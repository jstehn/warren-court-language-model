HOLLY HILL FRUIT PRODUCTS(1944)\nNo. 217\nArgued: January 10, 1944Decided: June 5, 1944\n\n\n\n Rehearing Denied Oct. 9, 1944\n\n\n See 64 S.Ct. 27. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 607, 608]\n\u00a0\n Messrs.

Maggs, of Washington, D.C., for the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division, U.S. Dept. of Labor, amicus curiae, by special leave of Court.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit brought by employees of Holly Hill Fruit Products, Inc. for wage payments under the Fair Labor Standards Act, 52 Stat. 1060, 29 U. S.C.  201 et seq., 29 U.S.C.A.  201 et seq. A judgment for the employees, the petitioners here, was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, which held that Holly Hill's employees were by virtue of  13(a)(10) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  210(a)(10), exempted from its scope, in that they were 'within the area of production (as defined by the Administrator), engaged in ... canning of agricultural ... commodities for market ....' The court below reached this con- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 607, 609]\n\u00a0\n clusion by holding that a portion of the definition of 'area of production' made by the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division was invalid and that the remaining portion afforded exemption. 136 F.2d 323. We brought the case here, \n320 \nU.S. 725\n, 64 S.Ct. 59, to settle a much litigated question of importance in the administration of the Fair Labor Standards Act.\n Holly Hill, a citrus fruit cannery employing some two hundred workers, is located in Davenport, Florida, a town with a population of about 650 people. During the two seasons in controversy-November 14, 1938, to May 26, 1939, and November 16, 1939 to March 30, 1940-the Administrator promulgated three regulations based on the scope he gave to his authority under  13(a)(10) to define 'area of production'. The validity of aspects of these regulations is the crucial issue.\n By regulation of October 20, 1938, the Administrator defined 'area of production' as used in  13(a)(10) to include an individual engaged in canning 'if the agricultural or horticultural commodities are obtained by the establishment where he is employed from farms in the immediate locality and the number of employees in such establishment does not exceed seven'. 29 Code Fed. Reg. (Supp.1938)  536.2(b). Effective April 20, 1939, an alternative definition, applicable to perishable or seasonal fresh fruits and vegetables, brought workers into the 'area of production' if employed 'in an establishment which is located in the open country or in a rural community and which obtains all of its products from farms in its immediate locality.' It was provided that \"open country' or 'rural community' shall not include any city or town of 2,500 or greater population according to the 15th United States Census, 1930, and 'immediate locality' shall not include any distance of more than ten miles.' 29 Code Fed. Reg. (Supp.1939)  536.2(e), pp. 2239-40. Finally, this alternative definition, no longer limited to \n\n[322 \nU.S. 607, 610]\n\u00a0\n fruits and vegetables, was in substance incorporated into the regulations effective June 17, 1939, but in addition it was provided that an individual might also be within the 'area of production' 'if he performs those (canning) operations on materials all of which come from farms in the general vicinity of the establishment where he is employed and the number of employees engaged in those operations in that establishment does not exceed seven'. 29 Code Fed. Reg. (Supp.1939)  536.2(a) (d), p. 2240.\n Before coming to the main question, that of the validity of adding a limitation on the allowable number of employees in one canning establishment within the exempted geographic bounds, we shall dispose of the applicability of the Administrator's other exempting definitions to Holly Hill's employees.\n The definitions which contain no employee limitation impose two essential conditions on an exemption sought under  13(a)(10): the establishment must be located in a city or town having a population smaller than 2500,1 and all of its products must be obtained from within ten miles of the establishment. Since Davenport contains less than 2500 persons, the first condition is met and we need not pass on its validity. \n2\n As to the second condition, the only evidence introduced indicates that during the 1938-1939 season, about 2% of the fruit used came from beyond ten air miles of the plant, and that for the 1939-1940 season, about 3.75% came from groves more than ten air miles from Holly Hill. Since all of the fruit did not come from within ten miles, Holly Hill did not \n\n[322 \nU.S. 607, 611]\n\u00a0\n satisfy this condition of the administrator's definitions. There can be no doubt that this conclusion is justified by a literal reading of the regulations, and the court below, in holding that the Administrator's requirement that all the goods come from within ten miles must be construed to mean 'substantially all', entered the Administrator's domain. What was said in another connection is relevant here. 'Looked at by itself without regard to the necessity behind it the line or point seems arbitrary. It might as well or nearly as well be a little more to one side or the other. But when it is seen that a line or point there must be, and that there is no mathematical or logical way of fixing it precisely, the decision of the (Administrator) must be accepted unless we can say that it is very wide of any reasonable mark.' Mr. Justice Holmes, dissenting, in Louisville Gas & Electric Co. v. Coleman, \n277 \nU.S. 32, 41\n, 48 S.Ct. 423, 426.3\n We come then to the validity of the October 20, 1938, regulation and that of the alternative in the June 17, 1939, regulation which provide in substance that an individual is employed within the 'area of production' if an establishment obtains the commodities from the 'immediate locality' ( 1938) or all the materials come from the 'general vicinity' (1939), and in addition the number of employees in the establishment 'does not exceed seven'. In short, when Congress exempted 'any individual employed within the area of production (as defined by the Administrator)' ( 13(a)(10)), did it authorize the Administrator not only to designate territorial bounds for purposes of exemption but also to except establishments from such exemption according to the number of workers employed. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 607, 612]\n\u00a0\n Congress provided for eleven exemptions from the controlling provisions relating to minimum wages or maximum hours of the Fair Labor Standards Act. 4 Employment in agriculture is probably the most far- reaching exemption. Closely related to it is the exemption which is our immediate concern-those workers engaged in processes necessary for the marketing of agricultural products and employed 'within the area of production' of \n\n[322 \nU.S. 607, 613]\n\u00a0\n such commodities. Such was the phrase and such its conjunction with the exemption for agriculture of which it formed an integral part as the bill passed both Houses, except that the enumerated exempted employments subsidiary to agriculture varied in the two bills. \n5\n The parenthetical qualification '(as defined by the Administrator)' emerged from the conference committee of the two Houses. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n The textual meaning of 'area of production' is thus reinforced by its context: 'area' calls for delimitation of \n\n[322 \nU.S. 607, 614]\n\u00a0\n territory in relation to the complicated economic factors that operate between agricultural labor conditions and the labor market of enterprises concerned with agricultural commodities and more or less near their production. The phrase is the most apt designation of a zone within which economic influences may be deemed to operate and outside of which they lose their force. In view, however, of the variety of agricultural conditions and industries throughout the country the bounds of these areas could not be defined by Congress itself. Neither was it deemed wise to leave such economic determination to the contingencies and inevitable diversities of litigation. And so Congress left the boundary-making to the experienced and informed judgment of the Administrator. Thereby Congress gave the Administrator appropriate discretion to assess all the factors relevant to the subject matter, that is the fixing of minimum wages and maximum hours.\n In delimiting the area the Administrator may properly weigh and synthesize all such factors. So long as he does that and no more, judgment belongs to him and not to the courts. For Congress has cast upon him the authority and the duty to dfine the 'area of production' of agricultural commodities with reference to which exemption in subsidiary employments may operate. But if Congress intended to allow the Administrator to discriminate between smaller and bigger establishments within the zone of agricultural production, Congress wholly failed to express its purpose. Where Congress wanted to make exemption depend on size, as it did in two or three instances not here relevant, it did so by appropriate language. \n7\n Congress referred to quantity when it desired to legislate on the basis of quantity. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 607, 615]\n\u00a0\n Congressional purpose as manifested by text and context is not rendered doubtful by legislative history. Meagre as that is, it confirms what Congress has formally said. The only extrinsic light cast on Congressional purpose regarding 'area of production' is that cast by the sponsors of this provision for enlarging the range of agricultural exemption. Senator Schwellenbach frankly stated that the largest apple packing plant in the world would be exempt if the 'work done in that plant is as described in the amendment'. 81 Cong.Rec. 7877. And in the House, Representative Biermann, while explaining his amendment in somewhat Delphic terms, did indicate plainly enough that he had in mind not differences between establishments within the same territory but between rural communities and urban centers: 'may I say that all over this country it has been recognized that there should be a labor differential between the large city and the little town.' 83 Cong.Rec. 7401.8\n From such light as Congress gave us beyond its words, it would appear that in giving exemption to an 'area of production', without differentiating as between establishments within such area, Congress might well have considered that a large plant within an area should not be given an advantage over small plants in competing for labor within the same locality, while at the same time it \n\n[322 \nU.S. 607, 616]\n\u00a0\n gave the Administrator ample power, in defining the area, to take due account of the appropriate economic factors in drawing the geographic lines. In any event, Congress did not leave it to the Administrator to decide whether within geographic bounds defined by him the Act further permits discrimination between establishment and establishment based upon the number of employees. The determination of the extent of authority given to a delegated agency by Congress is not left for the decision of him in whom authority is vested.\n The wider a delegation is made by Congress to an administrative agency the more incomplete is a statute and the ampler the scope for filling in, as it is called, its details. But when Congress wants to give wide discretion it uses broad language. Thus, in the Interstate Commerce Act, Congress prohibited a lower rate for a longer than a shorter haul, but it gave an authority to the Interstate Commerce Commission, undefined except as the general purposes of that Act implied the basis for affording exemption, to grant relief from this prohibition. Intermountain Rate Cases ( United States v. Atchison, T. & S.F.R. Co.), \n234 \nU.S. 476\n, 34 S.Ct. 986. Again in the National Labor Relations Act, Congress gave the Board authority to take such action 'as will effectuate the policies of this Act.'  10(c), 49 Stat. 449, 454, 29 U.S.C.  160(c), 29 U.S.C.A.  160(c). The 'policies' of the Act were so broadly defined by Congress that the determination of 'the relation of remedy to policy is peculiarly a matter for administrative competence'. Phelps Dodge Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board, \n313 \nU.S. 177, 194\n, 61 S.Ct. 845, 852. In the Fair Labor Standards Act, Congress legislated very differently in relation to the problem before us. To be sure the Fair Labor Standards Act like the National Labor Relations Act was based on findings and a declaration of broad policy. But Congress did not prescribe or proscribe generally and then give broad discretion for administrative relief as in the Interstate Commerce Act or for remedies as in the \n\n[322 \nU.S. 607, 617]\n\u00a0\n National Labor Relations Act. Congress did otherwise. It dealt with exemptions in detail and with particularity, enumerating not less than eleven exempted classes based on different industries, on different occupations within the same industry, (the classification in some instances to be defined by the Administrator, in some made by Congress itself, in others subject to definition by other legislation), on size and on areas. In short the Administrator was not left at large. A new national policy was here formulated with exceptions, catalogued with particularity and not left within the broad dispensing power of the Administrator. Exemptions made in such detail preclude their enlargement by implication.\n We should of course be faithful to the meaning of a statute. But after all Congress expresses its meaning by words. If legislative policy is couched in vague language, easily susceptible of one meaning as well as another in the common speech of men, we should not stifle a policy by a pedantic or grudging process of construction. To let general words draw nourishment from their purpose is one thing. To draw on some unexpressed spirit outside the bounds of the normal meaning of words is quite another. For we are here not dealing with the broad terms of the Constitution 'as a continuing instrument of government' but with part of a legislative code 'subject to continuous revision with the changing course of events'. United States v. Classic, \n313 \nU.S. 299, 316\n, 61 S.Ct. 1031, 1038.\n Legislation introducing a new system is at best empirical, and not infrequently administration reveals gaps or inadequacies of one sort or another that may call for amendatory legislation. But it is no warrant for extending a statute that experience may disclose that it should have been made more comprehensive. 'The natural meaning of words cannot be displaced by reference to difficulties in administration.' Commonwealth v. Grunseit ( 1943) 67 C.L.R. 58, 80. For the ultimate question \n\n[322 \nU.S. 607, 618]\n\u00a0\n is what has Congress commanded, when it has given no clue to its intentions except familiar English words and no hint by the draftsmen of the words that they meant to use them in any but an ordinary sense. The idea which is now sought to be read into the grant by Congress to the Administrator to define 'the area of production' beyond the plain geographic implications of that phrase is not so complicated nor is English speech so poor that words were not easily available to express the idea or at least to suggest it. After all, legislation when not expressed in technical terms is addressed to the common run of men and is therefore to be understood according to the sense of the thing, as the ordinary man has a right to rely on ordinary words addressed to him.\n The details with which the exemptions in this Act have been made preclude their enlargement by implication. While the judicial function in construing legislation is not a mechanical process from which judgment is excluded, it is nevertheless very different from the legislative function. Construction is not legislation and must avoid 'that retrospective expansion of meaning which properly deserves the stigma of judicial legislation.' Kirschbaum Co. v. Walling, \n316 \nU.S. 517, 522\n, 62 S.Ct. 1116, 1119. To blur the distinctive functions of the legislative and judicial processes is not conducive to responsible legislation.\n We agree therefore with the Circuit Court of Appeals in holding invalid the limitations as to the number of employees within a defined area. But we cannot follow that Court in deleting this part of the administrative regulation and, by applying what remains of the definition, exempting Holly Hill's employees from the requirements of the Act. Since the provision as to the number of employees was not authorized, the entire definition of which that limitation was a part must fall. We can hardly assume that the Administrator would have defined 'area of production' merely by deleting the employee pro- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 607, 619]\n\u00a0\n vision, had he known of its invalidity. It would be the sheerest guesswork to believe that elimination of an important factor in the Administrator's equation would have left his equation unaffected even if he did not here insist upon its importance. It is not for us to write a definition. That is the Administrator's duty.\n Concluding, then, that when Congress granted exemptions for workers within the 'area of production (as defined by the Administrator)' it restricted the Administrator to the drawing of geographic lines, even though he may take into account all relevant economic factors in the choice of areas open to him, the regulations which made discriminations within the area defined by applying the exemption only to plants with less than seven employees are ultra vires. But that leaves the difficult problem of the proper disposition of the case. It is our view that the case should be remanded to the district court with instructions to hold it until the Administrator, by making a valid determination of the area with all deliberate speed, acts within the authority given him by Congress.\n Such a disposition is most consonant with justice to all interests in retracing the erroneous course that has been taken. Neither law nor logic dictates an 'either-or' conclusion-that is, a conclusion that the employment in these industries is entirely exempt because the Administrator misconceived the bounds of his regulatory powers although plainly enough he meant to exercise them so as not to withdraw all these employments from the requirements of the Act, or that employment in these industries is subject to the Act because no exception excludes it. The two opposing alternatives do violence to the law as Congress wrote it. To hold that all individuals 'engaged in handling, packing, storing, ginning, compressing, pasteurizing, drying, preparing in their raw or natural state, or canning of agricultural or horticultural commodities for market, or in making cheese or butter or other dairy \n\n[322 \nU.S. 607, 620]\n\u00a0\n products' are exempt from the operation of the Act is obviously to fly in the face of Congressional purpose. The Act exempts some but not all of the employees engaged in these industries, and it is not for us now to say that all are exempt. So to hold would postpone the operation of the Act in the enumerated instances for at least six years beyond the date fixed by Congress. Equally offending to the purposes of Congress and therefore to fairness in this situation is the suggestion that if the exemption falls all employees engaged in the designated industries are covered by the Act.\n The accommodation that we are making assumes, what we must assume, that the Administrator will retrospectively act as conscientiously within the bounds of the power given him by Congress as he would have done initially had he limited himself to his authority. To be sure this will be a retrospective judgment, and law should avoid retroactivity as much as possible. But other possible dispositions likewise involve retroactivity, with the added mischief of producing a result contrary to the statutory design.\n Such an adaptation of court procedure to a remolding of the situation as nearly as may be to what it should have been initially is not unprecedented. Such was essentially the procedure which was devised to unravel the skein in United States v. Morgan, \n307 \nU.S. 183\n, 59 S.Ct. 795. The Court did not feel itself balked by the kind of considerations that seemed controlling to a Baron Parke. The creative analogies of the law were drawn upon by which great equity judges, exercising imaginative resourcefulness, have always escaped the imprisonment of reason and fairness within mechanical concepts of the common law. See, e.g., Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. State of Florida, \n295 \nU.S. 301\n, 55 S.Ct. 713; Inland Steel Co. v. United States, \n306 \nU.S. 153\n, 59 S.Ct. 415; and for some examples of this approach see Graf v. Hope Building Corp., 254 N.Y. 1, 7, 171 N.E. 884, 70 A.L.R. 984 (Cardozo, Ch. J., dissenting). That \n\n[322 \nU.S. 607, 621]\n\u00a0\n such were the large considerations that guided decision in the Morgan case the opinion makes clear:\n'... in construing a statute setting up an administrative agency and providing for judicial review of its action, court and agency are not to be regarded as wholly independent and unrelated instrumentalities of justice, each acting in the performance of its prescribed statutory duty without regard to the appropriate function of the other in securing the plainly indicated objects of the statute. Court and agency are the means adopted to attain the prescribed end, and so far as their duties are defined by the words of the statute, those words should be construed so as to attain the end through co-ordinated action. Neither body should repeat in this day the mistake made by the courts of law when equity was struggling for recognition as an ameliorating system of justice; neither can rightly be regarded by the other as an alien intruder, to be tolerated if must be, but never to be encouraged or aided by the other in the attainment of the common aim.' 307 U.S. at page 191, 59 S.Ct. at page 799.\n\n If it be said that in the Morgan case the Court was dealing with a fund in court-irrelevant though that be to the governing principles of that decision-no such constriction can be made of the import of our decision in General American Tank Car Corp. v. El Dorado Terminal Co., \n308 \nU.S. 422\n, 60 S.Ct. 325, 331. That like this was an action at law and not a suit in equity involving a res. The respondent was seeking to recover a sum admittedly due under a car-leasing agreement with petitioner. The Interstate Commerce Commission urged that since the Commission had not, as the law required, passed upon the validity of the practice involved in the agreement, the district court was without jurisdiction. And so, technically speaking, the district court was. But this Court remanded the case to the district court with instructions to hold the cause 'pending the conclusion of an appropriate administra- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 607, 622]\n\u00a0\n tive proceeding.' The petition for rehearing claimed that our decision involved retroactivity. \n309 \nU.S. 694\n, 60 S.Ct. 465. So it did. But as against retroactivity we balanced the considerations that made retroactivity seem the lesser evil.\n In short, the judicial process is not without the resources of flexibility in shaping its remedies, though courts from time to time fail to avail themselves of them. The interplay between law and equity in the evolution of more just results than the hardened common law afforded, has properly been drawn upon in working out accommodating relationships between the judiciary and administrative agencies. And certainly in specific cases, such as those already referred to and in this, it is consonant with judicial administration and fairness not to be balked by the undesirability of retroactive action any more than courts have found it difficult to sanction legislative ratification of acts originally unlawful, United States v. Heinszen & Co., \n206 \nU.S. 370\n, 27 S.Ct. 742, 11 Ann.Cas. 688; Chuoco Tiaco v. Forbes, \n228 \nU.S. 549\n, 33 S.Ct. 585; Graham and Foster v. Goodcell, \n282 \nU.S. 409\n, 51 S.Ct. 186; Kiyoshi Hirabayashi v. United States, \n320 \nU.S. 81, 91\n, 63 S.Ct. 1375, 1381, or retroactively to give prior legislation new scope. Paramino Lumber Co. v. Marshall, \n309 \nU.S. 370\n, 60 S. Ct. 600. And in habeas corpus proceedings, even though a petitioner was unlawfully in custody, this Court has allowed continued retention of custody until a valid order could be made. Mahler v. Eby, \n264 \nU.S. 32\n, 44 S.Ct. 283; Tod v. Waldman, \n266 \nU.S. 113\n, 45 S.Ct. 85.\n Finally, there is no difficulty upon such a remand in requiring the Administrator to promulgate his definition. This Court has on several occasions required the Interstate Commerce Commission to take jurisdiction when it declined to do so or to discharge a duty laid upon the Commission by statute. Interstate Commerce Commission v. United States of America ex rel. Humboldt Steamship Co., \n224 \nU.S. 474\n, 32 S.Ct. 556; Louisville Cement Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n246 \nU.S. 638\n, 38 S.Ct. 408. See also Kansas City So. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n252 \nU.S. 178\n, 40 S.Ct. 187. The district court \n\n[322 \nU.S. 607, 623]\n\u00a0\n would not be telling the Administrator how to exercise his discretion but would merely require him to exercise it. It is a remedy against inaction.\n Holly Hill also contended that if it is not entirely exempt from paying the overtime rates here awarded, it is entitled to the advantage of the partial seasonal exemptions afforded by  7(b)(3) and 7(c). The district court ruled adversely to Holly Hill on these claims, but the Circuit Court of Appeals did not reach them. It will be time enough to reach them if they survive the disposition now made of this case.\n Accordingly, the case is remanded to the district court to proceed in conformity with this opinion.\n So ordered.\n Remanded.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS.\n I agree with the opinion of this court and with the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals that the Administrator was without power (if 'area of production' is to have any sensible meaning) to exclude from the area and from the operation of the exemption workers in a processing plant clearly within the area on the ground that a certain number of employes worked in the plant. If Congress, when it said that the area of production should be defined by the Administrator, meant that that official should have a roving commission to create exemptions from the Act, the entire provision must fall as an unconstitutional attempt to delegate legislative power. We should never, however, construe an Act in a sense which would render it unconstitutional if a different and permissible construction will save it.\n The legislative history makes it clear enough that Congress wished to exempt plants processing agricultural commodities in the locality of the farms which produced the commodities. Realizing that the ascertainment of the facts in particular cases would be essential to definition or \n\n[322 \nU.S. 607, 624]\n\u00a0\n delimitation of the area served, Congress, by the phrase 'as defined by the Administrator', meant to permit him to draw lines in delimitation of areas appropriately to correspond to the facts. I construe the word 'define', in this context, to mean 'ascertain the facts and announce the result of such ascertainment.' The opinions of the court below elaborate this view.\n I think the Administrator's order may well be allowed to stand with the illegal and unauthorized feature of it deleted. This is what the Circuit Court of Appeals decided and I believe it was right. Other features of the order were not, and are not, attacked and if, for the future, the Administrator desires, in other aspects, to amend his order, there is nothing to prevent. This would lead to affirmance of the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals and, if I could make my vote effective to that end, I should vote for affirmance. The other members of the court, however, are for reversal, but are divided on the question whether the judgment of the District Court should be affirmed or the case held in that court pending amendment of the order by the Administrator. Entertaining the views which I do, I cannot vote to affirm the judgment of the District Court, but that will be the effect of my action if I vote simply to reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals. While I think none of the authorities cited in the opinion of Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER justify the procedure there outlined, I am constrained to vote in accordance with his opinion.\n I am clear that, if the Administrator is to be permitted to amend his order, or to enter a new order effective from the date of the one under attack, he may not resort to gerrymandering or to any other device to accomplish by indirection what the decision holds he cannot do directly. I personally believe the scope of his discretion is more limited than some of my colleagues think and I do not wish my concurrence in the remand of the case to the \n\n[322 \nU.S. 607, 625]\n\u00a0\n District Court, to be there held pending the promulgation of an amended order, or a new order, to be taken as approving in advance the views expressed as to the extent of the Administrator's discretion.\n\n Mr. Justice RUTLEDGE, with whom Mr. Justice BLACK and Mr. Justice MURPHY concur, dissenting.\n In my opinion the Administrator has defined 'area of production' in a valid manner, and therefore the employee petitioners should prevail. But if, as the majority hold, his definition is not valid, then the exemption is not operative, and for that reason the petitioners likewise should prevail. I dissent, therefore, from the Court's conclusion that the definition is void. I dissent equally from the wholly novel disposition it makes of the cause on that hypothesis, in remanding it to await the Administrator's retroactive redetermination of the parties' rights.\n\n\n I.\n\n\n The basic issue, as the case was presented, is whether the Administrator can include in the definition not only spacial limits but also a limit upon the number of employees in exempted establishments. The Administrator included this factor in his first definition;1 later reexamined it in extensive hearings;2 concluded on the record thus made that no purely geographical definition could be conformed to the major legislative policies announced in the statute;3 has retained it in each of several later \n\n[322 \nU.S. 607, 626]\n\u00a0\n definitions, varying in other details, framed after extensive hearings;4 and now earnestly insists it, or an equivalent limitation on size of the plant, must be included, unless any definition he may make is to work havoc with some major policy of the Act, either by exempting large numbers of industrial employees5 or by creating disturbances of competitive situations, both for farmers and for canners and packers,6 which the statute expressly sought to avoid.\n The Administrator's task is highly complex. It involves defining exemptions for employees throughout the nation engaged in 'handling, packing, storing, ginning, compressing, pasteurizing, drying, preparing in their raw or natural state, or canning of agricultural or horticultural commodities for market, or in making cheese or butter or other dairy products.' Section 13(a)(10), 29 U.S.C.A.  213(a)(10). All these operations follow immediately upon harvest and removal from the field or milking. All can be done on the farm and frequently are done there, but may be done elsewhere, often in factories. All consist in the first stages of preparation for market. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 607, 627]\n\u00a0\n But whether the specified operations will be done on the farm, as part of the farm work or away from it, and in either small neighborhood establishments or in larger industrial plants, will depend upon a variety of factors as great as that which comprehends the whole vast process of starting the nation's crops, over 300,7 on their respective marketing courses. The initial steps in marketing such widely different products as cotton and apples; tobacco and milk; potatoes and citrus fruits; legume crops, wheat, corn and other grains, on the one hand, and tomatoes, strawberries, truck garden products, etc., on the other, are within the delegation.\n The mere enumeration of these instances indicates some of the variables involved. Others add to the difficulty. Highly perishable crops, as fruits and vegetables, require immediate action in these stages of handling. Cotton, grains, root crops, etc., less perishable, may wait longer on the farm, some for months, before these processes become necessary. Some crops are highly concentrated for production in a few regions, such as citrus fruits in Florida, Southern Texas, and Southern California, but are marketed on a nation-wide scale. Others have regional areas of production, like cotton in the South, celery in Michigan, tobacco in the border states and a few northern regions, yet depend on the national market. Still others have regions of greater or less concentration, but are grown all over the nation, like wheat and other grains, apples, potatoes, etc.\n Obviously, 'area of production,' in the sense of where the commodity is produced for purposes of commercial marketing, will vary from the whole nation, in the case of the more common grains, fruit crops and root crops, down to a few highly concentrated regions or areas in \n\n[322 \nU.S. 607, 628]\n\u00a0\n the case of others more dependent upon special climatic and soil combinations. And between the extremes of nation-wide and highly localized production are all ranges of sectional and regional production areas. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n Respondent regards the 'area of production' as the whole region where a commodity is grown, and therefore says the Administrator has no more to do than locate the existing limits of these areas. By this criterion the South, perhaps including California, would be the unalterable 'area of production' for cotton, the whole nation for eggs, wheat, corn, etc. This conception would nullify the delegation, making of the Administrator merely a surveyor in the wrong place. Congress clearly was not making him only a finder of fact, namely, of the geographical limits surrounding regions where 300 different commodi- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 607, 629]\n\u00a0\n ties are produced. Such a view would exempt all employees engaged in the operations specified in Section 13(a)(10).\n The same objections forbid regarding the 'area of production' as the region from which the particular plant purchases its raw material. The only substantial difference would be to make the Administrator's fact finding task a more impossible one. A definition would be required for every plant engaging in any of the specified operations for each of the more than 300 agricultural and horticultural commodities produced annually in the United States. Congress hardly could have intended to load upon the Administrator a task of these infinite proportions. Nor did it intend the same time intend to overwhelm him or to make that exemption automatic. Congress intended the Administrator to define the area of production. It did not at the same time intend to overthelm him with making myriads of particular and highly variable definitions for each operating unit, or to make him merely a runner of courses and distances, whether large or small. It rather intended him to make practical, workable and therefore generic and stable definitions.\n It follows necessarily that the Administrator's power is discretionary and the important questions are to what extent and in what manner may his discretion work. Neither subdivision (a)(10) nor Section 13 as a whole supplies these answers. The section itself does not supply all the standards necessary for definition of the term. At most it affords direction to exempt some but not other employees engaged in the specified activities and that those exempted must be within the 'area of production.' This necessarily includes some region where the commodity is produced. But since that region is an unknown quantity and so also is the question what employees within it are to be exempted, solutions must be found either in other \n\n[322 \nU.S. 607, 630]\n\u00a0\n provisions of the statute or in the legislative history, unless the delegation is to fall for want of standards.\n The statute itself furnishes clear guides for directing the Administrator. He is confined, as has been noted, by subsection (a)(10) to employees engaged in the specified initial operations of marketing. They must work within some producing region. Apart from the exemption they are within the Act's coverage, but close to the major line it draws between farm workers, who are excluded from, and industrial labor, which is within its coverage. Depending, not upon what they do, but upon where and how they do this work, they would fall on one side or the other of this line and within or without the incidence of the evils the Act sought to eradicate. These were 'the existence, in industries ... of labor conditions detrimental to the maintenance of the minimum standard of living necessary for health, efficiency, and general well-being of workers . ...'9 Congress exercised its authority over commerce, 'to correct and as rapidly as practicable to eliminate the conditions above referred to in such industries without substantially curtailing employment or earning power.' Section 2(a), (b), 29 U.S.C.A.  202(a, b). (Emphasis added.)\n The broad line between farming and industry runs throughout the Act. 10 It is the statute's basic line of \n\n[322 \nU.S. 607, 631]\n\u00a0\n policy between coverage and noncoverage. The line not only is pertinent to each of the statute's provisions but, where the contrary is not clearly and unambiguously stated, it is controlling. There can be no assumption that Congress intended employees in one group to be transferred to or treated as being in the other where no such clear mandate can be found.\n In determining what Congress intended by the delegation, it is crucial to keep in mind that, whatever decision the Administrator may make and by whatever criteria, the effect of his action must be to put some employees on one side of this line and others on the opposite side. That consequence he cannot escape. And, because he cannot avoid it, the line is pertinent and material to his choice, as it is to all others he must make in performing his duties. It is the statute's lodestar. The distinction between farming and industry is the essence of his determination. An 'area of production' determined without reference to this distinction would contradict, not enforce, the statute's basic policy. And this appears, not solely from the policy itself and the effects of failure to take it into account, but from a consideration of other determinations the Act confides to the Administrator and of the manner in which it requires him to make them.\n Thus, in issuing minimum wage orders and industry classifications, he and the industry committees must have 'due regard to economic and competitive conditions,' and act so as not to 'substantially curtail employment' or 'give a competitive advantage to any group.' And there is a specific prohibition against fixing wages or classifications 'solely on a regional basis.' Rather the governing criteria are to be competitive conditions, wages for com- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 607, 632]\n\u00a0\n parable work fixed by collective bargaining or by voluntary minimum wage plans. Section 8(b), (c), (d). The statute's primary design was to bring industrial workers under its protections and to eliminate as rapidly as possible the substandard conditions of such labor. But this was to be done with an eye also to two other matters: one, that by too rapid advance employment be not curtailed; and, two, that competitive conditions in the affected industries be not unduly disturbed or competitive advantages created. Cf. Section 2.\n These purposes were inescapably pertinent to the problems of exemption arising under Section 13(a)(10). They were likewise pertinent to other exemptions, cf. Section 7(c) and compare Section 7(b), and to still other delegations the statute confided to the Administrator. That Congress did not burden the books with 'an itemized catalogue'11 of standards in each instance of delegation, gives no basis for believing that what permeated all else found these parts insulated. The Administrator clearly had power, and more, the duty, to take account of these factors.\n If so, he could not escape the question of size. And indeed the Court does not deny this. Size certainly is not irrelevant to distinguish within any group which may do essentially the same work in two different ways, one the farming way, the other the industrial one. If is not irrelevant to economic dislocations or to curtailments of employment. And it is relevant to these things as much within as without an area of production. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n[322 \nU.S. 607, 633]\n\u00a0\n The legislative history discloses one object of the exemption as originally proposed was to protect small farmers, who are unable to perform these operations at the farm and therefore are dependent upon whatever nearby establishments may exist, whether large or small. Various members of the Senate and of the House sponsored amendments for this purpose. \n13\n As the bills went to conference each contained flat exemptions, substantially covering the activities now specified in Section 13(a)(10). But the debates in both houses show that even the sponsors of the various amendments differed or were doubtful concerning whether the amendments would give exemption to large plants. \n14\n There was general agreement that \n\n[322 \nU.S. 607, 634]\n\u00a0\n small ones should be relieved from coverage. \n15\n Senator Reynolds went further and proposed several amendments to relieve all small plants from the Act's provisions, not merely those engaged in the limited operations specified in the bills or Section 13(a) (10). These were defeated. \n16\n And there was vigorous demand, from the sponsor of the bill in the Senate and others,17 for restricting the scope of the amending exemptions to small plants. These differences were not settled on the floor of either house. But when the bills came to conference, they were resolved by changing the flat exemptions into discretionary ones to be defined by the Administrator.\n Since the delegation feature did not appear until the conference report and there is little in that report or in \n\n[322 \nU.S. 607, 635]\n\u00a0\n the debates upon it to add light, the previous discussions are wholly inconclusive, except in one respect. This was to show that there was great variety and complexity of opinion, and that this revolved around the question of size. That question continued unresolved up to conference and was resolved there, not by decision either way, but by reference to the Administrator. It must be taken therefore that the purpose was to give him discretion to make the necessary choices between the conflicting viewpoints as the facts of particular situations would give occasion for doing. And, it would seem, the preponderance of sentiment in favor of exempting small plants, but not large ones, except in occasional instances where this would be necessary to protect the small farmer, well could be taken as his guiding light. The legislative history, therefore, in so far as it sheds light at all, clearly is not inconsistent with what the Administrator has done, but on the contrary supports it.\n The Court does not find the Administrator acted improperly by taking these considerations into account. He only must not state them in his definition. And this matter of mere formulation is the crux of the case. The definition must be made 'in relation to the complicated economic factors that operate between agricultural labor conditions and the labor market of enterprises concerned with agricultural commodities and more or less near their production.' (Emphasis added.) The Administrator is given 'appropriate discretion to assess all the factors relevant to the subject matter,' which is essentially one of 'economic determination,' too complex for litigation to solve. He 'may properly weigh and synthesize all such factors.'\n In making his economic synthesis, however, the Administrator must state his results only in surveyor's terms. Congress, when it granted the exemption, 'restricted the Administrator to the drawing of geographic \n\n[322 \nU.S. 607, 636]\n\u00a0\n lines, even though he may take into account all relevant economic factors . ...' The 'zone within which economic influences may be deemed to operate and outside of which they lose their force' cannot be defined directly and purposively to draw the line between the zone of farming and the zone of industry. This must be done only indirectly, in an awkward, roundabout way.\n Nothing prevents the Administrator from drawing the lines as he thinks best, unless the suggestion of the specially concurring opinion is followed that they must be drawn in regular circles or squares. The courts have no business to tell him where to put them. He can define distance by air lines or by road lines to market. He can run the lines around big towns, but not around big factories. Baltimore could be excluded, but not Martin's bomber plant or one like it, in size and methods, for processing or canning fruits and vegetables. Towns may go out, though surrounded by truck farms, but not commercial canneries. Residences, apparently, must surround the cannery. In short, the Administrator can draw whatever map lines he thinks will achieve the appropriate economic adjustments, except one which leaves out perhaps the biggest cannot factory of all, and no court can interfere. I do not believe that Congress, when it gave the Administrator his complicated task and authorized him to consider all the relevant and complex economic factors, not only denied him the power to execute those considerations in his action, but compelled him to frustrate them in defining 'area of production.' The Court does not deny the Administrator may consider the size of the plant, and make this even the crucial factor in his decision. Yet it would only impede or defeat his judgment, formed on proper considerations, as well as the statute's purposes, to require him to state the exemption, not simply in the terms best chosen to express his meaning clearly and definitely, but in others couched in pure though tortured geography. According to his experience \n\n[322 \nU.S. 607, 637]\n\u00a0\n and confirmed judgment, shared by successive administrators and never reversed or modified, to require the latter method of formulation would make his task well nigh impossible or, if not that, incapable of being discharged without doing violence to the Act's major purposes and standards. \n18\n\u00a0\n\n So much of authority and power to defeat the statute's intended operation cannot be given to mere verbalism, more especially to one word, torn in context, function and purpose from the remainder of the Act. 'Area,' it is true, means area. But 'area of production' means more. 'The notion that because the words of a statute are plain, its meaning is also plain, is merely pernicious oversimplification. It is a wooden English doctrine of rather recent vintage ... to which lip service has on occasion been given here, but which since the days of Marshall this Court has rejected, especially in practice. ... A statute, like other living organisms, derives significance and sustenance from its environment, from which it cannot be severed without being mutilated.' \n19\n And so does a section in a statute. 'Area of production' as used in Section 13(a)(10) means an exemption, limited to persons performing the specified operations within a producing region, but selected from all so situated by an exercise of the Administrator's judgment in accordance with the statute's prime objects and chief limitations, among which necessarily is the size of the plant. If that is so, I see no good reason for forbidding the Administrator to say so.\n It follows the Administrator has not improperly exercised his function, the definitions are valid, and respondent's employees were not exempt from the statute's provisions. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 607, 638]\n\u00a0\n II.\n But if the definitions were invalid, as the Court holds, I could not agree to the extremely novel disposition it makes of the case. We are dealing with an exemption, not with the statute's primary coverage. Concededly the respondent employer was liable to petitioners for the minimum wages, overtime pay and statutory penalties under Section 16(b), 29 U.S.C.A.  216(b), if they were not exempt under Section 13(a)(10) or some other exemption. Ordinarily exemptions are not favored. Coverage, not exemption, is preferred. If the exemption is dubious, it is not given effect. If ambiguous, it is resolved strictly in favor of the statute's application. Spokane & I.E.R. Co. v. United States, \n241 \nU.S. 344\n, 36 S.Ct. 668; Piedmont & N.R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n286 \nU.S. 299, 311\n, 312 S., 52 S.Ct. 541, 545; McDonald v. Thompson, \n305 \nU.S. 263\n, 59 S.Ct. 176. In this case, if the exemption does not apply, the petitioners are within the statute and respondent is liable on their claims.\n To escape liability, respondent has the burden of showing the exemption does apply. But to do this it cannot merely show the definition of the Administrator is invalid. That would only leave itself and the petitioning employees subject to the Act's provisions, which require the payment of the claims. Respondent's dilemma therefore is both sharp and real. If the definition is valid, it does not cover these employees and respondent is liable to them. If the definition is invalid, clearly it exempts no one, petitioners are covered by the Act, and the respondent must pay. This is true whether the reason dictating invalidity is want of standards, application of the wrong ones, or merely formulating the result in the wrong way. This dilemma presents the alternative which respondent, the Court of Appeals and this Court have attempted to avoid in order, so it is said, to escape an 'either-or' conclusion, which is the kind the law almost always must make. It is one from which there is no \n\n[322 \nU.S. 607, 639]\n\u00a0\n escape without exercise of inventive genius beyond the right of either court to apply and which, as applied here, makes the cure worse than the disease.\n Respondent's invention, and likewise the Court of Appeal's, was to strike the limitation on the number of employees and apply the remainder of the definition. This but emasculates it. Hence all here, but one, are agreed such liberty cannot be taken with the Administrator's function. This Court's invention however does it equal or greater violence, first, as I think in emasculating it; second, and lacking even more in justification, in requiring it to be exercised with backward reaching effect.\n If the Court had sought its escape in finding that there were no standards to control the Administrator's discretion or that he had applied the wrong standards, one might understand its refusal to sustain the definition. But that too would mean that petitioners would recover. The Court does neither. There is no claim, except a semblance of suggestion in a separate opinion, that the statute supplies no standards and therefore gives the Administrator 'a roving commission to create exemptions.' Nor is there one that the wrong standards were used. The invention is called forth only to correct a mode of statement.\n If that were all, there would not be much room to complain. But, in addition to compelling the Administrator to make the definition in a manner which frustrates his function and the statute's objectives, or only partly fulfills them, the decision opens the door to a general expansion of the novel, and I think unauthorized, practice of retroactive administrative determination of private rights. That is true, unless these petitioners are to be specially treated, although less than a majority of the Court agree that the authorities cited to sustain it justify the procedure outlined. But if the procedure is justified in this case, it is in any other where an administrator \n\n[322 \nU.S. 607, 640]\n\u00a0\n mistakenly includes in a regulation a factor later held to make it invalid. No reason stated makes this case a special one. And there is none. It cannot be taken that these parties are to be singled out for unique treatment, merely in order to avoid the normal legal consequences of invalidating administrative action. Hence, every interest affected by such action now must take two risks in place of one: first, the normal, inescapable risk that the governing regulation may be held invalid; second, in that event, the novel one that some future regulation, a wholly unknown quantity, will relate back over an indefinite time to create entirely new or different and unexpected rights and liabilities.\n Of course there must be room for creative analogies in the law to give the desired escape from mechanical concepts and permit shaping its remedies. But we are as often told that Congress should perform the creative act in Congress' field. This should be most true where what we are called upon to recreate is Congress' own handiwork. If Congress intended the Administrator to act retroactively, Congress wholly failed to express this purpose.\n Moreover, it is not remedies but rights which are thus refashioned. And not equity but law remolds them. Who knows, before the redefinition, what persons may be included in its coverage? Or whether it may not have to be made again? The same persons cannot be included. Otherwise there would be no point to this decision. If the Administrator can rephrase the same coverage in wholly geographic terms, apart from delay the only result will be to have criticized his language. If he cannot do this some persons, and no one can tell in advance how many, will be deprived altogether of rights, others given them who had none. So with liabilities.\n The innovation would be serious if confined to this case or this Act. It is beyond prediction what the conse- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 607, 641]\n\u00a0\n quences may be, of uncertainty, or hardship, of injustice in deprivation of rights, in windfalls of right to others, in laying on new and wholly unexpected liabilities and in relieving from anticipated ones, if retroactive administrative refashioning becomes the general practice. The alternative, either to sustain or to hold void the regulation, and fix the rights accordingly, is not only the accepted and established one. It is the only one by which men can know the risks they assume at the time they become subject to them.\n Retroactivity is not favored in law. For this there are sound reasons, in some cases constitutional ones. Cf. Forbes Pioneer Boat Line v. Board of Commissioners, \n258 \nU.S. 338\n, 42 S.Ct. 325; Ochoa v. Hernandez y Morales, \n230 \nU.S. 139\n, 33 S.Ct. 1033. There are few occasions when retroactivity does not work more unfairly than fairly. Congress, the state legislatures and the courts apply the principle sparingly, even where they may. Cf. Graham and Foster v. Goodcell, \n282 \nU.S. 409\n, 51 S.Ct. 186; United States v. Heinszen, \n206 \nU.S. 370\n, 27 S.Ct. 742, 11 Ann.Cas. 688. Seldom if ever therefore may administrative or executive authority to apply it be inferred from legislation not expressly giving it. Compare Arizona Grocery Co. v. Atchison, T. & S.F.R. Co., \n284 \nU.S. 370\n, 52 S.Ct. 183; Helvering v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., \n306 \nU.S. 110\n, 59 S.Ct. 423. But, in any event, whatever corrective needs may prompt and vindicate a grant of such authority in other circumstances are not present in this application. Yet, if this decision is to mark the beginning of a general pattern, such authority now bids fair to become a common characteristic of administrative action.\n The administrative process has increasingly important functions in our legal system. Ordinarily it does enough, if it takes care of today and tomorrow. When it begins to add yesterday, without clear congressional mandate, the burden may become too great. In any event, that has not heretofore generally been considered its task. If that task it \n\n[322 \nU.S. 607, 642]\n\u00a0\n is to be added, the addition should be made by the body whence administrative power is derived, not by this Court's imaginative resourcefulness.\n Finally, respondent has not asked for this retroactive 'relief.' And this may be for entirely good reasons of its own. What respondent sought in the District Court, what it secured in the Court of Appeals, and what it has sought here, but clearly is not entitled to have, is a judicial declaration that, as a matter of law, its employees would have been exempt under any valid definition the Administrator might have adopted. In effect, this is a claim of exemption by the statute itself, one which would nullify the Administrator's power. Relief not sought should not be forced on respondent by an exercise of this Court's inventive genius. More especially should this not be done on the court's own motion, without any of the parties having had an opportunity to consider or discuss it in the briefs or in argument. Under such a policy, generally followed, a litigant never can know with what kind of gift horse he may come out, even if successful. And in this case the parties have faced the double uncertainty, wholly unanticipated, of creation here and recreation by the Administrator, when the latter undertakes relieving the District Court of the duty to await his further action. \n20\n\u00a0\n\n The judgment of the Court of Appeals should be reversed and the cause should be remanded to that court for determination of the other issues in the case. \n 21\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS join in that part of this dissent which would hold that the Administrator has defined 'area of production' in a valid manner. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The fact that Davenport is within four miles of Haines City, with a population greater than 2500, led the district court to conclude that Holly Hill was not located in the 'open country' or a 'rural community'. This appears to be a plain solecism. 29 Code Fed.Reg. (Supp.1939)  536.2( e), pp. 2239-40, and  536.2(d), p. 2240. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] It is conceded that a specific ruling on the population criterion is unnecessary. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Holly Hill here attacked the finding of the district court that all of the fruit did not come from within ten miles, but we see no reason to disturb it. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] 'Sec. 13(a) The provisions of sections 6 and 7 shall not apply with respect to (1) any employee employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, professional, or local retailing capacity, or in the capacity of outside salesman (as such terms are defined and delimited by regulations of the Administrator); or (2) any employee engaged in any retail or service establishment the greater part of whose selling or servicing is in intrastate commerce=; or (3) any employee employed as a seaman; or (4) any employee of a carrier by air subject to the provisions of title II of the Railway Labor Act; or (5) any employee employed in the catching, taking, harvesting, cultivating, or farming of any kind of fish, shellfish, crustacea, sponges, seaweeds, or other aquatic forms of animal and vegetable life, including the going to and returning from work and including employment in the loading, unloading, or packing of such products for shipment or in proparating, processing, marketing, freezing, canning, curing, storing, or distributing the above products or by- products thereof; or (6) any employee employed in agriculture; or (7) any employee to the extent that such employee is exempted by regulations or orders of the Administrator issued under section 14; or (8) any employee employed in connection with the publication of any weekly or semiweekly newspaper with a circulation of less than three thousand the major part of which circulation is within the county where printed and published; or (9) any employee of a street, suburban, or interurban electric railway, or local trolley or motor bus carrier, not included in other exemptions contained in this section; or (10) to any individual employed within the area of production (as defined by the Administrator), engaged in handling, packing, storing, ginning, compressing, pasteurizing, drying, preparing in their raw or natural state, or canning of agricultural or horticultural commodities for market, or in making cheese or butter or other dairy products; or (11) any switchboard operator employed in a public telephone exchange which has less than five hundred stations.' 52 Stat. 1067, as amended, 53 Stat. 1266, 29 U.S.C.A.  213(a). \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The exemptions provided in  13(a)(10) did not appear in the bill as reported to the Senate, but in the debate on the floor of that body an effort was made to extend the exemption accorded to agricultural workers, and as passed by the Senate the bill provided that 'The term 'person employed in agriculture', as used in this act, insofar as it shall refer to fresh fruits and vegetables, shall include persons employed within the area of production engaged in preparing, packing, or storing such fresh fruits or vegetables in their raw or natural state.' 81 Cong.Rec. 7876, 7949, 7957. This provision, varied somewhat by extending its coverage to all 'agricultural commodities' (82 Cong.Rec. 1783-1784), remained as part of the definition of 'Employee employed in agriculture' (H.Rep. No.2182, 75th Cong., 3d Sess., p. 2) until shortly before the bill was finally adopted by the House, at which time the so-called Biermann amendment included within the definition of employees engaged in agriculture 'individuals employed within the area of production, engaged in the handling, packing, storing, ginning, compressing, pasteurizing, drying, or canning of farm products and in making cheese and butter.' 83 Cong.Rec. 7401, 7407. At the conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses, the 'area of production' provision was given the form in which it was finally enacted, and there the parenthetical phrase 'as defined by the Administrator' was inserted after 'area of production'. 83 Cong.Rec. 9249. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] Compare this provision with  13(a)(1) exempting employees in 'a bona fide executive, administrative, professional, or local retailing capacity, or in the capacity of outside salesman (as such terms are defined and delimited by regulations of the Administrator)'. For this class, the Administrator is given the authority to define and delimit the 'terms' used. But in the same section, subdivision 10 grants authority to define not the term 'area', but to define the 'area'. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] See  13(a)(2)(8)(11) dealing respectively with retail or service establishments, weekly or semi-weekly newspapers and public telephone exchanges. \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Representative Biermann was asked whether his amendment 'would apply to a packing house located in Iowa and Illinois in the area of production, which employs two or three hundred men'. This was his complete answer: 'Speaking frankly, I think that is something that would have to be worked out. There are some packing houses in the State of Iowa that this amendment would apply to perhaps; but may I say that all over this country it has been recognized that there should be a labor differential between the large city and the little town.' Certainly Mr. Biermann did not give the remotest intimation that 'area of production' was meant to convey any idea other than that which area usually conveys. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Promulgated October 20, 1938, effective four days later. 3 Fed.Reg. 2536. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] See Hearings on Proposed Amendment of Section 536.2 (area of production) of Regulations issued under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, Wage and Hour Division, Department of Labor Ref. Nos. 54; 73; 162a; 162b; 162c. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Tests proposed and considered included: the mapping of producing territories; a flat mileage-population definition; a 'first concentration point' criterion; a standard which would include only establishments which handled and prepared for the account of the farmer commodities to which he retained title. All these and others were rejected by successive administrators, after being urged and opposed by industry representatives, as presenting insuperable obstacles to carrying out the statute's major policies. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Compare the definition promulgated October 20, 1938, 3 Fed.Reg. 2536, with the amendments of April 20, 1939, 4 Fed.Reg. 1655; June 17, 1939, 4 Fed.Reg. 2436; October 1, 1940, 5 Fed.Reg. 2647; and April 1, 1941, 6 Fed.Reg. 1476. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] Cf. Department of Labor Release R. 226, March 18, 1939; G.-60, July 24, 1940. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] A flat mileage definition was in force during part of the time material in this case, but was abandoned after its effects, by way of creating serious unfair discrimination between competing establishments and narrowing grocers' outlets, became evident. Cf. Department of Labor Release, G.-60, July 24, 1940. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Cf. Farm and Ranch Schedules, U.S. Census of Agriculture, 16th Census of the United States, 1940. \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] As the legislative history shows, cf. text infra at notes 13-16, there was fairly general agreement that some part of the work specified in Section 13(a) (10) should be exempt, whether or not it was done on the farm. But beyond this, a great variety of opinion existed both as to how far the exemption should go and as to the economic basis for it. Among the latter were views that the exemption should be made because the farmer bore the cost of the work, cf. 81 Cong.Rec. 7656, 7877, 7880; or because many farmers in fact performed it on their farms and as part of their operations, cf. Section 3(f), 52 Stat. 1060, 29 U.S.C.A.  206(f); 81 Cong. Rec. 7657-7659; or because others who had to resort to independent contractors to have it done would be discriminated against unless the work were exempt; cf. 81 Cong.Rec. 7656, 7658-7660, 7876. Some legislators were concerned to have the exemption apply whether the work were done in large or small plants; others to limit it to small ones only; and still others to secure it completely for particular crops. Numerous amendments were tendered, but for the most part defeated. It was not until the Conference Committee's report was framed that the problem was solved by referring it to definition by the Administrator. But even proponents of the amendments which were adopted recognized that the problem was one which 'the board ... would have to decide,' 81 Cong.Rec. 7878, 'something that would have to be worked out,' 83 Cong.Rec. 7401. \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Section 2(a). These conditions Congress found burden commerce, lead to labor disputes obstructing it, interfere with fair and orderly marketing, and spread themselves by causing the channels of commerce to be used for marketing among the several states the goods produced under them. Ibid. \n[\nFootnote 10\n] \"Industry' means a trade, business, industry ... in which individuals are gainfully employed.' Section 3(h). \"Agriculture' includes farming in all its branches ... and any practices (including any forestry or lumbering operations) performed by a farmer or on a farm as an incident to or in conjunction with such farming operations, including preparation for market, delivery to storage or to market or to carriers for transportation to market.' Section 3(f). Section 5, 29 U.S.C.A.  205, provides for industry committees and their functioning, to which the Administrator submits data and from which he receives recommendations and reports which he must approve before making them effective in the form of minimum wage rates and industry classifications. Cf. Section 8, 29 U.S.C.A .  208. \n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] National Broadcasting Co. v. United States, \n319 \nU.S. 190, 219\n, 63 S.Ct. 997, 1011. \n[\nFootnote 12\n] Respondent however, consistently with its 'fact-finder' or 'surveyor' theory of the Administrator's function, says the purpose was not to distinguish, within the specified activities, between farmers and industrial workers; it was rather to go a step further and exempt the latter as well, provided only they were within an area of production as respondent conceives it. That the Administrator may exempt some, or perhaps many, who are in fact industrial workers, because they are doing these activities under factory conditions and methods, may be conceded. That he must exempt all of them, or some larger number than his judgment, formed after considering the facts, the statute's policies, and the effects of what he may do, finds proper, cannot be accepted. Respondent claims an exemption fixed by the Act. The statute has given it one only when, in the Administrator's judgment, not arbitrarily formed, it meets the conditions which he finds will execute the legislative policy. \n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] The Senate's first suggestion of 'area of production' came from Senator Copeland, 81 Cong.Rec. 7656, although Senator Schwellenbach became the chief proponent of the concept there. Senator Black, sponsor of the bill, was concerned with the scope of 'area' and sought a more accurate term for limiting its effect so as not to exempt workers in large plants, cf. 81 Cong.Rec. 7656-7660, 7876-7878, and others expressed opinions that large operators should not be exempted. For portions of the discussion on the Senate floor see also 81 Cong.Rec. 7648-7673, 7876-7888, 7927-7929, 7947-7949.\n In the House of Representatives, the sponsor of the bill was Representative Norton. Chief proponent of the amendment involving 'area of production' was Representative Bierman. Cf. 83 Cong.Rec. 7325, 7326, 7401- 7408. \n[\nFootnote 14\n] Responding to inquiry whether packing houses in Iowa and Illinois would be exempted by his amendment, Representative Bierman said: 'Speaking frankly, I think that is something that would have to be worked out.' 83 Cong.Rec. 7401. Senator Schwellenbach clearly recognized his amendment would exempt large as well as small packing and similar plants, 81 Cong. Rec. 7877, 7878, but expressed the opinion there would not be 'any large or enormous plants' in the specified operations. In response to Senator Black's inquiry concerning the indefinite effect of 'area' without further definition, he said: 'I gave considerable thought to that. I do not believe it is possible, and that is something which the board, which has been accused of receiving too much power, would have to decide. It would have to provide a definition of 'immediate area of production.\" Cf. 81 Cong.Rec. 7876-7878. \n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] See the discussion cited in notes 8, 13 and 14. \n[\nFootnote 16\n] Cf. 81 Cong.Rec. 7948. Respondent argues from this that the intent of Congress was shown not to authorize the Administrator, by the later conference amendment, to distinguish among plants within the 'area of production' on the basis of size. The argument however ignores the fact that the amendments proposed by Senator Reynolds were drawn and intended to exempt from the statute's operation all plants having fewer than the number of employees (the amendments varied from five to ten in this respect), not merely plants engaged in the particular marginal operations specified in the various forms the Schwellenbach Amendment took during the debate. The conclusion to be drawn from the rejection of the Reynolds Amendments is not that the Senate intended to exempt all plants, large and small, covered by the Schwellenbach Amendment or by the form taken by Section 13(a)(10) in conference, but rather that the Senate was unwilling to except even all plants having as few as five employees from the statute's coverage. \n[\nFootnote 17\n] Cf. notes 13 and 14, supra, and the cited discussions. \n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] Cf. notes 1-6, supra, and text. \n[\nFootnote 19\n] United States v.

Moyer, and Robert L. Stern, all of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By a decree, entered February 1, 1916, in a suit by the United States against National Cash Register Company, the latter was restrained, pursuant to the antitrust statutes, from acquiring ownership or control of the business or plant of a competitor manufacturing or selling cash registers or other registering devices. The injunction, however, provided that, in case National should desire such acquisition, 'a petition may be presented to this Court stating the reasons therefor, and if the Court upon investigation into all the circumstances of the case and after notice of not less than sixty days to the Attorney General shall determine that such business or patents or plant so desired to be ac- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 137, 139]\n\u00a0\n quired will supplement the plant, patents, machines, or facilities of the defendant corporation and that the acquisition thereof is desired for that purpose and will not substantially lessen competition, then jurisdiction is reserved to pass an order permitting the same upon such terms and conditions as may be right.'\n National, desiring to acquire stock of Allen-Wales Adding Machine Corporation, petitioned for leave and gave the required notice to the Attorney General. The Government filed an answer opposing the grant. The matter was set for hearing in the District Court November 15, 1943. On that day Allen Calculators, Inc., the appellant, presented a motion for leave to intervene. The United States consented to the proposed intervention; National opposed it. The District Judge granted intervention conditionally and allowed counsel for the appellant to make an opening statement and to take some part in the proceedings. Subsequently, but prior to the closing of the hearing, he ruled that the appellant would not be allowed to intervene. Before making his ruling, he was advised, in answer to his inquiry, that the president of the appellant would be called as a witness by the Government. November 16 he entered a formal order denying intervention.\n The issues, which were tried upon evidence submitted by National and by the Government, were whether the purported acquisition would eliminate competition between certain products of National and Allen-Wales, would eliminate potential competition between other products of the two companies, and would, in other respects, be contrary to the purpose of the original decree. The proceeding was adversary throughout.\n December 4 the appellant filed its petition for appeal from the order denying intervention. December 7 the District Judge entered findings of fact and an order granting National's petition upon certain conditions which he \n\n[322 \nU.S. 137, 140]\n\u00a0\n deemed necessary to insure compliance with the original decree in the suit. Neither party has appealed from that order. December 10 the Judge allowed this appeal with a proviso that allowance should not operate as a stay of the order granting National's petition. The appeal is to this court under the Expediting Act. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Rule 24 of the Rules of Civil Procedure2 is:\n'(a) Intervention of Right. Upon timely application anyone shall be permitted to intervene in an action: (1) When a statute of the United States confers an unconditional right to intervene; or (2) when the representation of the applicant's interest by existing parties is or may be inadequate and the applicant is or may be bound by a judgment in the action; or (3) when the applicant is so situated as to be adversely affected by a distribution or other disposition of property in the custody of the court or of an officer thereof.\n\n'(b) Permissive Intervention. Upon timely application anyone may be permitted to intervene in an action: (1) when a statute of the United States confers a conditional right to intervene; or (2) when an applicant's claim or defense and the main action have a question of law or fact in common. In exercising its discretion the court shall consider whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties.'\n\n The appellant insists that it was entitled to intervene as of right, but we think that, in the light of the express provisions of clause (a) the contention must be rejected. No statute of the United States confers an unconditional \n\n[322 \nU.S. 137, 141]\n\u00a0\n right of intervention, as required by (1). The appellant relies on  16 of the Clayton Act,3 but that section merely authorizes private parties to sue for relief against threatened damage consequent upon the violation of the antitrust laws. It grants no privilege, much less an unconditional right, to intervene in suits under the Sherman Act brought by the United States. The application did not fall under (2) for the appellant clearly would not be bound by any judgment in the action. Nor had it any interest in the distribution or disposition of property in the custody of the court so as to come under (3).\n The appellant relies upon Missouri-Kansas Pipeline Co. v. United States, \n312 \nU.S. 502, 665\n, 61 S.Ct. 666. That case, however, is to be distinguished. There the applicant on whose behalf intervention was asked was named in the original decree as one who should be heard in respect of its property rights in the event certain action was taken. Such action was taken and, despite the terms of the original decree, intervention was denied. Clearly, as to the intervenor, the action was final. We accordingly entertained the appeal.\n The appellant had standing to invoke the discretion of the district judge to permit it to intervene under (b)(2) on the ground that its 'claim or defense and the main action have a question of law or fact in common.' The rule provides that, in exercising discretion as to intervention of this character, the court shall consider whether intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties. It is common knowledge that, where a suit is of large public interest, the members of the public often desire to present their views to the court in support of the claim or the defense. To permit a multitude of such interventions may result \n\n[322 \nU.S. 137, 142]\n\u00a0\n in accumulating proofs and arguments without assisting the court. The record here discloses that the parties produced all data they and the court thought was available upon the issues in the case. Moreover, the court invited the Government to call the appellant's president to testify as to his knowledge concerning the issues.\n The challenged order is but an order in the cause and not the final judgment. The exercise of discretion in a matter of this sort is not reviewable by an appellate court unless clear abuse is shown; and it is not ordinarily possible to determine that question except in the light of the whole record. If, in this case, National's petition had ultimately been dismissed, a review of the court's denial of appellant's intervention would have been an idle gesture. Where, as here, examination of the entire record leading to the court's final order discloses that the issues were thoroughly explored and that the parties were adequately represented, the action of the court denying intervention should not be reviewed. It was, inter alia, to prevent the delay of unwarranted appeals by disappointed applicants to intervene, which would suspend the ultimate disposition of suits under the antitrust acts, that jurisdiction to review District Court decrees was not vested in the Circuit Courts of Appeals but solely in this court, and that the statute limited the right of appeal to final decrees. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n The record shows that the District Court had entered a final decree on the merits of National's petition prior to allowing the present appeal; and, if we treat the appeal as taken from that final decree, as we think is required by the Expediting Act,5 and as attacking that decree because the appellant had been wrongfully denied intervention, we should have to affirm the judgment since \n\n[322 \nU.S. 137, 143]\n\u00a0\n it is not shown that the District Court abused its discretion in denying intervention. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n The appeal is dismissed.\n Appeal dismissed.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n Mr. Justice BLACK, Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice MURPHY dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of Feb. 11, 1903, c. 544,  2, 32 Stat. 823, as amended March 3, 1911, c. 231,  291, 36 Stat. 1167, 15 U.S.C.  29, 15 U.S.C.A.  29.

William Marshall Bullitt and Charles W. Milner, both of Louisville, Ky., for appellants.\n Mr. Earl S. Wilson, of Frankfort, Ky., for appellees.\n Mr. Clarence A. Linn, of San Francisco, Cal., for the State of California, as amicus curiae, by special leave of court. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 233, 236]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the court.\n Under Kentucky Revised Statutes of 1942, ch. 393,  393.060 et seq., every bank or trust company in the state is required to turn over to the state, deposits which have remained inactive and unclaimed for specified periods. The questions for decision are: (1) whether the statute under which the state purports to acquire the right to demand custody of the deposits, affords due process of law, even though the depositors may not receive personal notice of the pending transfer and there may be no prior judicial proceedings, and (2) whether the statute, as applied to deposits in a national bank, conflicts with the national banking laws or is an unconstitutional interference by the state with appellant's operations as a banking instrumentality of the United States.\n So far as here relevant, the provisions of the statute may be summarily stated as follows. Demand deposits held by a bank, with accrued interest, are presumed abandoned unless the owner has, within ten years preceding the date for making the report required by  393.110, negotiated in writing with the bank, or been credited with interest on his passbook at his request, or had a transaction noted upon the books of the bank, or increased or decreased the amount of his deposit ( 393.060). Non-demand deposits, with accrued interest, are likewise presumed abandoned, unless the owner, within the twenty-five years preceding the report, has taken one or more of such enumerated actions ( 393.070). \n\n[321 \nU.S. 233, 237]\n\u00a0\n The holder of property presumed abandoned, including any national bank, is required to file with the state Department of Revenue, annually before September 1, a report in duplicate of such property as of the preceding July 1; the copy is sent to the sheriff of the county in which the property is located, and he is under the statutory duty of posting the copy on the court house door or bulletin board, before the following October 1 ( 393.110(1). The holder is required to turn over to the Department of Revenue before November 15, the property so reported, unless the holder or owner certifies facts to rebut the presumption of abandonment, or unless the statute of limitations has run as between the owner and the holder. In neither such case need the holder turn over the property except upon an order of court. If a claimant has filed an action with respect to any such property, the holder is required to notify the Department of the pendency of the action but is not required to turn over the property during its pendency. ( 393.110(2). In any case the holder of such property is entitled to a judicial determination of his rights, under  393.160, providing for appeals from the decisions of the Commissioner of Revenue, or under  393.230, providing for an equitable action by the Commissioner to compel the surrender of such property ( 393.110(3).\n A person refusing to turn over property under this statute is subject to a penalty of 10% of its amount, but not to exceed $500; he is subject to no penalty, however, if he posts a compliance bond ( 393.290). Any person who transfers property to the State under this statute is relieved of liability to the owner, and the State is required to reimburse the holder for any such liability ( 393.130).\n The Commissioner may institute judicial proceedings to establish conclusively that property, in his hands be- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 233, 238]\n\u00a0\n cause presumed abandoned, is actually abandoned, or that the owner of the property has died and that there is no person entitled to it ( 393.230(2). In such an action the procedure is governed by the Kentucky Civil Code of Practice ( 393.240(2).\n A claim to property surrendered to the state may be made at any time, unless the property has been judicially determined, under  393.230, to have been actually abandoned, in which case any claim to the property by a person not actually served with notice and who did not appear and whose claim was not considered during the proceeding, must be made within five years of the judicial determination ( 393.140(1) and (2); and see Anderson National Bank v. Reeves, 293 Ky. 735, 738, 741, 170 S.W.2d 350). The claimant is required to make publication of his claim in a newspaper of general circulation in the county, or if there is none, he is required to post his claim at the court house door and at three other conspicuous places in the county ( 393.140(3). The Commissioner of Revenue is directed to consider and determine the validity of any claim and any defense; if he approves the claim, he must authorize its payment ( 393. 150). Judicial review of his determination in the appropriate state courts is provided ( 393.160).\n The statute thus sets up a comprehensive scheme for the administration of abandoned bank deposits. Upon a report by the bank and notice to the depositors and with an opportunity to be heard, if either wish it, the state takes into its protective custody bank accounts which, having been inactive for at least ten years if demand accounts, or at least twenty-five years if non-demand, the statute declares to be presumptively abandoned. The bank is relieved of its liability to the depositors, who receive instead a claim against the state, enforcible at any time until the deposits are judicially found to be abandoned in fact and \n\n[321 \nU.S. 233, 239]\n\u00a0\n for five years thereafter. Refusal by the designated state officer to make payment is reviewable by the state courts.\n Appellant, a national banking association organized under the laws of the United States, brought the present suit in the Circuit Court of Kentucky for Franklin County. The bill of complaint, filed by appellant on behalf of itself and all others similarly situated, sought to enjoin appellees, the state Commissioner of Revenue and other state officers, from enforcing the statute here in question. The Circuit Court held invalid so much of the challenged statute as requires the payment of deposits to the state merely on the prescribed notice, and without the order or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. It gave judgment perpetually enjoining appellees from enforcing such parts of the statute. The Kentucky Court of Appeals sustained the Act in its entirety, holding that it affords due process, and that it neither infringes the national banking laws nor is a prohibited interference with a banking instrumentality of the United States. It accordingly reversed the judgment of the Circuit Court, and instructed it to deny an injunction. 293 Ky. 735, 170 S.W.2d 350. On remand, the Circuit Court entered its judgment, dismissing the bill. The Court of Appeals affirmed. 294 Ky. 674, 172 S.W. 2d 575. The case comes here on appeal under  237(a) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  344(a), 28 U.S.C.A.  344(a).\n Appellant contends here: (1) that the statute, in requiring payment of the deposit accounts to the state on the prescribed notice, without recourse to judicial proceedings or any court order or judgment, deprives the depositors and appellant of property without due process of law, and ( 2) that such withdrawal of accounts from a national bank infringes the national banking laws, particularly R.S.  5136, 12 U.S.C.  24, 12 U.S.C. A.  24, which authorize national banks to accept deposits and to do a banking business, and is an unconstitutional interference with the \n\n[321 \nU.S. 233, 240]\n\u00a0\n federally authorized function of national banks as instrumentalities of the Federal Government.\n\n\n I.\n\n\n Appellant argues that the statute deprives both the bank and the depositors of their property rights in the bank accounts, and contends that the procedure by which the state acquires its asserted right to demand payment of the accounts is so lacking in notice to depositors and in an opportunity for them to be heard as to deny the state the right to assert the depositors' claims and afford to the bank no protection if it responds to the state's demand for payment of the accounts.\n While the Kentucky statute is entitled 'Escheats', its provisions, so far as applicable to bank deposits, are concerned only with personal property deemed abandoned. At common law, abandoned personal property was not the subject of escheat, but was subject only to the right of appropriation by the sovereign as bona vacantia. See 7 Holdsworth, A History of English Law (2d Ed.) 495, 496. Like rights of appropriation, except so far as limited by state law and the Fourteenth Amendment, exist in the several states of the United States. Hamilton v. Brown, \n161 \nU.S. 256\n, 16 S.Ct. 585; Christianson v. King County, \n239 \nU.S. 356\n, 36 S.Ct. 114; Security Sav. Bank v.

Klein, \n303 \nU.S. 276\n, 58 S.Ct. 536.\n Apart from questions which may arise under the national banking laws in the case of national banks, it is no longer open to doubt that a state, by a procedure satisfying constitutional requirements, may compel surrender to it of deposit balances, when there is substantial ground for belief that they have been abandoned or forgotten, Security Sav. Bank v. People of State of California, supra, certainly when the state acquires them subject to all lawful demands of the depositors. Provident Institution for Savings v. Malone, \n221 \nU.S. 660\n, 31 S.Ct. 661, 34 L.R.A.,N.S., 1129. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 233, 241]\n\u00a0\n The deposits are debtor obligations of the bank, incurred and to be performed in the state where the bank is located, and hence are subject to the state's dominion. See Security Sav. Bank v. People of State of California, supra, 263 U.S. at page 285, 44 S.Ct. at page 110, 31 A.L.R. 391 and cases cited; Irving Trust Co. v. Day, \n314 \nU.S. 556, 562\n, 62 S.Ct. 398, 401. And it is within the constitutional power of the state to protect the interests of depositors from the risks which attend long neglected accounts, by taking them into custody when they have been inactive so long as to be presumptively abandoned, see Provident Institution for Savings v. Malone, supra, 221 U.S. at page 664, 31 S.Ct. at page 663, 34 L.R.A.,N.S., 1129, just as it may provide for the administration of the property of a missing person. Cunnius v. Reading School Dist., \n198 \nU.S. 458\n, 25 S.Ct. 721, 3 Ann.Cas. 1121; Blinn v. Nelson, \n222 \nU.S. 1\n, 32 S.Ct. 1, Ann.Cas.1913B, 555.\n With respect to the statutory rebuttable presumption of abandonment of demand deposits after inactivity of ten years and of non-demand deposits after inactivity of twenty-five years, we are unable to say that the legislative determination is without support in experience. We have sustained like statutory presumptions that shorter periods of inactivity furnish the basis for state administration of unasserted claims or demands. See Security Sav. Bank v. People of State of California, supra; Cunnius v. Reading School Dist., supra; Blinn v. Nelson, supra; cf. Provident Institution for Savings v. Malone, supra.\n In the present posture of the case we conclude, subject to the requirements of procedural due process, that prior to a judicial decree of actual abandonment, the depositors will not be deprived of their property by the surrender of their bank accounts to the state. We need not decide whether the procedure for determining abandonment in fact conforms to due process, for appellant has not attacked this procedure here and no such proceeding is before us. Prior to such a decree the present statute merely compels the summary substitution of the state for the bank, as the debtor of the depositors. It deprives \n\n[321 \nU.S. 233, 242]\n\u00a0\n the depositors of none of their rights as creditors, preserving their right to demand from the state payment of the deposits, and their right to resort to the courts if payment is refused. True, payment over of the deposits to the state may be the precursor of a decree of abandonment and the shortening of the period within which a claimant may demand payment of his deposit. But, if the notice to depositors is adequate, we cannot say that the period of five years allowed for that purpose after the decree, is an infringement of constitutional rights. Terry v. Anderson, \n95 \nU.S. 628, 632\n, 633 S., and cases cited; United States v. Morena, \n245 \nU.S. 392, 397\n, 38 S.Ct. 151, 152.\n Appellant and the Comptroller of the Currency, as amicus curiae, point to the formalities with which the depositors must comply before they will be able to recover their deposits, and argue that the state may be less solvent or less willing to pay than the bank. In the absence of some persuasive showing, which is lacking here, that these formalities will be more onerous than those which would or could be properly required by the bank, or that the state will in fact be less able or less willing to pay, it cannot be assumed that the mere substitution of the state as the debtor will deprive the depositors of their property, or impose on them an unconstitutional burden. See Dohany v. Rogers, \n281 \nU.S. 362\n, 366-368, 50 S. Ct. 299, 301, 302, 68 A.L.R. 434; cf. Blinn v. Nelson, supra, 222 U.S. at page 7, 32 S.Ct. at page 2, Ann.Cas.1913B, 555; Corn Exchange Bank v. Coler, Commissioner, \n280 \nU.S. 218, 223\n, 50 S.Ct. 94, 95. In the absence of a showing of injury, actual or threatened, there can be no constitutional argument. In re 620 Church Street Corp., \n299 \nU.S. 24, 27\n, 57 S.Ct. 88, 89, and cases cited.\n Since the bank is a debtor to its depositors, it can interpose no due process or contract clause objection to payment of the claimed deposits to the state, if the state is lawfully entitled to demand payment, for in that case payment of the debt to the state, under the statute, relieves the bank of its liability to the depositors. Security Sav. Bank v. People of State of California, supra, 263 U.S. at pages 285, 286, 44 S.Ct. at pages 109, 110, 31 A.L.R. 391. But if the statute \n\n[321 \nU.S. 233, 243]\n\u00a0\n is deficient in its provisions for notice and opportunity for hearing so that the depositors would not be bound by any proceedings taken under it, the bank would be entitled to raise the question whether its obligation to the depositors would be discharged by payment of the deposits to the state. Hence our inquiry must be directed to the question whether the procedure by which the state undertakes to acquire the depositors' right to demand payment of the deposits was upon adequate notice to them and opportunity for them to be heard.\n As we have said, the statute provides for notice to the depositors by requiring the sheriff to post on the court house door or bulletin board a copy of the bank's report of deposits presumed abandoned. We think that this, in conjunction with the notice provided by the statute itself and by the taking of possession of the bank balances by the state, is sufficient notice to the depositors to satisfy all requirements of due process.\n The statute itself is notice to all depositors of banks within the state, of the conditions on which the balances of inactive accounts will be deemed presumptively abandoned, and their surrender to the state compelled. All persons having property located within a state and subject to its dominion must take note of its statutes affecting the control or disposition of such property and of the procedure which they set up for those purposes. Reetz v. People of State of Michigan, \n188 \nU.S. 505, 509\n, 23 S.Ct. 390, 392; North Laramie Land Co. v. Hoffman, \n268 \nU.S. 276, 283\n, 45 S.Ct. 491, 494. Proceedings for the assessment of taxes, the condemnation of land, the establishment of highways and public improvements affecting landowners, are familiar examples. Huling v. Kaw Valley Ry. & Imp. Co., \n130 \nU.S. 559, 563\n, 564 S., 9 S. Ct. 603, 605, 606; Ballard v. Hunter, \n204 \nU.S. 241\n, 254-257, 262, 27 S.Ct. 261, 264-267, 269.\n The report of the bank required to be posted on the court house door or bulletin board, lists the abandoned accounts as defined by the statute and thus gives notice \n\n[321 \nU.S. 233, 244]\n\u00a0\n to the owners of all those accounts which, because of their inactivity for the periods and in the ways specified by the statute, are deemed abandoned and required to be paid to the state. This notice, when read in the light of the knowledge of the statute, with which all persons having such bank accounts within the state are chargeable, is sufficient to advise that the listed accounts are deemed presumptively abandoned and will at the end of six weeks from the date of filing be paid over to the state, and that both before and after that event the depositors will be afforded opportunity to present their claims and to have them judicially determined, if rejected.\n Posting on the court house door as a method of giving notice of proceedings affecting property within the county, is an ancient one and is time-honored in Kentucky. The Act of the Kentucky legislature of December 19, 1796, provided in  2 for the use of this method of warning absent defendants in equity proceedings that a decree would be entered against them, if they did not appear. This means of giving notice was employed in the escheat statutes of Kentucky at least as early as 1852. Kentucky Revised Statutes of 1852, p. 308, c. 34, Art. IV,  3(1). The fact that a procedure is so old as to have become customary and well known in the community is of great weight in determining whether it conforms to due process, for 'Not lightly vacated is the verdict of quiescent years'. Coler v. Corn Exchange Bank, 250 N.Y. 136, 141, 164 N.E. 882, 884, 65 A.L. R. 879, affirmed sub nom. Corn Exchange Bank v. Coler, Commissioner, supra. To that effect, see Otis Co. v. Ludlow Mfg. Co., \n201 \nU.S. 140, 154\n, 26 S. Ct. 353, 355; Ownbey v. Morgan, \n256 \nU.S. 94, 108\n, 109 S., 112, 41 S.Ct. 433, 437, 438, 17 A.L.R. 873; Jackman v. Rosenbaum Co., \n260 \nU.S. 22, 31\n, 43 S.Ct. 9, 10; Corn Exchange Bank v. Coler, Commissioner, supra, 280 U.S. at pages 222, 223, 50 S.Ct. at page 95; Snyder v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts, \n291 \nU.S. 97, 110\n, 111 S., 54 S.Ct. 330, 334, 90 A.L.R. 575.\n We cannot say that the posting of a notice on the door of the court house in a Kentucky county is a less efficacious method of giving notice to depositors in banks of the \n\n[321 \nU.S. 233, 245]\n\u00a0\n county than publication in a local newspaper, or that in the circumstances of this case it is an inadequate means of giving notice of the summary taking into custody of the designated bank accounts by the state. This is the more so because in this case the notice is the immediate prelude to and accompanies the compulsory surrender of the bank balances to the state, unless the depositors in the meantime intervene as claimants. The statutory procedure, so far as it affects depositors, is in the nature of a proceeding in rem, in the course of which property, against which a claim is asserted, is seized or sequestered, and held subject to the appearance and presentation of claims by all those who assert an adverse interest in it. In all such proceedings the seizure of the property is in itself a form of notice of the claim asserted, to those who may claim an interest in the property. See Corn Exchange Bank v. Coler, Commissioner, supra, holding constitutional a statute providing for no notice to the owner of a bank deposit other than its seizure.\n Security Sav. Bank v. People of State of California, supra, was a proceeding to compel the bank to pay over to the state inactive bank accounts as the first step in their sequestration and, if unclaimed, their possible ultimate escheat. The Court held, 263 U.S. at pages 289, 290, 44 S.Ct. at page 111, 31 A.L.R. 391, that publication of notice of the proceeding in a newspaper at the state capital was sufficient notice to absent depositors to meet due process requirements. It supported this conclusion by reference to the proceeding against the bank by which it was required to pay over the deposits to the state 'as in personam, so far as concerns the bank; as quasi in rem, so far as concerns the depositors', 263 U.S. at page 287, 44 S.Ct. at page 110, 31 A.L.R. 391. Since the service of process on the bank personally was equivalent to a seizure of the accounts, it was deemed to supplement the publication as an independent notice, in itself, to the depositors of the seizure and of their opportunity given by the statute to appear and assert their claims against the state. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 233, 246]\n\u00a0\n Like procedure, begun by the seizure or acquisition of control of a res, including, in some cases, choses in actions, has been sustained as affording adequate notice to absent claimants in escheat proceedings, Hamilton v. Brown, supra; Christianson v. King County, supra, 239 U.S. at page 373, 36 S.Ct. at page 121; in garnishment proceedings, Harris v. Balk, \n198 \nU.S. 215, 223\n, 25 S.Ct. 625, 627, 3 Ann. Cas. 1084; in proceedings for the administration of a debt due an absentee, Cunnius v. Reading School District, supra; in proceedings begun by attachment, Cooper v. Reynolds, 10 Wall. 308; and in admiralty proceedings, The Mary, 9 Cranch 126, 144.\n We cannot say, nor does appellant seriously urge, that the length of notice by posting, six weeks, is inadequate. Three weeks' notice by publication of the condemnation of the land for a public highway was held sufficient by this Court in North Laramie Land Co. v. Hoffman, supra; and thirty days was deemed sufficient in a like proceeding in Huling v. Kaw Valley Ry. & Imp. Co., supra.\n What is due process in a procedure affecting property interests must be determined by taking into account the purposes of the procedure and its effect upon the rights asserted and all other circumstances which may render the proceeding appropriate to the nature of the case. Davidson v. New Orleans, \n96 \nU.S. 97, 107\n, 108 S.; Ballard v. Hunter, supra, 204 U.S. at page 255, 27 S.Ct. at page 266; North Laramie Land Co. v. Hoffman, supra, 268 U.S. at pages 282, 283, 45 S.Ct. at page 494; Dohany v. Rogers, supra, 281 U.S. at page 369, 50 S.Ct. at page 302, 68 A.L.R. 434, and cases cited. The fundamental requirement of due process is an opportunity to be heard upon such notice and proceedings as are adequate to safeguard the right for which the constitutional protection is invoked. If that is preserved, the demands of due process are fulfilled. Measured by this standard, we cannot say that the present notice is insufficient.\n For this reason also it is not an indispensable requirement of due process that every procedure affecting the ownership or disposition of property be exclusively by judicial proceeding. Statutory proceedings affecting \n\n[321 \nU.S. 233, 247]\n\u00a0\n property rights, which, by later resort to the courts, secure to adverse parties an opportunity to be heard, suitable to the occasion, do not deny due process. Familiar examples are the decisions and orders of administrative agencies which determine rights subject to a subsequent judicial review. And such is obviously the case here, where there is full opportunity to the depositors to be heard by the State Commissioner, whose decision is subject to court review. It is difficult to see what right here asserted would have been better preserved by a court procedure whose and was the compulsory surrender of the deposit balances by the bank to the state, which takes subject to the claims of the depositors.\n The mere fact that the state or its authorities acquire possession or control of property as a preliminary step to the judicial determination of asserted rights in the property is not a denial of due process. Samuels v. McCurdy, \n267 \nU.S. 188, 200\n, 45 S.Ct. 264, 268, 37 L.R.A. 1378; North Laramie Land Co. v. Hoffman, supra; Corn Exchange Bank v. Coler, Commissioner, supra; Phillips v. Commissioner, \n283 \nU.S. 589\n, 593- 601, 51 S.Ct. 608, 610-613, and cases cited.\n We conclude that the procedural provisions of the Kentucky statute are adequate to meet all constitutional requirements, and that it does not deprive appellant or its depositors of property without due process of law.\n\n\n II.\n\n\n We come now to appellant's second contention, that the Kentucky statute infringes the national banking laws and unconstitutionally interferes with appellant as an instrumentality of the federal government. But the statute does not discriminate against national banks, cf. McCulloch v. State of Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, by directing payment to the state by state and national banks alike, of presumptively abandoned accounts. Nor do we find any word in the national banking laws which expressly or by implication conflicts with the provisions of the Kentucky \n\n[321 \nU.S. 233, 248]\n\u00a0\n statutes. Cf. Davis v. Elmira Sav. Bank, \n161 \nU.S. 275\n, 16 S.Ct. 502.\n This Court has often pointed out that national banks are subject to state laws, unless those laws infringe the national banking laws or impose an undue burden on the performance of the banks' functions. Waite v. Dowley, \n94 \nU.S. 527\n, 533; First Nat. Bank v. State of Missouri, \n263 \nU.S. 640, 656\n, 44 S.Ct. 213, 215; Lewis v. Fidelity & Deposit Co., \n292 \nU.S. 559, 566\n, 54 S.Ct. 848, 851, 92 A.L.R. 794; Jennings v. United States Fid. & G. Co., \n294 \nU.S. 216, 219\n, 55 S.Ct. 394, 395, 99 A.L.R. 1248. Thus the mere fact that the depositor's account is in a national bank does not render it immune to attachment by the creditors of the depositor, as authorized by state law. Compare Earle v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, \n178 \nU.S. 449\n, 20 S.Ct. 915, with Van Reed v. People's Nat. Bank, \n198 \nU.S. 554\n, 25 S.Ct. 775, 3 Ann.Cas. 1154\n\n\n As we have seen, a bank account is a chose in action of the depositor against the bank, which the latter is obligated to pay in accordance with the terms of the deposit. It is a part of the mass of property within the state whose transfer and devolution is subject to state control. Security Sav. Bank v. People of State of California, supra, 263 U.S. at pages 285, 286, 44 S.Ct. at pages 109, 110, 31 A.L.R. 391, and cases cited; Irving Trust Co. v. Day, supra, 314 U.S. at page 562, 62 S.Ct. at page 401. It has never been suggested that non- discriminatory laws of this type are so burdensome as to be inapplicable to the accounts of depositors in national banks.\n The statute here attacked does not purport to do more than does any other regulation of the devolution of bank accounts of missing persons, a function which is, as we have seen, within the competence of the state. Under the statute the state merely acquires the right to demand payment of the accounts in the place of the depositors. Upon payment of the deposits to the state, the bank's obligation is discharged. Something more than this is required to render the statute obnoxious to the federal banking laws. For an inseparable incident of a national bank's privilege of receiving deposits is its obligation to pay them to the persons entitled to demand payment ac- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 233, 249]\n\u00a0\n cording to the law of the state where it does business. A demand for payment of an account by one entitled to make the demand does not infringe or interfere with any authorized function of the bank. In fact, inability to comply with such demands is made a basis in the national banking laws for closing the doors of the bank and winding up its affairs.\n Appellant argues that if the present act is sustained, it will open the door to the exertion of unlimited state discretionary power over the deposits in national banks, and that the act imposes a burden on appellants such as was held to be inadmissible in First Nat. Bank v. State of California, \n262 \nU.S. 366\n, 43 S.Ct. 602, which was followed in National City Bank v. People of Philippine Islands, \n302 \nU.S. 651\n, 58 S.Ct. 269. As we have seen, the only power sought to be exerted by the state over the depositors' accounts is the assertion of its lawfully acquired right to collect them, in accordance with the obligation, which was both assumed by appellant and is to be performed in conformity with the banking laws of the United States. In this respect the state's power to make such a demand cannot extend beyond its power under state law and the Federal Constitution to acquire control of deposit accounts from their owners. So long as it is thus limited, and the power is exercised only to demand payment of the accounts in the same way and to the same extent that the depositors could, we can perceive no danger of unlimited control by the state over the operations of national banking institutions. We need not decide whether within this limit, the state's power over deposits in national banks is as simple as its like power over deposits in state banks. Compare First Nat. Bank v. State of California, supra, with Security Sav. Bank v. People of State of California, supra. We are concerned only with the question whether the particular power here asserted is a forbidden encroachment upon the privileges of a national bank. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 233, 250]\n\u00a0\n The decision of this Court in First Nat. Bank v. State of California, supra, did not rest on any want of power of a state to demand of a national bank, payment of deposits which the state was lawfully entitled to receive. Decision there turned rather on the effect of the state statute in altering the contracts of deposit in a manner considered so unusual and so harsh in its application to depositors as to deter them from placing or keeping their funds in national banks. In that case the state brought a statutory proceeding in its courts to compel a national bank to pay over to it an inactive deposit account. The statute required 'escheat to the state' of all balances in deposit accounts remaining unclaimed and inactive for more than twenty years, where neither the depositor nor any claimant had filed any notice with the bank showing his present address. It authorized suit in behalf of the state to recover such amounts and directed that judgment should be given for the state 'if it be determined that the moneys deposited in any defendant bank or banks are unclaimed', for the period and in the manner specified by the statute. It will be noted that the statute required no proof that the forfeited accounts had been in fact abandoned, or that their owners were unknown or had died without heirs or surviving kin. Upon mere proof of dormancy for the prescribed period, the statute declared the accounts to be escheated to the state.\n After pointing out that the state Supreme Court, in sustaining the judgment in the state's favor, had declined, as unnecessary to its decision, to express an opinion whether the absent depositors could reclaim their forfeited deposits from the state, this Court declared that the statute 'attempts to qualify in an unusual way agreements between national banks and their customers long understood to arise when the former receive deposits under their plainly granted powers.' 262 U.S. at page 370, 43 S.Ct. at page 603. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 233, 251]\n\u00a0\n And since it was thought that such alterations might be made by that and other states 'and, instead of 20 years, varying limitations may be prescribed-3 years perhaps, or 5, or 10, or 15', the Court declared that the effect on the national banking system would be incompatible with the statutory purposes of establishing a system of national banks acting as federal instrumentalities. That effect it specifically described as follows (262 U.S. at page 370, 43 S.Ct. at page 603): 'The depositors of a national bank often live in many different states and countries, and certainly it would not be an immaterial thing if the deposits of all were subject to seizure by the state where the bank happened to be located. The success of almost all commercial banks depends upon their ability to obtain loans from depositors, and these might well hesitate to subject their funds to possible confiscation.'\n The unusual alteration of depositors' accounts to which the Court referred was plainly the statutory declaration of escheat of depositors' accounts merely because of their dormancy for the specified period, without any determination of abandonment in fact. This is treated as in effect 'confiscation' of depositors' accounts, operating as an effective deterrent to depositors' placing their funds in national banks doing business within the state.\n We have no occasion to reconsider this decision, as appellees urge, for the grounds assigned for it are wholly wanting here. While the seizure and escheat or forfeiture for mere dormancy of a national bank account are unusual, the escheat or appropriation by the state of property in fact abandoned or without an owner is, as we have seen, as old as the common law itself. Here there is no escheat or forfeiture by reason of dormancy. Dormancy without more is made the statutory ground for the state's taking inactive bank accounts into its custody, the state assuming the bank's obligation to the depositors. And the deposits \n\n[321 \nU.S. 233, 252]\n\u00a0\n need not be surrendered, if the depositors or the bank make it appear that abandonment has not occurred. This is not confiscation or even an attempted deprivation of property. Escheat or forfeiture to the state may follow, but only on proof of abandonment in fact. We cannot say that the protective custody of long inactive bank accounts, for which the Kentucky statute provides, and which in many circumstances may operate for the benefit and security of depositors, see Provident Institution for Savings v. Malone, supra, 221 U.S. at page 664, 31 S.Ct. at page 663, 34 L.R.A., N.S., 1129, will deter them from placing their funds in national banks in that state. It cannot be said that it would have that effect, more than would the tax laws, the attachment laws, or the laws for the administration of estates of decedents or of missing or unknown persons, which a state may maintain and apply to depositors in national banks.\n Nor are we able to discern any greater or different effect so far as prospective depositors in national banks are concerned, from the application of the ancient law of escheat or forfeiture of goods as bona vacantia, to bank accounts found to be without an owner, or to have been in fact abandoned by their owners. Compare United States v. Klein, supra. True, under the Kentucky statute, as in the case of an attachment or the administration of the estate of a deceased depositor, a change in the dominion over the accounts will ensue, to which the bank must respond by payment of them on lawful demand. But this, as we have said, is nothing more than performance of a duty by the bank imposed by the federal banking laws, and not a denial of its privileges as a federal instrumentality. In all this we can perceive no denial of constitutional right and no unlawful encroachment on the rights and privileges of national banks.\n Since Kentucky may enforce its statute requiring the surrender to it of presumptively abandoned accounts in national as well as state banks, it may, as an appropriate \n\n[321 \nU.S. 233, 253]\n\u00a0\n incident to this exercise of authority, require the banks to file reports of inactive accounts, as the statute directs. Waite v. Dowley, supra; Colorado Nat. Bank v. Bedford, \n310 \nU.S. 41, 53\n, 60 S.Ct. 800, 805.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","4":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nANDERSON v.

Marx, of Cincinnati, Ohio for petitioner.\n Mr. Allen P. Dodd, of Louisville, Ky., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The primary question in this case is whether on these facts shareholders of a bank-stock holding company are liable under  23 of the Federal Reserve Act, 12 U.S.C.  64, 12 U.S.C.A. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 349, 352]\n\u00a0\n s 64, and  12 of the National Bank Act, 12 U.S.C.  63, 12 U.S.C.A.  63, for an assessment on shares of a national bank in the portfolio of the holding company.\n The essential facts1 may be briefly stated.\n Banco Kentucky Company was organized under the laws of Delaware in July, 1929. It had broad charter powers in the field of finance. It was organized by the management of the National Bank of Kentucky and of the Louisville Trust Company-banking houses doing business at Louisville. Banco perfected the desired alliance between them by acquiring most of their shares2 in exchange for its shares. The Bank, the Trust Company, and Banco each had the same directors and certain common officers. Some of the shareholders who made the exchange also purchased additional shares of Banco stock at $25 per share. Banco stock was also sold at that price on the market to those who did not own any shares in the Bank or the Trust Company. All told some $9,900,000 in cash was realized by Banco from the sale of its shares-about $6,000,000 of which was financed on loans from the Bank and from the Trust Company. Banco's stock certificates stated that the shares were 'full-paid and nonassessable'. Its certificate of incorporation provided that the stockholders' property should 'not be subject to the payment of corporate debts to any extent whatever'.\n The closing date for the exchange of shares was September 19, 1929. Beginning about September 25, 1929, Banco acquired a majority stock interest in each of five \n\n[321 \nU.S. 349, 353]\n\u00a0\n banks in Kentucky and two banks in Ohio, and a minority stock interest in another bank in Kentucky. Of these eight banks, two were national. The shares of the state, as well as the national, banks in the group carried a double liability. \n3\n The price paid for the shares in these banks was about $ 11,500,000-of which some $6,500,000 was paid in cash and $5,000,000 in Banco's shares. Not all of Banco's funds were invested in bank shares. It acquired for $2,000,000 a $2,000,000 note of its president. \n4\n It purchased 625 shares of a life insurance company for $25,000 cash. It purchased and retired 106,000 of its own shares at a cost of over $2,300,000-some $275, 000 less than Banco received for them. It received dividends of about $1, 180,000 on the bank stocks owned by it and paid them out at once as dividends on its own shares. It borrowed $2,600,000 from a New York bank and paid back $1,000,000. With $600,000 of that loan it purchased from the Bank certain dubious assets5-a transaction which the \n\n[321 \nU.S. 349, 354]\n\u00a0\n Kentucky court later set aside. Banco Kentucky Co.'s Receiver v. National Bank of Ky., 281 Ky. 784, 137 S.W.2d 357. It was negotiating for the purchase of the shares of an investment banking house when that house, the Bank and the Trust Company failed. That was in November, 1930-a little more than a year after Banco began its financial career. In November, 1930 a receiver was appointed for the Bank and one for Banco. In February, 1931 the Comptroller of the Currency made an assessment on the shareholders of the Bank in the amount of $4,000,000 payable on or before April 1, 1931. And in March, 1931 the receiver of the Bank notified the stockholders of Banco that he had demanded payment of the assessment from the receiver of Banco and that he intended to proceed against them for collection of the assessment to the extent that he was unable to collect from Banco. In October, 1931 the receiver of the Bank brought an action against Banco as holder of substantially all of the Bank's shares. He obtained a judgment ( Keyes v. American Life Ins. Co., D.C., 1 F.Supp. 512) which was affirmed on appeal. Laurent v. Anderson, 6 Cir., 70 F.2d 819. Some $90,000 was paid on that judgment. The receiver of the Bank thereupon brought this suit against those stockholders of Banco who resided in the Western District of Kentucky in which he seeks to recover from each his proportionate part of the balance of the assessment. Similar suits against other stockholders were brought in federal district courts in other states. The District Court, after a trial, dismissed the bill. 32 F.Supp. 328. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that judgment. 6 Cir., 127 F.2d 696. The case is here on certiorari.\n\n\n I.\n\n\n We are met at the outset with the contention that the decision in Laurent v. Anderson, supra, holding Banco liable on the assessment is res judicata of the present claim; \n\n[321 \nU.S. 349, 355]\n\u00a0\n and that petitioner by bringing that suit made an election which bars the present action. We do not agree. Either the record owner or the actual owner of shares of a national bank may be liable on the statutory assessment. \n6\n Richmond v. Irons, \n121 \nU.S. 27, 58\n, 7 S.Ct. 788, 802; Keyser v. Hetz, \n133 \nU.S. 138, 149\n, 10 S.Ct. 290, 294; Pauly v. State Loan & Trust Co., \n165 \nU.S. 606\n, 17 S.Ct. 465; Lantry v.

Jack, \n294 \nU.S. 158\n, 55 S.Ct. 370, 96 A.L.R. 1457. A receiver may sue both-partial satisfaction of the judgment against one being a pro tanto discharge of the other. Ericson v. Slomer, 7 Cir., 94 F. 2d 437. And see Continental Nat. Bank & Trust Co. v. O'Neil, 7 Cir., 82 F. 2d 650. The basis of liability of each is different-apparent or titular ownership in one case, actual or beneficial ownership in the other. Hence the issues involved in each suit are not the same. \n7\n See Reconstruction Finance Corp. v. Pelts, 7 Cir., 123 F.2d 503; Reconstruction Finance Corp. v. Barrett, 7 Cir., 131 F.2d 745, 748. If the receiver were barred from proceeding against one because he had already proceeded against the other, creditors of banks would be deprived of the full benefits of these statutes. The wisdom of the receiver's first suit rather than the fixed statutory liability would be the measure of their protection. There is no justification for such an impairment of the statutory scheme. The rules of election applicable to suits on contracts made by agents of undisclosed principals \n\n[321 \nU.S. 349, 356]\n\u00a0\n (Pittsburgh Terminal Coal Corp. v. Bennett, 3 Cir., 73 F.2d 387, 389) have been pressed upon us. But they have no application to suits to enforce a liability which has this statutory origin. Cf. Christopher v. Norvell, \n201 \nU.S. 216, 225\n, 26 S.Ct. 502, 504, 5 Ann.Cas. 740.\n\n\n II.\n\n\n The District Court found, and the Circuit Court of Appeals agreed, that Banco was organized in good faith and was not a sham; that it was not organized for a fraudulent purpose or to conceal enterprises conducted for the benefit of the Bank; that it was not a mere holding company; that it was not formed as a means for avoiding double liability on the stock of the Bank; and that the soundness of the Bank and its ability to meet the obligations could not be questioned until after the formation of Banco. Some of these findings have been challenged. But we do not stop to examine the evidence. We accept those findings, as they were concurred in by two courts and no clear error is shown. Brewer Oil Co. v. United States, \n260 \nU.S. 77, 86\n, 43 S.Ct. 60, 63; Alabama Power Co. v. Ickes, \n302 \nU.S. 464, 477\n, 58 S.Ct. 300, 302. We conclude, however, that the courts below erred in dismissing the bill.\n It is clear by reason of Early v. Richardson, supra, that if a stockholder of the Bank had transferred his shares to his minor children, he would not have been relieved from liability for this assessment. And see Seabury v. Green, \n294 \nU.S. 165\n, 55 S.Ct. 373, 96 A.L.R. 1463. That follows because of the policy underlying these statutes. One who is legally irresponsible cannot be allowed to serve as an insulator from liability, whether that was the purpose or merely the effect of the arrangement. A father who transfers his shares to his minor children has not found a substitute for his liability. See Weston's Case, 5 Ch.App. 614. It does not matter that the transfer was in good faith, without purpose of evasion and at a time when the bank was solvent. Early v. Richardson, supra. The vice of the arrangement is \n\n[321 \nU.S. 349, 357]\n\u00a0\n found in the nature of the transferee and his relationship to the transferor. Cf. Nickalls v. Merry, 7 Eng. & Irish App. 530. The same result will at times obtain where the transferee is financially irresponsible. This does not mean that every stockholder of a national bank who sells his shares remains liable because his transferee turns out to be irresponsible or impecunious. It is clear that he does not. Earle v. Carson, \n188 \nU.S. 42, 54\n, 55 S., 23 S.Ct. 254, 259. But where after the sale he retains through his transferee an investment position in the bank, including control, he cannot escape the statutory liability if his transferee does not have resources commensurate with the risks of those holdings. In such a case he remains liable as a 'stockholder' or 'shareholder' within the meaning of these statutes to the extent of his interest in the underlying shares of the bank. For he retains control and the other benefits of ownership without substituting in his stead any one who is responsible for the risks of the banking business. The law has been edging towards that result. See Hansen v. Agnew, 195 Wash. 354, 80 P. 2d 845; Metropolitan Holding Co. v. Snyder, 8 Cir., 79 F.2d 263, 103 A.L.R. 912; Barbour v. Thomas, 6 Cir., 86 F.2d 510; Nettles v. Rhett, 4 Cir., 94 F.2d 42. We think the result is necessary, lest the protection afforded by these double liability provisions be lost through transfers to impecunious or not fully responsible holding or operating companies whose stock is owned by the transferor. Whether the transfer is made in avoidance of the double liability as in Corker v. Soper, 5 Cir., 53 F.2d 190, or for business reasons which may be considered wholly legitimate, the result is the same. Depositors are deprived of the benefit of double liability in either event.\n Thus it is no bar to the present suit that Banco was organized in good faith, that there was no fraudulent intent, that Banco was not a sham, that it was not a mere holding company, or that the shareholders of the Bank had no purpose of avoiding double liability. We are not \n\n[321 \nU.S. 349, 358]\n\u00a0\n concerned with any question of good intention. The question is whether the parties did what they intended to do and whether what they did contravened the policy of the law. By that test it is clear to us that the old stockholders of the Bank are liable. For they retained through Banco their former investment positions in the Bank, including control, and did not constitute Banco as an adequate financial substitute in their stead. Banco's asset position immediately after its sales of stock cannot be taken as the measure of its financial responsibility. Its liquid condition was fleeting; the raising of the cash was but an interim step in the planned evolution of Banco as a bank-stock holding company. It is the condition of Banco at the end of the promotion which is significant. Banco emerged as a bank-stock holding company. Technically it was not merely such a holding company as it had other interests and investments. But its main assets were stocks in banks, stocks which carried double liability. Its other assets-apart from the $25,000 of life insurance stock-were always highly suspect and dubious. In substance Banco as a going concern had no free assets which could possibly be said to constitute an adequate reserve against double liability on the bank stocks which it held. It was in no true sense comparable to an investment trust or holding company which holds bank stock in a diversified portfolio. If the small amount of life insurance stock be left out of account, the situation is in point of fact not materially different from the case where the only assets held were bank stocks carrying double liability. Such an arrangement, if successful, would allow stockholders of banks to retain all of the benefits of ownership without the double liability which Congress had prescribed. The only substitute which depositors of one bank would have for that double liability would be the stock in another bank carrying a like liability. The sensitiveness of one bank in the group to the disaster of another would likely mean \n\n[321 \nU.S. 349, 359]\n\u00a0\n that at the only time when double liability was needed the financial responsibility of the holding company as stockholder would be lacking. However that may be, the device used here can be so readily utilized in circumvention of the statutory policy of double liability that the stockholders of the holding company rather than the depositors of the subsidiary banks must take the risk of the financial success of the undertaking. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n That is a basis of liability sufficiently broad to include also the stockholders of Banco who had not been stockholders of the Bank. As we have noted, many of them acquired their shares either for cash or for shares in other banks. It must be assumed that in making those purchases or effecting those exchanges they knew what kind of an enterprise Banco was. See Nettles v. Rhett, supra, 94 F.2d pages 48, 49; Anderson v. Atkinson, D.C., 22 F.Supp. 853, 863. Circulars of the Chicago Stock Exchange, on which Banco's shares were listed, gave a plain indication of the nature \n\n[321 \nU.S. 349, 360]\n\u00a0\n of the enterprise. \n9\n So did circulars of dealers. \n10\n And there would not seem to be any doubt that the old stockholders of the Bank were given at the time of the exchange a fair \n\n[321 \nU.S. 349, 361]\n\u00a0\n picture of the nature of the enterprise which Banco was about to launch. Some shareholders of Banco claim the right to rescind their purchases of its shares on the ground of misrepresentations in the sale. But whether or not such relief might be granted in some instances, it seems clear that Banco's stockholders are bound by the decisions of the directors which determined, within the scope of the corporate charter, the kind and quality of the corporate undertaking. As was stated in Christopher v. Brusselback, \n302 \nU.S. 500, 503\n, 58 S.Ct. 350, 352, 'A stockholder is so far an integral part of the corporation of which he is a member, that he may be bound and his rights foreclosed by authorized corporate action taken without his knowledge or participation. Sanger v. Upton, \n91 \nU.S. 56\n, 58.' And see Pink v. A.A.A. Highway Express, \n314 \nU.S. 201, 207\n, 62 S.Ct. 241, 245, 137 A.L.R. 957 and cases cited. The legality of the investments of Banco's funds for the most part is not challenged. It must be assumed that they were not ultra vires. They fall indeed into the category of acts of directors which normally cannot be challenged by stockholders. Cook, Corporations, 8th Ed .,  684. These principles, basic in general corporation law, are relevant here as indicating that the stockholders of Banco cannot escape responsibility for the inadequacy of Banco's resources merely because the choice of its investments was made by the officers and directors-acts in which the stockholders did not participate and of which perhaps they had no actual knowledge. The fact that they may have claims against an officer or director for mismanagement does not relieve them from liability to the depositors of the subsidiary banks. Cf. Scott v. DeWeese, \n181 \nU.S. 202, 213\n, 21 S.Ct. 585, 589; Lantry v. Wallace, \n182 \nU.S. 536\n, 548- 554, 21 S.Ct. 878, 882-885.\n Normally the corporation is an insulator from liability on claims of creditors. The fact that incorporation was desired in order to obtain limited liability does not defeat that purpose. Elenkrieg v. Siebrecht, 238 N.Y. 254, 144 \n\n[321 \nU.S. 349, 362]\n\u00a0\n N.E. 519, 34 A.L.R. 592. See 7 Harv.Bus.Rev. 496. Limited liability is the rule not the exception; and on that assumption large undertakings are rested, vast enterprises are launched, and huge sums of capital attracted. But there are occasions when the limited liability sought to be obtained through the corporation will be qualified or denied. Mr. Chief Judge Cardozo stated that a surrender of that principle of limited liability would be made 'when the sacrifice is so essential to the end that some accepted public policy may be defended or upheld.' Berkey v. Third Ave. Ry. Co., 244 N.Y. 84, 95, 155 N.E. 58, 61, 50 A.L.R. 599; United States v. Milwaukee Refrigerator Transit Co., C.C., 142 F. 247. See Powell, Parent & Subsidiary Corporations (1931) pp. 77-81. The cases of fraud make up part of that exception. Linn & Lane Timber Co. v. United States, \n236 \nU.S. 574\n, 35 S.Ct. 440; Rice v. Sanger, 27 Ariz. 15, 229 P. 397; Donovan v. Purtell, 216 Ill. 629, 640, 75 N.E. 334, 1 L.R.A.,N.S., 176; George v. Rollins, 176 Mich. 144, 142 N.W. 337; Higgins v. California, P. & A. Co., 147 Cal. 363, 81 P. 1070. But they do not exhaust it. An obvious inadequacy of capital, measured by the nature and magnitude of the corporate undertaking, has frequently been an important factor in cases denying stockholders their defense of limited liability. Luckenbach S.S. Co. v. W. R. Grace & Co., 4 Cir., 267 F. 676, 681; Oriental Inv. Co. v. Barclay, 25 Tex.Civ.App. 543, 559, 64 S.W. 80, 88. And see Weisser v. Mursam Shoe Corp., 2 Cir., 127 F.2d 344. Cf. Pepper v. Litton, \n308 \nU.S. 295, 310\n, 60 S.Ct. 238, 246; Albert Richards Co. v. Mayfair, Inc., 287 Mass. 280, 288, 191 N.E. 430; Erickson v. Minnesota & Ontario Power Co., 134 Minn. 209, 158 N.W. 979. That rule has been invoked even in absence of a legislative policy which undercapitalization would defeat. It becomes more important in a situation such as the present one where the statutory policy of double liability will be defeated if impecunious bank- stock holding companies are allowed to be interposed as non-conductors of liability. It has often \n\n[321 \nU.S. 349, 363]\n\u00a0\n been held that the interposition of a corporation will not be allowed to defeat a legislative policy, whether that was the aim or only the result of the arrangement. United States v. Lehigh Valley R. Co., \n220 \nU.S. 257\n, 31 S.Ct. 387; Chicago, M. & St. p. Ry. Co. v. Minneapolis Civic & Commerce Assoc., \n247 \nU.S. 490\n, 38 S.Ct. 553; United States v. Reading Co., \n253 \nU.S. 26\n, 40 S.Ct. 425. The Court stated in Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry. Co. v. Minneapolis Civic & Commerce Ass'n, supra, 247 U.S. page 501, 38 S.Ct. page 557, that 'the courts will not permit themselves to be blinded or deceived by mere forms of law' but will deal 'with the substance of the transaction involved as if the corporate agency did not exist and as the justice of the case may require.' We are dealing here with a principle of liability which is concerned with realities not forms. As we have said, the net practical effect of the organization and management of Banco was the same as though the shares of the Bank were held in trust for beneficiaries who were in point of substance its only owners. Those who acquired shares of Banco did not enter upon an enterprise distinct from the banking business. Their investment in Banco was in substance little more than an investment in the shares of the Bank. They were as much in the banking business as any stockholder of the Bank had ever been. And they continued in that business through Banco which as a going concern lacked assets adequate as a reserve against the contingent statutory liability. Its stockholders were in point of substance the only source of funds available to satisfy the assessments. For these reasons the old group of stockholders must be held to have retained and the new group of stockholders must be held to have acquired liability as stockholders of the Bank.\n To allow this holding company device to succeed would be to put the policy of double liability at the mercy of corporation finance. The fact that Congress did not outlaw holding companies from the national bank field nor undertake to regulate them during the period of Banco's \n\n[321 \nU.S. 349, 364]\n\u00a0\n existence can hardly imply that Congress sanctioned their use to defeat the policy of double liability. It is true that Congress later addressed itself to this problem and in the Banking Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 186, 12 U. S.C.  61, 12 U.S.C.A.  61, established certain controls over them. In general, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System was authorized to issue a voting permit entitling a holding company to vote the stock controlled by it on certain conditions. Apart from requirements for examination and non-affiliation with securities companies, s 19(a) and ( e), certain standards for financial responsibility were established and holding companies seeking such permits were granted a specified period of time within which to meet those standards. Where the stockholders of the holding company were liable for the statutory liability, a specified reserve of readily marketable assets was required.  19(c). Otherwise, the holding company was required to maintain free of any lien 'readily marketable assets other than bank stock' in an amount equal to a larger percentage of the par value of the bank stocks owned.  19(b). It is apparent that Congress in that Act protected its policy of double liability by prescribing one standard of financial responsibility for holding companies whose shares were assessable by their terms and another for those whose shares were non-assessable. \n11\n We need not stop to consider what would be the measure of liability in cases arising under that Act where there had been no compliance with it. But if that Act had been \n\n[321 \nU.S. 349, 365]\n\u00a0\n applicable to Banco and Banco had complied with it, Banco would then have met the standards of financial responsibility which Congress had prescribed as adequate for the depositors. Yet the fact that Congress later wrote specific standards into the law means no more than a recognition on its part of an evil and a fashioning by it of a specific remedy. It can hardly mean that Congress by its earlier silence had sanctioned the use of the holding company to defeat the protection which it had provided for depositors of national banks. The legislative policy which Congress had long announced was the policy of double liability. It is that policy with which we are here concerned. It is that policy, declared by Congress, which the judicial power may appropriately protect in the way we have indicated, in absence of a choice by Congress of another method.\n It is of course true that Delaware created this corporation. But the question of liability for these assessments is a federal question. The policy underlying a federal statute may not be defeated by such an assertion of state power. Northern Securities Co. v. United States, \n193 \nU.S. 197, 349\n, 24 S.Ct. 436, 461; Seabury v. Green, supra. The spectre of unlimited liability for stockholders has been raised. But there is no cause for alarm. Barring conflicting federal incorporation statutes, Delaware may choose such rules of limitation on the liability of stockholders of her corporations as she desires. And those laws are enforceable in federal courts under the rule of Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, \n304 \nU.S. 64\n, 58 S.Ct. 817, 114 A.L.R. 1487. But no State may endow its corporate creatures with the power to place themselves above the Congress of the United States and defeat the federal policy concerning national banks which Congress has announced. We are concerned here with that problem and with that problem alone.\n The result which we reach may be harsh to some of the stockholders of Banco. But rules of liability are usually \n\n[321 \nU.S. 349, 366]\n\u00a0\n harsh especially where they are not bottomed on fault. Thus private investors have frequently found contrary to their expectation or understanding that they purchased with their investment an unlimited liability for the debts of the enterprise. Thompson v. Schmitt, 115 Tex. 53, 274 S.W. 554; Frost v. Thompson, 219 Mass. 360, 106 N.E. 1009; Weber Engine Co. v. Alter, 120 Kan. 557, 245 P. 143, 46 A.L.R. 158; Rand v. Morse, 8 Cir., 289 F. 339. It has never been supposed, however, that the innocence and good faith of investors were barriers to such suits. Horgan v. Morgan, 233 Mass. 381, 385, 124 N.E. 32. Nor can we accede to the suggestion that those defenses should be available here. The policy underlying double liability is an exacting one. Its defeat cannot be encouraged through the utilization of financial devices which put a premium on ignorance.\n The suggestion that there should be no liability without fault unless a statute establishes it denies the whole history of the judicial process in shaping the rules of vicarious liability. The liability of a master for the torts of his servant certainly started from no such foundation. And the rules which made those who purchased shares in Massachusetts business trusts responsible for the debts of the enterprise were evolved, with few exceptions, on a common law, not a statutory, basis. Magruder, The Position of Shareholders in Business Trusts, 23 Col.L.Rev. 423. In the field in which we are presently concerned, judicial power hardly oversteps the bounds when it refuses to lend its aid to a promotional project which would circumvent or undermine a legislative policy. To deny it that function would be to make it impotent in situations where historically it has made some of its most notable contributions. If the judicial power is helpless to protect a legislative program from schemes for easy avoidance, then indeed it has become a handy implement of high finance. Judicial interference to cripple or defeat a legislative policy is one thing; judicial interference with \n\n[321 \nU.S. 349, 367]\n\u00a0\n the plans of those whose corporate or other devices would circumvent that policy is quite another. Once the purpose or effect of the scheme is clear, once the legislative policy is plain, we would indeed forsake a great tradition to say we were helpless to fashion the instruments for appropriate relief.\n In summary, we see no difference between the various classes of stockholders of Banco which would support a difference in their liability. Those who purchased stock of Banco for cash were as much participants in the banking business as those who acquired their stock in exchange for shares of the Bank. Together they shared the benefits of ownership of the subsidiary banks, including control. Certainly a sale of shares of Banco by the old stockholders of the Bank did not give those shares an immunity bath. To draw distinctions between the classes of stockholders of Banco would be to make the protection afforded by these statutes turn on accidents of acquisition quite irrelevant to the concept of 'stockholders' or 'shareholders' on whom Congress placed this liability. One simple illustration will make that plain. A purchases shares of an underlying bank for $10,000 in cash and exchanges those shares for shares of Banco. B hands over to Banco $10,000, Banco purchases the shares of the underlying bank, and then issues its shares to B. From the practical point of view A and B are investors of the same class. To say that A is liable and B not liable when both start with cash and end with identical investments is to make the difference between liability and no liability turn on distinctions which have no apparent relevancy to the legislative policy which the rule of double liability was designed to protect. And to say that courts may hold A liable but not B is to make the occasions for the assertion of judicial power turn on whimsical circumstances.\n The final suggestion is that the old stockholders of the Bank remain liable for the full assessment on the shares \n\n[321 \nU.S. 349, 368]\n\u00a0\n of the Bank which they exchanged for shares of Banco. But that overlooks the fact that their interest in those underlying shares was diluted by the issuance of Banco's shares to others. 12 Double liability is an incidence of ownership. It has long been held that a stockholder who in good faith parts with all his interest in the shares rids himself of that double liability, even though his transferee is not responsible. Earle v. Carson, supra. We could hardly adhere to that principle and still hold the old stockholders of the Bank liable for the full assessment on the shares which they exchanged for shares of Banco. The other stockholders of Banco acquired through their investment in it an interest in the shares of the Bank. To the extent of that interest the beneficial ownership of the old stockholders of the Bank in its shares was as definitely reduced as if they had made a transfer of that part of their holdings.\n Certain stockholders of Banco claim that they are entitled to rescind their purchases of Banco's shares because of misrepresentations made to them when they acquired the shares. We do not reach those questions. Nor do we stop to determine whether such a defense would avoid liability on the assessment (cf. Oppenheimer v. Harriman Nat. Bank & Trust Co., \n301 \nU.S. 206\n, 57 S.Ct. 719) and, unlike the case where some shareholders are insolvent (United States v. Knox, \n102 \nU.S. 422\n, 425), increase the pro rata liability of the other shareholders of Banco. It is sufficient at this time to state that the liability of the shareholders of Banco would be measured by the number of \n\n[321 \nU.S. 349, 369]\n\u00a0\n shares of stock of the Bank, whether several or only fractional, represented by each share of stock of Banco; and that the assessment liability of each share of stock of Banco would be a like proportion of the assessment liability of the shares of the Bank represented by the former.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded to the District Court for proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice JACKSON, dissenting.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS, Mr. Justice REED, Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER, and I find ourselves unable to join in the judgment of the Court.\n The Court accepts concurrent findings of fact by the two lower courts, but reverses their concurrent judgment. It holds that the findings establish liability as matter of law on two very different kinds of stockholdings: (1) holding company stock taken in exchange for double liability stock of the National Bank of Kentucky; and (2) holding company stock bought and fully paid for in cash. We think holders of the latter are not liable on any principle heretofore known to the law and that if owners of the former are to be held it must be on a quite different principle than that stated by the Court.\n\n\n I.\n\n\n Former National Bank of Kentucky stockholders had stock in the Bank itself which carried double liability. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[321 \nU.S. 349, 370]\n\u00a0\n The Bank failed November 30, 1930, and if they had then held that stock, each would have been liable for assessment upon his shares. The aggregate assessment was $4,000,000. Only about a year before the failure, on September 19, 1929, this double-liability bank stock was exchanged for shares of the holding company purporting to be fully paid and nonassessable. At the same time Bank of Kentucky stockholders also bought additional holding company stock for cash to the amount of $4,471,950. Bank of Kentucky stockholders as a group thus paid into the holding company cash morethan sufficient to meet the assessment now levied. In addition to that, investors who were not connected with the Bank bought shares for cash amounting to $5,397,000. The Court nevertheless holds that the Bank of Kentucky stockholders contravened the policy of the law and are subject to the double liability because they 'did not constitute Banco as an adequate financial substitute in their stead.' We do not see how such a statement of fact, and it certainly is not a matter of law, can be conformable with acceptance of the findings of fact of the courts below. Nor are we able to reconcile the view that 'the old group of stockholders must be held to have retained ... the liability as stockholders of the bank' with the one later expressed that their interest was 'diluted' so as to give them a pro rata reduc- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 349, 371]\n\u00a0\n tion of liability. (See note 12 of the opinion of the Court.) (Emphasis supplied.) It seems to us that the transfer of their bank stock to the holding company either was valid, in which case it relieved of all liability; or it was invalid, in which case it relieved of no liability. The doctrine that a transfer may be good enough to dilute liability but bad enough to carry along a part of it is new to us and we have difficulty grasping its implications.\n We are, however, agreed that it would be a proper use of the power of this Court for it to examine the evidence that lies back of these findings and determine whether clear error has been committed and whether the conditions disclosed are such that a bona fide transfer of the stock took place sufficient to shake off double-liability obligations.\n In spite of the exchange of National Bank of Kentucky stock, its stockholders through the holding company kept both a large measure of control of the Bank and the benefits of investment in it. They, or those acting in their behalf, had determined the policy of the holding company, had sponsored its representatives, and had selected its officers and personnel, including the manager who proved to be false to his trust. There is evidence that the National Bank of Kentucky had for some time been under criticism by the Comptroller for many of its loans and some of its policies, although it is found not to have been insolvent. The exchange did not consist of individual acts but was a concerted movement, planned by the Bank management, by which the holding company absorbed all of the stockholdings and all of the double liability.\n The Court might properly, if examination of the evidence should warrant it, reach a legal conclusion that the double liability of the stockholders of the National Bank of Kentucky survives the exchange and that those who have continued their interest in the Bank through the holding company are liable upon assessment in the same manner and to the extent that they would have been had \n\n[321 \nU.S. 349, 372]\n\u00a0\n the holding company transactions never occurred. But this would be because the formal transfer of the stock out of their own names would not be recognized as a defense. The Court's conclusion rests on a quite different theory. It concludes that the transfer was valid to relieve these stockholders of their liability as stockholders of the Bank, but that they became subject to a new and smaller liability as stockholders of a holding company. With this we cannot agree. The holding company, its financing, its management, and all that relates to it constitute relevant material as to whether under principles that have long been recognized the transfer is good. We do not think they create a new liability.\n\n\n II.\n\n\n After holding that former owners of National Bank of Kentucky shares are liable because they did not find an adequate substitute for their own personal liability, the Court proceeds to hold purchasers of holding- company stock for cash to be under a substituted liability pro tanto. The grounds upon which Bank of Kentucky stockholders and non-Bank of Kentucky stockholders are both held seem to conflict. If the new stockholders for cash are liable it is hard to see why the old ones have not found a substitute, and if the Bank of Kentucky stockholders have not found a substitute, it is difficult to see a basis on which the new stockholders are liable.\n Stock purchasers for cash have at no time owned a stock that purported to carry double liability. On the contrary, by the terms of the stock certificates and by the law of the corporation's being, their shares were fully paid and nonassessable. These stockholders cannot be said in any way to have assumed any express or implied contractual assessment liability. No statute of the United States and no applicable state statute then or since has purported to impose a double liability upon these holding-company shares. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 349, 373]\n\u00a0\n No controlling precedent in this Court at the time these stockholders purchased or since (until today) purported to attach a double liability to such shares. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[321 \nU.S. 349, 374]\n\u00a0\n The reason given for this decision is that 'the interposition of a corporation will not be allowed to defeat a legislative policy' and that 'no State may endow its corporate creatures with the power to place themselves above the Congress of the United States and defeat the federal policy \n\n[321 \nU.S. 349, 375]\n\u00a0\n concerning national banks which Congress has announced.' (Italics supplied.)\n We have been unable to find that Congress ever has announced a legislative policy such as the Court announces. And the Court nowhere points it out. The National Banking Act applicable at the time provided that the stockholders 'of every national banking association' shall be under assessment liability. But Congress nowhere has said that the stockholders of a corporation that is not a national banking association shall be liable to assessment because the latter corporation held some or all of the stock of a national bank. Indeed, the history of banking legislation shows that Congress has considered the problems created by the holding company and not only has failed to adopt such a policy as the Court is declaring, but has made other provisions inconsistent with such a policy.\n No legislation on the subject appears until 1933, when Congress enacted detailed regulation of the relations between holding companies and national banks. It required the holding company to obtain a permit to vote national bank shares and empowered the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to grant or withhold the permit. \n3\n No permit can be granted except upon certain \n\n[321 \nU.S. 349, 376]\n\u00a0\n conditions, and assumption by holding-company stockholders of an assessment liability is not among them. In general, they are (a) that the holding company must submit to examination in the same manner as the national bank and must publish periodic statements of condition; (b) that after five years from the statute's enactment, each holding company must possess readily marketable assets and free assets other than bank stock in a pre- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 349, 377]\n\u00a0\n scribed amount; and (c) that after five years a holding company whose stockholders or members are individually and severally liable may be relieved of establishing a part of this reserve under certain circumstances. Congress was informed that some bank stock holding corporations were, by the law of the states in which they were incorporated, subject to double liability just as were stockholders of banks. It was also informed that other bank holding \n\n[321 \nU.S. 349, 378]\n\u00a0\n corporations by the law of their incorporation were not so liable. \n4\n It did not expressly or by implication recognize or create a uniform double liability by federal act on stockholders of state-created holding companies. It made specific provision, on the contrary, for each class of corporation. Where does this Court get authority to disregard the distinction Congress has thus created and to impose a single rule of its own making instead? When Congress has expressly set up a standard of diversification \n\n[321 \nU.S. 349, 379]\n\u00a0\n for holding company assets and has given the companies five years to meet it, from what do we derive authority to say the five-year adjustment period shall be ignored? How can we say retroactively that there is a liability for failure to do before Congress acted something which, after it did act, it expressly gave five years to do? And how can such a result be said to be an enforcement of congressional policy, which we understand to be the basis of the Court's opinion?\n\n\n III.\n\n\n If to legislate were the province of this Court, we would be at liberty candidly to exercise discretion toward the \n\n[321 \nU.S. 349, 380]\n\u00a0\n undoing of the holding company. Some of us feel that as utilized in this country it is, with a few exceptions, a menace to responsible management and to sound finance, shifting control of local institutions to absentee managements and centralizing in few hands control of assets and enterprises bigger than they are able well to manage-views which are matters of record. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n But we are of one opinion that no such latitude is confided to judges as here is exercised. We are dealing with a variety of liability without fault. The Court is professing to impose it, not as a matter of judge-made law, but as a matter of legislative policy, and it cannot cite so much as a statutory hint of such a policy. The Court is not enforcing a policy of Congress; it is competing with Congress in creating new regulations in banking, a field peculiarly within legislative rather than judicial competence. Nor was such a policy of assessment liability one whose importance was so transcending as to set aside the policy of permitting corporate enterprise under limited liability. Congress has since repealed the double liability, even of holders of stock in national banks;6 and when in force, it had little practical value to depositors. \n7\n States also have \n\n[321 \nU.S. 349, 381]\n\u00a0\n abandoned the assessment plan. \n8\n Courts should, of course, see that the congressional policy is not defeated by any fraud, by creating sham corporations, or by any other artifice. When, however, assessment liability is a failure only because the corporate owner of the stock is not solvent, that is not a circumstance which will warrant disregard of the corporate entity so as to render stockholders liable. The findings here, accepted by the Court, eliminate every charge of fraud, bad faith, or intentional evasion of liability. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n We are fully agreed that Bank of Kentucky depositors, however, should not be prejudiced by a transfer to the holding company of its stock in violation of letter or spirit \n\n[321 \nU.S. 349, 382]\n\u00a0\n of the National Banking Act. If the case warrants disregard of the transfer, the depositors then would have just the protection that they would have enjoyed had no holding company intervened. The Court, however, makes the holding company a windfall to bank creditors by extending the liability to persons never otherwise reachable. We may disallow the holding company as a sanctuary for stockholders escaping pre-existing liability without making of it a trap for unwary and unwarned investors.\n To disregard the transfer of this stock, and to hold former stockholders liable to the same extent as if they had made no such transfer, is the manner or proceeding indicated under proper circumstances by the National Banking Act itself. Instead of considering whether to disregard the transfer the Court disregards the corporate entity of the holding company because it says these obligations arise from legislative policy. Even if we could find such a policy, legislative liabilities are numerous. It is probably a legislative policy that a corporation shall pay all of its debts. The reasoning employed by the Court, we should think, would leave it uncertain whether stockholders may not be liable for many other types of indebtedness. Congress, if the matter of banking reform were left to it, could define the limits of vicarious liability at the time it was imposed. The Court is leaving the limits and extent of that liability so vague that a whole cluster of decisions will have to be written to clarify what is being done today. And meanwhile we know of no way that a stockholder can learn the extent and circumstances of stockholder liability except to give his name to a leading case. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n The Court admits that the judgment is 'harsh.' Why is it so if it is according to any law that was known or \n\n[321 \nU.S. 349, 383]\n\u00a0\n knowable at the time of the transactions? To enforce a double liability so incurred would be no harsher than to enforce any contract obligation that had been assumed without expecting it would result in liability. This decision is made harsh by the element of surprise. \n11\n Its only harshness is that which comes of the Court's doing with backwards effect what Congress has not seen fit to do with forward effect. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Further details concerning the financial transactions indirectly involved in this litigation may be found in Atherton v. Anderson, 6 Cir., 86 F.2d 518; Id., 6 Cir., 99 F.2d 883; Banco Kentucky's Receiver v. Louisville Trust Co's Receiver, 263 Ky. 155, 92 S.W.2d 19. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The shares of the Bank and the Trust Company had been earlier transferred to trustees who issued Trustees' Participation Certificates. It was these certificates which Banco received from the shareholders of the two banks in exchange for its shares. The command which Banco had over the underlying shares is described in Laurent v. Anderson, 6 Cir., 70 F.2d 819. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See Ky.Rev.Stat.1942,  287.360; Ohio Code Ann.1940,  710-75. At or about the time of Banco's failure the shares in the other banks were sold or disposed of at rather nominal prices. It appears that the closing of the Bank was followed by heavy runs on these other banks; and the local interests in most of the cities where the banks were located were willing to support the banks to keep them open if Banco would surrender control. Banco, it seems, was also anxious to avoid double liability on those shares. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] The president of Banco was also president of the Bank. This note was acquired in November, 1929, from Wakefield & Co. It was secured by 60, 000 shares of Banco stock and 22,500 shares of stock of Standard Oil of Kentucky. Nothing was ever paid on the note. Nothing was realized on the Banco stock. Some $440,000 was realized on the Standard Oil stock. In December 1930 the president of Banco and maker of the note filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy. He was discharged. Wakefield & Co. made an assignment for the benefit of creditors in 1931 and apparently no dividends have yet been paid its creditors. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] These were a Murray Rubber note in the amount of $580,000 and a note of Lewis C. Humphrey for $20,000-of which the bank examiner had been quite critical for some time. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Provisions for the termination of double liability on shares of national banks are contained in the Act of June 16, 1933, 48 Stat. 189, and the Act of August 23, 1935, 49 Stat. 708, 12 U.S.C.  64a, 12 U.S.C.A .  64a. \n[\nFootnote 7\n] It is true that the court in Laurent v. Anderson, supra, stated that Banco was 'in every sense the true and beneficial owner' of the shares of the Bank. 70 F.2d page 824. But it is apparent from the opinion that the court was answering the contention that the trustees of the participation certificates were responsible for the assessment. Banco's defense was based on  63 of the National Bank Act. It argued that under that section only funds in the hands of the trustees were liable. That argument was rejected by the court. \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] The history of bank-stock holding companies shows that their organizers were acutely aware of this problem and at times took steps to protect the depositors of the subsidiary banks on possible assessments on the bank stocks. One holding company is said to have kept 'at all times an amount in cash or its equivalent equal to our aggregate stockholders' liability on the bank stocks owned by us.' Branch, Chain and Group Banking, Hearings under H. Res. 141, 71st Cong., 2d Sess.(1930) p. 1181. A similar method was for the holding company 'to carry in its treasury a large reserve of readily marketable securities which may be liquidated in order to make good any shareholders' liability that may be imposed upon the holding company.' Bonbright & Means, The Holding Company (1932), p. 331. Cf. Nineteenth Annual Report, Superintendent of Banks of California (1928), p. 21. Another method of safeguarding the depositors was to make express provision in the charter of the holding company that its stockholders were ratably liable for any statutory liability imposed on it by reason of its ownership of bank stocks. Branch, Chain, and Group Banking, op. cit., pp. 1042-1043; Barbour v. Thomas, 6 Cir., 86 F.2d 510, 513, 514. Wisconsin provided for such a liability by statute. Wis.Stat.1941,  221.56. \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] 'The BancoKentucky Company was organized under the laws of the State of Delaware on July 16, 1929, with an authorized capital of 2,000, 000 shares of $10 par value. The Company was organized for the purpose of owning a controlling interest in state and national banks located primarily in Kentucky, Ohio and Indiana. Its charter gives it broad powers entitling it to engage in a wide range of investment and other activities.\n'The BancoKentucky Company has acquired, through an exchange of stock, nearly 100% of the shares of the National Bank of Kentucky-Louisville Trust Company, and in addition its stockholders have subscribed to 480,000 shares of its stock for cash. This cash will be used for acquiring majority interests in other banks and for other corporate purposes.'\n\n In listing its shares on the Chicago Stock Exchange it gave the Exchange the following description of its business:\n'(b) Primary purpose: To acquire control and operate Banks and Trust Companies.\n\n'(c) Nature of Business: This company has not engaged in the business of investing and reinvesting in a diversified list of securities of other corporations for revenue and profit, but has limited its activities to acquiring control of Banks and Trust Companies and the operation of same.' \n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] Thus a circular of Blyth & Co. stated:\n'The Banco Kentucky Company was recently formed to acquire and hold controlling interests in commercial banks throughout the Middle West. By charter, broad powers are conferred upon the Company, so that all types of operations in the financial field are permitted but no investments are contemplated other than controlling interests in financial institutions.\n\n'Upon completion of present transactions the Company will control the National Bank of Kentucky, organized in 1834, the Louisville National Bank and Trust Co., organized 1884 as Louisville Trust Company, both of Louisville, Ky., the Pearl Market Bank & Trust Co., organized 1907, and the Brighton Bank & Trust Co., organized 1898, both of Cincinnati, Ohio, and the Central Savings Bank and Trust Company, organized 1906, of Covington, Ky. In addition, the Company has funds of approximately $6,000, 000, which are expected to be used for the acquiring of additional banking institutions.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] As stated in S. Rep. No. 77, 73d Cong., 1st Sess., p. 11: 'The affiliates of this type (holding companies) are prohibited from voting the stocks of national banks unless they are willing to undertake to accept examination by the Federal Reserve Board, divest themselves of ownership of stock and bond financing concerns, and comply with regulations designed to insure their ownership of sufficient free assets to make sure that they can satisfy the double liability of their shareholders in case any of the banks owned by such a company should go into the hands of receivers or be closed.' \n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] The old stockholders of the Bank have a lesser interest in the shares of the Bank than they had prior to the exchange. Their interest in the shares of the Bank decreased proportionately with the increase in the outstanding stock of Banco. That resulted in a pro rata reduction in their liability. The other group of stockholders of Banco acquired that portion of the liability of which the old stockholders of the Bank were relieved. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The pertinent sections of the Bank Act follow:\n'The shareholders of every national banking association shall be held individually responsible ... for all contracts, debts, and engagements of such association, to the extent of the amount of their stock therein, at the par value thereof, in addition to the amount invested in such shares; ....' 12 U.S.C.  63, 12 U.S.C.A.  63.\n\n'The stockholders of every national banking association shall be held individually responsible for all contracts, debts, and engagements of such association, each to the amount of his stock therein, at the par value thereof in addition to the amount invested in such stock. The stockholders in any national banking association who shall have transferred their shares or registered the transfer thereof within sixty days next before the date of the failure of such association to meet its obligations, or with knowledge of such impending failure, shall be liable to the same extent as if they had made no such transfer, to the extent that the subsequent transferee fails to meet such liability; but this provision shall not be construed to affect in any way any recourse which such shareholders might otherwise have against those in whose names such shares are registered at the time of such failure.' 12 U.S.C.  64, 12 U.S.C.A.  64. \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The authorities cited to support the Court's disregard of the corporate entity fall far short of persuasion. The quotation of the statement by Mr. Chief Judge Cardozo from Berkey v. Third Avenue Railway Co., 244 N.Y. 84, 155 N.E. 58, 61, 50 A.L.R. 599, 'that a surrender of that principle of limited liability would be made 'when the sacrifice is so essential to the end that some accepted public policy may be defended or upheld\" has a very different significance in its context. The facts, including interchangeable names of parent and subsidiary, complete financial and operating domination, and use of one company's assets by the other, indicated a stronger case for disregard of the corporate fiction than do the findings here. Nevertheless, Chief Judge Cardozo considered that the corporate entity could not be disregarded in favor of a tort claimant and said: 'In such circumstances, we thwart the public policy of the state instead of defending or upholding it, when we ignore the separation between subsidiary and parent and treat the two as one.' \n Other cases cited afford no more support for the decision. United States v. Milwaukee Refrigerator Transit Co., C.C., 142 F. 247, held that payments by a carrier to a corporation wholly controlled by a shipper might constitute rebates under the Elkins Act, 49 U.S.C.A.  41 et seq. The statements in Powell, Parent & Subsidiary Corporations, 77-81, are completely general and to be read in the light of the specific categories which precede the page citation, all of which involve active wrong by a parent corporation. Linn & Lane Timber Co. v. United States, \n236 \nU.S. 574\n, 35 S.Ct. 440, involved the question whether an 'instrumentality' corporation could acquire rights which would enable it to stand better than its transferor-creator. Rice v. Sanger Bros., 27 Ariz. 15, 229 P. 397, found a corporation to be organized for fraudulent purposes and the former partners who became its stockholders were held liable. Donovan v. Purtell, 216 Ill. 629, 75 N.E. 334, 1 L.R.A., N.S., 176, holds nothing more than that an officer of a corporation who is personally guilty of fraud will be held liable therefor. George v. Rollins, 176 Mich. 144, 142 N.W. 337, stands for the proposition that equity will enforce a restrictive covenant against a successor corporation formed for the purpose of evading it. Higgins v. California Petroleum Co., 147 Cal. 363, 81 P. 1070, held that in the circumstances certain successor corporations assumed a lease and therefore had to pay royalties; there was no disregarding of the corporate entity involved. Luckenbach S.S. Co. v. W. R. Grace & Co., 4 Cir., 267 F. 676, comes nearer the mark, but still is far wide of it. A steamship corporation leased its fleet of vessels to a $10, 000 corporation, formed and 90 per cent owned by it, for an utterly inadequate rental. It was held that this turning over of the corporation's ships to a subsidiary which was 'itself in another form' rendered the parent corporation liable for the subsidiary's breach of contract. Oriental Investment Co. v. Barclay, 25 Tex.Civ.App. 543, 64 S.W. 80, allowed a hotel employee to recover for personal injuries against the parent holding company, even though technically he was the employee of the subsidiary operating company, of whose existence he was unaware and which had been capitalized with $2,000 to operate a property whose monthly rental alone was $1500. Weisser v. Mursam Shoe Corp., 2 Cir., 127 F.2d 344, 346, arose on dismissal of the complaint and it was held that on a full trial it might be found that the subsidiary was 'only a tool of the other defendants, deliberately kept judgment proof, to obtain the benefits of a lease with plaintiffs without assuming any obligations. The plaintiffs allege that this was done fraudulently ....' Pepper v. Litton, \n308 \nU.S. 295\n, 60 S.Ct. 238, and Albert Richards Co. v. Mayfair, Inc., 287 Mass. 280, 191 N.E. 430, both dealt with cases where parent corporations claimed priority over other creditors of a subsidiary; in each the subsidiary was held to be an instrumentality of the parent and, to avoid a fraud on creditors, the latter's claim of priority was denied. In Erickson v. Minnesota & .ontario Power Co., 134 Minn. 209, 158 N.W. 979, a parent corporation was held liable for damage caused by a dam owned by a subsidiary; the parent paid the operating expenses of the dam, took all the earnings of the subsidiary, had a mortgage on all its assets, and in addition had a direct right of control over the operation of the dam. United States v. Lehigh Valley Railroad, \n220 \nU.S. 257\n, 31 S.Ct. 387, and United States v. Reading Co., \n253 \nU.S. 26\n, 40 S.Ct. 425, held that a railroad's exercise of its power as a stockholder might amount to such a commingling of affairs as to make it liable for a violation of the commodities clause. Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry. Co. v. Minneapolis Civic Association, \n247 \nU.S. 490\n, 38 S.Ct. 553, held that additional terminal charges made by a wholly owned subsidiary as compared with terminal charges by the parent might be held to constitute a discrimination. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n]  19 of the Banking Act of 1933, amending  5144 of the Revised Statutes, provides in part as follows:\n'... shares controlled by any holding company affiliate of a national bank shall not be voted unless such holding company affiliate shall have first obtained a voting permit as hereinafter provided, which permit is in force at the time such shares are voted.\n\n'For the purposes of this section shares shall be deemed to be controlled by a holding company affiliate if they are owned or controlled directly or indirectly by such holding company affiliate, or held by any trustee for the benefit of the shareholders or members thereof.\n\n'Any such holding company affiliate may make application to the Federal Reserve Board for a voting permit entitling it to cast one vote at all elections of directors and in deciding all questions at meetings of shareholders of such bank on each share of stock controlled by it or authorizing the trustee or trustees holding the stock for its benefit or for the benefit of its shareholders so to vote the same. The Federal Reserve Board may, in its discretion, grant or withhold such permit as the public interest may require. In acting upon such application, the Board shall consider the financial condition of the applicant, the general character of its management, and the probable effect of the granting of such permit upon the affairs of such bank, but no such permit shall be granted except upon the following conditions: \n\n'(a) Every such holding company affiliate shall, in making the application for such permit, agree (1) to receive, on dates identical with those fixed for the examination of banks with which it is affiliated, examiners duly authorized to examine such banks, who shall make such examinations of such holding company affiliate as shall be necessary to disclose fully the relations between such banks and such holding company affiliate and the effect of such relations upon the affairs of such banks, such examinations to be at the expense of the holding company affiliate so examined; (2) that the reports of such examiners shall contain such information as shall be necessary to disclose fully the relations between such affiliate and such banks and the effect of such relations upon the affairs of such banks; (3) that such examiners may examine each bank owned or controlled by the holding company affiliate, both individually and in conjunction with other banks owned or controlled by such holding company affiliate; and (4) that publication of individual or consolidated statements of condition of such banks may be required;\n\n'(b) After five years after the enactment of the Banking Act of 1933, every such holding company affiliate (1) shall possess, and shall continue to possess during the life of such permit, free and clear of any lien, pledge, or hypothecation of any nature, readily marketable assets other than bank stock in an amount not less than 12 per centum of the aggregate par value of all bank stocks controlled by such holding company affiliate, which amount shall be increased by not less than 2 per centum per annum of such aggregate par value until such assets shall amount to 25 per centum of the aggregate par value of such bank stocks; and (2) shall reinvest in readily marketable assets other than bank stock all net earnings over and above 6 per centum per annum on the book value of its own shares outstanding until such assets shall amount to such 25 per centum of the aggregate par value of all bank stocks controlled by it;\n\n'(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, after five years after the enactment of the Banking Act of 1933, (1) any such holding company affiliate the shareholders or members of which shall be individually and severally liable in proportion to the number of shares of such holding company affiliate held by them respectively, in addition to amounts invested therein, for all statutory liability imposed on such holding company affiliate by reason of its control of shares of stock of banks, shall be required only to establish and maintain out of net earnings over and above 6 per centum per annum on the book value of its own shares outstanding a reserve of readily marketable assets in an amount of not less than 12 per centum of the aggregate par value of bank stocks controlled by it, and (2) the assets required by this section to be possessed by such holding company affiliate may be used by it for replacement of capital in banks affiliated with it and for losses incurred in such banks, but any deficiency in such assets resulting from such use shall be made up within such period as the Federal Reserve Board may by regulation prescribe. ...' June 16, 1933, c. 89, 48 Stat. 186, 187. \n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] At the Senate hearings which preceded the Banking Act of 1933, Mr. L. E. Wakefield, vice-president of one of the largest bank holding companies, testified as follows with respect to double liability:\n'Mr. Wakefield. The stockholders of the First Bank Stock Corporation, being a Delaware corporation, do not have a double liability. When we started to organize this institution we did all the work on the theory we would have it a Minnesota corporation, which would have double liability. At the last minute, when we found that every stockholder in North Dakota, South Dakota, and Montana would, in case of death, have a double inheritance tax, they complained so strongly about that situation we shifted and put it into a Delaware corporation.\n\n'The other factor that we have heard discussed and that I think of in connection with banking such as we are doing is this thought in the public mind, or some minds, that, for instance, our being a Delaware corporation was intended to avoid the double liability of stockholders. I would say that if that is of importance it might be easily provided that a holding company should create a surplus account in its holdings or build up a surplus account of some proportion of the capital of the banks that should be kept in liquid securities, or something of that sort. ...' Hearings before Senate Committee on Banking and Currency Pursuant to S. Res. 71, 71st Cong., 3d Sess., Pt. 4, pp. 616, 620.\n\n Earlier, Mr. J. W. Pole, Comptroller of the Currency, had testified:\n'Mr. Pole. We call that a group-banking system in the Northwest. In the case of the Northwest and the First Bank Stock Corporation, I think that their stock is not subject to the double liability, although the stock of some holding corporations is subject to double liability. But in the case of those two corporations, in those particular cases-not that it obtains too generally-they have invested in securities other than bank stocks, so that a judgment against either one of those corporations would be good for the assessment.\n\n'Mr. Willis. In those particular cases? 'Mr. Pole. In those particular cases; yes, sir. 'Mr. Willis. But there are cases where they are not subject to the assessment? 'Mr. Pole. There are cases where they are not subject to the assessment; yes, and where they hold nothing but bank stocks. 'Mr. Willis. In those cases where you have an affiliated bank that buys all the stock of the bank itself, what becomes of the double liability of the shareholder? 'Mr. Pole. The securities company where it buys the stock of the bank itself, would be the holder of the stock and subject to assessment. 'Mr. Willis. Is not the double liability then very largely neutralized? \n\n'Mr. Pole. Yes. 'Mr. Willis. What have you done to correct that? 'Mr. Pole. We have done nothing to correct it. 'Mr. Willis. What can be done by law to correct it? 'Mr. Pole. That is a big problem. 'Mr. Willis. Can you make a recommendation covering that along with your other problems? 'Mr. Pole. Yes.' Senate Hearings, supra, Part 1, pp. 27-28. For a provision extending double liability to holding-company stockholders, see Wisconsin Stat. 1943,  221.56(3). \n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] See 56 Reports of American Bar Association (1931) p. 763; Briefs for Government in Electric Bond & Share Co. v.

June 16, 1933, c. 89,  22, 48 Stat. 189, Aug. 23, 1935, c. 614,  304, 49 Stat. 708, 12 U.S.C.  64a, 12 U.S.C.A.  64a. \n[\nFootnote 7\n] Comptroller Pole stated at the Senate hearings: 'We hear a good deal about double liability. It is not so important as at first one might so regard it. As an illustration, the deposits, we will say, of a bank with $100,000 capital would be ordinarily $1,000,000. If you collected the entire 100 per cent assessment, you would only collect 10 per cent of your deposits after all. ... But in practice you would not collect over 50 per cent of that. We do collect, as a matter of fact, just about 50 per cent.' Hearings, supra note 4, Pt. 1, p. 28.\n Depositors in the bank have already received 77 per cent of their deposits. Few pre-depression investments have yielded so much. About 6,000 stockholders of Banco have lost 100 per cent of their investment, and are now faced with liability in undetermined amounts. As to many of them, it is idle to say that they had actual responsibility for the Bank's management or any better knowledge of its affairs than the depositors. \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Within the last decade at least thirty-one states which formerly had double liability have abolished it either absolutely or upon compliance with certain conditions. Only five states appear to have retained their double liability provisions intact, and in one of these a proposal to abolish it is currently being considered. See 'Stockholders' Double Liability,' Commerce Clearing House State Banking Law Service, Vol. II. \n[\nFootnote 9\n] Findings of the trial court included the following:\n'61. Banco was organized in good faith.\n\n'62. Banco was 'certainly not a sham.'\n\n'63. Banco was 'not organized for a fraudulent purpose or to conceal secret or sinister enterprises conducted for the benefit of the Bank.'\n\n'64. Banco was not a mere holding company.\n\n'65. Banco 'was formed for the purpose set out in the letter of July 19, 1929, and for no other purpose.'\n\n'66. Banco 'was not formed as a medium or agency through which to avoid double liability on the stock of the Bank.\" \n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] This court has considered the disregard of the corporate fiction in Donnell v.

UNITED STATES(1944)\nNo. 463\nArgued: Decided: May 22, 1944\n\n\n\n\n[322 \nU.S. 419, 420]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John W. Preston and Oliver O. Clark, both of Los Angeles, Cal ., for petitioner.\n Mr. Norman MacDonald, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice JACKSON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner Arenas is a full-blood Mission Indian, regularly enrolled in the Agua Caliente or Palm Springs Band. He sued in the United States District Court to be awarded a trust patent to certain lands on the Palm Springs Reservation The Government was granted a summary judgment of dismissal on affidavits and on the record of the St. Marie litigation on like claims by similarly situated Indians. \n1\n No findings have been made in this case by the District Court. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed,2 chiefly in reliance upon its previous decision in the St. Marie case, and we granted certiorari. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n For a long period Congress pursued the policy of imposing, as rapidly as possible, our system of individual land tenure on the Indian. To this end tribal or com- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 419, 421]\n\u00a0\n munal land holdings of the Indians were superseded by allotment to individuals, who were protected against improvidence by restraints on alienation. \n4\n The Mission Indians had deserved well and had fared badly5 and Congress passed the Mission Indian Act of Jan. 12, 18916 for their particular redress.\n The first three sections of this Act set up a commission to settle these several bands on suitable reservations and directed that appropriate patents issue. The United States was to hold the titles in trust, however, for twenty-five years and then was to convey to the tribes any portions not previously patented in severalty to members. Several reservations were set apart, including one at Palm Springs, with which this and the St. Marie case were concerned.\n The Act also provided in  4 that whenever in the opinion of the Secretary of the Interior any of the Indians should 'be so advanced in civilization as to be capable of owning and managing land in severalty, the Secretary of the Interior may cause allotments to be made to such Indians, out of the land of such reservation' and it specified the acreage to be allotted to each. Section 5 provided that on approval of the allotments the Secretary should cause patents to issue in the name of the allottees. For twenty-five years the lands were to remain in trust for their benefit and then were to be conveyed in fee free of the trust. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n[322 \nU.S. 419, 422]\n\u00a0\n Nevertheless, little was done toward allotment in severalty to Mission Indians for nearly twenty-five years. One reason, we father, was that the Act authorized allotment on a more liberal basis than available lands would permit, although there may have been other reasons. In 1916, however, Secretary Lane called the neglect to the attention of Congress and asked that he be authorized to make allotments in quantities governed by the General Allotment Act of 1887, as amended by section 17 of the Act of June 25, 1910, 36 Stat. 859, instead of in those set out in \n\n[322 \nU.S. 419, 423]\n\u00a0\n the Mission Indian Act of 1891. Thereupon Congress passed the Act of March 2, 19178 by which it 'authorized and directed' the Secretary to proceed under the Act of 1910\n\n\n The Secretary on June 7, 1921 appointed Harry E. Wadsworth as Special Allotting Agent at Large for the Mission Indian Reservations of California and instructed him to prepare schedules of selections for allotments thereon. In 1923, Wadsworth filed a schedule showing selections on the Palm Springs Reservation for fifty members of the Band. The Secretary expressly disapproved this schedule. Complaint had come from the Indians, many of whom did not want allotments and had not made the selections listed in their names. When they failed to choose, the allotment agent had made a choice for them. The Secretary instructed Wadsworth to prepare a new schedule listing only selections voluntarily made and to leave off those who did not desire allotments. In 1927, the Department received from Wadsworth a new schedule showing voluntary selections for twenty-four members of the Palm Springs Band.\n Each Indian for whom a selection was listed received from Wadsworth a certificate of selection for allotment. Each was stamped 'Not valid unless approved by the Secretary of the Interior.'\n On October 26, 1923, Wadsworth asked the Indian Department for instructions, reciting, 'Allotments being completed and certificates issued. Many allottees anxious to immediately occupy their selections and prepare things for early crops instead waiting for receipt of patents.' On the same day he received reply, 'No objection to Indians preparing their respective allotment selections for crops if properly listed on schedule.' Wadsworth also wrote to one, at least, of the allottees in the St. Marie case, \n\n[322 \nU.S. 419, 424]\n\u00a0\n saying among other things, 'It is difficult to tell exactly when you may except these patents from Washington but I believe they should be here within 6 weeks or so. They will come to the superintendent in Riverside, who will notify you that they are there and ready for delivery to you. In the meantime, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs in Washington authorizes me to say to you that from this date you are entitled to enter upon and take possession of these allotments, and these certificates will be your evidence of such authority until the trust patents are received by you.'\n Wadsworth filed the schedule with the Department of the Interior. He attached a certificate, among other things reciting 'that the allotments shown hereon were made in accordance with the provisions of the act of Congress of February 8, 1887 as amended by the Act of June 25, 1910 and supplemented by the Act of March 2, 1917.' The General Land Office recommended that the schedule be approved, with exceptions that appear to have no bearing on the case before us.\n But the allotments appear never to have been approved by the Secretary. He refuses to issue patents to which these Indians claim to be entitled. The Government's moving papers contain an affidavit by counsel declaring that the Secretary disapproved the allotments. But it gives no reason, and no order or statement of disapproval by the Secretary is in the record. The Government filed no pleading averring reasons for disapproval or, if disapproval was formal, setting forth the document. On the contrary, counsel seems to have taken the position that as matter of law the Secretary's reasons and the form of his disapproval were not relevant to any question the Court is empowered to decide.\n The power of the Secretary so to refuse patents and the powerlessness of the courts to review the refusal are here maintained on these contentions: 'It rests in the \n\n[322 \nU.S. 419, 425]\n\u00a0\n complete discretion of the Secretary of the Interior whether or not allotments shall be made on the Palm Spring Reservation. Sections 4 and 5 of the Act of January 12, 1891 contemplate three steps in the making of allotments on that reservation: (1) an opinion by the Secretary as to the capacity of the Indians to receive allotments; (2) a method or procedure for making such allotments; and (3) approval of the allotments by the Secretary. Each of these steps is under the control and rests in the discretion of the Secretary.' Upon these grounds the trial court and the Circuit Court of Appeals held that the plaintiffs in the St. Marie cases were not entitled to patents and that this petitioner is not entitled to go to trial.\n\n\n I.\n\n\n The Secretary's Discretion in Determining the Capacity of the Indians to Receive Allotments.\n The Act of 1891 provides that 'whenever any of the Indians residing upon any reservation patented under the provisions of this act shall, in the opinion of the Secretary of the Interior, be so advanced in civilization as to be capable of owning and managing land in severalty, the Secretary of the Interior may cause allotments to be made to such Indians.' (Emphasis supplied.) This undoubtedly conferred a very considerable discretion upon the Secretary.\n The Act of 1917, however, drops the language of discretion and directs the Secretary to cause allotments to be made to the Indians on the Mission reservations. \n9\n The \n\n[322 \nU.S. 419, 426]\n\u00a0\n Act was prepared by the Secretary10 and if it was intended to perpetuate his discretion as to whether the allotment policy was to be applied to these Indians at all, it might easily have so provided. Both the Secretary and Congress appears to have settled that point. The Communication of the Secretary to the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs indicates no reservations about the Secretary's view that the Indians were qualified and that the Department should carry out the allotment policy. It points out certain evils and inequalities among the Indians under the tribal system of land holdings and says, 'This is a condition that cannot be cured entirely until the lands have been allotted in severalty.' And again it says, 'The Department believes that the present conditions, while much better than they were some years ago, would be rapidly improved by allotment in severalty, provided authority to pro rate the available land is given.'\n Following passage of the Act the Secretary set about executing its directions. Wadsworth was appointed General Allotment Agent and was sent to the Indians with instructions to permit them to select their own allotments. When he selected for those who did not choose for themselves, his schedule was disapproved, and only for that reason. He was returned to the task of compiling voluntary selections for those who desired allotments, it being thought that if that were done those who objected 'would soon fall in line and request that they too be given their proportionate share of the allottable areas.' \n11\n There is \n\n[322 \nU.S. 419, 427]\n\u00a0\n no denial that Wadsworth was authorized to hold out to the Indians that their patents would be received in a few weeks and that meanwhile, if not already living on their selected lands, they might enter into possession.\n To assume that the Act of 1917, while directing the Secretary to make allotments, only meant to give him uncontrolled discretion not to do so would be a doubtful construction, in view of its history. But even if it were so interpreted, it did not require the Secretary to manifest his exercise of discretion in any formal way. His opinion that the Indians had the capacity for individual responsibility for land ownership could be indicated by conduct as well as by words. We think his conduct and words amount both to an administrative construction of the 1917 Act as a direction and to the exercise of any discretion he may have had under it.\n If the Indians were not ready for allotments, why send an agent to hold out to them that hope and promise? Why the elaborate procedure of allotment? The Department then sought not only to offer allotment but to proceed so as to make the Indians 'fall in line.' Despite the obvious inference from these acts the record does not counter them by any showing that the Secretary now considers these Indians to lack civilization and capacity, tested by the usual standards for allotment, nor does it show that they do not in fact possess it. History and common knowledge of these Indians would indicate that they are not wanting in whatever it is that makes up 'civilization.' Long ago the Franciscans converted them to Christianity, taught them to subsist by good husbandry and handicrafts. Under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo Feb. 2, 1848, 9 Stat. 922, their ancestral lands and their governance passed from Mexico to the United States. During the gold discovery days they were too gentle to combat the ruthless pressures of the whites and came to lead a precarious and pitiable, but peaceful, existence. Eventually the country was \n\n[322 \nU.S. 419, 428]\n\u00a0\n aroused by their plight and set up a commission to investigate their grievances and to make recommendations for their protection and relief. It reported in 188412 and its recommendations were substantially embodied in the Mission Indian Act of 1891. By the standards of peacefulness, industry, and gentleness these Indians have long been 'civilized.' Even tested by the standard of acquisitiveness, they seem not to have failed. Improvements made by Arenas on the lands he occupied in reliance upon his certificate are valued at $15,000.\n On the record as it now stands we do not think the Government has established the falsity of the allegations of the complaint that the Secretary had made the preliminary decision as to the allotments. We think the issue has been settled, in the absence of further proof to the contrary, by the Act of 1917 and the Secretary's action under it.\n\n\n II.\n\n\n The Secretary's Discretion as to Procedure for Making Such Allotments.\n We do not see that this is much in question nor is much in point, if true. Arenas does not question that the Secretary had discretion to adopt the method of allotment which was followed. He claims that both he and the Department have complied with it, that his choice has been ascertained, the lands have been identified and marked and reported to the Department, and that nothing remains for either to do to perfect the right to a patent. If there has been any irregularity in the procedure to lead to a patent, the Government has not pleaded or evidenced it in the case. We assume the Secretary's complete control of the method and, as the record stands, that his method has \n\n[322 \nU.S. 419, 429]\n\u00a0\n been executed to the point where a patent would issue but for the refusal of the Secretary.\n\n\n III.\n\n\n The Secretary's Discretion as to Final Approval of the Allotments.\n This is the crux of the lawsuit. It is as to this final step that Congress has invested the courts with some responsibility.\n The Act of August 15, 1894, 25 U.S.C.  345, 25 U.S.C.A.  345, authorizes Indians to commence and prosecute actions 'in relation to their right' to land under any allotment act or under any grant made by Congress 'in the proper district court of the United States; and said district courts are given jurisdiction to try and determine any action, suit, or proceeding arising within their respective jurisdictions involving the right of any person, in whole or in part of Indian blood or descent, to any allotment of land under any law or treaty.' It is further provided that 'the judgment or decree of any such court in favor of any claimant to any allotment of land shall have the same effect, when properly certified to the Secretary of the Interior, as if such allotment had been allowed and approved by him. \n13\n\u00a0\n\n[322 \nU.S. 419, 430]\n\u00a0\n Under this statute the courts have decided disputes between Indians and the Government as to the relative qualifications of two claimants to receive, as a member of a band, a patent, Hy-yu-tse-mil-kin v. Smith, \n194 \nU.S. 401\n, 24 S.Ct. 676, and whether particular lands were appropriate for allotment, United States v. Payne, \n264 \nU.S. 446\n, 44 S.Ct. 352.\n But here we do not know from any information developed in the adversary proceedings what the dispute between the Secretary of the Interior and Arenas is about. The Government did not answer the complaint. It foreclosed evidence on the facts by its motion for summary judgment, in which it incorporated the evidence in another proceeding. In that other proceeding no representative of the Government except the local Mission Indian agent and Wadsworth, the former allotment agent, were sworn. There appears to have been no testimony as to what happened to the schedule of allotments after it reached Washington or as to whether it ever was approved or disapproved and, if so, how or by whom or why. The Government's affidavit filed in opposition to the motion recited that the Secretary's records 'reveal that the Secretary of the Interior has disapproved the allotment schedule and certificates of selection.' No entry order or memorandum of disapproval is produced, nor is the date thereof stated.\n Certain facts do appear from which we know that this is no ordinary allotment problem. Each selection here \n\n[322 \nU.S. 419, 431]\n\u00a0\n included three kinds of land: a two-acre town lot, of considerable value; five acres of irrigable land of fair value; and forty acres of desert land. All of the town lots chosen are in Section 14, Township 4, South, Range 4, East. This section contains Palm Springs, a hot mineral spring, from which the reservation derives its name.\n But the reservation itself is a checkerboard affair. At the time of its establishment the odd numbered sections already had been granted to the Southern Pacific Railroad and hence the reservation consisted of only even numbered sections. On the railroad sections the whites have established the settlement known as Palm Springs, a flourishing winter resort with large hotels and the usual business places and residences that characterize such a development. Out of this situation has grown conflict of interest between the Indians and the whites and between Indians themselves. The Indians, to the annoyance of the whites, seek to exploit their ownership of the springs, and the whites are accused, not without probable cause, of coveting the Indians' property rights therein. Those among both races who favor allotment allege that the denial of patents is designed to serve the white interests in Palm Springs by leasing or selling valuable tribal lands to those who are promoting the resort interests. Those who oppose issuance of patents allege that the allotment system is unfair to the tribe and will result eventually in the whites' getting possession and title to the lands. The outlines of the controversy are clear, but the summary disposition of the case has precluded the adversary trial which alone would give reliable foundation for determining it, if indeed the evidence will show that it should be the subject of judicial determination. The legal claims of this particular Indian to a patent for the lands he selected for allotment, which have long been in his possession and have been considerably improved with the knowl- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 419, 432]\n\u00a0\n edge of the Government, are now entangled in larger questions of Indian land policy.\n The jurisdictional Act of 1894, under which this suit is in the courts, requires them to adjudicate legal rights of the parties and to render a judgment which will stand in lieu of the Secretary's action if he has unlawfully denied a patent to an allotment to which the Indian is entitled. But courts are not to determine questions of Indian land policy, nor can the Secretary on grounds of policy deprive an allottee of any rights he may have acquired in his allotment. To separate questions of right from questions of policy requires judicial examination of any well pleaded allegation of the complaint and of any grounds advanced for refusal of the patent. Even in some discretionary matters, it has been held that if an official acts solely on grounds which misapprehend the legal rights of the parties, an otherwise unreviewable discretion may become subject to correction. Perkins v. Elg, \n307 \nU.S. 325, 349\n, 59 S.Ct. 884, 896.\n Since the government has not pleaded to the complaint nor offered evidence as to the Secretary's position we know it only as stated in argument. It appears that the sole reason for denying a patent is a departmental change of policy, by which the Secretary now disagrees with the allotment policy prescribed for these Indians by the Acts of 1891 and 1917. The Government brief says, 'Meanwhile opposition to the making of allotments in severalty developed among the members of the Palm Springs band of Indians, and as a result administrative action on the 1927 schedule was further delayed. During this period the conclusion was reached in the Department that in fairness to the band as a whole and from the standpoint of their best interests the lands scheduled for allotment should be held in a tribal status and dealt with as a tribal asset.' It says further, 'The Secretary has determined \n\n[322 \nU.S. 419, 433]\n\u00a0\n that it would be inequitable and detrimental to the Palm Springs band of Indians as a whole to approve any allotments on their reservation.' Again, 'The Secretary should not be compelled to carry through a plan of allotment in severalty which in his judgment will operate contrary to the best interests of the Palm Springs band of Indians, but he should be permitted to stay his hand and seek a time which would be more in the interests of that band.'\n The Secretary has endeavored to persuade Congress that treatment other than the allotment policy embodied in its legislation would be more advantageous for the Indians. In 1935, he recommended to Congress a bill authorizing him to make a 99-year lease of the reservation lands. \n14\n This failed of enactment. In 1937, the Secretary recommended a bill to repeal the provisions of the Act of March 2, 1917, directing the making of allotments on the Mission Indian reservations. \n15\n That bill failed. He also recommended a bill to authorize the sale of a part of the Palm Springs Reservation. \n16\n That likewise failed of enactment.\n We think the grounds advanced by the Government by way of argument, although not by way of evidence, are inadequate to establish as matter of law that the petitioner has no legal right to a patent. Congress not only has failed to deny these allotment rights by legislation, but has rejected urgent and reiterated appeals from the Department to do so. Arenas is entitled to invoke the applicable legis- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 419, 434]\n\u00a0\n lation as it stands in determining whether he is entitled to have completed the all but fully executed policy of allotment. \n17\n\u00a0\n\n The petitioner made no counter motion in the District Court for summary judgment against the Government. Before us he asks only that his complaint be answered and that he be given a chance to establish his legal claim if he can by trial. The summary judgment against him should be reversed and the Government required to answer. We do not preclude motion by the Government to strike parts of the complaint if any are found to be improper pleading. But we think the duty of the Court under the jurisdiction act can be discharged in a case of this complexity only by trial, findings and judgment in regular course.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] St. Marie v.

Blanchard, of Chicago, Ill., for petitioner.\n Mr. Ben Meyers, of Chicago, Ill., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice JACKSON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Armour and Company, petitioners, have been held liable to certain employees for overtime, liquidated damages, \n\n[323 \nU.S. 126, 127]\n\u00a0\n and attorneys' fees under the Fair Labor Standards Act. 7 Cir., 140 F.2d 356. The overtime in question is that spent on the employer's premises as fire guards subject to call, but otherwise put to such personal use as sleeping or recreation. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit on facts of considerable similarity reached an opposite result, in Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 136 F.2d 112; Id., \n323 \nU.S. 134\n, 65 S.Ct. 161. To resolve the conflict we granted certiorari in both cases. Skidmore v. Swift & Co., \n322 \nU.S. 723\n, 64 S.Ct. 1256; Armour & Co. v. Wantock, \n322 \nU.S. 723\n, 64 S.Ct. 1265.\n Armour and Company operates a soap factory in Chicago which produces goods for interstate commerce. It maintains a private fire-fighting force to supplement that provided by the city. The respondents were employed as fire fighters only, and otherwise had nothing to do with the production of goods. They were not night watchmen, a separate force being maintained for that purpose. They were not given access to the factory premises at night except by call or permission of the watchmen.\n These men worked in shifts which began at 8:00 a.m., when they punched a time clock. The following nine hours, with a half hour off for lunch, they worked at inspecting, cleaning, and keeping in order the company's fire-fighting apparatus, which included fire engines, hose, pumps, water barrels and buckets, extinguishers, and a sprinkler system. At 5:00 p.m. they 'punched out' on the time clock. Then they remained on call in the fire hall, provided by the Company and located on its property, until the following morning at 8:00. They went off duty entirely for the next twenty-four hours and then resumed work as described.\n During this night time on duty they were required to stay in the fire hall, to respond to any alarms, to make any temporary repairs of fire apparatus, and take care of the sprinkler system if defective or set off by mischance. The time spent in these tasks was recorded and amounts on average to less than a half hour a week. The employer \n\n[323 \nU.S. 126, 128]\n\u00a0\n does not deny that time actually so spent should be compensated in accordance with the Act.\n The litigation concerns the time during which these men were required to be on the employer's premises, to some extent amenable to the employer's discipline, subject to call, but not engaged in any specific work. The Company provided cooking equipment, beds, radios, and facilities for cards and amusements with which the men slept, ate, or entertained themselves pretty much as they chose. They were not, however, at liberty to leave the premises except that, by permission of the watchman, they might go to a nearby restaurant for their evening meal.\n A single fixed weekly wage was paid to the men, regardless of the variation in hours per week spent on regular or on fire house duty, the schedule of shifts occasioning considerable variation in weekly time.\n This fire-fighting service was not maintained at the instance of the Company's officials in charge of production, but at that of its insurance department. Several other plants of Armour and those of numerous other manufacturers in the same industry produce similar goods for commerce without maintaining such a fire-fighting service.\n On these facts the petitioner contends: first, that employees in such auxiliary fire-fighting capacity are not engaged in commerce or in production of goods for commerce, or in any occupation necessary to such production within the meaning of the Act; and, second, that even if they were within the Act, time spent in sleeping, eating, playing cards, listening to the radio, or otherwise amusing themselves, cannot be counted as working time. The employees contended in the District Court that all of such standby time, however spent, was employment time within the Act, but they took no appeal from the judgment insofar as it was adverse to them.\n The District Court held that the employees in such service were covered by the Act. But it declined to go \n\n[323 \nU.S. 126, 129]\n\u00a0\n to either extreme demanded by the parties as to working time. Usual hours for sleep and for eating it ruled would not be counted, but the remaining hours should. Judgment was rendered for Wantock of $505.67 overtime, the same amount in liquidated damages, and $600 for attorneys' fees; while Smith recovered $943.07 overtime, liquidated, damages of equal amount, and attorneys' fees of $650. The Court of Appeals affirmed.\n First. Were the employees in question covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act? Section 7 of the Act, 29 U.S.C.  207, 29 U.S.C.A.  207, by its own terms applies maximum hours provisions to two general classes of employees, those who are engaged in commerce and those who are engaged in producing goods for commerce. Section 3(j), 29 U.S.C.  203(j), 29 U.S. C.A.  203(j), adds another by the provision that 'an employee shall be deemed to have been engaged in the production of goods if such employee was employed ... in any process or occupation necessary to the production' of goods for commerce. The courts below held that the respondents were included in this class. The petitioner seeks to limit those entitled to this classification by reading the word 'necessary' in the highly restrictive sense of 'indispensable,' 'essential,' and 'vital'- words it finds in previous pronouncements of this Court dealing with this clause. Kirschbaum v. Walling, \n316 \nU.S. 517, 524\n, 526 S., 62 S.Ct. 1116, 1120, 1121; Overstreet v. North Shore Corp., \n318 \nU.S. 125, 129\n, 130 S., 63 S.Ct. 494, 497, 498. These and other cases, says petitioner, indicate that in applying the Act a distinction must be made between those processes or occupations which an employer finds advantageous in his own plan of production and those without which he could not practically produce at all. Present respondents, it contends, clearly fall within the former category because soap can be and in many other plants is produced without the kind of fire protection which these employees provide.\n The argument would give an unwarranted rigidity to the application of the word 'necessary,' which has always \n\n[323 \nU.S. 126, 130]\n\u00a0\n been recognized as a word to be harmonized with its context. See McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 413, 414. No hard and fast rule will tell us what can be dispensed with in 'the production of goods.' All depends upon the detail with which that bare phrase is clothed. In the law of infants' liability, what are 'necessaries' may well vary with the environment to which the infant is exposed: climate and station in life and many other factors. So, too, no hard and fast rule may be transposed from one industry to another to say what is necessary in 'the production of goods.' What is practically necessary to it will depend on its environment and position. A plant may be so built as to be an exceptional fire hazard, or it may be menaced by neighborhood. It may be farther from public fire protection, or its use of inflammable materials may make instaneous response to fire alarm of peculiar importance to it. 'Whatever terminology is used, the criterion is necessarily one of degree and must be so defined.' Santa Cruz Fruit Packing Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, \n303 \nU.S. 453, 467\n, 58 S.Ct. 656, 660; Kirschbaum v. Walling, \n316 \nU.S. 517, 526\n, 62 S.Ct. 1116, 1121. In their context, the restrictive words like 'indispensable,' which petitioner quotes, do not have the automatic significance petitioner seeks to give them. What is required is a practical judgment as to whether the particular employer actually operates the work as part of an integrated effort for the production of goods.\n The fact that respondents were hired by an employer which shows no ostensible purpose for being in business except to produce goods for commerce is not without weight, even though we recognized in Kirschbaum v. Walling that it might not always be decisive. 316 U.S. at page 525, 62 S. Ct. at page 1121. A court would not readily assume that a corporation's management was spending stockholders' money on a mere hobby or an extravegance. The company does not prove or assert that this fire protection is so unrelated to its business of production that it does not for income-tax \n\n[323 \nU.S. 126, 131]\n\u00a0\n purposes deduct the wages of these employees from gross income as 'ordinary and necessary expenses.' Internal Revenue Code  23(a)(1), 26 U. S.C.A. Int.Rev. Code  23(a) (1). The record shows that this department not only helps to safeguard the continuity of production against interruption by fire but serves a fiscal purpose as well. Without the department, insurance could not be obtained at any price except by employing enough watchmen to make hourly rounds; with it, only enough watchmen for rounds every two hours are needed. This saves twelve watchmen, or about $17,600 a year, and reduces insurance premiums by $1200 a year. What the net savings are has not been stipulated, but it is clear that this so-called 'de luxe' service is maintained because it is good business to do so. More is necessary to a successful enterprise than that it be physically able to produce goods for commerce. It also aims to produce them at a price at which it can maintain its competitive place, and an occupation is not to be excluded from the Act merely because it contributes to economy or to continuity of production rather than to volume of production.\n If some of the phrases quoted from previous decisions describe a higher degree of essentiality than these respondents can show, it must be observed that they were all uttered in cases in which the employees were held to be within the Act. A holding that a process or occupation described as 'indispensable' or 'vital' is one 'necessary' within the Act cannot be read as an authority that all which cannot be so described are out of it. McLeod v. Threlkeld, \n319 \nU.S. 491\n, 63 S.Ct. 1248, which did exclude the employee from the scope of the Act, is not in point here because it involved application of the other clause of the Act, covering employees engaged 'in commerce,' and the test of whether one is in commerce is obviously more exacting than the test of whether his occupation is necessary to production for commerce.\n But we think the previous cases indicate clearly that respondents are within the Act. Kirschbaum v. Wall- \n\n[323 \nU.S. 126, 132]\n\u00a0\n ing, supra (\n316 \nU.S. 517\n, 62 S.Ct. 1120), held that watchmen, as well as engineers, firemen, carpenters and others, were covered, because they contributed to 'the maintenance of a safe, habitable building' which was, in turn, necessary for the production of goods. Again, in Walton v. Southern Package Corp., \n320 \nU.S. 540\n, 64 S.Ct. 320, 321, the 'necessary to the production' clause was held to cover a night watchman for a manufacturing company, and we pointed to the reduction of fire insurance premiums as evidence that a watchman 'would make a valuable contribution to the continuous production of respondent's goods.' The function of these employees is not significantly different.\n The courts below did not err in holding that respondents were employed in an occupation reasonably necessary to production as carried on by the employer and hence were covered by the Act.\n Second. Was it error to count time spent in playing cards and other amusements, or in idleness, as working time?\n The overtime provisions of the Act,  7, 52 Stat. 1063, 29 U.S.C.  207, 29 U.S.C.A.  207, apply only to those who are 'employees' and to 'employment' in excess of the specified hours;  3(g), 29 U.S.C.  203(g), 29 U.S.C.A.  203(g), provides that \"employ' includes to suffer or permit to work.'\n Here, too, the employer interprets former opinions of the Court as limitations on the Act. It cites statements that the congressional intent was 'to guarantee either regular or overtime compensation for all actual work or employment' and that 'Congress here was referring to work or employment ... as those words are commonly used-as meaning physical or mental exertion (whether burdensome or not) controlled or required by the employer and pursued necessarily and primarily for the benefit of the employer and his business' (italics supplied). Tennessee Coal, Iron & R. Co. v. Muscoda Local No. 123, \n321 \nU.S. 590, 597\n, 598 S., 64 S.Ct. 698, 702, 703. It is timely again to remind counsel that \n\n[323 \nU.S. 126, 133]\n\u00a0\n words of our opinions are to be read in the light of the facts of the case under discussion. To keep opinions within reasonable bounds precludes writing into them every limitation or variation which might be suggested by the circumstances of cases not before the Court. General expressions transposed to other facts are often misleading. The context of the language cited from the Tennessee Coal case should be sufficient to indicate that the quoted phrases were not intended as a limitation on the Act, and have no necessary application to other states of facts.\n Of course an employer, if he chooses, may hire a man to do nothing, or to do nothing but wait for something to happen. Refraining from other activity often is a factor of instant readiness to serve, and idleness plays a part in all employments in a stand-by capacity. Readiness to serve may be hired, quite as much as service itself, and time spent lying in wait for threats to the safety of the employer's property may be treated by the parties as a benefit to the employer. Whether time is spent predominantly for the employer's benefit or for the employee's is a question dependent upon all the circumstances of the case.\n That inactive duty may be duty nonetheless is not a new principal invented for application to this Act. In Missouri, K. & T.R. Co. v. United States, \n231 \nU.S. 112, 119\n, 34 S.Ct. 26, 27, the Court held that inactive time was to be counted in applying a federal Act prohibiting the keeping of employees on duty for more than sixteen consecutive hours. Referring to certain delays, this Court said, 'In the meantime the men were waiting, doing nothing. It is argued that they were not on duty during this period, and that if it be deducted, they were not kept more than sixteen hours. But they were under orders, liable to be called upon at any moment, and not at liberty to go away. They were none the less on duty when inactive. Their duty was to stand and wait.' \n\n[323 \nU.S. 126, 134]\n\u00a0\n We think the Labor Standards Act does not exclude as working time periods contracted for and spent on duty in the circumstances disclosed here, merely because the nature of the duty left time hanging heavy on the employees' hands and because the employer and employee cooperated in trying to make the confinement and idleness incident to it more tolerable. Certainly they were competent to agree, expressly or by implication, that an employee could resort to amusements provided by the employer without a violation of his agreement or a departure from his duty. Both courts below having concurred in finding that under the circumstances and the arrangements between the parties the time so spent was working time, we therefore affirm.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","7":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nASHCRAFT v. STATE OF TENN.(1944)\nNo. 391\nArgued: February 28, 1944Decided: May 1, 1944\n\n\n\n\n[322 \nU.S. 143, 144]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. James F. Bickers and Grover N. McCormick, both of Memphis, Tenn., for petitioners.\n Mr. Nat Tipton, of Nashville, Tenn., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n About three o'clock on the morning of Thursday, June 5, 1941, Mrs. Zelma Ida Ashcraft got in her automobile at her home in Memphis, Tennessee, and set out on a trip to visit her mother's home in Kentucky. Late in the afternoon of the same day her car was observed a few miles out of Memphis, standing on the wrong side of a road which she would likely have taken on her journey. Just off the road, in a slough, her lifeless body was found. On her head were cut places inflicted by blows sufficient to have caused her death. Petitioner Ware, age 20, a Negro, was indicted in a state court and found guilty of her murder. Petitioner Ashcraft, age 45, a white man, husband of the deceased, charged with having hired Ware to commit the murder, was tried jointly with Ware and convicted as an accessory before the fact. Both were sentenced to ninety-nine years in the state peniten- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 143, 145]\n\u00a0\n tiary. The Supreme Court of Tennessee affirmed the convictions.\n In applying to us for certiorari, Ware and Ashcraft urged that alleged confessions were used at their trial which had been extorted from them by state law enforcement officers in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, and that 'solely and alone' on the basis of these confessions they had been convicted. Their contentions raised a federal question which the record showed to be substantial and we brought both cases here for review. Upon oral argument before this Court Tennessee's legal representatives conceded that the convictions could not be sustained without the confessions but defended their use upon the ground that they were not compelled but were 'freely and voluntarily made.'\n The record discloses that neither the trial court nor the Tennessee Supreme Court actually held as a matter of fact that petitioners' confessions were 'freely and voluntarily made.' The trial court heard evidence on the issue out of the jury's hearing, but did not itself determine from that evidence that the confessions were voluntary. Instead it over-ruled Ashcraft's objection to the use of his alleged confession with the statement that, 'This Court is not able to hold, as a matter of law, that reasonable minds might not differ on the question of whether or not that alleged confession was voluntarily obtained.' And it likewise over-ruled Ware's objection to use of his alleged confession, stating that 'the reasonable minds of twelve men might ... differ as to ... whether Ware's confession was voluntary, and ... therefore, that is a question of fact for the jury to pass on.' \n1\n Nor did the \n\n[322 \nU.S. 143, 146]\n\u00a0\n State Supreme Court review the evidence pertaining to the confessions and affirmatively hold them voluntary. In sustaining the petitioners' convictions, one Justice dissenting, it went no further than to point out that, 'The trial judge ... held ... he could not say that the confessions were not voluntarily made and, therefore, permitted them to go to the jury', and to declare that it, likewise, was 'unable to say that the confessions were not freely and voluntarily made.' \n2\n\u00a0\n\n If, therefore, the question of the voluntariness of the two confessions was actually decided at all it was by the jury. And the jury was charged generally on the subject of the two confessions as follows:\n'I further charge you that if verbal or written statements made by the defendants freely and voluntarily and without fear of punishment or hope of reward, have been proven to you in this case, you may take them into consideration with all of the other facts and circumstances in the case. ... In statements made at the time of the arrest, you may take into consideration the condition of the minds of the prisoners owing to their arrest and \n\n[322 \nU.S. 143, 147]\n\u00a0\n whether they were influenced by motives of hope or fear, to make the statements. Such a statement is competent evidence against the defendant who makes it and is not competent evidence against the other defendant . ... You cannot consider it for any purpose against the other defendant.'\n\n Concerning Ashcraft's alleged confession this general charge constituted the sole instruction to the jury. \n3\n But with regard to Ware's alleged confession the jury further was instructed:\n'It is his (Ware's) further theory that he was induced by the fear of violence at the hands of a mob and by fear of the officers of the law to confess his guilt of the crime charged against him, but that such confession was false and that he had nothing whatsoever to do with, and no knowledge of the alleged crime. If you believe the theory of the defendant, Ware, ... it is your duty to acquit him.'\n\n Having submitted the two alleged confessions to the jury in this manner, the trial court instructed the jury that:\n'what the proof may show you, if anything, that the defendants have said against themselves, the law presumes to be true, but anything the defendants have said in their own behalf, you are not obliged to believe . ...'\n\n This treatment of the confessions by the two State courts, the manner of the confessions' submission to the jury, and the emphasis upon the great weight to be given confessions make all the more important the kind of 'independent examination' of petitioners' claims which, in \n\n[322 \nU.S. 143, 148]\n\u00a0\n any event, we are bound to make. Lisenba v. California, \n314 \nU.S. 219, 237\n, 238 S., 62 S.Ct. 280, 290. Our duty to make that examination could not have been 'foreclosed by the finding of a court, or the verdict of a jury, or both.' Id. We proceed therefore to consider the evidence relating to the circumstances out of which the alleged confessions came.\n First, as to Ashcraft. Ashcraft was born on an Arkansas farm. At the age of eleven he left the farm and became a farm hand working for others. Years later he gravitated into construction work, finally becoming a skilled dragline and steam shovel operator. Uncontradicted evidence in the record was that he had acquired for himself 'an excellent reputation.' In 1929 he married the deceased Zelma Ida Ashcraft. Childless, they accumulated, apparently through Ashcraft's earnings, a very modest amount of jointly held property including bank accounts and an equity in the home in which they lived. The Supreme Court of Tennessee found 'nothing to show but what the home life of Ashcraft and the deceased was pleasant and happy.' Several of Mrs. Ashcraft's friends who were guests at the Ashcraft home on the night before her tragic death testified that both husband and wife appeared to be in a happy frame of mind.\n The officers first talked to Ashcraft about 6 P.M. on the day of his wife's murder as he was returning home from work. Informed by them of the tragedy, he was taken to an undertaking establishment to identify her body which previously had been identified only by a driver's license. From there he was taken to the county jail where he conferred with the officers until about 2 A.M. No clues of ultimate value came from this conference, though it did result in the officers' holding and interrogating the Ashcrafts' maid and several of her friends. During the following week the officers made extensive investigations in Ashcraft's neighborhood and \n\n[322 \nU.S. 143, 149]\n\u00a0\n elsewhere and further conferred with Ashcraft himself on several occasions, but none of these activities produced tangible evidence pointing to the identity of the murderer.\n Then, early in the evening of Saturday, June 14, the officers came to Ashcraft's home and 'took him into custody.' In the words of the Tennessee Supreme Court,\n'They took him to an office or room on the northwest corner of the fifth Floor of the Shelby County jail. This office is equipped with all sorts of crime and detective devices such as a fingerprint outfit, cameras, high-powered lights, and such other devices as might be found in a homicide investigating office. ... It appears that the officers placed Ashcraft at a table in this room on the fifth floor of the county jail with a light over his head and began to quiz him. They questioned him in relays until the following Monday morning, June 16, 1941, around nine- thirty or ten o'clock. It appears that Ashcraft from Saturday evening at seven o'clock until Monday morning at approximately nine-thirty never left this homicide room of the fifth floor.'4\n\n Testimony of the officers shows that the reason they questioned Ashcraft 'in relays' was that they became so tired they were compelled to rest. But from 7:00 Saturday evening until 9:30 Monday morning Ashcraft had no rest. One officer did say that he gave the suspect a single five minutes respite, but except for this five minutes the procedure consisted of one continuous stream of questions.\n As to what happened in the fifth-floor jail room during this thirty- six hour secret examination the testimony \n\n[322 \nU.S. 143, 150]\n\u00a0\n follows the usual pattern and is in hopeless conflict. \n5\n Ashcraft swears that the first thing said to him when he was taken into custody was, 'Why in hell did you kill your wife?'; that during the course of the examination he was threatened and abused in various ways; and that as the hours passed his eyes became blinded by a powerful electric light, his body became weary, and the strain on his nerves became unbearable. \n6\n The officers, on the other hand, swear that throughout the questioning they were kind and considerate. They say that they did not accuse Ashcraft of the murder until four hours after he was brought to the jail building, though they freely admit that from that time on their barrage of questions was constantly directed at him on the assumption that he was \n\n[322 \nU.S. 143, 151]\n\u00a0\n the murderer. Together with other persons whom they brought in on Monday morning to witness the culmination of the thirty-six hour ordeal the officers declare that at that time Ashcraft was 'cool', 'calm', 'collected,' 'normal'; that his vision was unimpaired and his eyes not bloodshot; and that he showed no outward signs of being tired or sleepy.\n As to whether Ashcraft actually confessed there is a similar conflict of testimony. Ashcraft maintains that although the officers incessantly attempted by various tactics of intimidation to entrap him into a confession, not once did he admit knowledge concerning or participation in the crime. And he specifically denies the officers' statements that he accused Ware of the crime, insisting that in response to their questions he merely gave them the name of Ware as one of several men who occasionally had ridden with him to work. The officers' version of what happened, however, is that about 11 P.M. on Sunday night, after twenty- eight hours' constant questioning, Ashcraft made a statement that Ware had overpowered him at his home and abducted the deceased, and was probably the killer. About midnight the officers found Ware and took him into custody, and, according to their testimony, Ware made a self-incriminating statement as of early Monday morning, and at 5:40 A.M. signed by mark a written confession in which appeared the statement that Ashcraft had hired him to commit the murder. This alleged confession of Ware was read to Ashcraft about six o'clock Monday morning, whereupon Ashcraft is said substantially to have admitted its truth in a detailed statement taken down by a reporter. About 9:30 Monday morning a transcript of Ashcraft's purported statement was read to him. The State's position is that he affirmed its truth but refused to sign the transcript, saying that he first wanted to consult his lawyer. As to \n\n[322 \nU.S. 143, 152]\n\u00a0\n this latter 9:30 episode the officers' testimony is reinforced by testimony of the several persons whom they brought in to witness the end of the examination.\n In reaching our conclusion as to the validity of Ashcraft's confession we do not resolve any of the disputed questions of fact relating to the details of what transpired within the confession chamber of the jail or whether Ashcraft actually did confess. \n7\n Such disputes, we may say, are an inescapable consequence of secret inquisitorial practices. And always evidence concerning the inner details of secret inquisitions8 is weighted against an accused, \n\n[322 \nU.S. 143, 153]\n\u00a0\n particularly where, as here, he is charged with a brutal crime, or where, as in many other cases, his supposed offense bears relation to an unpopular economic, political, or religious cause.\n Our conclusion is that if Ashcraft made a confession it was not voluntary but compelled. We reach this conclusion from facts which are not in dispute at all. Ashcraft, a citizen of excellent reputation, was taken into custody by police officers. Ten days' examination of the Ashcrafts' maid, and of several others, in jail where they were held, had revealed nothing whatever against Ashcraft. Inquiries among his neighbors and business associates likewise had failed to unearth one single tangible clue pointing to his guilt. For thirty-six hours after Ashcraft's seizure during which period he was held incommunicado, without sleep or rest, relays of officers, experienced investigators, and highly trained lawyers questioned him without respite. From the beginning of the questioning at 7 o'clock on Saturday evening until 6 o'clock on Monday morning Ashcraft denied that he had anything to do with the murder of his wife. And at a hearing \n\n[322 \nU.S. 143, 154]\n\u00a0\n before a magistrate about 8:30 Monday morning Ashcraft pleaded not guilty to the charge of murder which the officers had sought to make him confess during the previous thirty-six hours.\n We think a situation such as that here shown by uncontradicted evidence is so inherently coercive that its very existence is irreconcilable with the possession of mental freedom by a lone suspect against whom its full coercive force is brought to bear. \n9\n It is inconceivable that any court of justice in the land, conducted as our courts are, open to the public, would permit prosecutors serving in relays to keep a defendant witness under continuous cross examination for thirty- six hours without rest or sleep in an effort to extract a 'voluntary' confession. Nor can we, consistently with Constitutional due process of law, hold voluntary a confession where prosecutors do the same thing away from the restraining influences of a public trial in an open court room. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n[322 \nU.S. 143, 155]\n\u00a0\n The Constitution of the United States stands as a bar against the conviction of any individual in an American court by means of a coerced confession. \n11\n There have been, and are now, certain foreign nations with governments dedicated to an opposite policy: governments which convict individuals with testimony obtained by police organizations possessed of an unrestrained power to seize persons suspected of crimes against the state, hold them in secret custody, and wring from them confessions by physical or mental torture. So long as the Constitution remains the basic law of our Republic, America will not have that kind of government.\n Second, as to Ware. Ashcraft and Ware were jointly tried, and were convicted on the theory that Ashcraft hired Ware to perform the murder. Ware's conviction was sustained by the Tennessee Supreme Court on the assumption that Ashcraft's confession was properly admitted and his conviction valid. Whether it would have been sustained had the court reached the conclusion we have reached as to Ashcraft we cannot know. Doubt as to what the State court would have done under the changed \n\n[322 \nU.S. 143, 156]\n\u00a0\n circumstances brought about by our reversal of its decision as to Ashcraft is emphasized by the position of the State's representatives in this Court. They have asked that if we reverse Ashcraft's conviction we also reverse Ware's.\n In disposing of cases before us it is our responsibility to make such disposition as justice may require. 'And in determining what justice does require, the Court is bound to consider any change, either in fact or in law, which has supervened since the judgment was entered.' Patterson v. Alabama, \n294 \nU.S. 600, 607\n, 55 S.Ct. 575, 578; State Tax Commission v. Van Cott, \n306 \nU.S. 511, 515\n, 516 S., 59 S.Ct. 605, 607. Application of this guiding principle to the case at hand requires that we send Ware's case back to the Tennessee Supreme Court. Should that Court in passing on Ware's conviction in the light of our ruling as to Ashcraft adopt the State Attorney General's view and reverse the conviction there then would be no occasion for our passing on the federal question here raised by Ware. Under these circumstances we vacate the judgment of the Tennessee Supreme Court affirming Ware's conviction, and remand his case to that court for further proceedings.\n The judgment affirming Ashcraft's conviction is reversed and the cause is remanded to the Supreme Court of Tennessee for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.\n Judgment of Tennessee Supreme Court affirming defendant Ware's conviction vacated and case remanded with directions and judgment of Tennessee Supreme Court affirming Ashcraft's conviction reversed and cause remanded with directions.\n\n Mr. Justice JACKSON, dissenting.\n A sovereign state is now before us, summoned on the charge that it has obtained convictions by methods so unfair that a federal court must set aside what the state courts have done. Heretofore the state has had the benefit of a presumption of regularity and legality. A confession made by one in custody heretofore has been \n\n[322 \nU.S. 143, 157]\n\u00a0\n admissible in evidence unless it was proved and found that it was obtained by pressures so strong that it was in fact involuntarily made, that the individual will of the particular confessor had been overcome by torture, mob violence, fraud, trickery, threats, or promises. Even where there was excess and abuse of power on the part of officers, the State still was entitled to use the confession if upon examination of the whole evidence it was found to negative the view that the accused had 'so lost his freedom of action that the statements made were not his but were the result of the deprivation of his free choice to admit, to deny, or to refuse to answer.' Lisenba v. California, \n314 \nU.S. 219, 241\n, 62 S.Ct. 280, 292.\n In determining these issues of fact, respect for the sovereign character of the several states always has constrained this Court to give great weight to findings of fact of state courts. While we have sometimes gone back of state court determinations to make sure whether the guaranties of the Fourteenth Amendment have or have not been violated, in close cases the decisions of state courts have often been sufficient to tip the scales in favor of affirmance. Lisenba v. California, supra, 314 U. S. at pages 238, 239, 62 S.Ct. at pages 290, 291; Buchalter v. New York, \n319 \nU.S. 427, 431\n, 63 S.Ct. 1129, 1131; cf. Milk Wagon Drivers Union v. Meadowmoor Dairies, \n312 \nU.S. 287, 294\n, 61 S.Ct. 552, 555, 132 A.L.R. 1200\n\n\n As we read the present decision the Court in effect declines to apply these well-established principles. Instead, it: (1) substitutes for determination on conflicting evidence the question whether this confession was actually produced by coercion, a presumption that it was, on a new doctrine that examination in custody of this duration is 'inherently coercive'; (2) it makes that presumption irrebuttable-i.e., a rule of law- because, while it goes back of the State decisions to find certain facts, it refuses to resolve conflicts in evidence to determine whether other of \n\n[322 \nU.S. 143, 158]\n\u00a0\n the State's proof is sufficient to overcome such presumption; and, in so doing, (3) it sets aside the findings by the courts of Tennessee that on all the facts this confession did not result from coercion, either giving those findings no weight or regarding them as immaterial.\n We must bear in mind that this case does not come here from a lower federal court over whose conduct we may assert a general supervisory power. If it did, we should be at liberty to apply rules as to the admissibility of confessions, based on our own conception of permissible procedure, and in which we may embody restrictions even greater than those imposed upon the states by the Fourteenth Amendment. See Bram v. United States, \n168 \nU.S. 532\n, 18 S.Ct. 183; Ziang Sung Wan v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 1\n, 45 S.Ct. 1; McNabb v. United States, \n318 \nU.S. 332, 341\n, 63 S.Ct. 608, 613; United States v. Mitchell, 64 S.Ct. 896. But we have no such supervisory power over state courts. We may not lay down rules of evidence for them nor revise their decisions merely because we feel more confidence in our own wisdom and rectitude. We have no power to discipline the police or law-enforcement officers of the State of Tennessee nor to reverse its convictions in retribution for conduct which we may personally disapprove.\n The burden of protecting society from most crimes against persons and property falls upon the state. Different states have different crime problems and some freedom to vary procedures according to their own ideas. Here, a state was forced by an unwitnessed and baffling murder to vindicate its law and protect its society. To nullify its conviction in this particular case upon a consideration of all the facts would be a delicate exercise of federal judicial power. But to go beyond this, as the Court does today, and divine in the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment an exclusion of confessions on an irrebuttable presumption that custody and examination are 'inherently coercive' if of some unspecified duration within \n\n[322 \nU.S. 143, 159]\n\u00a0\n thirty-six hours, requires us to make more than a passing expression of our doubts and disagreements.\n\n\n I.\n\n\n The claim of a suspect to immunity from questioning creates one of the most vexing problems in criminal law-that branch of the law which does the courts and the legal profession least credit. The consequences upon society of limiting examination of persons out of court cannot fairly be appraised without recognition of the advantage criminals already enjoy in immunity from compulsory examination in court. Of this latter Mr. Justice Cardozo, for an all but unanimous Court, said: 'This too might be lost, and justice still be done. Indeed, today as in the past there are students of our penal system who look upon the immunity as a mischief rather than a benefit, and who would limit its scope, or destroy it altogether. No doubt there would remain the need to give protection against torture, physical or mental.' Palko v. Connecticut, \n302 \nU.S. 319, 325\n, 326 S., 58 S.Ct. 149, 151, 152.\n This Court never yet has held that the Constitution denies a State the right to use a confession just because the confessor was questioned in custody where it did not also find other circumstances that deprived him of a 'free choice to admit, to deny, or to refuse to answer.' Lisenba v. California, \n314 \nU.S. 219, 241\n, 62 S.Ct. 280, 292. The Constitution requires that a conviction rest on a fair trial. Forced confessions are ruled out of a fair trial. They are rules out because they have been wrung from a prisoner by measures which are offensive to concepts of fundamental fairness. Different courts have used different terms to express the test by which to judge the inadmissibility of a confession, such as 'forced,' 'coerced,' 'involuntary,' 'extorted,' 'loss of freedom of will.' But always where we have professed to speak with the voice of the due process clause, the test, in whatever words stated, has been \n\n[322 \nU.S. 143, 160]\n\u00a0\n applied to the particular confessor at the time of confession.\n It is for this reason that American courts hold almost universally and very properly that a confession obtained during or shortly after the confessor has been subjected to brutality, torture, beating, starvation, or physical pain of any kind is prima facie 'involuntary.' The effect of threats alone may depend more on individual susceptibility to fear. But men are so constituted that many will risk the postponed consequences of yielding to a demand for a confession in order to be rid of present or imminent physical suffering. Actual or threatened violence have no place in eliciting truth and it is fair to assume that no officer of the law will resort to cruelty if truth is what he is seeking. We need not be too exacting about proof of the effects of such violence on the individual involved, for their effect on the human personality is invariably and seriously demoralizing.\n When, however, we consider a confession obtained by questioning, even if persistent and prolonged, we are in a different field. Interrogation per se is not, while violence per se is, an outlaw. Questioning is an indispensable instrumentality of justice. It may be abused, of course, as cross-examination in court may be abused, but the principles by which we may adjudge when it passes constitutional limits are quite different from those that condemn police brutality, and are far more difficult to apply. And they call for a more responsible and cautious exercise of our office. For we may err on the side of hostility to violence without doing injury to legitimate prosecution of crime; we cannot read an undiscriminating hostility to mere interrogation into the Constitution without unduly fettering the States in protecting society from the criminal.\n It probably is the normal instinct to deny and conceal any shameful or guilty act. Even a 'voluntary confes- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 143, 161]\n\u00a0\n sion' is not likely to be the product of the same motives with which one may volunteer information that does not incriminate or concern him. The term 'voluntary' confession does not mean voluntary in the sense of a confession to a priest merely to rid one's soul of a sense of guilt. 'Voluntary confessions' in criminal law are the product of calculations of a different order, and usually proceed from a belief that further denial is useless and perhaps prejudicial. To speak of any confessions of crime made after arrest as being 'voluntary' or 'uncoerced' is somewhat inaccurate, although traditional.\n A confession is wholly and incontestably voluntary only if a guilty person gives himself up to the law and becomes his own accuser. The Court bases its decision on the premise that custody and examination of a prisoner for thirty-six hours is 'inherently coercive.' Of course it is. And so is custody and examination for one hour. Arrest itself is inherently coercive, and so is detention. When not justified, infliction of such indignities upon the person is actionable as a tort. Of course such acts put pressure upon the prisoner to answer questions, to answer them truthfully, and to confess if guilty.\n But does the Constitution prohibit use of all confessions made after arrest because questioning, while one is deprived of freedom, is 'inherently coercive'? The Court does not quite say so, but it is moving far and fast in that direction. The step it now takes is to hold this confession inadmissible because of the time taken in getting it.\n The duration and intensity of an examination or inquisition always have been regarded as one of the relevant and important considerations in estimating its effect on the will of the individual involved. Thirty-six hours is a long stretch of questioning. That the inquiry was prolonged and persistent is a factor that in any calculation \n\n[322 \nU.S. 143, 162]\n\u00a0\n of its effect on Ashcraft would count heavily against the confession. But some men would withstand for days pressures that would destroy the will of another in hours. Always heretofore the ultimate question has been whether the confessor was in possession of his own will and self-control at the time of confession. For its bearing on this question the Court always has considered the confessor's strength or weakness, whether he was educated or illiterate, intelligent or moronic, well or ill, Negro or white.\n But the Court refuses in this case to be guided by this test. It rejects the finding of the Tennessee courts and says it must make an 'independent examination' of the circumstances. Then it says that it will not 'resolve any of the disputed questions of fact' relating to the circumstances of the confession. Instead of finding as a fact that Ashcraft's freedom of will was impaired, it substitutes the doctrine that the situation was 'inherently coercive.' It thus reaches on a part of the evidence in the case a conclusion which I shall domonstrate it could not properly reach on all the evidence. And it refuses to resolve the conflicts in the other evidence to determine whether it rebuts the presumption thus reached that the confession is a coerced one.\n If the constitutional admissibility of a confession is no longer to be measured by the mental state of the individual confessor but by a general doctrine dependent on the clock, it should be capable of statement in definite terms. If thirty-six hours is more than is permissible, what about 24? or 12? or 6? or 1? All are 'inherently coercive.' Of course questions of law like this often turn on matters of degree. But are not the states entitled to know, if this Court is able to state, what the considerations are which make any particular degree decisive? How else may state courts apply our tests? \n\n[322 \nU.S. 143, 163]\n\u00a0\n The importance of defining these new constitutional standards of admissibility of confessions is emphasized by the decision to return the companion case of Ware to the Supreme Court of Tennessee for reconsideration 'in the light of the ruling as to Ashcraft.' Except for Ware's own testimony, all of the evidence is that when he confronted Ashcraft in custody Ware confessed immediately, voluntarily, and almost spontaneously. But he had been arrested, taken from bed into custody, and detained and questioned. Does the doctrine of inherent coerciveness condemn the Ware confession? Should the Tennessee court decide whether Ware obviously a much weaker character than Ashcraft, was actually coerced into confessing? It already has decided that question and this Court does not hold the fact determined wrongly. Ware's case is properly in this Court. Why should not this Court decide Ware's case on the merits and thus test and expound its novel ruling as applied to a different set of circumstances?\n No one can regard the rule of exclusion dependent on the state of the individual's will as an easy one to apply. It leads to controversy, speculation, and variations in application. To eliminate these evils by eliminating all confessions made after interrogation while in custody is a drastic alternative, but it is the logical consequence of today's ruling, as its application to the facts of Ashcraft's case will show.\n\n\n II.\n\n\n Apart from Ashcraft's uncorroborated testimony, which he Tennessee courts refused to believe, there is much evidence in this record from persons whom they did believe and were justified in believing. This evidence shows that despite the 'inherent coerciveness' of the circumstances of his examination, the confession when made was delib- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 143, 164]\n\u00a0\n erate, free, and voluntary in the sense in which that term is used in criminal law. This Court could not, in our opinion, hold this confession an involuntary one except by substituting its presumption in place of analysis of the evidence and refusing to weigh the evidence even in rebuttal of its presumption.\n As in most such cases, we start with some admitted facts. In the early morning Mrs. Ashcraft left her home in an automobile to visit relatives. She was found murdered. She had not bee robbed nor ravished, although an effort had been made to give the crime an appearance of robbery. The officers knew of no other motive for the killing and naturally turned to her husband for information.\n On the afternoon of the crime, Thursday, June 5, 1941, they took Ashcraft to the morgue to identify the body, and to the county jail, where he was kept and interviewed until 2:00 a.m. He makes no complaint of his treatment at this time. In this and several later interviews he made a number of statements with reference to the condition of the car, and as to Mrs. Ashcraft's having taken a certain drug, and as to money which she was accustomed to carry on her person, which further investigation indicated to be untrue. Still Ashcraft was not arrested. He professed to be willing to assist in identifying the killer. At last, on Saturday evening, June 14, an officer brought Ashcraft to the jail for further questioning. He was taken to a room on the fifth floor and questioned intermittently by several officers over a period of about thirty-six hours.\n There are two versions as to what happened during this period of questioning. According to the version of the officers, which was accepted by the court which saw the witnesses what happened? On Saturday evening Ashcraft was taken to the jail, where he was questioned by Mr. Becker and Mr. Battle, Becker is in the Intelligence \n\n[322 \nU.S. 143, 165]\n\u00a0\n Service of the United States Army at the present time and before that was in charge of the Homicide Bureau of the Sheriff's office of Shelby County, Tennessee. Battle has for eight years been an Assistant Attorney General of the County. They began questioning Ashcraft about 7:00 p.m. They recounted various statements of his which had proved untrue. About 11:00 o'clock Ashcraft said he realized the circumstances all pointed to him and that he could not explain the circumstances. They then accused him of the murder, but he denied it. About 3:00 a.m. Becker and Battle retired and left Ashcraft in charge of Ezzell, a special investigator connected with the Attorney General's office. He questioned Ashcraft and discussed the crime with him until about 7:00 on Sunday morning. Becker and Battle then returned and interviewed him intermittently until about noon, when Ezzell returned and remained until about 5:00. Becker then returned, and about 11: 00 o'clock Sunday night Ashcraft expressed a desire to talk with Ezzell. Ezzell was sent for and Ashcraft told him he wanted to tell him the truth. He said, 'Mr. Ezzell, a Negro killed my wife.' Ezzell asked the Negro's name, and Ashcraft said, 'Tom Ware.' Up to this time Ware had not been suspected, nor had his name been mentioned. Ashcraft explained that he did not tell the officers before because 'I was scared; the negro said he would burn my house down if I told the law.'\n Thereupon Becker, Battle, Ezzell, and Mr. Jayroe, connected with the Sheriff's office, took Ashcraft in a car and found Ware. When questioned at the jail, Ware turned to Ashcraft and said in substance that he had told Ashcraft when this thing happened that he did not intend to take the entire blame. The officers thereupon turned their attention to Ware. He promptly admitted the killing and said Ashcraft hired him to do it. Waldauer, the court reporter, was called to take down this confession, and \n\n[322 \nU.S. 143, 166]\n\u00a0\n completed his transcript at about 5:40 a.m. He read it to Ware and told him he did not have to sign it unless he so chose. Ware made his mark upon it and swore to it before Waldauer as a Notary Public. A copy was given to Ashcraft, and he then admitted that he had hired Ware to kill his wife. He was given breakfast and then in response to questions made a statement which was taken down by the court reporter, Waldauer. It was transcribed, but Ashcraft declined to sign it, saying that he wanted his lawyer to see it before he signed it. No effort was made to compel him to sign the confession. However, two business men of Memphis, Mr. Castle, vice president of a bank, and Mr. Pidgeon, president of the Coca-Cola Bottling Company were called in. Both testified that Ashcraft in their presence asserted that the transcript was correct but that he declined to sign it. The officers also called Dr. McQuiston to the jail to make a physical examination of both Ashcraft and Ware. He had practiced medicine in Memphis for twenty-eight years and both Mr. and Mrs. Ashcraft had been his patients for something like five years. In the presence of this friendly doctor Ashcraft might have complained of his treatment and avowed his innocence. The doctor testified, however, that Ashcraft said he had been treated all right, that he made no complaint about his eyes, and that they were not bloodshot. The doctor made a physical examination, and says Ashcraft appeared normal. He further testified as to Ashcraft, 'Well, sir, he said he had not been able to get along with his wife for some time; that her health had been bad; that he had offered her a property settlement and that she might go her way and he his way; and he also stated that he offered this colored man, Ware, a sum of money to make away with his wife.' \n1\n The doctor says \n\n[322 \nU.S. 143, 167]\n\u00a0\n that that statement was entirely voluntary. No matter what pressure had been put on Ashcraft before, the courts below could reasonably believe that he made this statement voluntarily to a man of whom he had no fear and who knew his family relations.\n Ashcraft's story of torture could only be accepted by disbelieving such credible and unimpeached contradiction. Ashcraft testified that he was refused food, was not allowed to go to the lavatory, and was denied even a drink of water. Other testimony is that on Saturday night he was brought a sandwich and coffee about midnight; that he drank the coffee but refused the sandwich; that on Sunday morning he was given a breakfast and was fed again about noon a plate lunch consisting of meat and vegetables and coffee. Both Waldauer, the Reporter, and Dr. McQuiston testified that they saw breakfast served to Ashcraft the next morning, before the statement taken down by Waldauer. Ashcraft claims he was threatened and that a cigarette was slapped out of his mouth. This is all denied.\n This Court rejects the testimony of the officers and disinterested witnesses in this case that the confession was voluntary not because it lacked probative value in itself nor because the witnesses were self- contradictory or were impeached. On the contrary, it is impugned only on grounds such as that such disputes 'are an inescapable consequence of secret inquisitorial practices.' We infer from this that since a prisoner's unsupported word often conflicts with that of the officers, the officer's testimony for constitutional purposes is always prima facie false. We know that police standards often leave much to be desired, but we are not ready to believe that the democratic proc- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 143, 168]\n\u00a0\n ess brings to office men generally less believable than the average of those accused of crime.\n Reference also is made to the fact that when petitioner was questioned investigation had failed 'to unearth one single tangible clue pointing to his guilt.' We cannot see the relevance of such circumstances on the question of the voluntary or involuntary character of his statements to the officers. Is the suggestion that if they had probable clews to his guilt, their questioning of him would have been better justified?\n This questioning is characterized as a 'secret inquisition,' invoking all of the horrendous historical associations of those words. Certainly the inquiry was participated in by a good many persons, and we do not see how it could have been much less 'secret' unless the press should have been called in. Of course, any questioning may be characterized as an 'inquisition,' but the use of such characterizations is no substitute for the detached and judicial consideration that the court below gave to the case.\n We conclude that even going behind the state court decisions into the facts, no independent judgment on the whole evidence that Ashcraft's confession was in fact coerced is possible. And against this background of facts the extreme character of the Court's ruling becomes apparent.\n I am not sure whether the Court denies the State all right to arrest and question the husband of the slain woman. No investigation worthy of the name could fail to examine him. Of all persons he was most likely to know whether she had enemies or rivals. Would not the State have a constitutional right, whether he was accused or not, to arrest and detain him as a material witness? If it has the right to detain one as a witness, presumably it has the right to examine him. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 143, 169]\n\u00a0\n Could the State not confront Ashcraft with his false statements and ask his explanation? He did not throw himself at any time on his rights, refuse to answer, and demand counsel, even according to his own testimony. The strategy of the officers evidently was to keep him talking, to give him plenty of rope and see if he would not hang himself. He does not claim to have made objection to this. Instead he relied on his wits. The time came when it dawned on him that his own story brought him under suspicion, and that he could not meet it. Must the officers stop at this point because he was coming to appreciate the uselessness of deception?\n Then he became desperate and accused the Negro. Certainly from this point the State was justified in holding and questioning him as a witness, for he claimed to know the killer. That accusation backfired and only turned up a witness against him. He had run out of expedients and inventions; he knew he had lost the battle of wits. After all honesty seemed to be the best, even if the last, policy. He confessed in detail.\n At what point in all this investigation does the Court hold that the Constitution commands these officers to send Ashcraft on his way and give up the murder as insoluble? If the state is denied the right to apply any pressure to him which is 'inherently coercive' it could hardly deprive him of his freedom at all. I, too, dislike to think of any man, under the disadvantages and indignities of detention being questioned about his personal life for thirty-six hours or for one hour. In fact, there is much in our whole system of penology that seems archaic and vindictive and badly managed. Every person in the community, no matter how inconvenient or embarrassing, no matter what retaliation it exposes him to, may be called upon to take the witness stand and tell all he knows about a crime- except the person who knows most about it. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 143, 170]\n\u00a0\n Efforts of prosecutors to compensate for this handicap by violent or brutal treatment or threats we condemn as passionately and sincerely as other members of the Court. But we are not ready to say that the pressure to disclose crime, involved in decent detention and lengthy examination, although we admit them to be 'inherently coercive,' are denied to a State by the Constitution, where they are not proved to have passed the individual's ability to resist and to admit, deny, or refuse to answer.\n\n\n III.\n\n\n The Court either gives no weight to the findings of the Tennessee courts or it regards their inquiry as to the effect on the individuals involved as immaterial. We think it was a material inquiry and that respect is due to their conclusion.\n The Supreme Court of Tennessee, writing in this case, stated the law of that State by which it reviewed and affirmed the action of the trial court. It said, 'When confessions are offered as evidence, their competency becomes a preliminary question to be determined by the court. This imposes upon the presiding judge the duty of deciding the fact whether the party making the confession was influenced by hope or fear. This rule is so well established that if the judge allow the jury to determine the preliminary fact, it is error, for which the judgment will be reversed.\n'In the instant case the trial judge heard the witnesses as to their confessions out of the presence of the jury, and he held that under the facts he could not say that the confessions were not voluntarily made and, therefore, permitted them to go to the jury.' (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n The rule of law thus laid down complied with the law as this Court had settled it at the time of trial.\n The Tennessee Supreme Court made a painstaking examination of the evidence in the light of the claim that \n\n[322 \nU.S. 143, 171]\n\u00a0\n the confessions were coerced. It concluded that it was 'unable to say that the confessions were not freely and voluntarily made. Both of the plaintiffs in error have had a fair trial and we decline to disturb the conviction.'\n That court, it is clear, renders no mere lip service to the guaranties of the Constitution. In other cases it has set aside convictions because confessions used at trials were found to have been coerced. \n2\n There is not the least indication that the court was passionate or biased or that the result does not represent the honest judgment of a high-minded court, sensitive to these problems.\n A trial judge out of hearing of the jury saw and heard Ashcraft and saw and heard those whom Ashcraft accused of coercing him. In determining a matter of this kind no one can deny the great advantage of a court which may see and hear a man who claims that his will succumbed and those who, it is claimed, were so overbearing. The real issue is strength of character, and a few minutes' observation of the parties in the courtroom is more informing than reams of cold record. There is not the slightest indication that the trial judge ws prejudiced or indifferent to the prisoner's rights. Ashcraft's counsel moved to exclude his confession 'for the reason that the statements contained therein were not freely and voluntarily made, nor were they free from duress and restraint, but were secured by compulsion. ...' The court said, '... the sole proposition, as the Court sees it from this testimony, is that he was confined and questioned for a period of approximately thirty-six hours. I think counsel concedes that is practically the main ground upon which he rests his motion. There was no physical violence offered to the defendant Ashcraft, and none was claimed.' He overruled the motion and received the confession. This \n\n[322 \nU.S. 143, 172]\n\u00a0\n Court, not one of whose members ever saw Ashcraft or any one of the State's witnesses, overturns the decision by the trial judge.\n Moreover, a jury held Ashcraft's statements incredible. After the trial judge, out of their presence, heard the evidence and decided the confession was admissible, the jury heard the evidence to decide whether the confession should be believed. Ashcraft again testified and so did all of the witnesses for the State. Conduct of the hearing both by the judge and the prosecutors was above criticism. The Court observes: 'If, therefore, the question of the voluntariness of the two confessions was actually decided at all it was by the jury.' Is it suggested that a state consistently with the Constitution may not leave this question to the sole determination of a jury? I had supposed that the constitutional duty of a state when such questions of fact arise is to furnish due process of law for deciding them. Does not jury trial meet this test? Here Tennessee, and I think very commendably, provided the double safeguards of a preliminary trial by the judge and a final determination by the jury.\n The Court's opinion makes a critical reference to the charge of the trial judge. However, diligent counsel took no exception to the part of the charge quoted, made no request for further instruction on the subject, and assigned no error to the charge. Even if we think the charge inadequate, does the inadequacy of a charge constitute want of due process? And if so, do we review questions as to the charge although counsel for the petitioner made no objection during the trial when the judge could have corrected the error, but after the trial was over assigned it as one of twelve reasons for demanding a new trial?\n No conclusion that this confession was actually coerced can be reached on this record except by reliance upon the utterly uncorroborated statements of defendant Ashcraft. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 143, 173]\n\u00a0\n His testimony does not carry even ordinary guaranties of truthfulness, and the courts and jury were not bound to accept it. Perjury is a light offense compared to murder and they may well have believed that Ashcraft was ready to resort to a lesser crime to avoid conviction of a greater one. Furthermore, the very grounds on which this Court now upsets his conviction Ashcraft repudiated at the trial. He asserts that he was abused, but he does not testify as this Court holds that it had the effect of forcing an involuntary confession from him. On the contrary, he flatly insists that it had no such effect and that he never did confess at all.\n Against Ashcraft's word the state courts and jury accepted the testimony of several apparently disinterested witnesses of high standing in their communities, in addition to that of the accused officers. One of the witnesses to Ashcraft's admission of guilt was his own family physician, two were disinterested business men of substance and standing, another was an experienced court reporter who had long held this position of considerable trust. Another was a member of the bar. Certainly, the state courts were not committing an offense against the Constitution of the United States in refusing to believe that this whole group of apparently reputable citizens entered into a conspiracy to swear a murder onto an innocent man, against whom not one of them is shown to have had a grievance or a grudge.\n This is not the case of an ignorant and unrepresented defendant who has been the victim of prejudice. Ashcraft was a white man of good reputation, good position, and substantial property. For a week after this crime was discovered he was not detained, although his stories to the officers did not hang together, but was at large, free to consult his friends and counsel. There was no indecent haste, but on the contrary evident deliberation, in suspect- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 143, 174]\n\u00a0\n ing and accusing him. He was not sentenced to death, but for a term that probably means life. He was defended by resourceful and diligent counsel.\n The use of the due process clause to disable the states in protection of society from crime is quite as dangerous and delicate a use of federal judicial power as to use it to disable them from social or economic experimentation. The warning words of Mr. Justice Holmes in his dissenting opinion in Baldwin v. Missouri, \n281 \nU.S. 586, 595\n, 50 S.Ct. 436, 439, 72 A.L.R. 1303, seem to us appropriate for rereading now.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS and Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER join in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The legal test applied by the trial court to determine the admissibility of the two confessions was stated thus:\n'The Court has come to the conclusion ... that the law in Tennessee with reference to confession is simply this: it is largely a question of fact as to whether or not a confession is voluntary, and is made without hope of reward or fear of punishment. It only becomes a question of law for the Court to decide when, from the facts surrounding the taking of the alleged confessions or statements, the Court, as a matter of law, can hold that the State has failed to carry its burden, which it has of showing that the confessions were free and voluntarily, and that reasonable minds could not differ, and could come to but one conclusion that the confessions were involuntary and forced.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Notwithstanding the apparent fact that neither the trial court nor the appellate court affirmatively held the confessions voluntary, the Tennessee Supreme Court, in its opinion, restated the rule it had announced in previous cases, that, 'When confessions are offered as evidence, their competency becomes a preliminary question, to be determined by the Court. ... (If) the judge allow the jury to determine the preliminary fact, it is error, for which the judgment will be reversed.' See Self v. State, 6 Baxt. 224, 253, 65 Tenn. 244, 253. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] On motion for new trial, Ashcraft's counsel urged error in that, 'The court ... in delivering his charge to the jury ... in no place or at any time ... presented the theory of the defendant Ashcraft to the jury. He wholly and completely in his charge ignored the theory of the defendant Ashcraft that the alleged confessions or admissions made by him ... were not freely and voluntarily made. ...' \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] From the testimony it appears that Ashcraft was taken from the jail about 11 o'clock Sunday night for a period of approximately an hour to help the officers hunt the place where Ware lived. On his return Ashcraft was, for a short time, kept in a jail room different from that in which he was kept the rest of the time. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] 'As the report avers 'The third degree is a secret and illegal practice.' Hence the difficulty of discovering the facts as to the extent and manner it is practiced' IV Reports of National Committee on Law Observance and Enforcement (Wickersham Commission), U.S. Government Printing Office, 1931, Lawlessness in Law Enforcement, p. 3. Station houses and jails are most frequently employed for third degree practices, 'upstairs rooms or back rooms being sometimes picked out for their greater privacy.' Id., The Third Degree, p. 170; cf. Chambers v. Florida, \n309 \nU.S. 227, 238\n, 60 S.Ct. 472, 477. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] \"Work' is the term used to signify any form of what is commonly called the third degree, and may consist in nothing more than a severe cross-examination. Perhaps in most cases it is no more than that, but the prisoner knows he is wholly at the mercy of his inquisitor and that the severe cross-examination may at any moment shift to a severe beating. ... Powerful lights turned full on the prisoner's face, or switched on and off have been found effective. ... The most commonly used method is persistent questioning continuing hour after hour, sometimes by relays of officers. It has been known since 1500 at least that deprivation of sleep is the most effective torture and certain to produce any confession desired.' Report of Committee on Lawless Enforcement of Law made to the Section of Criminal Law and Criminology of the American Bar Association ( 1930) 1 American Journal of Police Science 575, 579-580, also quoted in IV Wickersham Report, supra, p. 47. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] The use in evidence of a defendant's coerced confession cannot be justified on the ground that the defendant has denied he ever gave the confession. White v. Texas, \n310 \nU.S. 530, 531\n, 532 S., 60 S.Ct. 1032, 1033. \n[\nFootnote 8\n] State and federal courts, textbook writers, legal commentators, and governmental commissions consistently have applied the name of 'inquisition' to prolonged examination of suspects conducted as was the examination of Ashcraft. See, e.g., cases cited in IV Wickersham Report, supra, and also pp. 44, 47, 48, and passim; Pound (Cuthbert W.), Inquisitorial Confessions, 1 Cornell L.Q. 77; Chambers v. Florida, \n309 \nU.S. 227, 237\n, 60 S.Ct. 472, 477; Bram v. United States, \n168 \nU.S. 532, 544\n, 18 S.Ct. 183, 187; Brown v. Walker, \n161 \nU.S. 591, 596\n, 16 S.Ct. 644, 646; Counselman v. Hitchcock, \n142 \nU.S. 547, 573\n, 12 S.Ct. 195, 202; cf. Cooper v. State, 86 Ala. 610, 611, 6 So. 110, 4 L.R.A. 766, 11 Am.St.Rep. 84. In a case where no physical violence was inflicted or threatened, the Supreme Court of Virginia expressly approved the statement of the trial judge that the manner and methods used in obtaining the confession read 'like a chapter from the history of the inquisition of the Middle Ages.' Enoch v. Commonwealth, 141 Va. 411, 423, 126 S.E. 222, 225; and see Cross v. State, 142 Tenn. 510, 514, 221 S.W. 489, 9 A.L.R. 1354. The analogy, of course, was in the fact that old inquisition practices included questioning suspects in secret places, away from friends and counsel, with notaries waiting to take down 'confessions', and with arrangements to have the suspect later affirm the truth of his confession in the presence of witnesses who took no part in the inquisition. See Encyclopedia Britannica, Fourteenth Ed., 'Inquisition'; Prescott, Ferdinand and Isabella, Sixth Ed., Part First, Chap. VII. The Inquisition; VIII Wigmore on Evidence, Third Ed ., p. 307. 'In the more serious offenses the party suspected is arrested, he is placed on his inquisition before the chief of police, and a statement is obtained. ... Where the office of the district attorney is in political harmony with the police system, the district attorney is generally invited to be present as an inquisitor.' 2 Wharton on Criminal Evidence, Eleventh Ed., pp. 1021-1022; and see Notes 5 and 6, supra.\n An admirable summary of the generally expressed judicial attitude toward these practices is set forth in the Report of The Committee on Lawless Enforcement of Law, 1 Amer.Journ. of Police Science, supra, p. 587: 'Holding incommunicado is objectionable because arbitrary-at the mere will and unregulated pleasure of a police officer. ... The use of the third degree is obnoxious because it is secret; because the prisoner is wholly unrepresented; because there is present no neutral, impartial authority to determine questions between the police and the prisoner; because there is no limit to the range of the inquisition, nor to the pressure that may be put upon the prisoner.' \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Bram v. United States, \n168 \nU.S. 532, 556\n, 562 S., 563, 18 S.Ct. 183, 192, 194; see also Ziang Sung Wan v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 1, 14\n, 15 S., 45 S.Ct. 1, 3, 4; Burdeau v. McDowell, \n256 \nU.S. 465, 475\n, 41 S.Ct. 574, 13 A.L.R. 1159; Counselman v. Hitchcock, \n142 \nU.S. 547, 573\n, 574 S., 12 S.Ct. 195, 202; 3 Elliot's Debates, pp. 445-449, 452; cf. Chambers v. Florida, \n309 \nU.S. 227\n, 60 S.Ct. 472. The question in the Bram case was whether Bram had been compelled or coerced by a police officer to make a self- incriminatory statement, contrary to the Fifth Amendment; and the question here is whether Ashcraft similarly was coerced to make such a statement, contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment. Lisenba v. California, \n314 \nU.S. 219, 236\n, 238 S., 62 S.Ct. 280, 289, 290. Taken together, the Bram and Lisenba cases hold that a coerced or compelled confession cannot be used to convict a defendant in any state or federal court. And the decision in the Bram case makes it clear that the admitted circumstances under which Ashcraft is alleged to have confessed preclude a holding that he acted voluntarily. \n[\nFootnote 10\n] Compare the following allegation contained in Ashcraft's motion for new trial, 'The Sheriff's deputies ... set themselves up as a quasi judicial tribunal and tried ... and convicted him there and in so doing rendered a trial ... before the trial court ... and the jury of peers ... a mere formality,' with Lisenba v. California, supra, 314 U.S. at page 237, 62 S.Ct. at page 290. 'The requirement of a public trial is for the benefit of the accused; that the public may see he is fairly dealt with and not unjustly condemned, and that the presence of interested spectators may keep his triers keenly alive to a sense of their responsibility and to the importance of their functions. ...'

Bemis, of Cleveland, Ohio, for petitioner.\n Mr. Valentine Brookers, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit for refund of a portion of the manufacturers' excise tax on tires paid by the Pacific Goodrich Rubber Company, petitioner's wholly owned subsidiary, pursuant to Section 602 of the Revenue Act of 1932.1 The District Court's judgment was for the Government, 48 F.Supp. 453, and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 126, 127]\n\u00a0\n 135 F.2d 456. Certiorari was granted on a petition which alleged that the Circuit Court's affirmance rested on its erroneous decision of procedural questions. \n320 \nU.S. 722\n, 64 S.Ct. 48. We were asked in the petition to pass upon these issues: (1) Whether there was a material variance between the claim which had been denied by the Commissioner and that sued upon in the District Court. See R.S.  3226, as amended, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code ,  3772; United States v. Andrews, Ex'x, \n302 \nU.S. 517\n, 58 S.Ct. 315. (2) Whether, if there was such a variance, it had been, or could have been, waived by the Government in the proceedings in the District Court. See United States v. Garbutt Oil Co., \n302 \nU.S. 528\n, 58 S.Ct. 320. Argument at the bar and in the briefs of both parties was not, however, limited to these narrow procedural problems but also dealt with the merits of the claim for refund. This argument has disclosed that, regardless of the procedural questions, the judgment in favor of the Government can be supported on the ground that under the controlling tax statutes petitioner's claim has no merit. See Helvering v. Gowran, \n302 \nU.S. 238, 245\n, 58 S.Ct. 154, 158. We pass at once to a consideration of that decisive issue.\n Petitioner claims it is entitled to the tax refund under provisions of the Agricultural Adjustment Act. \n2\n Section 9(a) of that Act authorized the imposition of a 'processing tax' on the 'first domestic processing' of basic agricultural commodities, including cotton. A proviso at the end of the section granted to manufacturers of certain products, including tires, a deduction from the excise tax on those products because of the payment of the 'processing tax' on the cotton used in them. \n3\n Another sec- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 126, 128]\n\u00a0\n tion of the Act,  16, imposed a different tax, equal to the processing tax, on articles held in floor stocks on a certain date for sale or other disposition which articles had been 'processed wholly or in chief value' from a basic agricultural commodity. 4 This latter section did not grant any deduction from the manufacturers' excise tax because of the floor stocks tax. Nevertheless when the Pacific Goodrich Rubber Company computed its manufacturers' excise tax on tires it claimed deduction on account of the tax which it had paid on floor stocks of cotton fabrics. The Commissioner disallowed the deduction on the ground that, while deductions were allowable for cotton on which a 'processing tax' had been paid under  9(a), they were not allowable for cotton on which a tax on floor stocks had been paid under  16. This suit is based on the premise that the deduction proviso of  9(a) should be read into  16. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 126, 129]\n\u00a0\n Within the literal meaning of the Agricultural Adjustment Act a tax on floor stocks was not a 'processing tax', and therefore the proviso in  9(a) which spoke only of a 'processing tax' on cotton was not literally applicable to the tax on floor stocks imposed under  16. The tax on floor stocks, though complementing the processing tax, was not a tax upon the 'processing' of an agricultural commodity but upon articles already processed from such a commodity and held for sale or other disposition on the date when the processing tax on the commodity went into effect. Although the literal language of the Act does not authorize the deduction which it claims, petitioner contends that the purpose of Congress to relieve tire manufacturers from so-called 'double taxation' on cotton contained in tires will be defeated5 unless we read into  16 the proviso of  9(a).\n With this contention we cannot agree. In the form in which the Agricultural Adjustment Act was introduced in Congress, neither  9(a), which authorized the 'processing tax', nor  16, which authorized the floor stocks tax, contained a proviso granting a deduction from the manufacturers' excise tax. \n6\n But  16 of the bill did provide that under specified circumstances taxpayers subject to the floor stock tax would be entitled to a tax adjustment in the nature of a refund. \n7\n When the bill was under consideration in the Senate,  9(a) was amended by adding a pro- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 126, 130]\n\u00a0\n viso8 which authorized an adjustment on account of the 'processing tax' in the nature of a deduction from the manufacturers' excise tax. Thus the bill as finally enacted provided one type of adjustment for the floor stocks tax in  16 and a different type of adjustment for the processing tax in  9(a). We have been pointed to nothing in the Act as a whole or its legislative history which shows that Congress considered these separate methods of adjusting the two taxes insufficient to prevent the burden of 'double taxation' on the tire manufacturers so far as Congress wanted to prevent it. We cannot say, therefore, that the expressed intention of Congress is defeated by a literal interpretation of the Act which declines to read the proviso of  9(a) into  16.9 The judgment of the Circuit Court is accordingly\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Sec. 602.

BARBER(1944)\nNo. 51\nArgued: Decided: December 4, 1944\n\n\n\n\n[323 \nU.S. 77, 78]\n\u00a0\n Mr. C. W. K. Meacham, of Chattanooga, Tenn., for petitioner.\n Mr. J. Clifford Curry, of Chattanooga, Tenn., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question for decision is whether the Supreme Court of Tennessee, in a suit brought upon a North Carolina judgment for arrears of alimony, rightly denied full faith and credit to the judgment, on the ground that it lacks finality because, by the law of North Carolina, it is subject to modification or recall by the court which entered it.\n In 1920 petitioner secured in the Superior Court of North Carolina for Buncombe County, a court of general jurisdiction, a judgment of separation from respondent, her husband. The judgment directed payment to petitioner of $200 per month alimony, later reduced to $160 per month. In 1932 respondent stopped paying the prescribed alimony. In 1940, on petitioner's motion in the separation suit for a judgment for the amount of the alimony accrued and unpaid under the earlier order, the Superior Court of North Carolina gave judgment in her favor. It adjudged that respondent was indebted to petitioner in the sum of $19,707.20, under its former order, that petitioner have and recover of respondent that amount, and 'that execution issue therefor'.\n Petitioner then brought the present suit in the Tennessee Chancery Court to recover on the judgment thus ob- \n\n[323 \nU.S. 77, 79]\n\u00a0\n tained. Respondent, by his answer, put in issue the finality, under North Carolina law, of the judgment sued upon, and the cause was submitted for decision on the pleadings and a stipulation that the court might consider as duly proved the records in two prior appeals in the North Carolina separation proceeding 'upon the authority of which the judgment sued upon in the present case is predicated', and that the opinions of the Supreme Court of North Carolina upon these appeals, Barber v. Barber, 216 N.C. 232, 4 S.E.2d 447; Id., 217 N.C. 422, 8 S.E.2d 204, should be 'admissible in evidence to prove or tend to prove the North Carolina law.'\n The Tennessee Chancery Court held the judgment sued upon to be entitled to full faith and credit, and gave judgment for petitioner accordingly. The Supreme Court of Tennessee reversed on the ground that the judgment was without the finality entitling it to credit under the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution, Art. IV,  1. 180 Tenn. 353, 175 S.W.2d 324. We granted certiorari because of an asserted conflict with Sistare v. Sistare, \n218 \nU.S. 1\n, 30 S.Ct. 682, 28 L.R.A., N.S., 1068, 20 Ann.Cas. 1061, and because of the importance of the issue raised. \n322 \nU.S. 719\n, 64 S.Ct. 1145\n\n\n The constitutional command is that 'Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and Judicial Proceedings of every other State.' Article IV,  1 of the Constitution also provides that 'Congress may by general Laws prescribe the Manner in which such Acts, Records and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect thereof.' And Congress has enacted that judgments 'shall have such faith and credit given to them in every court within the United States as they have by law or usage in the courts of the State from which they are taken'. Act of May 26, 1790, c. 11, 1 Stat. 122, as amended, 28 U.S.C.  687, 28 U.S.C.A.  687.\n In Sistare v. Sistare, supra, \n218 \nU.S. 16, 17\n, 30 S.Ct. 686, 28 L.R.A.,N.S., 1068, 20 Ann.Cas. 1061, this Court considered whether a decree for future alimony, brought to a sister \n\n[323 \nU.S. 77, 80]\n\u00a0\n state, was entitled to full faith and credit so to installments which had accrued, but which had not been reduced to a further judgment. The Court held that a decree for future alimony is, under the Constitution and the statute, entitled to credit as to past due installments, if the right to them is 'absolute and vested,' even though the decree might be modified prospectively by future orders of the court. See also Barber v. Barber, 21 How. 582. The Sistare case also decided that such a decree was not final, and therefore not entitled to credit, if the past due installments were subject retroactively to modification or recall by the court after their accrual. See also Lynde v. Lynde, \n181 \nU.S. 183, 187\n, 21 S.Ct. 555, 556, 45 L.ed. 810.\n The Sistare case considered the applicability of the full faith and credit clause, only as to decrees for future alimony some of the installments of which had accrued. The present suit was not brought upon a decree of that nature, but upon a money judgment for alimony already due and owing to the petitioner, as to which execution was ordered to issue. The Supreme Court of Tennessee applied to this money judgment the distinction taken in the Sistare case as to decrees for future alimony. It concluded that by the law of North Carolina the judgment for the specific amount of alimony already accrued, was subject to modification by the court which awarded it, that it was not a final judgment under the rule of the Sistare case, and therefore was not entitled to full faith and credit.\n As we are of opinion that the Tennessee Supreme Court erroneously construed the law of North Carolina as to the finality of the judgment sued upon here, it is unnecessary to consider whether the rule of the Sistare case as to decrees for future alimony is also applicable to judgments subsequently entered for arrears of alimony. Compare Lynde v. Lynde, supra, \n181 \nU.S. 187\n, 21 S.Ct. 556, where this Court distinguished between a decree for arrears of alimony and one for future alimony, some of the installments of which had ac- \n\n[323 \nU.S. 77, 81]\n\u00a0\n crued. See also Audubon v. Shufeldt, \n181 \nU.S. 575, 577\n, 578 S., 21 S.Ct. 735, 736. For the same reason, it is unnecessary to consider whether a decree or judgment for alimony already accrued, which is subject to modification or recall in the forum which granted it, but is not yet so modified, is entitled to full faith and credit until such time as it is modified. Cf. Levine v. Levine, 95 Or. 94, 109-113, 187 P. 609; Hunt v. Monroe, 32 Utah 428, 440, 91 P. 269, 11 L.R.A.,N.S., 249; and compare Milwaukee County v. M. E. White Co., \n296 \nU.S. 268, 275\n, 276 S., 56 S.Ct. 229, 233, and cases cited.\n We assume for present purposes that petitioner's judgment for accrued alimony is not entitled to full faith and credit, if by the law of North Carolina it is subject to modification. The refusal of the Tennessee Supreme Court to give credit to that judgment because of its nature is a ruling upon a federal right, and the sufficiency of the grounds of denial is for this Court to decide. Magnolia Petroleum Co. v. Hunt, \n320 \nU.S. 430, 443\n, 64 S.Ct. 208, 215, 216, 150 A.L.R. 413, and cases cited. And in determining the applicable law of North Carolina, this Court reexamines the issue with deference to the opinion of the Tennessee court, although we cannot accept its view of the law of North Carolina as conclusive. This is not a case where a question of local law is peculiarly within the cognizance of the local courts in which the case arose. The determination of North Carolina law can be made by this Court as readily as by the Tenneessee courts, and since a federal right is asserted, it is the duty of this Court, upon an independent investigation, to determine for itself the law of North Carolina. See Adam v. Saenger, \n303 \nU.S. 59, 64\n, 58 S.Ct. 454, 457, and cases cited.\n We are thus brought to the question whether, by the law of North Carolina, the judgment which petitioner has secured in that state for arrears of alimony is so wanting in finality as not to be within the command of the Constitution and the Act of Congress. Our examination of the North Carolina law on this subject must be in the \n\n[323 \nU.S. 77, 82]\n\u00a0\n light of the admonition of Sistare v. Sistare, supra, \n218 \nU.S. 22\n, 30 S.Ct. 688, 28 L.R.A.,N.S., 1068, 20 Ann.Cas. 1061, that 'every reasonable implication must be resorted to against the existence of' a power to modify or revoke installments of alimony already accrued 'in the absence of clear language manifesting an intention to confer it.' The admonition is none the less to be heeded when the debt has been reduced to a judgment upon which execution has been directed to issue.\n Section 1667 of the North Carolina Consolidated Statutes (General Stats. of 1943, Michie,  50-16), under which petitioner brought her suit for separation and alimony, provides that 'If any husband shall separate himself from his wife and fail to provide her and the children of the marriage with ... necessary subsistence', she may maintain an action in the Superior Court to have a 'reasonable subsistence' allotted and paid to her. It declares that 'the order of allowance ... may be modified or vacated at any time, on the application of either party or of any one interested.'\n This statute by its terms makes provision only for the modification of the 'order of allowance', not of a judgment rendered for the amount of the unpaid allowances which have accrued under such an order. Nor does it state that the order of allowance may be modified retroactively as to allowances already accrued. The original North Carolina judgment ordering the payment of subsistence installments of alimony is not in the record, and we are not advised of its terms. Respondent places his reliance not on them, but upon the North Carolina law, apart from the terms of the decree, as providing for modification of such a judgment. But we are aware of no statute or decision of any court of North Carolina and none has been cited, to the effect that an unconditional judgment of that state for accrued allowances of alimony may be modified or recalled after its rendition. Indeed, we find no pronouncement of any North Carolina court \n\n[323 \nU.S. 77, 83]\n\u00a0\n that before such a judgment is rendered, an order for future allowances may be modified or set aside with respect to allowances which have accrued and are due and owing.\n The Supreme Court of Tennessee found no support in North Carolina statutes or judicial decisions for its conclusion that the North Carolina judgment for arrears of alimony is subject to such modification, other than a single paragraph of the opinion of the Supreme Court of North Carolina at an early stage of the suit which resulted in the judgment upon which suit was here brought. \n1\n But these remarks, as their context shows, appear to be addressed, not to the power of the court to modify or set aside a judgment for arrears of alimony, but to the authority conferred by N.C.Con.Stat.  1667, upon the court in the suit for alimony to modify its previous order for the allowance of subsistence. \n\n[323 \nU.S. 77, 84]\n\u00a0\n Consistently with Sistare v. Sistare, supra, the passage points out that such an order is not final in the proceeding in which it is entered, but is subject to modification by further orders of the court. In this respect the North Carolina court was but following its own pronouncement in the first appeal in the separation proceeding, Barber v. Barber, supra, 216 N.C. 232, 234, 4 S.E.2d 447, and in numerous other decisions of that court. See Crews v. Crews, 175 N.C. 168, 173, 95 S.E. 149; Anderson v. Anderson, 183 N.C. 139, 142, 110 S.E. 863; Tiedemann v. Tiedemann, 204 N.C. 682, 683, 169 S.E. 422; Wright v. Wright, 216 N.C. 693, 696, 6 SE.2d 555. But it is quite another matter to say that past due installments may be modified, or that a judgment, not by its terms conditional and on which execution may issue, is subject to modification because the obligation for accrued alimony could have been modified or set aside before its merger in the judgment. And in fact the North Carolina Supreme Court has been at pains to indicate that such is not the case.\n In considering whether the decree of another state for future alimony is entitled to full faith and credit, the North Carolina court recognizes that such faith and credit is required as to past due installments when it does not appear that they may be modified or revoked. And it interprets general provisions for modification of a decree directing future allowances of alimony as inapplicable to allowances which have become due and owing. Since its decision in Barber v. Barber, in 217 N.C., it has held in Lockman v. Lockman, 220 N.C. 95, 16 S.E.2d 670, that such a decree in Florida is entitled to credit in North Carolina with respect to arrears in alimony. The court said, at page 103 of 220 N.C., at page 675 of 16 S.E. 2d:\n'The rule in North Carolina is that a judgment awarding alimony is a judgment directing the payment of money by the defendant, and by such judgment the defendant becomes indebted to the plaintiff for such alimony as it falls due, and when the defendant is in arrears in the pay- \n\n[323 \nU.S. 77, 85]\n\u00a0\n ment of alimony, the Court may judicially determine the amount due and enter decree accordingly. It has no less dignity than any other contractual obligation. Barber v. Barber, 217 N.C. 422, 8 S.E.2d 204. In Duss v. Duss, 92 Fla. 1081, 111 So. 382, the obligation of the divorced husband to pay alimony was stated in language of similar import.'\n\n The Supreme Court of North Carolina thus has assimilated the law of North Carolina to that of Florida, under which it had just held that past due installments of alimony were not subject to modification. In this state of the law of North Carolina, we cannot say that past due installments under a decree for future alimony can be revoked or modified.\n Still less can we say that a judgment for such installments can be so modified. The North Carolina Supreme Court said in the Barber case, 217 N. C. 422, 428, 8 S.E.2d 204, 208: 'There is no reason why a judgment should not be rendered on an allowance for alimony, which is a debt-any more than an ordinary one.' And elsewhere in its opinion it said (page 427 of 217 N. C., page 208 of 8 S.E.2d):\n'A judgment awarding alimony is a judgment directing the payment of money by a defendant to plaintiff and, by such judgment, the defendant thereupon becomes indebted to the plaintiff for such alimony as it becomes due, and when the defendant is in arrears in the payment of alimony the Court may, on application of plaintiff judicially determine the amount then due and enter its decree accordingly. The defendant, being a party to the action and having been given due notice of the motion, is bound by such decree, and the plaintiff is entitled to all the remedies provided by law for the enforcement thereof.'\n\n We do not find in the language on which the Tennessee court relied any clear or unequivocal indication that the judgment for arrears of alimony, on which execution was directed to issue, was itself subject to modification or recall. True, as the opinion of the North Carolina court states, the judgment for arrears of alimony was not a final \n\n[323 \nU.S. 77, 86]\n\u00a0\n judgment in the separation suit. As to future alimony payments not merged in the money judgment, the allotments ordered are, by the terms of the statute, subject to modification. But it would hardly be consistent with the court's statements, that accrued alimony is a debt for which a judgment may be rendered, that the defendant is bound by the judgment, and that 'the plaintiff is entitled to all the remedies provided by law' for its enforcement, to say that the judgment may be modified or set aside by virtue of a statute which in terms merely authorizes modification of the order for payment of allowances.\n The judgment of a court of general jurisdiction of a sister state duly authenticated is prima facie evidence of the jurisdiction of the court to render it and of the right which it purports to adjudicate. Adam v. Saenger, supra, \n303 \nU.S. 62\n, 58 S.Ct. 456, and cases cited. The present judgment is on its face an unconditional adjudication of petitioner's right to recover a sum of money due and owing which, by the law of the state, is a debt. The judgment orders that execution issue. To overcome the prima facie effect of the judgment record, it is necessary that there be some persuasive indication that North Carolina law subjects the judgment to the infirmity of modification or recall which is wanting here.\n Upon full consideration of the law of North Carolina we conclude that respondent has not overcome the prima facie validity and finality of the judgment sued upon. We cannot say that the statutory authority to modify or recall an order providing for future allowances of installments of alimony extends to a judgment for overdue installments or that such a judgment is not entitled to full faith and credit.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice JACKSON, concurring.\n I concur in the result, but I think that the judgment of the North Carolina court was entitled to faith and \n\n[323 \nU.S. 77, 87]\n\u00a0\n credit in Tennessee even if it was not a final one. On this assumption I do not find it necessary or relevant to examine North Carolina law as to whether its judgment might under some hypothetical circumstances be modified.\n Neither the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution nor the Act of Congress implementing it says anything about final judgments or, for that matter, about any judgments. Both require that full faith and credit be given to 'judicial proceedings' without limitation as to finality. Upon recognition of the broad meaning of that term much may some day depend.\n Whatever else this North Carolina document might be, no one denies that it is a step in a judicial proceeding, instituted validly under the strictest standards of due process. On its face it is final and by its terms it awards a money judgment in a liquidated amount, presently collectible, and provides 'that execution issue therefor.' Tennessee should have rendered substantially the same judgment that it received from the courts of North Carolina. If later a decree is made in North Carolina which modifies or amends its judgment, that modification or amendment will also be entitled to faith and credit in Tennessee.\n Of course a judgment is entitled to faith and credit for just what it is, and no more. But its own terms constitute a determination by the rendering court as to what it is, and an enforcing court may not search the laws of the state to see whether the judgment terms are erroneous. Of course, if a judgment by its terms reserves power to modify or states conditions, a judgment entered upon it could appropriately make like reservations or conditions. No such appear in this judgment unless they are to be annexed to it by a study of the law of North Carolina. Any application for such relief should be addressed to the North Carolina court and not to the Tennessee \n\n[323 \nU.S. 77, 88]\n\u00a0\n court nor to this one. The purpose of the full faith and credit clause is to lengthen the arm of the state court and to eliminate state lines as a shelter from judicial proceedings. This is defeated by entertaining a plea to review the support in state law for the judgment as it has been rendered, which is a delaying inquiry as has been shown by this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The language quoted from Barber v. Barber, 217 N.C. 422, 427, 428, 8 S.E.2d 204, 208, is as follows:\n'It is not a final judgment in the action, since both the plaintiff and the defendant may apply for other orders and for modifications of orders already made, which the court will allow as the ends of justice require, according to the changed conditions of the parties. The orders made from time to time are, of course, res judicata between the parties, subject to this power of the court to modify them. The consolidation of the amounts due, when ascertained in one order or decree does not invest any of these orders with any other character than that which they originally had. If the defendant is in court only by reason of the original service of summons, he is in court only for such orders as, upon motion, are appropriate and customary in the proceeding thus instituted. There is no reason why a judgment should not be rendered on an allowance for alimony, which is a debt-any more than an ordinary one. The court below, in its sound discretion, which is not ordinarily reviewable by this Court, under the motion of plaintiff in this cause can hear the facts, change of conditions of the parties, the present needs of support of any of the children and, in its sound discretion, render judgment for what defendant owes under the former judgment and failed to pay and see to it that such judgment is given to protect plaintiff, and 'give diligence to make her (your) calling and election sure.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n","10":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBATES v.

Clark, Asst. Atty. Gen., and Messrs. Robert S. Erdahl and W. Marvin Smith and Miss Beatrice Rosenberg, all of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n\n PER CURIAM.\n Petitioner asks certiorari to review his conviction upon an indictment charging criminal conspiracy to commit several separate offenses. The indictment charged petitioner, one Smith, and another (who was acquitted by the jury), and persons unknown, with a conspiracy to acquire gold bullion without a license in violation of  4 of Executive Order 6260, 12 U.S.C.A.  95 note (31 C.F.R.  50.4); to earmark for export, and to export to Germany gold bullion without a license, both in violation of  6 of the Order (31 C.F.R. \n\n[323 \nU.S. 15, 16]\n\u00a0\n s 50.6); and with conspiracy to commit two counterfeiting offenses.\n At the trial the evidence showed that petitioner, who was interested in making a profit from the sale of gold, was introduced by an informer to one Schaetzel, a Government agent who posed as the owner of a gold mine, interested in disposing of gold. Petitioner told Schaetzel a story, conceded by the Government to be without foundation, to the effect that petitioner wished to procure gold for sale to Nazi agents in this country who proposed to transport it to Germany by submarine. Petitioner, who was in fact seeking other ways of disposing of gold, tried without success to negotiate with numerous dealers, some of whose names were suggested to petitioner by Smith on petitioner's promise to pay him a commission. When Schaetzel complained to petitioner of the delay in consummating the proposed arrangement with the supposed Nazi agents, petitioner induced Smith to pose as such to reassure Schaetzel.\n On the verdict of the jury, finding petitioner and Smith guilty as charged by the indictment, the district court gave judgment against them. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed the conviction of Smith but affirmed that of petitioner, 141 F.2d 436, on the ground that the jury could have found that petitioner had conspired with unknown Nazi agents to export gold.\n The Government, by its brief here, formally concedes that petitioner's conviction cannot be sustained on this ground. It admits that petitioner's story of his negotiations with Nazi agents was sham, as he testified at the trial, and as is shown by other evidence submitted to the jury and by the failure of the Government to produce evidence of contacts with Nazi agents although petitioner was under almost constant surveillance by government agents. The Government also concedes that it has no evidence and that there is none in the record to support peti- \n\n[323 \nU.S. 15, 17]\n\u00a0\n tioner's conviction on any theory of a conspiracy to export gold. It in effect confesses that the affirmance on that ground is error. The Government also admits that the conviction cannot be supported on the counterfeiting charges.\n But the Government argues that there is evidence in the record sufficient to sustain the conviction of petitioner and Smith of conspiracy to acquire gold without the prescribed license, notwithstanding the Government's failure to seek a review of the reversal of Smith's conviction. The district court's instructions to the jury are not included in the record on appeal. In this state of the record there can be no question that this charge of the indictment was not properly submitted to the jury.\n On the Government's concession, which we accept, as to the charge of conspiracy to export gold and to commit counterfeiting offenses, the judgment of the Court of Appeals cannot be sustained. We do not consider the merits of the Government's contention that the conviction can be sustained on other grounds, since, in the circumstances of this case, we deem it more appropriate that the Court of Appeals consider that question in the first instance.

U.S.(1944)\nNo. 493\nArgued: April 26, 1944Decided: June 12, 1944\n\n\n\n Mr. Harold Evans, of Philadelphia, Pa., for petitioner.\n Mr. Charles Fahy, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On september 26, 1932, the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri entered its \n\n[322 \nU.S. 665, 666]\n\u00a0\n order admitting Baumgartner to citizenship and issued a certificate of naturalization to him. Almost ten years later, on August 21, 1942, the United States brought this suit under  338 of the Nationality Act of 1940 ( 54 Stat. 1137, 1158, 8 U.S.C.  738, 8 U.S.C.A.  738) to set aside the naturalization decree and cancel the certificate. \n1\n The District Court entered a decree for the Government, 47 F.Supp. 622, which the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, with one judge dissenting, affirmed. 138 F.2d 29. We brought the case here because it raises important issues in the proper administration of the law affecting naturalized citizens. \n321 \nU.S. 756\n, 64 S.Ct. 485.\n As a condition to receiving his American citizenship, Baumgartner, like every other alien applying for that great gift, was required to declare on oath that he renounced his former allegiance, in this case to the German Reich, and that he would 'support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic', and that he would 'bear true faith and allegiance to the same'. That he did not truly and fully renounce his allegiance to Germany and that he did not in fact intend to support the Constitution and laws of the United States and to give them true faith and allegiance, are the charges of fraud and illegality on which his citizenship is claimed forfeit.\n As is true of the determination of all issues of falsity and fraud, the case depends on its own particular facts. But the division of opinion among the judges below makes manifest that facts do not assess themselves and that the \n\n[322 \nU.S. 665, 667]\n\u00a0\n decisive element is the attitude appropriate for judgment of the facts in a case like this. The two lower courts have sustained the Government's claim that expressions by Baumgartner, in conversations with others and in the soliloquies of a diary, showed that he consciously withheld complete renunciation of his allegiance to Germany and entertained reservations in his oath of allegiance to his country, its Constitution and its laws. What follows is a fair summary of the evidence on which this finding rests, putting the Government's case in its most favorable light.\n Baumgartner was born in Kiel, Germany, on January 20, 1895, and brought up in modestly comfortable circumstances. He received a classical high-school education, which he completed in time to enter the German army in 1914. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in 1917, and shortly thereafter he was captured by the British and confined in England until November, 1919. Upon his return to Germany, Baumgartner studied at the University of Darmstadt, from which he was graduated in 1925 as an electrical engineer. Thereupon he was employed by a public utility company until January, 1927, when he left for the United States. Shortly before, Baumgartner had married, and his wife followed him to this country later in the same year.\n For about three months, Baumgartner stayed with friends in Illinois, and then came to Kansas City, Missouri, where he was employed by the Kansas City Power and Light Company. He continued in its employ down to the time of this suit. The man to whom he reported to work testified that after about two days on the job, Baumgartner began to discuss the political scene in Germany, to express a lack of enthusiasm for the then German Government, and to extol the virtues of Hitler and his movement. Baumgartner spoke so persistently about the superiority of German people, the German schools, and \n\n[322 \nU.S. 665, 668]\n\u00a0\n the engineering work of the Germans, that he aroused antagonism among his co-workers and was transferred to a different section of the plant.\n There was testimony that in 1933 or 1934 Mrs. Baumgartner's mother visited this country, and that after this visit, Baumgartner, beginning in 1934, 'praised the work that Hitler was doing over there in bringing Germany back, on repeated occasions.' Evidence of statements made by Baumgartner over a period of about seven years beginning in 1933 indicated oftrepeated admiration for the Nazi Government, comparisons between President Roosevelt and Adolf Hitler which led to conclusions that this country would be better off if run as Hitler ran Germany, 'that regimentation, as the Nazis, formed it (sic) was superior to the democracy', and that 'the democracy of the United States was a practical farce'. One witness of German extraction testified that Baumgartner told him he was 'a traitor to my country' because of the witness' condemnation of Hitler. Baumgartner made public speeches on at least three occasions before businessmen's groups, clubs, and the like in which he told of the accomplishments of the Nazi Government and indicated that 'he would be glad to live under the regime of Hitler.'\n During 1937 and 1938, Baumgartner conducted a Sunday school class, and former students testified that the discussion in class turned to Germany very frequently, that Baumgartner indicated that his students could get a fairer picture of conditions in Germany from the German radio, and that Germany was justified in much of what it was doing. The school superintendent also testified that he had received complaints that Baumgartner was preaching Nazism.\n In 1938 Baumgartner resigned from the Country Club Congregational Church in Kansas City because he objected to the injection of politics into the sermons. In \n\n[322 \nU.S. 665, 669]\n\u00a0\n May of the next year his wife and their three children, who had been born in Kansas City, went to Germany to visit Mrs. Baumgartner's parents. One witness testified that Baumgartner explained this trip in part by saying that 'he wanted the children to be brought up in German schools', and when war broke out in September, 1939, Mrs. Baumgartner cabled for money to return but Baumgartner could not raise the necessary funds and felt that his family would be as safe in Germany as here. Baumgartner remarked that he wanted his wife to come back from Germany, when she did, on a German boat. One of Baumgartner's neighbors testified that in a conversation in December, 1939, Baumgartner, asked about his thirteen-year-old daughter then in Germany, said sarcastically: 'Edith has done a very un-American thing, she has joined the Nazi Youth Movement.'\n There was testimony that Baumgartner justified the German invasions in the late 1930's, and announced, when Dunkerque fell, that 'Today I am rejoicing.' One witness testified that Baumgartner told him that he 'belonged to an order called the so-called 'Bund\", and the diary which Baumgartner kept from December 1, 1938, to the summer of 1941 reveals that he attended a meeting of the German Vocational League where the German national anthem was sung and 'everyone naturally arose and assumed the usual German stance with the arm extended to give the National Socialist greeting'. Other diary entries reflect violent anti-semitism, impatience at the lack of pro-German militancy of German-Americans, and approval of Germans who have not 'been Americanized, that is, ruined.' \n2\n Finally, Baumgartner replied in the \n\n[322 \nU.S. 665, 670]\n\u00a0\n affirmative to the trial judge's question: 'was your attitude towards the principles of the American government in 1932 when you took the oath the same as it has been ever since?'\n That the concurrent findings of two lower courts are persuasive proof in support of their judgments is a rule of wisdom in judicial administration. In reaffirming its importance we mean to pay more than lip service. But the rule does not relieve us of the task of examining the foundation for findings in a particular case. The measure of proof requisite to denaturalize a citizen was before this Court in Schneiderman v. United States, \n320 \nU.S. 118\n, 63 S.Ct. 1333. It was there held that proof to bring about a loss of citizenship must be clear and unequivocal. We cannot escape the conviction that the case made out by the Government lacks that solidity of proof which leaves no troubling doubt in deciding a question of such gravity as is implied in an attempt to reduce a person to the status of alien from that of citizen.\n The phrase 'finding of fact' may be a summary characterization of complicated factors of varying significance for judgment. Such a 'finding of fact' may be the ultimate judgment on a mass of details involving not merely an assessment of the trustworthiness of witnesses but other appropriate inferences that may be drawn from living testimony which elude print. The conclusiveness \n\n[322 \nU.S. 665, 671]\n\u00a0\n of a 'finding of fact' depends on the nature of the materials on which the finding is based. The finding even of a so-called 'subsidiary fact' may be a more or less difficult process varying according to the simplicity or subtlety of the type of 'fact' in controversy. Finding so-called ultimate 'facts' more clearly implics the application of standards of law. And so the 'finding of fact' even if made by two courts may go beyond the determination that should not be set aside here. Though labeled 'finding of fact', it may involve the very basis on which judgment of fallible evidence is to be made. Thus, the conclusion that may appropriately be drawn from the whole mass of evidence is not always the ascertainment of the kind of 'fact' that precludes consideration by this Court. See, e.g., Beyer v. LeFevre, \n186 \nU.S. 114\n, 22 S.Ct. 765. Particularly is this so where a decision here for review cannot escape broadly social judgments-judgments lying close to opinion regarding the whole nature of our Government and the duties and immunities of citizenship. Deference properly due to the findings of a lower court does not preclude the review here of such judgments. This recognized scope of appellate review is usually differentiated from review of ordinary questions of fact by being called review of a question of law, but that is often not an illuminating test and is never self-executing. Suffice it to say that emphasis on the importance of 'clear, unequivocal, and convincing' proof, see Schneiderman v. United States, supra, 320 U.S. at page 125, 63 S.Ct. at page 1336, on which to rest the cancellation of a certificate of naturalization would be lost if the ascertainment by the lower courts whether that exacting standard of proof had been satisfied on the whole record were to be deemed a 'fact' of the same order as all other 'facts', not open to review here.\n The gravamen of the Government's complaint and of the findings and opinions below is that Baumgartner con- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 665, 672]\n\u00a0\n sciously withheld allegiance to the United States and its Constitution and laws; in short, that Baumgartner was guilty of fraud. To prove such intentional misrepresentation evidence calculated to establish only the objective falsity of Baumgartner's oath was adduced. Nothing else was offered to show that Baumgartner was aware of a conflict between his views and the new political allegiance he assumed. But even if objective falsity as against perjurious falsity of the oath is to be deemed sufficient under  338(a) of the Nationality Act of 1940 to revoke an admission to citizenship, it is our view that the evidence does not measure up to the standard of proof which must be applied to this case.\n We come then to a consideration of the evidence in the context in which thatevidence is to be judged. Congress alone has been entrusted by the Constitution with the power to give or withhold naturalization and to that end 'to establish a uniform Rule of Naturalization.' Art. I,  8, Clause 4. In exercising its power, Congress has authorized the courts to grant American citizenship only if the alien has satisfied the conditions imposed by Congress for naturalization. There is no 'right to naturalization unless all statutory requirements are complied with.' United States v. Ginsberg, \n243 \nU.S. 472, 475\n, 37 S.Ct. 422, 425. And so 'If a certificate is procured when the prescribed qualifications have no existence in fact, it may be canceled by suit.' Tutun v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 568, 578\n, 46 S.Ct. 425, 427. From the earliest days of the Republic, Congress has required as a condition of citizenship that the alien renounce his foreign allegiance and swear allegiance to this country and its Constitution. Act of January 29, 1795, 1 Stat. 414. By this requirement Congress has not used meaningless words. Nor, on the other hand, has it thereby expressed a narrow test or formula susceptible of almost mechanical proof, as is true of other prerequisites for \n\n[322 \nU.S. 665, 673]\n\u00a0\n naturalization-period of residence, documentation of arrival, requisite number of sponsoring witnesses and the like. Allegiance to this Government and its laws, is a compendious phrase to describe those political and legal institutions that are the enduring features of American political society. We are here dealing with a test expressing a broad conception-a breadth appropriate to the nature of the subject matter, being nothing less than the bonds that tie Americans together in devotion to a common fealty. The spacious scope of this conception was expressed by this Court in stating that the Constitution 'was made for an undefined and expanding future, and for a people gathered, and to be gathered, from many nations and of many tongues', Hurtado v. California, \n110 \nU.S. 516, 530\n, 531 S., 4 S. Ct. 111, 118, 292, and again, 'when we are dealing with words that also are a constituent act, like the Constitution of the United States, we must realize that they have called into life a being the development of which could not have been foreseen completely by the most gifted of its begetters. It was enough for them to realize or to hope that they had created an organism; it has taken a century and has cost their successors much sweat and blood to prove that they created a nation. The case before us must be considered in the light of our whole experience and not merely in that of what was said a hundred years ago.' State of Missouri v. Holland, \n252 \nU.S. 416, 433\n, 40 S.Ct. 382, 383, 11 A.L.R. 984.\n To ascertain fulfilment of a test implying so expansive a reach presents difficult and doubtful problems even for judges presumably well- trained in the meaning of our country's institutions and their demands from its citizens. 'Under our Constitution, a naturalized citizen stands on an equal footing with the native citizen in all respects save that of eligibility to the Presidency.' Luria v. United States, \n231 \nU.S. 9, 22\n, 34 S.Ct. 10, 13. One of the prerogatives of \n\n[322 \nU.S. 665, 674]\n\u00a0\n American citizenship is the right to criticize public men and measures-and that means not only informed and responsible criticism but the freedom to speak foolishly and without moderation. Our trust in the good sense of the people on deliberate reflection goes deep. For such is the contradictoriness of the human mind that the expression of views which may collide with cherished American ideals does not necessarily prove want of devotion to the Nation. It would be foolish to deny that even blatant intolerance toward some of the presuppositions of the democratic faith may not imply rooted disbelief in our system of government.\n Forswearing past political allegiance without reservation and full assumption of the obligations of American citizenship are not at all inconsistent with cultural feelings imbedded in childhood and youth. \n3\n And during a period when new strength of the land of one's nativity was flamboyantly exploited before its full sinister meaning had been adequately revealed even to some Americans of the oldest lineage, such old cultural loyalty, it is well \n\n[322 \nU.S. 665, 675]\n\u00a0\n known, was stimulated into confusion of mind and sometimes to expressions of offensive exuberance.\n The denial of application for citizenship because the judicial mind has not been satisfied that the test of allegiance has been met, presents a problem very different from the revocation of the naturalization certificate once admission to the community of American citizenship has been decreed. No doubt the statutory procedure for naturalization ( 334, Nationality Act of 1940, 8 U.S.C.A.  734), and  338, with which we are here concerned, 'were designed to afford cumulative protection against fraudulent or illegal naturalization.' United States v. Ness, \n245 \nU.S. 319, 327\n, 38 S.Ct. 118, 121. But relaxation in the vigor appropriate for scrutinizing the intensity of the allegiance to this country embraced by an applicant before admitting him to citizenship is not to be corrected by meagre standards for disproving such allegiance retrospectively. New relations and new interests flow, once citizenship has been granted. All that should not be undone unless the proof is compelling that that which was granted was obtained in defiance of Congressional authority. Non-fulfilment of specific conditions, like time of residence or the required number of supporting witnesses, are easily established, and when established leave no room for discretion because Congress has left no area of discretion. But where the claim of 'illegality' really involves issues of belief or fraud, proof is treacherous and objective judgment, even by the most disciplined minds, precarious. That is why denaturalization on this score calls for weighty proof, especially when the proof of a false or fraudulent oath rests predominantly not upon contemporaneous evidence but is established by later expressions of opinion argumentatively projected, and often through the distorting and self-deluding medium of memory, to an earlier year when qualifications for citizenship were claimed, tested and adjudicated. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 665, 676]\n\u00a0\n It is idle to try to capture and confine the spirit of this requirement of proof within any fixed form of words. The exercise of our judgment is of course not at large. We are fully mindful that due observance of the law governing the grant of citizenship to aliens touches the very well-being of the Nation. Nothing that we are now deciding is intended to weaken in the slightest the alertness with which admission to American citizenship should be safeguarded. But we must be equally watchful that citizenship once bestowed should not be in jeopardy nor in fear of exercising its American freedom through a too easy finding that citizenship was disloyally acquired. We have sufficiently indicated the considerations of policy, derived from the traditions of our people, that require solid proof that citizenship was falsely and fraudulently procured. These considerations must guide our judicial judgment. Nor can the duty of exercising a judgment be evaded by the illusory definiteness of any formula.\n The insufficiency of the evidence to show that Baumgartner did not renounce his allegiance to Germany in 1932 need not be labored. Whatever German political leanings Baumgartner had in 1932, they were to Hitler and Hitlerism, certainly not to the Weimar Republic. Hitler did not come to power until after Baumgartner forswore his allegiance to the then German nation.\n Views attributed to Baumgartner as to the superiority of German people, schools, engineering techniques, and the virtues of Hitler, expressed in 1927, when he began to work in Kansas City, are the only direct evidence introduced to show that before he was naturalized in 1932, his attitude precluded his truly or honestly taking an oath of allegiance to the United States, its Constitution and its laws. And his statement at the trial that his attitude toward the principles of the American Government was the same in 1932 as it was at the time of the trial, is hardly significant. For Baumgartner professed \n\n[322 \nU.S. 665, 677]\n\u00a0\n loyalty at the trial, denied or explained the few disturbing statements attributed to him by others, and reconciled suspicious diary entries in ways that do not preclude the validity of his oath of allegiance. In short, the weakness of the proof as to Baumgartner's state of mind at the time he took the oath of allegiance can be removed, if at all, only by a presumption that disqualifying views expressed after naturalization were accurate representations of his views when he took the oath. The logical validity of such a presumption is at best dubious even were the supporting evidence less rhetorical and more conclusive. Baumgartner was certainly not shown to have been a party Nazi, and there is only the statement of one witness that Baumgartner had told him that he was a member of the Bund, to hint even remotely that Baumgartner was associated with any group for the systematic agitation of Nazi views or views hostile to this Government. On the contrary, Baumgartner's diary, on which the Government mainly relies, reveals that when in 1939 he attended a meeting of the German Vocational League at which the Nazi salute was given, it was apparently his only experience with this group, and he went 'Since I wanted to see what sort of an organization this Vocational League was'.\n And so we conclude that the evidence as to Baumgartner's attitude after 1932 affords insufficient proof that in 1932 he had knowing reservations in forswearing his allegiance to the Weimar Republic and embracing allegiance to this country so as to warrant the infliction of the grave consequences involved in making an alien out of a man ten years after he was admitted to citizenship. The evidence in the record before us is not sufficiently compelling to require that we penalize a naturalized citizen for the expression of silly or even sinister-sounding views which native-born citizens utter with impunity. The judgment must accordingly be reversed and the case re- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 665, 678]\n\u00a0\n manded to the District Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n So ordered.\n Reversed and remanded, with directions.\n Mr. Justice MURPHY.\n The issue in this case is clear. The Government has sought to set aside petitioner's naturalization certificate because of alleged fraudulent and illegal procurement. It was thus incumbent on the Government to meet the standard of proof laid down by this Court in Schneiderman v. United States, \n320 \nU.S. 118, 125\n, 158 S., 63 S.Ct. 1333, 1336, 1352, by presenting evidence of a 'clear, unequivocal, and convincing' character which did not leave 'the issue in doubt' as to whether petitioner fraudulently or illegally procured his certificate.\n It is true that in the Schneiderman case we were met with the issue as to whether the petitioner in that case had illegally procured his naturalization certificate in that he had not, at the time of his naturalization and five years prior thereto, behaved as a person attached to the principles of the Constitution, and well disposed to the good order and happiness of the United States. We expressly did not pass upon the charge of fraud in obtaining the certificate, which is the primary charge present in this proceeding. But the requirement that the Government prove its case by 'clear, unequivocal, and convincing' evidence transcends the particular ground upon which the Government seeks to set aside the naturalization certificate. The decision in the Schneiderman case was not merely a decision of an isolated case. It was a formulation by a majority of the Court of a rule of law governing all denaturalization proceedings. \n1\n That rule of law is \n\n[322 \nU.S. 665, 679]\n\u00a0\n equally applicable whether the citizen against whom the proceeding is brought is a Communist, a Nazi or a follower of any other political faith. This requirement of proof was recognized by the court below, 138 F.2d 29, 34, and by both the Government and the petitioner before us.\n In the instant case the failure of the Government to present evidence of a 'clear, unequivocal, and convincing' nature that petitioner fraudulently or illegally procured his naturalization certificate in 1932 is patent. With one unimportant exception, the Government proved only that petitioner displayed certain Nazi sympathies and was critical of the United States several years after 1932. There was no competent evidence that he entertained these strong beliefs or that he had any mental reservations in forswearing his allegiance to the Veimar Republic in 1932\n\n\n American citizenship is not a right granted on a condition subsequent that the naturalized citizen refrain in the future from uttering any remark or adopting an attitude favorable to his original homeland or those there in power, no matter how distasteful such conduct may be to most of us. He is not required to imprison himself in an intellectual or spiritual straightjacket; nor is he obliged to retain a static mental attitude. Moreover, he does not lose the precious right of citizenship because he subsequently dares to critize his adopted government in vituperative or defamatory terms. It obviously is more difficult to conform to the standard set forth in the Schneiderman case by mere proof of a state of mind subsequent to naturalization than by proof of facts existing \n\n[322 \nU.S. 665, 680]\n\u00a0\n prior to or at the time of naturalization. But that does not excuse a failure to meet that standard. The naturalized citizen has as much right as the natural born citizen to exercise the cherished freedoms of speech, press and religion, and without 'clear, unequivocal, and convincing' proof that he did not bear or swear true allegiance to the United States at the time of naturalization he cannot be denaturalized. Proper realization of that principle makes clear the error of setting aside petitioner's naturalization certificate on the basis of the facts adduced in this proceeding.\n Mr. Justice BLACK, Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice RUTLEDGE join in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 338(a) provides: 'It shall be the duty of the United States district attorneys for the respective districts, upon affidavit showing good cause therefor, to institute proceedings ... for the purpose of revoking and setting aside the order admitting such person to citizenship and canceling the certificate of naturalization on the ground of fraud or on the ground that such order and certificate of naturalization were illegally procured.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The following are some excerpts from Baumgartner's diary: 'The only ones who have any ideas here are the Jews and their ideas are vile, mean, and malicious. ... Today the President of the United States delivered his message to the new Congress. The speech was a horrible mixture of war agitation and laughable talk about the freedom of press, speech, etc., which this country allegedly has and which has to be protected with guns . ... we drank a bottle of Pschorr brew together to the welfare and the future of Germany. ... The Jewish-American-English fortress in the heart of Central Europe has fallen. A terrible defeat for the above named powers who will probably have a difficult time recovering from this. ... Listened to Hitler's speech from the Krolls Opera House on 15.2. It was wonderful as usual. ... The whole country is under the influence of the insane actions of the Government in Washington which have the character of wild, unbridled despotism.' \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The retention of cultural ties despite the change in 'juridical and political' status has thus been put by a distinguished historian, Gaetano Salvemini, in speaking of his own naturalization: 'There is in this country a wider area of generosity than in any other country-at least in Europe. It is this feeling that one is at home here that conquers you little by little. And one fine day you feel that you are no longer an exile but a citizen in your own country. When I took my oath I felt that really I was performing a grand function. I was throwing away not my intellectual and moral but my juristic past. I threw it away without any regret. The Ethiopian war, the rape of Albania, the Spanish crime, and this last idiotic crime, had really broken my connection with sovereigns, potentates, and all those ugly things which are enumerated in the formula of the oath. It is a wonderful formula. Your pledges are only juridical and political. You are asked to sever your connections with the government of your former country, not with the people and the civilization of your former country. And you are asked to give allegiance to the Constitution of your adopted country, that is, to an ideal of life.' Radcliffe Quarterly, August 1941, pp. 8-9. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The denaturalization proceeding in the Schneiderman case was brought under the provisions of  15 of the Act of June 29, 1906, 34 Stat. 596, 8 U.S.C.  405, 8 U.S.C.A.  405.

TRUESDELL(1944)\nNo. 215\nArgued: Decided: March 27, 1944\n\n\n\n\n[321 \nU.S. 542, 543]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Lee Bond, of Leavenworth, Kan., for petitioner.\n Mr. Edward G. Jennings, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Sec. 11 of the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 894, 50 U.S.C.Appendix  311, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix  311, provides that 'No person shall be tried by any military or naval court martial in any case arising under this Act unless such person has been actually inducted for the training and service prescribed under this Act or unless he is subject to trial by court martial under laws in force prior to the enactment of this Act.' \n1\n Petitioner Billings, who is held by the Army on a charge of a violation of the Articles of War, claims that this provision of the Act exempts him from military jurisdiction and makes him responsible solely to the civil authorities. The answer turns on whether or not Billings has been 'actually inducted' into the Army. These are the facts. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 542, 544]\n\u00a0\n Billings claims to be a conscientious objector. He registered under the Act with Local Board No. 1 of Ottawa County, Kansas, stating on his card at the time that he would never serve in the Army. He was given a 1-B classification because of defective eyesight but was reclassified as 1-A in January, 1942. The local board rejected his claim that he was a conscientious objector. He appealed to the board of appeal which affirmed the ruling of the local board. Though petitioner resolved never to serve in the Army, he desired to comply with all of the requirements of Selective Service short of actual induction, so that he might avoid all civil penalties possible. Accordingly, he consulted with draft officials in Texas and faculty members at the University of Texas where he taught and concluded that taking the oath was a prerequisite to induction into the armed forces. He thought he might be finally rejected by the Army on account of defective eyesight. But he resolved that if he was not rejected at the induction station, he would not take the oath but would turn himself over to the civil authorities. He was ordered by his local board to report on August 12, 1942 and to proceed to the induction center at Fort Leavenworth. He joined the group selected for induction and was transported to Fort Leavenworth where he and the others in his group spent the night in the barracks. The next morning after breakfast in the mess hall petitioner was given both the physical and mental examinations during which he made clear to the examining officials his purpose not to serve in the Army. He then reported to the officer who passed on the results of the examinations and who told him that he had been put in Class I-B. He then reported to the induction office and told the officers in charge that he refused to serve in the Army and that he wanted to turn himself over to the civil authorities. They said that he was already under the jurisdiction of the military and put him under guard to prevent him from \n\n[321 \nU.S. 542, 545]\n\u00a0\n leaving the reservation. With their consent, however, he used the telephone and procured the services of an attorney whom he retained to file a petition for habeas corpus on his behalf. Thereupon an Army officer read petitioner the oath of induction which petitioner refused to take. He was advised that his refusal made no difference, that 'You are in the army now.' He was then ordered to submit to finger-printing. He refused to obey. Military charges were preferred against him for willful disobedience of that order.\n On August 14, 1942, petitioner filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus alleging that he was not a member of the armed forces of the United States, that he was not subject to military jurisdiction, and that if he had violated any laws they were the civil laws of the United States. The writ issued. Respondent filed a return and a hearing was had at which petitioner testified. The District Court discharged the writ and remanded petitioner to respondent's custody, holding that petitioner was subject to military jurisdiction. Ex parte Billings, 46 F.Supp. 663. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that 'Induction was completed when the oath was read to petitioner and he was told that he was inducted into the Army.' 135 F.2d 505, 507. The case is here on a petition for a writ of certiorari which we granted because of the importance of the problem in the administration of the Act.\n\n\n I.\n\n\n It is conceded that petitioner was not 'actually inducted' in the Army within the meaning of  11 of the Act when he was ordered to report to the induction station. But it is contended that from that time on he was subject to at least a limited military jurisdiction by reason of the Articles of War.\n Among those whom Article 2 of the Articles of War, 41 Stat. 787, 10 U. S.C.  1473, 10 U.S.C.A.  1473, subjects to military law are \n\n[321 \nU.S. 542, 546]\n\u00a0\n all persons 'lawfully called, drafted, or ordered into, or to duty or for training in, the said service, from the dates they are required by the terms of the call, draft or order to obey the same.' This provision standing alone would have made petitioner subject to military law from August 12, 1942, the date when he was required by the local board to present himself for induction. That was indeed the consequence under the Selective Draft Act of 1917, 40 Stat. 76, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix  201 et seq. Franke v. Murray, 8 Cir., 248 F. 865, L.R.A.1918E, 1015; United States v. Bullard, 2 Cir., 290 F. 704; Digest Op. J.A.G. 1912-1930, Sec. 2238; 2 Op. J.A.G. (1918) 327.3; Second Report, Provost Marshal General (1918), p. 221. The Articles of War then in force (39 Stat. 651) had substantially the same provision as the present Article 2. Sec. 2 of the 1917 Act provided, moreover, that 'All persons drafted into the service of the United States ... shall, from the date of said draft or acceptance, be subject to the laws and regulations governing the Regular Army ....' 40 Stat. 78, 50 U. S.C.A.Appendix  202. And the regulations under the 1917 Act stated that when a registrant was ordered to report to a local board or a state adjutant general for duty he was 'in the military service' from and after the day and hour thus specified.  133, 159D, 159E, 159F, 159G, 161. And see United States v. McIntyre, 9 Cir., 4 F.2d 823. But the present Act and the regulations promulgated under it are differently designed.\n Sec. 3 of the Act, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix  303 provides that 'no man shall be inducted for training and service under this Act unless and until he is acceptable to the land or naval forces for such training and service and his physical and mental fitness for such training and service has been satisfactorily determined.' Moreover, as we have noted, Congress by  11 withheld from military courts martial jurisdiction over cases arising under the Act unless the person involved had been 'actually inducted' or 'unless he is subject to trial by court martial under laws in force prior to the enactment of this Act.' The 'actually inducted' \n\n[321 \nU.S. 542, 547]\n\u00a0\n clause of  11 was offered as an amendment on the floor of the Senate by Senator Bone. 86 Cong.Rec. 10895. It was designed, as stated by the Senate conferees, to give civil courts jurisdiction over violations of the Act prior to induction for training in substitution for the House provisions that civil and military courts should have concurrent jurisdiction in such cases. 86 Cong.Rec. 11710, 12039, 12084. In view of this legislative history the Congress can hardly be presumed to have restored by the second 'unless' clause in  11 what it took away by the first 'unless' clause. That is to say,  11 of the Act read together with  3 indicates to us a purpose to vest in the civil courts exclusive jurisdiction over all violations of the Act prior to actual induction. It is suggested, however, that prior to that time a selectee may be subject to military jurisdiction by reason of Art. 2 of the Articles of War and be prosecuted before courts martial for all offenses proscribed by the Articles, provided those acts are not made criminal by the Act. Under that view a selectee who failed to report for induction (Bowles v. United States, \n319 \nU.S. 33\n, 63 S.Ct. 912) or who having reported, refused to be examined (United States v. Collura, 2 Cir., 139 F.2d 345) could be prosecuted for such offenses only in civil courts.  11. But since by Art. 2 he became a soldier when ordered to report, he could be prosecuted by the military for those offenses which were proscribed by the Articles of War but not by the Act.\n We think that is too narrow a reading of  11 of the Act. As we pointed out in Falbo v. United States, \n320 \nU.S. 549, 552\n, 64 S.Ct. 346, 347, the mobilization program established by the Selective Service System is designed to operate 'as one continuous process for the selection of men for national service'-a process in which the civil and military agencies perform integrated functions. The examination of men at induction centers and their acceptance or rejection are parts of that process. Induction marks its \n\n[321 \nU.S. 542, 548]\n\u00a0\n end. But prior to that time a selectee is still subject to the Act and not yet a soldier. A case involving his rights or duties as a selectee prior to that event is a case arising under the Act. The civil authorities not the military are charged with the duties of enforcement at that stage of the process. That necessarily means that the measure of a selectee's rights and duties is to be found in the Act not in the Articles of War. For  16(a) of the Act, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix  316(a), suspends all laws or parts thereof which are in conflict with its provisions.\n We are supported in that view by the administrative construction of the Act. The regulations promulgated under it define a 'delinquent' as one who is 'liable for training and service' under the Act and 'who fails or neglects to perform any duty required of him' by the Act or the regulations made pursuant thereto.  601.5. And Part 642, which contains detailed provisions concerning the rights and duties of 'delinquents', provides: 'Every registrant who has heretofore or who hereafter fails to comply with an Order to Report for Induction or an Order to Report for Work of National Importance shall be reported promptly to the United States Attorney ...; provided that if the local board believes that by reasonable effort it may be able to locate the registrant and secure his compliance, it may delay the mailing of such Delinquent Registrant Report for a period not in excess of 30 days.'  642.41(a). Moreover,  642.42(a) provides: 'After a delinquent has been reported to the United States Attorney, it is the responsibility of the United States Attorney to determine whether he shall be prosecuted. Before permitting such a delinquent to be inducted or assigned to work of national importance, the local board should obtain the views of the United States Attorney concerning such action.' We will develop shortly the place of such regulations in the Selective Service System. It is sufficient at this point to \n\n[321 \nU.S. 542, 549]\n\u00a0\n note that the regulations treat the problems of 'delinquents' as matters exclusively for the civil authorities. \n2\n We cannot believe that the Act would have been given that construction if, as is now contended, the selectee became subject to even a limited military jurisdiction prior to induction.\n\n\n II.\n\n\n Respondent argues in the second place that petitioner became a soldier when the Army accepted him after his examinations were completed. That argument is based largely on the War Department Regulations.\n The War Department Regulations3 in force in August, 1942, ( Mobilization Regulations No. 1-7, October 1, 1940) provided in Sec. II, par. 6, that 'The function of the induction station is to provide the final examinations for registrants selected for induction and the induction of those acceptable to the Army.' Sec. II, par. 13(e) entitled 'induction ceremony' provided: 'All men successfully passing the \n\n[321 \nU.S. 542, 550]\n\u00a0\n physical examination will be immediately inducted into the Army. The induction will be performed by an officer in a short, dignified ceremony in which the men are administered the oath, AW 109: 'I, _ _, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the United States of America; that I will serve them honestly and faithfully against all their enemies whomsoever; and that I will obey the orders of the President of the United States and the orders of the officers appointed over me, according to the rules and Articles of War.' They will be informed that they are now members of the Army of the United States and given an explanation of their obligations and privileges. In the event of refusal to take an oath (or affirmation) by any individual he will not be required to receive it, but will be informed that this action does not alter in any respect his obligation to the United States.'\n The argument is that since the Army Regulations do not condition a selectee's entry into the Army on his subscribing to the oath,4 induction must take place at some anterior point of time. It is said that while  3 of the Act provides that a selectee shall not be inducted 'until he is acceptable' to the Army, there is nothing in the Act which postpones induction beyond that time. The induction ceremony described in Sec. II, par. 13(e) of the regulations is said to be a formal exercise which solemnifies the occasion and during which the soldier is advised concerning his obligations and responsibilities to the United States. See United States v. Smith, D.C., 47 F.Supp. 607. The statement in Sec. II, par. 13(e), that those who pass the examination 'will be immediately inducted into the Army' is read to mean that selectees \n\n[321 \nU.S. 542, 551]\n\u00a0\n shall thereupon be accepted as soldiers. A statement by an officer in authority that they are accepted, followed by the reading of the oath and such other explanation as may be required completes the ceremony.\n That view finds support in informal rulings of the Judge Advocate General's office. \n5\n And War Department Regulations have the force of law as we recently had occasion to reaffirm in Standard Oil Co. v. Johnson, \n316 \nU.S. 481, 484\n, 62 S.Ct. 1168, 1170\n\n\n But that circumstance is complicated here by the division of jurisdiction between the civil and military authorities which the Act creates. The President is authorized 'to select and induct' men into the armed forces 'in the manner provided in this Act'.  3(a). No man shall be 'inducted for training and service under this Act unless and until he is acceptable' to the armed services.  3(a). And the civil authorities retain jurisdiction over him until \n\n[321 \nU.S. 542, 552]\n\u00a0\n he is 'actually inducted'.  11. Thus it seems clear, as we have already said, that the Act, rather than the War Department Regulations or the Articles of War, determines the rights and duties of selectees, as distinguished from inducted men. The manner and method of effecting an induction into the Army are thus left for the War Department. But the power of the President under the Act 'to select and induct' men includes the power to determine when the selective process is completed. It is only after that process is finished that a selectee is eligible for induction.\n That view runs throughout the Selective Service Regulations promulgated under the Act. They are the regulations which have special relevancy here. The rule-making power under the Act is vested in the President.  10(a)(1), 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix  310(a)(1). The President in turn is given the power to delegate that authority. \n6\n  10(b). And during the period here in question, as at the present time,7 the President had delegated it to the Director of Selective Service. Exec. Order, No. 8545, Sept. 23, 1940, 5 Fed.Reg., pp. 3779, 3781. The Act and the regulations promulgated under it give the selective process its integrated nature. Falbo v. United States, supra. They determine the role which the military as well as the civilian authorities are to play in the administrative process of selection. Id. As in other instances (United States v. American Trucking Ass'n, \n310 \nU.S. 534, 549\n, 60 S.Ct. 1059, 1067; Gray v. Powell, \n314 \nU.S. 402\n, 62 S.Ct. 326) the interpretations of an Act of Congress by those \n\n[321 \nU.S. 542, 553]\n\u00a0\n charged with its administration are entitled to persuasive weight.\n As we have said, the Selective Service Regulations support our interpretation of the Act. Thus it is provided that while a selectee is appealing or otherwise contesting his classification, his induction shall be stayed.  625.3, 626.14, 627.41, 628.7. And, as we have noted, when a 'delinquent' has been reported to a United States Attorney, the local board shall not order him to report for induction without obtaining the views of the United States Attorney. These provisions, as well as those governing the control of the local boards over the orders to report for induction, which we will come to shortly, are framed on the theory that the time when a selectee's status may change from civilian to soldier is subject to the terms and requirements of the Act. Thus they confirm our construction of the Act.\n The Selective Service Regulations also draw a distinction between acceptance (or being found acceptable) by the Army and induction. During the period here in question an inducted man was defined as 'a man who has become a member of the land or naval forces through the operation of the Selective Service System.' 32 Code Fed.Reg. 1941 Supp.  601.7. Induction station was defined as any camp, etc. 'at which selected men are received by the military authorities and, if found acceptable, are inducted into military service.'  601.8. And though the regulation governing the reception of selected men at the induction station referred to their treatment 'pending their induction or rejection' ( 633.8), 'induction' was not otherwise used in the sense of 'acceptance'. For it was defined in the very next regulation in the following manner: 'Induction. At the induction station, the selected men found acceptable will be inducted into the land or naval forces.'  633.9. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 542, 554]\n\u00a0\n These regulations thus suggest that induction follows acceptance and is a separate process. Read in that light the War Department Regulations may be reconciled with the regulations under the Act. For as we have seen, the War Department provided by regulation at the time Billings appeared at Fort Leavenworth that the 'induction will be performed by an officer in a short, dignified ceremony in which the men are administered the oath', etc . (Italics added.)\n We are confirmed in this conclusion by recent amendments both to the Army Regulations and to the Selective Service Regulations. The Army Regulations, as amended March 30, 1943, now state respecting the 'induction ceremony', that 'The induction will be performed by an officer who, prior to administering the oath, will give the men about to be inducted a short patriotic talk' (italics added). This makes unambiguous the fair inference in the earlier Army Regulations that selectees were inducted by the ceremony and not before it.\n Moreover, the Selective Service Regulations have been amended in recent months so as to provide for preinduction physical examinations before a registrant 'is ordered to report for induction.'  629.1. As under the former regulations, the group to be forwarded for examination by the military authorities is assembled by the local board and given certain instructions and credentials.  629.22. Registrants in certain classes 'may be inducted into service at the induction station upon being found qualified for service', provided they make written request of their boards and provided there is no appeal pending in their cases and the appeal period has expired.  629.23. All other registrants who are given the preinduction examination are returned to their local board when the examination is completed.  629.22(e). Those found acceptable by the Army or Navy are later ordered to report for induction.  632.1 et seq. Local boards, in filling \n\n[321 \nU.S. 542, 555]\n\u00a0\n calls received, are authorized to allow twenty-one days before induction to those who 'have been found to be acceptable to the Army.'  632.4. This takes the place of the earlier system whereby selectees were first inducted and then given, if they desired, furloughs to attend to their personal affairs. Army Reg. No. 615-500, September 1, 1942, Sec. II, par. 16.\n We mention these recent regulations because they perpetuate the distinction between acceptance or being found acceptable and induction which appeared in the regulations when Billings reported at the induction station. That these amendments do not effect any change in the concept of 'induction' is apparent from the fact that its definition has remained practically the same from the time when Billings reported at the induction station to the present time. \n8\n It could hardly be maintained that a selectee who has passed his preinduction physical examination but who has not been ordered to report for induction is subject to military jurisdiction. And it would not seem permissible to hold that he who failed to report for induction at the end of the so-called twenty-one day furlough period could be prosecuted by a court martial because he had been 'actually inducted' within the meaning of  11. But if that is true, it is difficult to see why there would be a difference in result if the interval between the time when he is found acceptable or is accepted and the ceremony of induction were only a few minutes, as in the present case, rather than a few weeks. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 542, 556]\n\u00a0\n III.\n It is finally contended, as the Circuit Court of Appeals held, that petitioner was inducted when the oath was read to him and he was told that he was in the Army. At that time he had been placed under guard and was retained against his will. But the argument is that the military has authority to exercise force for the purpose of inducting selectees into the service.\n We have no doubt of the power of Congress to enlist the man-power of the nation for prosecution of the war and to subject to military jurisdiction those who are unwilling, as well as those who are eager, to come to the defense of their nation in its hour of peril. Arver v. United States, \n245 \nU.S. 366\n, 38 S.Ct. 159, L.R.A.1918C, 361, Ann. Cas.1918B, 856. But Congress did not choose that course in the present emergency. It imposed a separate penalty on those who defied the law- prosecution by the civil authorities and a maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment or a $10,000 fine or both.  11. We say that that penalty was aimed at those who defied the law, though in the words of  11 it includes, of course, only those who have not been 'actually inducted'. But we give 'inducted' the meaning it has in the Act and in the regulations. As we have pointed out, an inducted man is defined by the Selective Service Regulations as one 'who has become a member of the land or naval forces through the operation of the Selective Service System.'  601.7. That suggests that he becomes 'actually inducted' within the meaning of the Act by submitting to the Selective Service System. The fact that he is not a volunteer is, of course, irrelevant as the Act was designed as a 'fair and just system of selective compulsory military training and service.'  1(b), 50 U.S.C.A. Appendix,  301(b). But induction under the Act and the present regulations is the end product of submission to the selective process and compliance with the orders of the local board. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 542, 557]\n\u00a0\n It must be remembered that  11 imposes on a selectee a criminal penalty for any failure 'to perform any duty required of him under or in the execution' of the Act or 'rules or regulations made pursuant thereto.' He who reports to the induction station but refuses to be inducted violates  11 of the Act as clearly as one who refuses to report at all. United States v. Collura, supra. The order of the local board to report for induction includes a command to submit to induction. Though that command was formerly implied,9 it is now express. The Selective Service Regulations state that it is the 'duty' of a registrant who receives from his local board an order to report for induction 'to appear at the place where his induction will be accomplished', 'to obey the orders of the representatives of the armed forces while at the place where his induction will be accomplished', and 'to submit to induction'.  633.21(b). Thus it is clear that a refusal to submit to induction is a violation of the Act rather than a military order. The offense is complete before induction and while the selectee retains his civilian status. That circumstance throws light on the meaning of the words 'actually inducted' as used in  11 of the Act. Congress by accepting the Bone amendment to  11 specified the maximum penalty to be imposed on those who violated the Act or disobeyed an order of their board prior to their induction. \n10\n It also withheld from military courts \n\n[321 \nU.S. 542, 558]\n\u00a0\n jurisdiction over those offenders. At the same time Congress did not authorize the Army to search out delinquents wherever they might be and induct them without more. We must therefore assume that Congress as a matter of policy decided that those who disobeyed the order of their board and refused to be inducted were to be punished by the civil authorities and by them alone. \n11\n If forcible seizure or detention of such offenders by the Army were sanctioned, the Congressional policy of providing the maximum punishment for their delinquency would be undermined.\n Moreover, it should be remembered that he who reports at the induction station is following the procedure outlined in the Falbo case for the exhaustion of his administrative remedies. Unless he follows that procedure he may not challenge the legality of his classification in the courts. But we can hardly say that he must report to the military in order to exhaust his administrative remedies and then say that if he does so report he may be forcibly inducted against his will. That would indeed make a trap of the Falbo case by subjecting those who reported \n\n[321 \nU.S. 542, 559]\n\u00a0\n for completion of the Selective Service process to more severe penalties than those who stayed away in defiance of the board's order to report.\n These considerations together indicate to us that a selectee becomes 'actually inducted' within the meaning of  11 of the Act when in obedience to the order of his board and after the Army has found him acceptable for service he undergoes whatever ceremony or requirements of admission the War Department has prescribed.\n We are not concerned with the wisdom of either the 'actually inducted' clause in  11 or the procedure for selection and induction which has been prescribed under the Act. Nor is it for us to decide whether the maximum penalty provided by Congress is adequate for those who flout the Act while the nation fights for its very existence. But where Congress has drawn the line between civil and military jurisdiction it is our duty to respect it.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS is of the view that the judgment should be affirmed for the reasons stated in the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals, 10 Cir., 135 F.2d 505.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER.\n Under the Selective Service Act of 1940 unlike that of 1917, a selectee is not subject to trial by a military court martial until he has been 'actually inducted' for training and service. But Congress did not define when he was so 'inducted'. It thus left to judicial construction when the civilian status ceased and the military status began. In a matter of this sort, involving as it does the process of compulsory recruiting of the nation's Army in the midst of war, it is of vital importance that the line be drawn as definitely as the legislation reasonably permits in order that ambiguity and controversy be reduced to a minimum. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 542, 560]\n\u00a0\n In the Falbo case we held the other day that 'The connected series of steps into the national service which begins with registration with the local board does not end until the registrant is accepted by the army .... ' \n320 \nU.S. 549, 553\n, 64 S.Ct. 346, 348. The line that was thus drawn-when 'the connected series of steps' has ended-seems to me to be the line to draw between the civil and military status of a registrant. In other words, when acceptance of a registrant is communicated by the Army, the Army has made its choice. The man is then in the Army. Such was the ruling, and I believe the correct ruling, of the court below. 135 F.2d 505. According to the Court's opinion, as I understand it, the Act itself does not draw this line but Congress has authorized such a line to be drawn by appropriate regulations. On that assumption, I do not dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 11 so far as material here provides: 'Any person ... who in any manner shall knowingly fail or neglect to perform any duty required of him under or in the execution of this Act, or rules or regulations made pursuant to this Act ... shall, upon conviction in the district court of the United States having jurisdiction thereof, be punished by imprisonment for not more than five years or a fine of not more than $10,000, or by both such fine and imprisonment, or if subject to military or naval law may be tried by court martial, and, on conviction, shall suffer such punishment as a court martial may direct. No person shall be tried by any military or naval court martial in any case arising under this Act unless such person has been actually inducted for the training and service prescribed under this Act or unless he is subject to trial by court martial under laws in force prior to the enactment of this Act.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] While the regulations governing 'delinquents' cited in the text are those presently in force, the ones in effect at the time of Billings' refusal to be inducted were of the same tenor and were then included in  601.5,  642.4,  642.5.\n It should also be noted that these regulations contain detailed provision for the parole of persons convicted of violations of the Act.  643.1 et seq. Those required to register under the Act may be paroled by the Attorney General on the recommendation of the Director of Selective Service for induction or for other assignments.  643.2. The Attorney General has the power to impose 'such terms and conditions as he may deem proper' upon the parolee and shall supervise him, and may suspend or revoke the parole, except when the parolee is 'in the active land or naval forces of the United States.'  643.8, 643.9. And Army Regulations No. 615-500, Sec. II, par. 7(b)(5) provide that registrants convicted of violation of the Act 'will be accepted for induction at any time,' provided the Attorney General of the United States has granted parole 'for the purpose of induction.' \n[\nFootnote 3\n] These were superseded September 1, 1942, by Army Regulations No. 615-500. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The case of a selectee is distinguished from that of an enlistee who is required by Art. 109 of the Articles of War to take the oath, 10 U. S.C.A.  1581. Identical requirements in the predecessor Articles of War applicable to enlistees were construed as inapplicable to draftees under the Selective Draft Act of 1917. See 1 Op. J.A.G. 169 (1917); Franke v. Murray, supra, 248 F. at pages 868, 869, L.R.A.1918E, 1015. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The following propositions were submitted to the Chief, Military Affairs Section of the Judge Advocate General's office: '1. That the only purpose of the administration of the oath as set out in MR 1-7, Paragraph 13e, is for the purpose of informing the individual of his obligations and responsibilities to the United States of America, and his acquiescence in, or acknowledgement of this obligation, by some overt act indicating acceptance thereof is immaterial. 2. That induction is complete immediately upon full acceptance of the individual by the government. The oath or any act or requirement thereafter is ministerial only and is not necessary to the completion of induction. 3. For induction no acquiescence or acceptance on the part of the individual is required.'\n On June 6, 1941, the following informal ruling was made: 'Generally speaking, the above-quoted conclusions are believed to be sound, and it therefore follows that a refusal on the part of a selectee to take the prescribed oath does not legally affect the validity of his induction.' We are advised by the Judge Advocate General on February 4, 1944, in a supplemental memorandum filed by the Solicitor General that although that opinion was expressed informally by letter and not in a formal opinion it 'represented the views of The Judge Advocate General' and that those views 'have not been modified and are hereby adhered to.' \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Sec. 10(b) as originally enacted contained no limitation as to the persons to whom that authority might be delegated. But by the Act of December 5, 1943, 57 Stat. 598,  10(b), 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix  310(b) was amended to read: 'The President is authorized to delegate to the Director of Selective Service only, any authority vested in him under this Act ( except section 9).' \n[\nFootnote 7\n] See Exec. Order No. 9410, December 23, 1943, 8 Fed.Reg. 17319. \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] As we have indicated the Selective Service Regulations in  633.9 defined 'induction' at the time Billings reported to the induction station as follows: 'At the induction station, the selected men found acceptable will be inducted into the land or naval forces.' At the present time  633. 25 defines 'induction' as follows: 'At the Army Reception Center, the Navy Recruiting Station, or the induction station, as the case may be, the selected men who have been forwarded for induction and found acceptable will be inducted into the land or naval forces.' \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] See  633.1, 633.2, 633.6 in force in August, 1942. \n[\nFootnote 10\n] The Conference Report stated: 'The Senate bill provided that persons subject to the bill who fail to report for duty as ordered should be tried exclusively in the district courts of the United States and not by military and naval courts martial, unless such persons had actually been inducted for the training and service prescribed in the bill or unless they were subject to trial by court martial under laws in force prior to the enactment of the bill. The House amendment in such cases gave the courts martial and the district courts concurrent jurisdiction, and made failure of persons to report for duty subject to the laws and regulations concerning that branch of the land and naval forces to which they were assigned from the date they were required by the terms of the order to obey the same, even though they had not actually been inducted.\n'The conference agreement contains the provisions of the Senate bill in this respect.' 86 Cong.Rec. 12039. \n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] It is true that for other purposes Congress has treated selectees who are ordered to report for induction the same as those in military service. Thus the benefits of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940 (50 U.S.C.Appendix  501 et seq., 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix  501 et seq ., 54 Stat. 1178), which originally obtained only to 'persons in the military service', were extended by an Act of October 6, 1942, to selectees from the date of receiving an order to report until the time of actually reporting for induction. 50 U.S.C.A.pp.Supp. II,  516, 50 U.S.C. A.Appendix  516, 56 Stat. 770. But, as we have pointed out, the Selective Service Act and the regulations under it have not made the selectee's civilian status change to that of soldier at either point of time. \n\n\n\n\n","13":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBOSTON TOW BOAT CO. v.

Cornell Steamboat Company v. United States, \n321 \nU.S. 634\n, 64 S.Ct. 768. When Cornell attacked the Commission's order in the District Court, Boston again intervened. 53 F.Supp. 349. Its petition for intervention, granted by the District Court, alleged that it operated tugboats in and about Boston harbor which rendered services somewhat similar to those rendered by Cornell in New York harbor; that Division 4 of the Commission had held it, Boston, covered by the Act; that it was aggrieved by the Commission's decision against Cornell 'insofar as said decision holds that towers for hire are carriers and subject to the terms and provisions of Part III of the Interstate Commerce Act'; and that it desired to participate in the District Court proceedings 'solely for the purpose of asserting ... its said contentions regarding such jurisdictional issue.' Boston's petition did not allege, and the record fails to show, that it had any financial interest in Cornell, or was engaged in competition with Cornell, or that its interests would be adversely affected by a decision against Cornell except insofar as that decision might establish a precedent holding tugboats subject to the Commission's jurisdiction under Part III of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.A.  901 et seq. Boston's brief in this Court asserts that it has pending in the District Court for the District of Massachusetts a suit to enjoin and set aside the Commission's order holding Boston covered by the Act. In its brief Boston expressly seeks to reserve the right to contend in the Massachusetts proceeding 'that the facts underlying its own towing operations are such as to bring the question of its status outside the scope of that of a carrier.'\n We are of opinion that Boston's interest in the outcome of the Cornell litigation is insufficient to entitle it to take a separate appeal. See Judicial Code,  210, 212, as \n\n[321 \nU.S. 632, 634]\n\u00a0\n amended 28 U.S.C.A.  45a, 47a. Whether Boston had sufficient interest to intervene as of right before the Commission and in the District Court we need not decide, the issue here being only whether Boston has such an 'independent right which is violated' by the decision against Cornell as will support an independent appeal.

The state court issued, ex parte, a temporary injunction and a show cause order. Thereupon appellant, Administrator of the Office of Price Administration, brought this suit in the federal District Court pursuant to  205(a) of the Act and  24(1) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.A.  41(1), to restrain Mrs. Willingham from further prosecution of the state proceedings and from violation of the Act, and to restrain appellee Hicks, Bibb County sheriff, from executing or attempting to execute any orders in the state proceedings. The District Court, 51 F.Supp. 597, in reliance on its earlier ruling in Payne v. Griffin, 51 F.Supp. 588, dismissed the Administrator's suit on bill and answer, holding that the orders in question and the provisions of the Act on which they rested were unconstitutional. The case is here on direct appeal. 50 Stat. 752, 28 U.S. C.  349a, 28 U.S.C.A.  349a.\n Sec. 2(b) of the Act provides in part that, 'Whenever in the judgment of the Administrator such action is necessary or proper in order to effectuate the purposes of this Act, he shall issue a declaration setting forth the neces- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 503, 506]\n\u00a0\n sity for, and recommendations with reference to, the stabilization or reduction of rents for any defense area housing accommodations within a particular defense-rental area.' Pursuant to that authority the Administrator on April 28, 1942, issued a declaration designating twenty- eight areas in various parts of the country, including Macon, Georgia, as defense-rental areas. 7 Fed.Reg. 3193. That declaration stated that defense activities had resulted in increased housing rents in those areas1 and that it was necessary and proper in order to effectuate the purposes of the Act to stabilize and reduce such rents. It also contained a recommendation pursuant to  2(b) that the maximum rent for housing accommodations rented on April 1, 1941, should be the rental for such accommodations on that date;2 and that in case of accom- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 503, 507]\n\u00a0\n modations not rented on April 1, 1941, or constructed thereafter provisions for the determination, adjustment, and modification of maximum rents should be made, such rents to be in principle no greater than the generally prevailing rents in the particular area on April 1, 1941. The declaration also stated in accordance with the provisions of  2(b)3 that if within sixty days after April 28, 1942, such rents within the areas in question had not been \n\n[321 \nU.S. 503, 508]\n\u00a0\n stabilized or reduced by state or local regulation or otherwise in accordance with the Administrator's recommendation, the Administrator might fix the maximum rents.\n On June 30, 1942, the Administrator issued Maximum Rent Regulation No. 26, effective July 1, 1942, establishing the maximum legal rents for housing in these defense areas, including Macon, Georgia. 7 Fed.Reg. 4905. It recited that the rentals had not been reduced or stabilized since the declaration of April 28, 1942, and that defense activities had resulted in increases in the rentals on or about April 1, 1941, but not prior to that date. The maximum rentals fixed for housing accommodations rented on April 1, 1941 were the rents obtained on that date.  1388.1704(a). As respects housing accommodations not rented on April 1, 1941, but rented for the first time between that date and the effective date of the regulation, July 1, 1942-the situation involved in this case-it was provided that the maximum rent should be the first rent charged after April 1, 1941.  1388. 1704(c). But in that case it was provided that the Rent Director ( designated by  1388.1713) might order a decrease on his own initiative on the ground, among others, that the rent was higher than that generally prevailing in the area for comparable housing accommodations on April 1, 1941.  1388.1704(c),  1388.1705(c)(1). By Procedural Regulation No. 3, as amended (8 Fed.Reg. 526, 1798, 3534, 5481, 14811) issued pursuant to  201(d) and  203(a) of the Act4 provision was made that when the Rent Direc- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 503, 509]\n\u00a0\n tor proposed to take such action he should serve a notice upon the landlord involved, stating the proposed action and the grounds therefor.  1300.207. Within 60 days of the final action of the Rent Director the landlord might file an application for review by the regional administrator for the region in which the defense-rental area office was located and then file a protest with the Administrator for review of the action of the regional office ( 1300.209,  1300.210); or he might proceed by protest immediately.  1300.209,  1300.215. As we develop more fully hereafter, the Act provides in  203(a) for the filing of protests with the Administrator. The machinery for a hearing on a protest and a determination of the issue by the Administrator ( 1300.215-s 1300.240) was designed to provide the basis of judicial review by the Emergency Court of Appeals as authorized by  204(a) of the Act.\n In June, 1943, the Rent Director gave written notice to Mrs. Willingham that he proposed to decrease the maximum rents for three apartments owned by her, and which had not been rented on April 1, 1941, but were first rented in the summer of 1941, on the ground that the first rents for these apartments received after April 1, 1941 were in excess of those generally prevailing in the area for comparable accommodations on April 1, 1941. Mrs. Willingham filed objections to that proposed action together with supporting affidavits. The Rent Director thereupon ad- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 503, 510]\n\u00a0\n vised her that he would proceed to issue an order reducing the rents. Before that wad done she filed her bill in the Georgia court. The present suit followed shortly, as we have said.\n I. We are met at the outset with the question whether the District Court could in any event give the relief which the Administrator seeks in view of  265 of the Judicial Code, 36 Stat. 1162, 28 U.S.C.  379, 28 U.S. C.A.  379, which provides that 'The writ of injunction shall not be granted by any court of the United States to stay proceedings in any court of a State, except in cases where such injunction may be authorized by any law relating to proceedings in bankruptcy.' We recently had occasion to consider the history of  265 and the exceptions which have been engrafted on it. Toucey v. New York Life Ins. Co., \n314 \nU.S. 118\n, 62 S.Ct. 139, 137 A.L.R. 967. In that case we listed the few Acts of Congress passed since its first enactment in 1793 which operate as implied legislative amendments to it. 314 U.S. pages 132-134, 62 S.Ct. pages 143, 144, 137 A.L.R. 967. There should now be added to that list the exception created by the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942. By  205( a) the Administrator is given authority to seek injunctive relief in the appropriate court (including the federal district courts) against acts or practices in violation of  4, e.g., the receipt of rent in violation of any regulation or order under  2. Moreover, by  204(d) of the Act one who seeks to restrain or set aside any order of the Administrator or any provision of the Act is confined to the judicial review granted to the Emergency Court of Appeals, which was created by  204(c) and to this Court. \n5\n As \n\n[321 \nU.S. 503, 511]\n\u00a0\n we recently held in Lockerty v. Philips, \n319 \nU.S. 182, 186\n, 187 S., 63 S.Ct. 1019, 1021, 1022, Congress confined jurisdiction to grant equitable relief to that narrow channel and withheld such jurisdiction from every other federal and state court. Congress thus preempted jurisdiction in favor of the Emergency Court to the exclusion of state courts. \n6\n The rule expressed in  265 which is designed to avoid collisions between state and federal authorities (Toucey v. New York Life Ins. Co., supra) thus does not come into play. The powers of the District Court under  205(a) of the Act and  24(1) of the Judicial Code are ample authority for that court to protect the exclusive federal jurisdiction which Congress created.\n The suggestion is made that Congress could not constitutionally withhold from the courts of the States jurisdiction to entertain suits attacking the Act on constitutional grounds. But we have here a controversy which arises under the Constitution and laws of the United States and is therefore within the judicial power of the United States ad defined in Art. III,  2 of the Constitu- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 503, 512]\n\u00a0\n tion. Hence Congress could determine whether the federal courts which it established should have exclusive jurisdiction of such cases or whether they should exercise that jurisdiction concurrently with the courts of the States. Plaquemines Tropical Fruit Co. v. Henderson, \n170 \nU.S. 511, 517\n, 18 S.Ct. 685, 687; The Moses Taylor, 4 Wall. 411, 428-430. And see State of Tennessee v. Davis, \n100 \nU.S. 257\n; McKay v. Kalyton, \n204 \nU.S. 458, 468\n, 469 S., 27 S.Ct. 346, 349, 350. Under the present Act all jurisdiction has not been withheld from state courts, since they have concurrent jurisdiction over all civil enforcement suits brought by the Administrator.  205(c). But the authority of Congress to withhold all jurisdiction from the state courts obviously includes the power to restrict the occasions when that jurisdiction may be invoked.\n II. The question of the constitutionality of the rent control provisions of the Act7 raises issues related to those considered in Yakus v. United States (Rottenberg v. United States), \n321 \nU.S. 414\n, 64 S.Ct. 660.\n When it came to rents Congress pursued the policy it adopted respecting commodity prices. It established standards for administrative action and left with the Administrator the decision when the rent controls of the Act should be invoked. He is empowered to fix maximum rents for housing accommodations in any defense rental area,8 whenever in his judgment that action is necessary or proper in order to effectuate the purpose of the Act. A defense-rental area is any area 'designated by the Administrator as an area where defense activities have re- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 503, 513]\n\u00a0\n sulted or threaten to result in an increase in the rents for housing accommodations inconsistent with the purposes' of the Act.  302(d). The controls adopted by Congress were thought necessary 'in the interest of the national defense and security' and for the 'effective prosecution of the present war.' Sec. 1(a). They have as their aim the effective protection of our price structures against the forces of disorganization and the pressures created by war and its attendant activities. \n9\n s 1(a); S. Rep. No. 931, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 1-5. Thus the policy of the Act is clear. The maximum rents fixed by the Administrator are those which 'in his judgment' will be 'generally fair and equitable and will effectuate the purposes of this Act.'  2(b). But Congress did not leave the Administrator with that general standard; it supplied criteria for its application by stating that so far as practicable the Administrator in establishing any maximum rent \n\n[321 \nU.S. 503, 514]\n\u00a0\n should ascertain and give consideration to the rents prevailing for the accommodations, or comparable ones, on April 1, 1941. The Administrator, however, may choose an earlier or later date if defense activities have caused increased rents prior or subsequent to April 1, 1941. But in no event may the Administrator select a date earlier than April 1, 1940. And in determining a maximum rent 'he shall make adjustments for such relevant factors as he may determine and deem to be of general applicability in respect of such accommodations, including increases or decreases in property taxes and other costs.'  2(b). And Congress has provided that the Administrator 'may provide for such adjustments and reasonable exceptions' as in his judgment are 'necessary or proper in order to effectuate the purposes of this Act.'  2(c).\n The considerations which support the delegation of authority under this Act over commodity prices (Yakus v. United States) are equally applicable here. The power to legislate which the Constitution says 'shall be vested' in Congress (Art. I,  1) has not been granted to the Administrator. Congress in  1(a) of the Act has made clear its policy of waging war on inflation. In  2(b) it has defined the circumstances when its announced policy is to be declared operative and the method by which it is to be effectuated. Those steps constitute the performance of the legislative function in the constitutional sense. Opp Cotton Mills, Inc. v. Administrator, \n312 \nU.S. 126, 144\n, 657 S., 61 S.Ct. 524, 532.\n There is no grant of unbridled administrative discretion as appellee argues. Congress has not told the Administrator to fix rents whenever and wherever he might like and at whatever levels he pleases. Congress has directed that maximum rents be fixed in those areas where defense activities have resulted or threaten to result in increased rentals inconsistent with the purpose of the Act. And it has supplied the standard and the base period to guide the Administrator in determining what the maximum rentals should \n\n[321 \nU.S. 503, 515]\n\u00a0\n be in a given area. The criteria to guide the Administrator are certainly not more vague than the standards governing the determination by the Secretary of Agriculture in United States v. Rock Royal Cooperative, Inc., \n307 \nU.S. 533, 576\n, 577 S., 59 S.Ct. 993, 1014, of marketing areas and minimum prices for milk. The question of how far Congress should go in filling in the details of the standards which its administrative agency is to apply raises large issues of policy. Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins, \n310 \nU.S. 381, 398\n, 60 S.Ct. 907, 914. We recently stated in connection with this problem of delegation, 'The Constitution, viewed as a continuously operative charter of government, is not to be interpreted as demanding the impossible or the impracticable.' Opp Cotton Mills, Inc. v. Administrator, supra, page 145, 61 S.Ct. page 533. In terms of hard-headed practicalities Congress frequently could not perform its functions if it were required to make an appraisal of the myriad of facts applicable to varying situations, by area throughout the land, and then to determine in each case what should be done. Congress does not abdicate its functions when it describes what job must be done, who must do it, and what is the scope of his authority. In our complex economy that indeed is frequently the only way in which the legislative process can go forward. Whether a particular grant of authority to an officer or agency is wise or unwise, raises questions which are none of our concern. Our inquiry ends with the constitutional issue. Congress here has specified the basic conclusions of fact upon the ascertainment of which by the Administrator its statutory command is to become effective. But that is not all. The Administrator on the denial of protests must inform the protestant of the 'grounds upon which' the decision is based and of any 'economic data and other facts of which the Administrator has taken official notice.'  203(a). These materials and the grounds for decision which they furnished are included in the transcript on which judicial review is based.  204(a). We fail to see how more \n\n[321 \nU.S. 503, 516]\n\u00a0\n could be required (Taylor v. Brown, Em.App., 137 F.2d 654, 658, 659) unless we were to say that Congress rather than the Administrator should determine the exact rentals which Mrs. Willingham might exact.\n As we have pointed out and as more fully developed in Yakus v. United States, supra,  203(a) of the Act provides for the filing of a protest with the Administrator against any regulation or order under  2. Moreover, any person 'aggrieved' may secure judicial review of the action of the Administrator in the Emergency Court of Appeals.  204(a). And that review is on a transcript which includes 'a statement setting forth, so far as practicable, the economic data and other facts of which the Administrator has taken official notice.'  204(a). Here, as in the Yakus case, the standards prescribed by the Act are adequate for the judicial review which has been accorded. The fact that there is a zone for the exercise of discretion by the Administrator is no more fatal here than in other situations where Congress has prescribed the general standard and has left to an administrative agency the determination of the precise situations to which the provisions of the Act will be applied and the weight to be accorded various statutory criteria on given facts. Opp Cotton Mills, Inc. v. Administrator, supra; Yakus v. United States, supra.\n Thus so far as delegation of authority is concerned, the rent control provisions of the Act, like the price control provisions (Yakus v. United States, supra), meet the requirements which this Court has previously held to be adequate for peace-time legislation.\n III. It is said, however, that  2(b) of the Act is unconstitutional because it requires the Administrator to fix maximum rents which are 'generally fair and equitable.' The argument is that a rental which is 'generally fair and equitable' may be most unfair and inequitable as applied to a particular landlord and that a statute which does not \n\n[321 \nU.S. 503, 517]\n\u00a0\n provide for a fair rental to each landlord is unconstitutional. During the first World War the statute for the control of rents in the District of Columbia provided machinery for securing to a landlord a reasonable rental. Block v. Hirsh, \n256 \nU.S. 135, 157\n, 41 S.Ct. 458, 460, 16 A.L. R. 165. And see Edgar A. Levy Leasing Co. v. Siegel, \n258 \nU.S. 242\n, 42 S.Ct. 289. And under other price-fixing statutes such as the Natural Gas Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 821, 15 U.S.C.  717 et seq., 15 U.S.C.A .  717 et seq., Congress has provided for the fixing of rates which are just and reasonable in their application to particular persons or companies. Federal Power Commission v. Hope Natural Gas Co., \n320 \nU.S. 591\n, 64 S.Ct. 281. Congress departed from that pattern when it came to the present Act. It has been pointed out that any attempt to fix rents, landlord by landlord, as in the fashion of utility rates, would have been quite impossible. Wilson v. Brown, Em.App., 137 F.2d 348, 352-354. Such considerations of feasibility and practicality are certainly germane to the constitutional issue. Jacob Ruppert v. Caffey, \n251 \nU.S. 264, 299\n, 40 S. Ct. 141, 149; Opp Cotton Mills, Inc., v. Administrator, supra, 312 U.S. page 145, 61 S.Ct. page 532. Moreover, there would be no constitutional objection if Congress as a war emergency measure had itself fixed the maximum rents in these areas. We are not dealing here with a situation which involves a 'taking' of property. Wilson v. Brown, supra. By  4(d) of the Act it is provided that 'nothing in this Act shall be construed to require any person to sell any commodity or to offer any accommodations for rent.' There is no requirement that the apartments in question be used for purposes which bring them under the Act. Of course, price control, the same as other forms of regulation, may reduce the value of the property regulated. But, as we have pointed out in the Hope Natural Gas Co. case (320 U.S. page 601, 64 S.Ct. 281), that does not mean that the regulation is unconstitutional. Mr. Justice Holmes, speaking for the Court, stated in Block v. Hirsh, supra, 256 U.S. page 155, 41 S.Ct. page 459, 16 A.L.R. 165: 'The fact that tangible property is also visible tends to give a rigidity \n\n[321 \nU.S. 503, 518]\n\u00a0\n to our conception of our rights in it that we do not attach to others less concretely clothed. But the notion that the former are exempt from the legislative modification required from time to time in civilized life is contradicted not only by the doctrine of eminent domain, under which what is taken is paid for, but by that of the police power in its proper sense, under which property rights may be cut down, and to that extent taken, without pay.' A member of the class which is regulated may suffer economic losses not shared by others. His property may lose utility and depreciate in value as a consequence of regulation. But that has never been a barrier to the exercise of the police power. L'Hote v. New Orleans, \n177 \nU.S. 587, 598\n, 20 S.Ct. 788, 792; Welch v. Swasey, \n214 \nU.S. 91\n, 29 S. Ct. 567; Hebe Co. v. Shaw, \n248 \nU.S. 297\n, 39 S.Ct. 125; Pierce Oil Corp. v. City of Hope, \n248 \nU.S. 498\n, 39 S.Ct. 172; Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries Co., \n251 \nU.S. 146, 157\n, 40 S. Ct. 106, 108; Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., \n272 \nU.S. 365\n, 47 S.Ct. 114, 54 A.L.R. 1016; West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, \n300 \nU.S. 379\n, 57 S.Ct. 578, 108 A.L.R. 1330. And the restraints imposed on the national government in this regard by the Fifth Amendment are no greater than those imposed on the States by the Fourteenth. Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries Co., supra; United States v. Darby, \n312 \nU.S. 100, 657\n, 61 S.Ct. 451, 132 A.L.R. 1430\n\n\n It is implicit in cases such as Nebbia v. New York, \n291 \nU.S. 502\n, 54 S.Ct. 505, 89 A.L.R. 1469, which involved the power of New York to fix the minimum and maximum prices of milk, and Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins, supra, which involved the power of the Bituminous Coal Commission to fix minimum and maximum prices of bituminous coal, that high cost operators may be more seriously affected by price control than others. But it has never been thought that price-fixing, otherwise valid, was improper because it was on a class rather than an individual basis. Indeed, the decision in Munn v. Illinois, \n94 \nU.S. 113\n, the pioneer case in this Court, involved a legislative schedule of maximum prices for a defined class of warehouses and was sustained \n\n[321 \nU.S. 503, 519]\n\u00a0\n on that basis. We need not determine what constitutional limits there are to price-fixing legislation. Congress was dealing here with conditions created by activities resulting from a great war effort. Yakus v. United States, supra. A nation which can demand the lives of its men and women in the waging of that war is under no constitutional necessity of providing a system of price control on the domestic front which will assure each landlord a 'fair return' on his property.\n IV. It is finally suggested that the Act violates the Fifth Amendment because it makes no provision for a hearing to landlords before the order or regulation fixing rents becomes effective. Obviously, Congress would have been under necessity to give notice and provide a hearing before it acted, had it decided to fix rents on a national basis the same as it did for the District of Columbia. See 55 Stat. 788. We agree with the Emergency Court of Appeals (Avant v. Bowles, 139 F.2d 702) that Congress need not make that requirement when it delegates the task to an administrative agency. In Bi-Metallic Investment Co. v. State Board, \n239 \nU.S. 441\n, 36 S.Ct. 141, a suit was brought by a taxpayer and landowner to enjoin a Colorado Board from putting in effect an order which increased the valuation of all taxable property in Denver 40 per cent. Such action, it was alleged, violated the Fourteenth Amendment as the plaintiff was given no opportunity to be heard. Mr. Justice Holmes, speaking for the Court, stated, page 445 of 239 U.S., page 142 of 36 S.Ct.: 'Where a rule of conduct applies to more than a few people, it is impracticable that every one should have a direct voice in its adoption. The Constitution does not require all public acts to be done in town meeting or an assembly of the whole. General statutes within the state power are passed that affect the person or property of individuals, sometimes to be point of ruin, without giving them a chance to be heard. Their rights are protected in the only way that they can be in a complex society, by their power, \n\n[321 \nU.S. 503, 520]\n\u00a0\n immediate or remote, over those who make the rule.' We need not go so far in the present case. Here Congress has provided for judicial review of the Administrator's action. To be sure, that review comes after the order has been promulgated; and no provision for a stay is made. But as we have held in Yakus v. United States, supra, that review satisfies the requirements of due process. As stated by Mr. Justice Brandeis for a unanimous Court in Phillips v. Commissioner, \n283 \nU.S. 589, 596\n, 51 S.Ct. 608, 611. 'Where only property rights are involved, mere postponement of the judicial enquiry is not a denial of due process, if the opportunity given for the ultimate judicial determination of the liability is adequate. Springer v. United States, \n102 \nU.S. 586\n, 593; Scottish Union & National Ins. Co. v. Bowland, \n196 \nU.S. 611, 631\n, 25 S.Ct. 345 (351). Delay in the judicial determination of property rights is not uncommon where it is essential that governmental needs be immediately satisfied.'\n Language in the cases that due process requires a hearing before the administrative order becomes effective (Morgan v. United States, \n304 \nU.S. 1, 19\n, 20 S., 58 S.Ct. 773, 776, 777, 999; Opp Cotton Mills, Inc. v. Administrator, supra, 312 U.S. pages 152, 153, 61 S.Ct. pages 535, 536) is to be explained on two grounds. In the first place the statutes there involved required that procedure.\n Secondly, as we have held in Yakus v. United States, supra, Congress was dealing here with the exigencies of war time conditions and the insistent demands of inflation control. Cf. Porter v. Investors' Syndicate, \n286 \nU.S. 461, 471\n, 52 S.Ct. 617, 620. Congress chose not to fix rents in specified areas or on a national scale by legislative fiat. It chose a method designed to meet the needs for rent control as they might arise and to accord some leeway for adjustment within the formula which it prescribed. At the same time the procedure which Congress adopted was selected with the view of eliminating the necessity for 'lengthy and costly trials with concomitant dissipation of the time and ener- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 503, 521]\n\u00a0\n gies of all concerned in litigation rather than in the common war effort.' S.Rep. No. 931, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 7. To require hearings for thousands of landlords before any rent control order could be made effective might have defeated the program of price control. Or Congress might well have thought so. National security might not be able to afford the luxuries of litigation and the long delays which preliminary hearings traditionally have entailed.\n We fully recognize, as did the Court in Home Bldg. & Loan Association v. Blaisdell, \n290 \nU.S. 398, 426\n, 54 S.Ct. 231, 235, 88 A.L.R. 1481, that 'even the war power does not remove constitutional limitations safeguarding essential liberties.' And see Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries Co., supra, 251 U.S. page 155, 40 S.Ct. page 107. But where Congress has provided for judicial review after the regulations or orders have been made effective it has done all that due process under the war emergency requires.\n Other objections are raised concerning the regulations or orders fixing the rents. But these may be considered only by the Emergency Court of Appeals on the review provided by  204. Yakus v. United States, supra.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice RUTLEDGE, concurring.\n I concur in the result and substantially in the Court's opinion, except for qualifications expressed below. In view of these and my difference from the Court's position in Yakus v. United States (Rottenberg v. United States), \n321 \nU.S. 414\n, 64 S.Ct. 660, a statement of reasons for concurrence here is appropriate.\n\n\n I.\n\n\n With reference to the substantive aspects of the legislation, I would add here only the following. Since the phases in issue in this case relate to real estate rentals, it is not amiss to note that these ordinarily are within the state's power to regulate rather than that of the federal government. But their relation, both to the general \n\n[321 \nU.S. 503, 522]\n\u00a0\n system of controlling wartime price inflation and to the special problems of housing created in particular areas by war activities, gives adequate ground for exercise of federal power over them.\n Likewise, with respect to the delegation of authority to the administrator to designate 'defense rental areas' and to fix maximum rentals within them, the same considerations, and others, sustain the delegation as do that to fix prices of commodities generally. The power to specify defense rental areas, rather than amounting to an excess of permissible delegation, is actually a limitation upon the administrator's authority, restricting it to regions where the facts, not merely his judgment, make control of rents necessary both to keep down inflation and to carry on the war activities concentrated in them. Accordingly, I concur fully with the Court's expressed views concerning the substantive features of the legislation.\n\n\n II.\n\n\n This appeal presents two kinds of jurisdictional and procedural questions, though they are not unrelated. The first sort relate to the power of the District Court to restrain the further prosecution of the state court proceedings and the execution of, or attempts to execute, orders issued in them. The other issues relate to the District Court's power to restrain Mrs. Willingham from violating the Emergency Price Control Act and the orders issued pursuant to it affecting her interests.\n As to the former, I have no doubt that the District Court had power, for the reasons stated by the Court, to restrain the prosecution of the suit in the state court and the execution of orders made by it. By Section 204(d) of the Act, Congress withheld from all courts, including the state courts, with an exception in the case of the Emergency Court of Appeals and this Court on review of its judg- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 503, 523]\n\u00a0\n ments, 'jurisdiction ... to stay, restrain, enjoin, or set aside, in whole or in part, any provision of this Act authorizing the issuance of such regulations or orders, or making effective any such price schedule, or any provision of any such regulation, order, or price schedule, or to restrain or enjoin the enforcement of any such provision.' The single exception was the power of the Emergency Court by its final judgment, or of this Court on final disposition in review thereof, Section 204(a), (b), to set aside an order or regulation. Congress clearly had the power thus to confine the equity jurisdiction of the federal courts and to make its mandate for uninterrupted operation of the rent control system effective by prohibiting the state courts so to interfere with the statutory plan, at least until it should be shown invalid by the channel created for this purpose. \n1\n Any effort of the state court therefore to enjoin the issuance of rent orders or suspend their operation, whether on constitutional or other grounds, was directly in the teeth of the statute's explicit provisions and a violation of its terms. By this mandate the state courts were not required to give their sanction to enforcement of an unconstitutional act or regulation or even of one which might turn out to be such. They were merely commanded to keep hands off and leave decision upon the validity of the statute or the regulations, for purposes of suspending or setting them aside, to another forum established for that purpose. Congress clearly had the power and the intent to authorize federal courts to enforce this command, by injunction if necessary.\n\n\n III.\n\n\n In vesting jurisdiction in the federal district courts to enjoin violations of the Price Control Act and regulations \n\n[321 \nU.S. 503, 524]\n\u00a0\n issued pursuant to it, Congress included not only violations of the statute's prohibition directed to the state courts against staying enforcement but other violations as well. The District Court, acting in the exercise of that jurisdiction, rested its judgment on the decision of a question it was authorized to consider, namely, whether the Act, rather than merely a regulation issued under it, is invalid. Since the court decided that question erroneously in disposing of this case, reversal of its judgment would be required. And perhaps in strictness this is all that it would be necessary to decide at this time.\n But the contention has been made earnestly all through these proceedings that the regulations, on the basis of which any injunction obtained by the administrator must rest, are invalid and beyond his authority under the Act. And the Court, relying upon the decision in the Yakus and Rottenberg cases, has indicated that these contentions may not be considered in a proceeding of this character.\n From what already had been said, it is clear the contention misconceives the administrator's rights with respect to an injunction restraining the further prosecution of the state suit and execution of the state court's orders. His right to such an injunction may rest on considerations entirely different from those governing his right to secure an injunction restraining Mrs. Willingham from violating the regulation. The former could be founded wholly upon the power of Congress to require the state courts to keep hands entirely off, in the discharge of federal functions by federal officials, at any rate during such time as might be required for decision, with finality, upon the validity of the statute and regulations issued under it by an appropriate alternative federal method. The latter, however, presents the different question whether Congress can require the federal district courts, organized under Article III and vested by it with the judicial power, not merely to keep hands off, but by affirmative exercise \n\n[321 \nU.S. 503, 525]\n\u00a0\n of their powers to give permanent sanction to the legislative or administrative command, notwithstanding it is or may be in conflict with some constitutional mandate.\n That Congress can require the court exercising the civil jurisdiction in equity to refrain from staying statutory provisions and regulations is clear. Whether the enforcing court acts civilly or criminally, in circumstances like these, Congress can cut off its power to stay or suspend the operation of the statute or the regulation pending final decision that it is invalid. But this leaves the question whether Congress also can confer the equity jurisdiction to decree enforcement and at the same time deprive the court of power to consider the validity of the law or regulation and to govern its decree accordingly.\n Different considerations, in part, determine this question from those controlling when enforcement is by criminal sanction. The constitutional limitations specially applicable to criminal trials fall to one side. Those relating to due process of law in civil proceedings, including whatever matters affecting discrimination are applicable under the Fifth Amendment, and to the independence of the judicial power under Article III, in relation to civil proceedings, remain applicable. Since in these cases the rights involved are rights of property, not of personal liberty or life as in criminal proceedings, the consequences, though serious, are not of the same moment under our system, as appears from the fact they are not secured by the same procedural protections in trial. It is in this respect perhaps that our basic law, following the common law, most clearly places the rights to life and to liberty above those of property.\n All this is pertinent to whether Congress, in providing for civil enforcement of the Act and the regulations, can do what in my opinion it cannot require by way of criminal enforcement of this statute, namely, by providing the single opportunity to challenge the validity of the \n\n[321 \nU.S. 503, 526]\n\u00a0\n regulation and making this available for the limited time, constitute the method afforded the exclusive mode for securing decision of that question and, either by virtue of the taking advantage of it or by virtue of the failure to do so within the time allowed, foreclose further opportunity for considering it.\n In my opinion Congress can do this, subject however to the following limitations or reservations, which I think should be stated explicitly: (1) The order or regulation must not be invalid on its face; (2) the previous opportunity must be adequate for the purpose prescribed, in the constitutional sense; and (3), what is a corollary of the second limitation or implicit in it, the circumstances and nature of the substantive problem dealt with by the legislation must be such that they justify both the creation of the special remedy and the requirement that it be followed to the exclusion of others normally available.\n In this case, in my judgment, these conditions concur to justify the procedure Congress has specified. Except for the charge that the regulations, or some of them, are so vague and indefinite as to be incapable of enforcement, there is nothing to suggest they are invalid on their face. And they clearly are not so, either in the respect specified or otherwise. \n2\n The proceeding by protest and appeal through the Emergency Court, even for civil consequences \n\n[321 \nU.S. 503, 527]\n\u00a0\n only, approaches the limit of adequacy in the constitutional sense, both by reason of its summary character3 and because of the shortness of the period allowed for following it. \n4\n A reservation perhaps is in order in the latter respect, when facts are discovered after the period which, if proven, would invalidate the regulation and which by reasonable diligence could not have been discovered before the period ends. Finally, it hardly can be disputed that the substantive problem and the circumstances which created and surrounded it were such as, if ever they could be, to justify a procedure of this sort. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n Accordingly, I agree that, as against the challenges made here, the special remedy provided by the Act was adequate and appropriate, in the constitutional sense, for the determination of appellee's rights with civil effects, had she followed it. And her failure to follow it produced no such irrevocable and harmful consequences, for such purposes, as would ensue if she were charged with violation as a crime. Accordingly, by declining to take the plain way opened to her, more inconvenient though that may have been, and taking her misconceived remedy by another route, she has arrived where she might well have expected, at the wrong end.\n No doubt this was due to a misconception of her rights, \n\n[321 \nU.S. 503, 528]\n\u00a0\n both as a matter of substance and as one of procedure, due perhaps to failure to take full account of the reach of the nation's power in war. Nevertheless, the Court not improperly has set at rest some of her misconceptions concerning the effects of the regulations. Thus, it is held that the statute is not invalid in providing for maximum rents which are 'generally fair and equitable.' Section 2(b). It does not lessen the effect of this ruling for purposes of deciding the regulation's validity, that Maximum Rent Regulation Number 26, Section 5(c)(1), of which appellee complained on various constitutional grounds, including confiscation, provided that the administrator might order a decrease of the maximum rent for specified housing accommodations only on the ground that that rent 'is higher than the rent generally prevailing in the defense rental area for comparable housing accommodations on April 1, 1941.' (Italics added.)\n Other issues raised by the appellee with respect to the regulations likewise are disposed of by the rulings upon the statute's provisions. \n6\n In so far as the regulations are identical with the statute, therefore, and the objections to them are identical, the disposition of these objections to the Act disposes also of those made to the regulations. In so far as the latter raised questions not raised concerning the statute, and since none of these, except as mentioned above, called attention to any feature making a regulation void on its face, the appellee has foreclosed her opportunity to assert them, as to facts existing when the suit was begun, by her failure to follow the prescribed special remedy. It is not unreasonable, in a matter of this importance and urgency, to require one, whose only valid objection to the law, including the regulations, rests in proof of facts not apparent to the administrator or the \n\n[321 \nU.S. 503, 529]\n\u00a0\n court, to make his proof in the manner provided and to do so promptly, as a condition to securing equitable or other civil relief.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS.\n I should be content if reversal of the District Court's decision were upon the ground that that court lacked power to enjoin prosecution of the appellees' state court suit. The policy expressed in  265 of the Judicial Code applies in this instance. Moreover, if the provision of  204(d) of the Emergency Price Control Act is valid, the lack of jurisdiction of the state court could, and should, have been raised in that court and review of its ruling could have been obtained by established means of resort to this court. Since, however, the court has determined that the District Court acted within its competency in enjoining further prosecution of the state court suit, other issues must be faced.\n The appellant in his complaint charged that the appellees threatened to disobey the provisions of the Act and the regulations made pursuant to it. The appellees answered that the Act and the regulations were void because in excess of the powers of Congress. I do not understand the Administrator to contend that the court below was precluded by the terms of the statute from passing upon the question whether the Act constitutes an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. I am not sure whether he asserts that the provisions of  204(d), which purport to prohibit any court, except the Emergency Court of Appeals created by the Act, from considering the validity of any regulation or order made under the Act, prevent consideration of the Administrator's rent regulations and orders here under attack. If so, I think the contention is untenable.\n The statute of its own force is not applicable in any area except the District of Columbia unless and until so \n\n[321 \nU.S. 503, 530]\n\u00a0\n made by a regulation of the Administrator. The statutory provisions respecting rentals amount only to conference of authority on the Administrator to make regulations and do not themselves prescribe or constrain any conduct on the part of the citizen. In short, one cannot violate the provisions of the statute unless they are implemented by administrative regulations or orders. To say then that, while the court in which the Administrator seeks enforcement of the Act, and regulations made under it, has jurisdiction to pass upon the constitutionality of the Act, it may not consider the validity of pertinent regulations, is to say that the court is to consider the Act in vacuo and wholly apart from its application to the defendant against whom enforcement is sought. Under the uninterrupted current of authority the argument must be rejected.\n This brings me to a consideration of the appellees' principal contention, namely, that, as applied to rent control, the Emergency Price Control Act is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to an administrative officer. In approaching this question it is hardly necessary to state the controlling principles which have been reiterated in recent decisions. \n1\n Congress may perform its legislative function by laying down policies and establishing standards while leaving administrative officials free to make rules within the prescribed limits and to ascertain facts to which the declared policy is to apply. But any delegation which goes beyond the application and execution of the law as declared by Congress is invalid.\n Congress cannot delegate the power to make a law or refrain from making it; to determine to whom the law shall be applicable and to whom not; to determine what the law shall command and what not. Candid appraisal \n\n[321 \nU.S. 503, 531]\n\u00a0\n of the rent control provisions of the Act in question discloses that Congress has delegated the law making power in toto to an administrative officer.\n As already stated, the Act is not in itself effective with respect to rents. It creates an Office of Price Administration to be under the direction of a Price Administrator appointed by the President (50 U.S.C. Appendix,  921(a), 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix,  921(a). This official is authorized 'whenever in (his) judgment ... such action is necessary or proper in order to effectuate the purposes' of the Act to issue a declaration setting forth the necessity for, and recommendations with reference to, the stabilization or reduction of rents for accommodations within a particular defense rental area. If, within sixty days such rents within such area have not 'in the judgment of the Administrator' been stabilized or reduced in accordance with his recommendations he may, by regulation or order, establish such maximum rent or maximum rents for such accommodations 'as in his judgment will be generally fair and equitable and will effectuate the purposes' of the Act. 'So far as practicable' in establishing maximum rents he is to ascertain and duly consider the rents prevailing for such accommodations, or comparable accommodations, on or about April 1, 1941 (or if, prior or subsequent to April 1, 1941, defense activities shall have resulted, or threaten to result, in increases in rents of housing accommodations in such area inconsistent with the purposes of the Act, then on or about a date (not earlier than April 1, 1940) which 'in the judgment of the Administrator' does not reflect such increases); and he shall make adjustments 'for such relevant factors as he may determine and deem to be of general applicability in respect of such accommodations, including increases or decreases in property taxes and other costs.' 'In designating defense-rental areas, in prescribing regulations and orders establishing maximum rents for such accommodations, and in selecting \n\n[321 \nU.S. 503, 532]\n\u00a0\n persons to administer such regulations and orders, the Administrator shall, to such extent as he determines to be practicable,' consider recommendations made by State and local officials (50 U.S.C.Appendix,  902(b), 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix,  902(b). The form and the manner of establishing a regulation or order, the insertion of classifications and differentiations, the provisions for adjustments and reasonable exceptions lie wholly 'in the judgment of the Administrator' as to their necessity or propriety in order to effectuate the purposes of the Act (50 U.S.C. Appendix,  902(c), 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix,  902(c).\n The 'judgment of the Administrator' as to what is necessary and proper to effectuate the purposes of the Act is the only condition precedent for his issue of an order, regulation, or prohibition affecting speculative or manipulative practices or renting or leasing practices in connection with any defense-area housing accommodations, which practices 'in his judgment' are equivalent to or are likely to result in rent increases inconsistent with the purposes of the Act (50 U.S.C.Appendix,  902(d), 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix,  902(d).\n At the moment these statutory provisions were adopted rent control was not effective in any part of the nation. The Administrator was appointed for the purpose of enacting such control by regulations and orders. As will be seen, the first step he was authorized to take was to issue a declaration stating the necessity for reduction of rents within a particular defense-rental area and recommendations as to the nature of such reductions.\n How is the reader of the statute to know what is meant by the term 'defense-rental area'? The statutory 'standard' is this:\n'The term 'defense-rental area' means the District of Columbia and any area designated by the Administrator as an area where defense activities have resulted or threaten to result in an increase in the rents for housing accommodations inconsistent with the purposes of this Act.' ( Italics supplied.) (50 U.S.C.Appendix,  942(d), 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix,  942(d). \n\n[321 \nU.S. 503, 533]\n\u00a0\n Save for the District of Columbia, the designation of an area where the Act is to operate depends wholly upon the Administrator's judgment that so-called defense activities have resulted or threaten to result in an increase of rents inconsistent with the purposes of the Act. Note that the judgment involved is solely that of the Administrator. He need find no facts, he need make no inquiry, he need not, unless he thinks it practicable, even consult local authorities. In exercising his judgment the Administrator must be persuaded that 'defense activities' have caused or will cause a rise in rents. The statute nowhere defines or gives a hint as to what defense activities are. In time of war it is conceivable that an honest official might consider any type of work a defense activity. His judgment, however exorbitant, determines the coverage of the Act. It is true that he is authorized to make such studies and investigations as he deems necessary or proper to assist him in prescribing regulations or orders (50 U.S.C.Appendix,  922(a), 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix,  922(a), but his unfettered judgment is conclusive whether any are necessary or proper.\n\n But is not the Administrator's judgment channeled and confined by the final limitation that his action must be the promotion of the 'purposes of this Act'? What are they? So far as material they are: 'To prevent speculative, unwarranted, and abnormal increases in ... rents' (50 U.S.C. Appendix,  901(a), 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix,  901(a). There are other general phrases in the section which may be claimed to throw some light on the considerations the Administrator may entertain but, so far as rents are concerned, they are so vague as to be useless; as, for example, the protection of persons with relatively fixed and limited incomes, consumers, wage earners, investors and persons dependent on life insurance, annuities, and pensions from undue impairment of their standard of living, and more of the same. I have discussed the 'standards' in an opinion filed in Yakus v. United States, \n321 \nU.S. 414\n, 64 S.Ct. 660. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 503, 534]\n\u00a0\n Language could not more aptly fit this grant of power than that used in A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, supra, 295 U.S. at page 551, 55 S.Ct. at page 852, 97 A.L.R. 947: 'Here in effect is a roving commission to inquire into evils and upon discovery correct them.' Equally apposite is what was said at page 541 of 295 U.S., page 848 of 55 S.Ct., 97 A.L.R. 947: 'It (the Act) does not undertake to prescribe rules of conduct to be applied to particular states of fact determined by appropriate administrative procedure. Instead of prescribing rules of conduct, it authorizes the making of codes to prescribe them. For that legislative undertaking, section 3 sets up no standards, aside from the statement of the general aims of rehabilitation, correction and expansion described in section 1. In view of the scope of that broad declaration and of the nature of the few restrictions that are imposed, the discretion of the President in approving or prescribing codes, and thus enacting laws for the government of trade and industry throughout the country, is virtually unfettered.'\n Placing the relevant sections of the statute together we find that the term 'defense rental area' means any area designated by the Administrator as an area where 'defense activities' have resulted, or threaten to result, in 'speculative, unwarranted, and abnormal increases in ... rents.' Can anyone assert that Congress has thus laid down a standard to control the action of the executive? The Administrator, and he alone, is to say what increase is speculative, what increase is unwarranted, and what increase is abnormal. What facts is he to consider? Such as he chooses. What facts did he consider in the instant case? One cannot know.\n But the matter does not stop here. We have now only arrived at the designation of an area by the Administrator. As we have seen, his next step is to issue a declaration or recommendation. How shall he determine whether to do so or not? As seen by the above summary of the Act's provisions, the matter rests in the judgment of the Ad- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 503, 535]\n\u00a0\n ministrator as to whether such action is necessary or proper to effectuate the purposes of the Act. We have just seen what those purposes are. Again, his sole and untrammeled judgment as to what is needed to prevent speculative, unwarranted or abnormal increases is the only criterion of his action. The public records show that declarations made by him merely state that, in his judgment, the basic fact exists. He makes no findings; he is not bound to make any specific inquiry; he issues a fiat. No one is to be advised as to the basis of his judgment; no one need be heard.\n Does the statute afford a standard for the Administrator to follow in deciding the quantity of the reduction? Again his judgment alone is determinative. And, more, in his judgment alone rests the decision as to what accommodations within the area are to be affected by the decreed reduction. He may recommend the reduction of rent for 'any accommodations' within the defense-rental area.\n After the issue of his declaration and recommendations the Administrator must wait sixty days before putting his recommendations into effect. If, in his sole and unfettered judgment, stabilization has not been accomplished, he may then, by regulation or order, establish such maximum rent or maximum rents as 'in his judgment' will be 'generally fair and equitable and will effectuate the purposes of this Act.' His order may be based upon nothing but his own opinion. It may be made without notice, without hearing, without inquiry of any sort, without consultation with local authorities. The rents established may vary from street to street, and from subdivision to subdivision, all in accordance with the Administrator's personal judgment. The order may involve classification and exemption if the Administrator, in his sole discretion, deems that this course will 'effectuate the purposes of this Act.' Which means, of course, if he thinks non-specula- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 503, 536]\n\u00a0\n tion, non-abnormality, or sufficient warrant justifies the discriminations involved.\n How shall he fix the amount of the maximum rent? The only standard given him is the exercise of his own judgment that the rents fixed will be 'generally fair and equitable and will effectuate the purposes of this Act.' 'Fair and equitable' might conceivably be a workable standard if inquiry into the specific facts were prescribed and if the bearing of those facts were to be given weight in the ultimate decision, but the addition of the word 'generally', and the failure to prescribe any method for arriving at what is fair and equitable leaves the Administrator such room for disregard of specific injustices and particular circumstances that no living person could demonstrate error in his conclusion. And, again, even the phrase 'generally fair and equitable' is qualified by empowering the Administrator to consider also questions of speculation, unwarranted action or abnormality of condition. Such a 'standard' is pretense. It is a device to allow the Administrator to do anything he sees fit without accountability to anyone.\n But, it is said, that is an unfair characterization of the statute because, 'so far as practicable', the Administrator must ascertain and duly consider rents prevailing for 'such accommodations, or comparable accommodations, on or about April 1, 1941', and that, although he may pick out some other period which he thinks more representative, he must not select any period earlier than April 1, 1940, and, therefore, he is definitely confined and prohibited in exercising control over rentals. This argument will not do. The mere fact that he may not go to any period for comparison earlier than April 1, 1940, although he may take any later period he thinks appropriate, does not serve to obliterate the fact that after such wide and unrestricted choice of a period he can make any regulation he sees fit. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 503, 537]\n\u00a0\n Without further elaboration it is plain that this Act creates personal government by a petty tyrant instead of government by law. Whether there shall be a law prescribing maximum rents anywhere in the United States depends solely on the Administrator's personal judgment. When that law shall take effect, how long it shall remain in force, whether it shall be modified, what territory it shall cover, whether different areas shall be subject to different regulations, what is the nature of the activity that shall motivate the institution of the law,-all these matters are buried in the bosom of the Administrator and nowhere else.\n I am far from urging that, in the present war emergency, rents and prices shall not be controlled and stabilized. But I do insist that, war or no war, there exists no necessity, and no constitutional power, for Congress' abdication of its legislative power and remission to an executive official of the function of making and repealing laws applicable to the citizens of the United States. No truer word was ever said than this court's statement in the Minnesota Mortgage Moratorium Case2 that emergency does not create power but may furnish the occasion for its exercise. The Constitution no more contemplates the elimination of any of the coordinate branches of the Government during war than in peace. It will not do to say that no other method could have been adopted consonant with the legislative power of Congress. 'Defense-rental areas' and 'defense activities' could have been reasonably defined. Rents in those areas could have been frozen as of a given date, or reasonably precise standards could have been fixed, and administrative or other tribunals could have been given power according to the rules and standards prescribed to deal with special situations after hearing and findings and exposition of the reasons for action. I say this only be- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 503, 538]\n\u00a0\n cause the argument has been made that the emergency was such that no other form of legislation would have served the end in view. It is not for this court to tell Congress what sort of legislation it shall adopt but, in this instance, when Congress seems to have abdicated and to have eliminated the legislative process from our constitutional form of Government, it must be stated that this cannot be done unless the people so command or permit by amending the fundamental law.\n The obvious answer to what I have said is that this court has sustained, and no one would now question, the constitutional validity of Acts of Congress laying down purported standards as vague as those contained in the Act under consideration. But the answer is specious. Generally speaking, statutes invoking the aid of the administrative arm of the Government for their application and enforcement fall into two classes,- those in which a policy is declared and an administrative body is empowered to ascertain the facts in particular cases so as to determine whether that policy in a particular case had been violated. Of this type of legislation the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq., and the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C.A.  45 et seq., are classical examples. In the one, carriers are required to charge just and reasonable rates for their services. In the other citizens are forbidden to indulge in unfair methods of competition. If it be asserted that these are but vague standards of conduct it must at once be said that, in adopting them, Congress adopted common law concepts, the one applying to those pursuing a public calling and the other to business competitors in general, and that the standards announced carried with them concepts and contours attaching as a result of a long legal history. But more, in such instances, the standards were not to be applied in the uncontrolled judgment of the administrative body. On the contrary, the statutes require a complaint specifying the conduct thought to violate the statute and opportunity for answer, for hearing, for production of evidence, and for findings \n\n[321 \nU.S. 503, 539]\n\u00a0\n which are subject to judicial review. With such a background for administrative procedure what seems a loose and vague standard becomes in fact a reasonably ascertainable one that can fairly, equitably, and justly be applied.\n The other and distinct class of cases is that in which Congress, as in the present instance, declares a policy and entrusts to an administrative agent, without more, the making of general rules and regulations for the implementation of that policy. These rules are, in all but name, statutes. Here, unless the rule for the guidance of the Administrator is clear, and the considerations upon which he may act are definite and certain, it must inevitably follow that, to a greater or less degree, he will make the law. No citizen can question the motive or purpose of Congress in enacting a specific statute to control and define conduct as long as Congress acts within the powers granted it by the Constitution. As has been pointed out, Congress, in passing the Emergency Price Control Act, has attempted to clothe its delegate-an Administrator- with the same unchallengable legislative power which it possesses. In this respect the delegation is no different from that involved in the National Industrial Recovery Act which was held invalid in A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, supra.\n We are told that 'Congress has specified the basic conclusions of fact upon the ascertainment of which by the Administrator its statutory command is to become effective.' This means, I take it, that the Administrator need find no facts, in the accepted sense of the expression. He need only form an opinion,-for every opinion is a conclusion of fact. And 'basic' means, evidently, that his opinion is that one of the 'purposes of the Act' requires the making of a law applicable to a given situation. It is not of material aid that he discloses the reasons for his action. Such a test of constitutionality was unanimously rejected in the Schechter case. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 503, 540]\n\u00a0\n The statute there in question declared the policy of Congress to be 'to remove obstructions to the free flow of interstate and foreign commerce which tend to diminish the amount thereof; and to provide for the general welfare by promoting the organization of industry for the purpose of cooperative action among trade groups, to induce and maintain united action of labor and management under adequate governmental sanctions and supervision, to eliminate unfair competitive practices, to promote the fullest possible utilization of the present productive capacity of industries, to avoid undue restriction of production (except as may be temporarily required), to increase the consumption of industrial and agricultural products by increasing purchasing power, to reduce and relieve unemployment, to improve standards of labor, and otherwise to rehabilitate industry and to conserve natural resources.' 48 Stat. 195,  1.\n Under that Act the President was required to find that the promulgation by him of a code of fair competition in any industry would 'tend to effectuate the policy' of Congress as above declared. He did so find in promulgating the code there under attack.\n I have already quoted what this court said with respect to the so- called standards established by the statute. That case and this fall into exactly the same category. There it was held that the President's basic conclusions of fact amounted to an exercise of his judgment as to whether a law should come into being or not. Here it is said that the Administrator's basic conclusions of fact are but the enforcement of an enactment by Congress. Whether explicitly avowed or not, the present decision overrules that in the Schechter case.\n The judgment of the Administrator is, by this Act, substituted for the judgment of Congress. It is sought to make that judgment unquestionable just as the judg- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 503, 541]\n\u00a0\n ment of Congress would be unquestionable once exercised and embodied in a definite statutory proscription. But Congress, under our form of Government, may not surrender its judgment as to whether there shall be a law, or what that law shall be, to any other person or body.\n The Emergency Price Control Act might have been drawn so as to lay down standards for action by the Administrator which would be reasonably definite; it might have authorized inquiries and hearings by him to ascertain facts which affect specific cases within the provisions of the statute. That would have been a constitutional and practicable measure. It has done no such thing.\n But it is said the Administrator's powers are not absolute, for the statute provides judicial review of his action. While the Act purports to give relief from rulings of the Administrator by appeal to the Emergency Court of Appeals and to this court, the grant of judicial review is illusory. How can any court say that the Administrator has erred in the exercise of his judgment in determining what are defense activities? How can any court pronounce that the Administrator's judgment is erroneous in defining a 'defense-rental area'? What are the materials on which to review the judgment of the Administrator that one or another period in the last three years reflects, in a given area, no abnormal, speculative, or unwarranted increase in rent in particular defense housing accommodations in a chosen defense-rental area? It is manifest that it is beyond the competence of any court to convict the Administrator of error when the supposed materials for judgment are so vague and so numerous as those permitted by the statute.\n One only need read the decisions of the Emergency Court of Appeals to learn how futile it is for the citizen to attempt to convict the Administrator of an abuse of judgment in framing his orders, how illusory the purported \n\n[321 \nU.S. 503, 542]\n\u00a0\n judicial review is in fact. I have spoken more at length on this subject in my opinion in Yakus v. United States, \n321 \nU.S. 414\n, 64 S.Ct. 660.\n I think the judgment of the District Court was right and should be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The declaration recited that the designated areas were the location of the armed forces of the United States or of war production industries, that the influx of people had caused an acute shortage of rental housing accommodations, that most of the areas were those in which builders could secure priority ratings on critical materials for residential construction, that new construction had not been sufficient to restore normal rental markets, that surveys showed low vacancy ratios for rental housing accommodations in the areas, that defense activities had resulted in substantial and widespread increases in rents affecting most of these accommodations in the areas, and that official surveys in the areas had shown a marked upward movement in the general level of residential rents. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Sec. 2(b) provides: 'Whenever in the judgment of the Administrator such action is necessary or proper in order to effectuate the purposes of this Act, he shall issue a declaration setting forth the necessity for, and recommendations with reference to, the stabilization or reduction of rents for any defense-area housing accommodations within a particular defense-rental area. If within sixty days after the issuance of any such recommendations rents for any such accommodations within such defense- rental area have not in the judgment of the Administrator been stabilized or reduced by State or local regulation, or otherwise, in accordance with the recommendations, the Administrator may by regulation or order establish such maximum rent or maximum rents for such accommodations as in his judgment will be generally fair and equitable and will effectuate the purposes of this Act. So far as practicable, in establishing any maximum rent for any defense-area housing accommodations, the Administrator shall ascertain and give due consideration to the rents prevailing for such accommodations, or comparable accommodations, on or about April 1, 1941 ( or if, prior or subsequent to April 1, 1941, defense activities shall have resulted or threatened to result in increases in rents for housing accommodations in such area inconsistent with the purposes of this Act, then on or about a date (not earlier than April 1, 1940), which in the judgment of the Administrator, does not reflect such increases), and he shall make adjustments for such relevant factors as he may determine and deed to be of general applicability in respect of such accommodations, including increases or decreases in property taxes and other costs. In designating defense-rental areas, in prescribing regulations and orders establishing maximum rents for such accommodations, and in selecting persons to administer such regulations and orders, the Administrator shall, to such extent as he determines to be practicable, consider any recommendations which may be made by State and local officials concerned with housing or rental conditions in any defense-rental area.' \n And  2(c) provides: 'Any regulation or order under this section may be established in such form and manner, may contain such classifications and differentiations, and may provide for such adjustments and reasonable exceptions, as in the judgment of the Administrator are necessary or proper in order to effectuate the purposes of this Act. Any regulation or order under this section which establishes a maximum price or maximum rent may provide for a maximum price or maximum rent below the price or prices prevailing for the commodity or commodities, or below the rent or rents prevailing for the defense-area housing accommodations, at the time of the issuance of such regulation or order.' \n[\nFootnote 3\n] See the provisions of  2(b) in note 2, supra. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Sec. 201(d) provides: 'The Administrator may, from time to time, issue such regulations and orders as he may deem necessary or proper in order to carry out the purposes and provisions of this Act.'\n Sec. 203(a) provides in part: 'Within a period of sixty days after the issuance of any regulation or order under section 2, ... or in the case of a price schedule, within a period of sixty days after the effective date thereof specified in section 206, ... any person subject to any provision of such regulation, order, or price schedule may, in accordance with regulations to be prescribed by the Administrator, file a protest specifically setting forth objections to any such provision and affidavits or other written evidence in support of such objections. At any time after the expiration of such sixty days any persons subject to any provision of such regulation, order, or price schedule may file such a protest based solely on grounds arising after the expiration of such sixty days. Statements in support of any such regulation, order, or price schedule may be received any incorporated in the transcript of the proceedings at such times and in accordance with such regulations as may be prescribed by the Administrator.' \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Sec. 204(d) provides in part: 'The Emergency Court of Appeals, and the Supreme Court upon review of judgments and orders of the Emergency Court of Appeals, shall have exclusive jurisdiction to determine the validity of any regulation or order issued under section 2, ... of any price schedule effective in accordance with the provisions of section 206 , ... and of any provision of any such regulation, order, or price schedule. Except as provided in this section, no court, Federal, State, or Territorial, shall have jurisdiction or power to consider the validity of any such regulation, order, or price schedule, or to stay, restrain, enjoin, or set aside, in whole or in part, any provision of this Act authorizing the issuance of such regulations or orders, or making effective any such price schedule, or any provision of any such regulation, order, or price schedule, or to restrain or enjoin the enforcement of any such provision.'\n It should also be noted that  204(c) withholds from the Emergency Court power 'to issue any temporary restraining order or interlocutory decree staying or restraining, in whole or in part, the effectiveness of any regulation or order issued under section 2 ... or any price schedule effective in accordance with the provisions of section 206 ....' \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] It is true that  205(c) gives to state and territorial courts concurrent jurisdiction of all proceedings (except criminal proceedings) under  205 of the Act. But they embrace only enforcement suits brought by the Administrator, not suits brought to restrain or enjoin enforcement of the Act or orders or regulations thereunder. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Here as in Yakus v. United States, supra, the Administrator concedes that in an enforcement suit the constitutionality of the Act as distinguished from the constitutionality of orders or regulations under the Act is open. As pointed out in the Yakus case, reliance is placed on  204(d), supra note 5. And see S.Rep.No.931, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 24, 25. \n[\nFootnote 8\n] The terms rent, defense-rental area, defense-area housing accommodations, and housing accommodations are defined in  302 of the Act. \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Sec. 1(a) provides in part: 'It is hereby declared to be in the interest of the national defense and security and necessary to the effective prosecution of the present war, and the purposes of this Act are, to stabilize prices and to prevent speculative, unwarranted, and abnormal increases in prices and rents; to eliminate and prevent profiteering, hoarding, manipulation, speculation, and other disruptive practices resulting from abnormal market conditions or scarcities caused by or contributing to the national emergency; to assure that defense appropriations are not dissipated by excessive prices; to protect persons with relatively fixed and limited incomes, consumers, wage earners, investors, and persons dependent on life insurance, annuities, and pensions, from undue impairment of their standard of living; to prevent hardships to persons engaged in business, to schools, universities, and other institutions, and to the Federal, State, and local governments, which would result from abnormal increases in prices; to assist in securing adequate production of commodities and facilities; to prevent a post emergency collapse of values; to stabilize agricultural prices in the manner provided in section 3 ...; and to permit voluntary cooperation between the Government and producers, processors, and others to accomplish the aforesaid purposes.' \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Moses Taylor, 4 Wall. 411; cf.

Appellee's complaint against the regulation on the score of vagueness is addressed to the indefiniteness of the standards which the administrator has prescribed as a guide for his office in making decreases in maximum rentals, more particularly to Section 5(c)( 1), which authorizes a decrease in the maximum if it is 'higher than the rent generally prevailing in the Defense-Rental Area for comparable housing accommodations on April 1, 1941.' But assuming this complaint is otherwise meritorious, the standards thus provided are no less definite than those contained in the Act itself and the contention is therefore disposed of by the determination of the constitutionality of the Act. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Cf. the writer's dissenting opinion in Yakus v. United States, \n321 \nU.S. 414\n, 64 S.Ct. 660. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] Under the Act a protest against a regulation must be made within sixty days of its issuance, but if based on grounds arising after the sixty days, it may be filed 'at any time' thereafter.\n But under the Administrator's Revised Procedural Regulation No. 3,  1300.216, 'a protest against a provision of a maximum rent regulation based solely on grounds arising after the date of issuance of such maximum rent regulation shall be filed within a period of sixty days after the protestant has had, or could reasonably have had, notice of the existence of such grounds.' \n[\nFootnote 5\n] Cf.

R(1944)\nNo. 28\nArgued: Decided: January 17, 1944\n\n\n\n\n[321 \nU.S. 50, 51]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John E. Cassidy, of Peoria, Ill., for petitioners.\n Mr. Clarence W. Heyl, of Peoria, Ill., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice RUTLEDGE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The important question is whether the District Court properly issued an injunction which restrained respondent's employees, conductors, yardmen, enginemen and firemen, from interfering by violence or threats of violence with its property and interstate railroad operations. The sole issues that concern us are the existence of federal jurisdiction and whether the requirements of the Norris-LaGuardia Act (29 U.S.C.  107, 108, 29 U.S.C. A.  107, 108, 47 Stat. 71, 72) were satisfied.\n The case arises out of a long-continued labor dispute relating to working conditions and rates of pay. Negotiations between the parties, beginning in October, 1940, failed. A long course of mediation, with the aid of the National Mediation Board, resulted likewise. Accordingly, on November 7, 1941, the mediator proposed arbitration pursuant to the Railway Labor Act's provisions. 45 U.S.C.  155, First (b), 45 U.S.C.A.  155, subd. 1(b), 48 Stat. 1195. Both parties refused. Thereupon, as the Act requires, the Board terminated its services. Ibid. This occurred November 21, 1941. Under the statute, no change in rates of pay, rules, working conditions or established practices can be made for thirty days, unless in that time the parties agree to arbitration or an emergency board is created under Section 10. Ibid. Anticipating respondent would put into effect its proposed schedules at the end of the period, the employees voted \n\n[321 \nU.S. 50, 52]\n\u00a0\n to strike. The time for stopping work was set for December 9, at 11:00 a.m. Respondent knew of the voting on or before December 6, but did not receive formal notice of the strike until about noon of December 8.\n With the bombing of Pearl Harbor on December 7, the Mediation Board again intervened, strongly urging both sides to settle the dispute in view of the national emergency. At the Board's request the employees had postponed the strike indefinitely. \n1\n Further conferences failed to bring agreement and on December 17 the Board again urged that the disputants agree to arbitration under the statute. This time the employees accepted. \n2\n But respondent continued its refusal, though it also continued to urge the appointment of an emergency board. And, while the record does not show that respondent was notified formally of the employees' agreement to arbitrate until December 28, neither does it appear that respondent did not know of this fact before that time.\n On December 21, exactly the expiration of the thirty-day period, respondent by letter notified the employees and their representatives that its proposed schedules would become effective at 12:01 a.m., December 29. By letter dated December 27 and received by respondent before noon on December 28, the employees served notice that a strike would take effect December 28 at six o'clock in the evening. By wire which respondent received that day, the Board \n\n[321 \nU.S. 50, 53]\n\u00a0\n again strongly urged arbitration, pointing out the employees had acceded to the Board's request. Respondent again declined and urged an emergency board be appointed.\n The strike took effect at the appointed time. Picket lines were formed. Respondent undertook to continue operations with other employees. It employed 'special agents' to protect its trains and property. \n3\n Clashes occurred between them and the working employees, on the one hand, and the striking employees on the other. Various incidents involving violence or threats of violence took place. Some resulted in personal attacks, others in damage to property and interruption of service. The respondent sought the aid of public authorities, including the sheriffs of counties along its right of way and police authorities in cities and towns which it served. Some assistance was offered, but in some instances the authorities replied they had forces inadequate to supply the aid respondent requested and in others no reply was given. The parties are at odds concerning the extent of the violence, the need for public protection, and the adequacy of what was supplied or available. But the findings of the District Court are that the violence was substantial and the protection supplied by the public officials was inadequate. These incidents took place through the period extending from December 29, 1941, to January 3, 1942\n\n\n On the latter date respondent filed its complaint, asking for a temporary restraining order and, after hearing, an injunction restraining petitioners from interfering with its operations and property. The restraining order issued ex parte the same day, respondent giving bond as required (29 U.S.C.  107, 29 U.S.C.A.  107, 47 Stat. 71, 72) for indemnity against loss occasioned by its improvident or erroneous issuance. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 50, 54]\n\u00a0\n Hearing on the application for a temporary injunction began January 8 and continued to January 19. Two extensions continued the restraining order in force until the hearing was completed. Petitioners moved to vacate the extensions on January 15 and again at the close of the hearing on January 19, and to dismiss the complaint. These motions were denied, and the court made findings of fact and conclusions of law sustaining respondent's contentions. Thereupon the temporary injunction issued. In due course appeal was perfected from the order for its issuance and the previous orders denying petitioners' various motions to vacate the extensions and to dismiss the complaint. The Circuit Court of Appeals, one judge dissenting, affirmed the judgment. 132 F.2d 265. We granted certiorari because of the importance of the issues presented. \n318 \nU.S. 755\n, 63 S.Ct. 995.4\n Three principal issues have been made in the lower courts and here. Stated in the form of petitioners' contentions, they are: (1) The District Court was without jurisdiction, since there is no claim of diversity of citizenship and, it is said, no federal question is involved;5 (2) the \n\n[321 \nU.S. 50, 55]\n\u00a0\n evidence was not sufficient to show that the public authorities were unwilling or unable to furnish adequate protection for respondent's property;6 and (3) respondent did not make every reasonable effort to settle the dispute as required by the Norris-LaGuardia Act. \n7\n Without passing upon the others, we think the last contention must be sustained.\n Section 8 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act (29 U.S.C.  108, 29 U.S.C.A.  108, 47 Stat. 72), provides:\n'No restraining order or injunctive relief shall be granted to any complainant who has failed to comply with any obligation imposed by law which is involved in the labor dispute in question, or who has failed to make every reasonable effort to settle such dispute either by \n\n[321 \nU.S. 50, 56]\n\u00a0\n negotiation or with the aid of any available governmental machinery of mediation or voluntary arbitration.'\n\n The question, broadly stated, is whether respondent made 'every reasonable effort' to settle the dispute, as the section requires. On the facts this narrows to whether its steadfast refusal to agree to arbitration under the Railway Labor Act's provisions made the section operative. We think it did, with the consequence that the federal courts were deprived of the power to afford injunctive relief and respondent was remitted to other forms of legal remedy which remained available. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n Respondent was subject to the Railway Labor Act. Its provisions and machinery for voluntary arbitration were 'available.' Resort to them would have been a 'reasonable effort to settle' the dispute. Clearly arbitration under the Act was a method, both reasonable and available,9 which respondent refused to employ, not once, but repeatedly and adamantly. If it had been used, it would have averted the strike, the violence which followed, and the need for an injunction. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n Section 8 demands this method be exhausted before a complainant to whom it is available may have injunctive relief. Broadly, the section imposes two conditions. If a complainant has failed (1) to comply with any obligation imposed by law or (2) to make every reasonable \n\n[321 \nU.S. 50, 57]\n\u00a0\n effort to settle the dispute, he is forbidden relief. The latter condition is broader than the former. One must not only discharge his legal obligations. He must also go beyond them and make all reasonable effort, at the least by the methods specified if they are available, though none may involve complying with any legal duty. Any other view would make the second condition wholly redundant. It clearly is not the section's purpose, therefore, by that condition, to require only what one is compelled by law to do. Yet, as will appear, this would be the effect of accepting respondent's position.\n It is wholly inconsistent with the section's language and purpose to construe it, as have respondent and the lower courts, to require reasonable effort by only one conciliatory device whem others are available. The explicit terms demand 'every reasonable effort' to settle the dispute. Three modes are specified. \n11\n They were the normal ones for settlement of labor disputes by the efforts of the parties themselves and the aid of agencies adapted specially for the purpose. The Railway Labor Act12 pro- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 50, 58]\n\u00a0\n vided for all of them, with the aid of governmental machinery in the stages of mediation and arbitration. Section 8 is not limited to railway labor disputes. But it includes them. 13 And its very terms show they were used in explicit contemplation of the procedures and machinery then existing under the Railway Labor Act and with the intent of making their exhaustion conditions for securing injunctive relief, not singly or alternatively, but conjunctively or successively, when available. This purpose of Congress is put beyond question when the section's legislative history is considered in the light of the history and the basic common policy of the two statutes, the Railway Labor Act and the Norris-LaGuardia Act.\n The policy of the Railway Labor Act was to encourage use of the nonjudicial processes of negotiation, mediation and arbitration for the adjustment of labor disputes. Cf. General Committee of Adjustment of Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers v. Missouri-Kansas-Texas R. Co., \n320 \nU.S. 323\n, 64 S.Ct. 146; General Committee of Adjustment of Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers v. Southern Pacific Co., \n320 \nU.S. 338\n, 64 S.Ct. 142. The over-all policy of the Norris-LaGuardia Act was the same. The latter did not entirely abolish judicial power to impose previous restraint in labor controversies. But its prime purpose was to restrict the federal equity power in such matters within greatly narrower limits than it had come to occupy. \n14\n It sought to make injunction a last line \n\n[321 \nU.S. 50, 59]\n\u00a0\n of defense, available not only after other legally required methods, but after all reasonable methods as well, have been tried and found wanting. This purpose runs throughout the Act's provisions. It is dominant and explicit in Section 8. In short, the intent evidenced both by words and by policy was to gear the section's requirements squarely into the methods and procedures prescribed by the Railway Labor Act.\n Short reference to the legislative history makes this plain. There was extended discussion of the bill in the Congressional debates, a considerable part relating to the Railway Labor Act's provisions and operation. \n15\n No one suggested that the bill and that Act were not to be meshed in operation or that compliance with only one of the methods prescribed in Section 8 would satisfy its requirement of 'reasonable effort.' On the contrary, it seems to have been taken for granted that exhaustion of all is demanded. Numerous proposals for amendment in other respects were made, but there were none for changing this requirement. And Representative LaGuardia, who sponsored the bill in the House, after quoting and discussing provisions of the Railway Labor Act of 1926, quoted Section 8 and said, without challenge to his construction:\n'So that there is the tie-up between the provisions of the railroad labor act and the necessity of exhausting every remedy to adjust any difference which might arise. The workers could not and would not think of going on strike before all the remedies provided in the law have been exhausted. If the railroads have complied, they would not, as has been suggested (by Representative Beck), be deprived of any relief which they may have in law or equity.' (Emphasis added.)16 \n\n[321 \nU.S. 50, 60]\n\u00a0\n Representative O'Connor, supporting the sponsor's view, characterized Section 8 as 'the 'clean hands' provision' and said:\n\n'That section provides that a complainant shall not be entitled to an injunction if he has not complied with any contract or obligation on his part or has not made every reasonable effort to settle the dispute by the available methods of arbitration or mediation. Surely, this fundamental principle of equity that 'he who seeks justice must do justice' should apply in labor disputes as well as in other judicial controversies.'17\n\n To construe the section therefore as requiring but one of the three methods to be used, when the other two are equally available, would emasculate the language and would defeat the purpose and policy of the statute.\n It would do this by inviting semblance of compliance without its substance, motion of settlement without progress toward it. In railway disputes, the first short step in the succession provided by the Railway Labor Act could be taken and the remainder then could be hurdled by injunction. A party always could negotiate, that is, en- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 50, 61]\n\u00a0\n gage in collective bargaining,18 and thereby be relieved of the requirements, under Section 8, of mediation and arbitration. Thus, in this case, under the construction of the Court of Appeals, when respondent completed negotiations without the aid of mediation, there was no need to go on with mediation. In the court's view compliance with one of the specified methods satisfies the full requirements of Section 8.19 Yet negotiation, in the sense of bargaining collectively, under the Railway Labor Act is an obligation imposed by law. Section 2, Ninth; also First, Second; Virginian Ry. Co. v. System Federation No. 40, \n300 \nU.S. 515, 548\n, 57 S.Ct. 592, 599; cf. Texas & N.O.R. Co. v. Brotherhood of Railway and Steamship Clerks, \n281 \nU.S. 548\n, 50 S.Ct. 427; General Committee of Adjustment of Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers v. Missouri-Kansas-Texas R. Co., \n320 \nU.S. 323\n, 64 S.Ct. 146, 150. Obviously, if the view of the Court of Appeals is right, the condition requiring 'every reasonable effort to settle' the dispute becomes a dead letter in railway labor disputes, since no more would be required by its terms in that application than is called for by the first condition which demands compliance with legal obligations. Respondent, however, while apparently agreeing with the Court of Appeals that compliance with one method is sufficient, relies not only upon its negotiation, but also upon its participation in mediation. This serves it in no better stead. The section is not disjunctive as to arbitration, but conjunctive as to negotiation and mediation. The case is one, so far as both language and policy go, of one or all. \n20\n\u00a0\n\n[321 \nU.S. 50, 62]\n\u00a0\n Respondent's final contention, in this phase of the case, is the most insistent. It is that if 'voluntary arbitration,' as the term is used in Section 8, encompasses arbitration under the Railway Labor Act, by that fact the arbitration ceases to be 'voluntary' and the latter Act's requirement that it be so is violated. In short, it is said that effect is to force respondent to submit to compulsory arbitration.\n Without question, as respondent says, arbitration under the Railway Labor Act is voluntary. Section 7, First, requires the machinery to be put in motion by agreement of the parties. A proviso also declares, 'That the failure or refusal of either party to submit a controversy to arbitration shall not be construed as a violation of any legal obligation imposed upon such party by the terms of this Act or otherwise.' 45 U.S.C.  157, First, 45 U.S.C.A.  157, subd. 1. It is clear, therefore, that the Railway Labor Act's purpose is not to impose upon the parties a legal duty to arbitrate, enforceable as is the duty to bargain collectively imposed by Section 2, Ninth, discussed above. And if the effect of bringing that form of arbitration within the mandate of Section 8 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act were to create such a duty, so enforceable, respondent's contention would be more in point. But it does not do that. And the contention that it does entirely misconceives the effect of Section 7, First, of the Railway Labor Act, and confuses 'violation' of its terms with failure to comply with those of Section 8 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act. The proviso of Section 7, First, and the requirement of submission by agreement were in force substantially in their present form under the Railway Labor Act of 1926. 44 Stat. 582. It was exactly in the light of these provisions and with the intent, as has been shown, to make it include arbitration under the Railway Labor Act that Section 8 used the term 'voluntary arbitration.' Obviously there was no purpose in doing so to contradict the terms of both statutes and label 'voluntary' what in fact is compulsory. Nor was this the effect. Section 7, First, merely \n\n[321 \nU.S. 50, 63]\n\u00a0\n provides that failure to arbitrate shall not be construed as a violation of any legal obligation imposed upon the party failing by that Act or otherwise. Respondent's failure of refusal to arbitrate has not violated any obligation imposed upon it, whether by the Railway Labor Act or by the Norris-LaGuardia Act. No one has recourse against it by any legal means on account of this failure. Respondent is free to arbitrate or not, as it chooses. But if it refuses, it loses the legal right to have an injunction issued by a federal court or, to put the matter more accurately, it fails to perfect the right to such relief. This is not compulsory arbitration. It is compulsory choice between the right to decline arbitration and the right to have the aid of equity in a federal court.\n True, this deprives respondent of a protection to which it might have been entitled if the condition had not been imposed. But that is true of each of the section's conditions. And it is hardly more true with respect to one condition than with respect to others. Mediation, or for that matter negotiation, does not become compulsory because without them or either of them injunctive relief cannot be had. Neither does arbitration.\n Nor does it follow, as respondent seems to imply, that it is left without remedy. Other means of protection remain. Suits for recovery of damages still may be brought in the federal courts, when federal jurisdiction is shown to exist. Federal statutes supply criminal sanctions, enforceable in the federal courts, against persons who interfere in specified ways with the operation of interstate trains or destroy the property of interstate railroads. Cf. 18 U.S.C.  412a, 18 U.S.C.A.  412a. With these and other remedies that may be available we are concerned no further than to point out that respondent's failure to observe the requirements of Section 8 has not left it without legal protection. That failure has deprived it merely of one form of remedy which the Congress, exercising its plenary control over the jurisdic- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 50, 64]\n\u00a0\n tion of the federal courts,21 has seen fit to withhold. With the wisdom of that action we have no concern. It is enough, for its enforcement, that it is written plain and does not transcend the limits of the legislative power. Cf. Lauf v. E. G. Shinner & Co., \n303 \nU.S. 323\n, 58 S.Ct. 578.\n The fact is that respondent complied with the requirements of both Section 8 and the Railway Labor Act in all but the one essential respect. It recognized the employees' designated representatives, negotiated with them, engaged in mediation until it was terminated by the Board as the statute required. When it came, however, to the final and crucial step of arbitration, it declined to go forward as Section 8 requires if, later, injunctive relief is to be had. Whether the refusal was motivated by distrust of the Board,22 by a desire to escape the binding effect of an award,23 by preference for some other possible procedure,24 or merely by re- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 50, 65]\n\u00a0\n spondent's mistaken view of the section's requirements is not material. Arbitration under the Railway Labor Act was available, afforded a method for settlement Congress itself has provided, and until respondent accepted this method it had not made 'every reasonable effort to settle' the dispute, as Section 8 requires.\n It remains to refute a further basis for the ruling of the Court of Appeals. This was that, in accordance with its previous decisions, Section 8 does not apply when violence is involved. The terms of the Section offer no support for such a view. \n25\n And, if exceptions exist, to find one in the circumstances shown by this record would be to invert the statutory order of things. The purpose of the section is to head off strikes and the violence which too often accompanies them, by requiring the statutory steps to be taken before the aid of federal courts is sought in equity. Denial of that assistance is the sanction the statute affords to secure performance of the prescribed preventive measures. To give it, when they have not been taken, not only violates the section's terms. It defeats the purposes they were to accomplish and which, when achieved, make unnecessary invocation of the court's aid.\n In general the Act was not intended to interfere with the power to restrain violent acts. \n26\n And it was contemplated expressly the court might intervene to prevent them, when the particular circumstances show the complainant has had no opportunity to comply with such requirements as those of Section 8.27 But one major purpose of the Act was to prevent the use of injunction improperly as a strike breaking imple- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 50, 66]\n\u00a0\n ment. \n28\n And the discussion of Section 8 in the Congressional debates shows that, while it would not apply if on the facts the complainant could not meet its terms, it was intended to apply when he had had ample opportunity but refused to do so.29 This is clear not only from Representative O'Connor's 'clean hands' characterization of the section, 30 but also from the general character of the discussion regarding it. Most, if not all, of the objection was upon the mistaken view that Section 8 would apply even though the complainant might have no notice or knowledge of the facts calling for him to take the conciliatory steps before seeking injunctive relief. \n31\n What has been said above shows this was not the intent or effect of the section. There was indeed no expression of concern for the complainant who, having full opportunity to comply with the section, might refuse deliberately and steadfastly to do so. On the contrary, it appears to have been understood clearly he would be remitted to other forms of relief not touched by the Act.\n In view of the disposition we have made of the case, we have not determined the other issues which were presented. Some are of such importance they should not be decided in advance of necessity for determining them. That necessity is not present in this case. Accordingly, we express no opinion concerning those issues.\n The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Petitioners' brief characterizes their action as agreement 'to an indefinite postponement.' Respondent says 'the strike notice was at no time withdrawn, although it was temporarily withheld' until December 28. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The record does not disclose the exact time or manner of petitioners' agreement, but clearly indicates it was in response to this proposal of the Board, not the later one of December 28, which was addressed solely to respondent and recited the employees' previous agreement. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] There were twenty-nine of these. The employees involved in the dispute numbered about one hundred. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] It may be added to the background of facts that, between January 19, when the injunction issued, and the time when the appeal was perfected, various individual defendants, petitioners here, were cited to show cause why they should not be punished for contempt for violating the injunction. The court also issued an order on February 9 directing the marshal to enforce the injunction by proper means, including the employment of additional deputies if necessary. The record shows the citations were set for hearing but does not disclose what disposition was made of them. It appears, however, from the briefs that the persons cited were convicted and sentenced for violation of the injunction, sentence later being suspended pending the final determination of this case. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] In the lower courts and here this issue was highly controverted. Petitioners say jurisdiction is lacking since the cause of action is one merely for exercise of the general police power in the protection of the railroad's property. The complaint, it is said, does not specify and provision of federal law which requires construction or application and does no more than aver a general reference to federal statutes, including the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq., and the statute making criminal specified interferences with interstate railroad property. 18 U.S.C.  412a, 18 U.S.C.A.  412a; cf. Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264; Norton v. Whiteside, \n239 \nU.S. 144\n, 36 S.Ct. 97; Niles-Bement-Pond Co. v. Iron Moulders' Union, \n254 \nU.S. 77\n, 41 S.Ct. 39; Gully v. First National Bank, \n299 \nU.S. 109\n, 57 S.Ct. 96.\n Respondent and the lower courts find the jurisdictional basis generally in the duties imposed upon carriers by the Interstate Commerce Act and other federal statutes, including the criminal statute referred to above. They rely upon such authorities as Ex parte Lennon, \n166 \nU.S. 548\n, 17 S.Ct. 658; Toledo, Ann Arbor & North Michigan Ry. Co. v. Pennsylvania Co., C.C.N.D.Ohio, 54 F. 730, 19 L.R.A. 387; and Wabash R. Co. v. Hannahan, C.C.E.D.Mo., 121 F. 563. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Cf. the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 29 U.S.C.  107(e), 29 U.S.C.A.  107( e), 47 Stat. 71. \n[\nFootnote 7\n] Petitioners also urge that the temporary restraining order became void on the expiration of five days by the provisions of 29 U.S.C.  107(e ), 29 U.S.C.A.  107(e), and could not be extended beyond that time; hence the orders continuing it in force were nullities; and that the evidence was insufficient to show they had participated in or ratified any act of violence or of interference with respondent's operations or property. \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Cf. text infra at note 21. \n[\nFootnote 9\n] Cf. 45 U.S.C.  157, 45 U.S.C.A.  157, 44 Stat. 582-584, 48 Stat. 1197. Each party selects an equal number of arbitrators who select another or others, but in case of failure of the named arbitrators to agree the Mediation Board selects the additional member or members. \n[\nFootnote 10\n] The award is made final and conclusive upon the parties, except for possible impeachment of the judgment entered upon it, in judicial proceedings, on grounds specified in the statute. 45 U.S.C.  158(l), (m), ( n), 45 U.S.C.A.  158(l, m, n), 44 Stat. 584-586, 48 Stat. 1197;  159, Second, Third, 44 Stat. 585. \n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] It is not necessary to determine whether they are illustrative or exclusive. Respondent's emphasis upon the disjunctive meaning of 'either ... or ... or' effectually eliminates 'every' from the section. It distorts 'every reasonable effort' into meaning, in effect, 'one of the following reasonable efforts.' A similar distortion is its apparent view that the phrase 'with the aid of any available governmental machinery' qualifies only 'mediation' and not 'voluntary arbitration.' Cf. the further discussion in the text, infra at note 20. And if the section uses 'or' only in the disjunctive, it would be enough either to comply with legal obligations or to make reasonable effort, a view so obviously untenable it has not been suggested. \n[\nFootnote 12\n] The Norris-LaGuardia Act was adopted March 23, 1932. 47 Stat. 70. At that time the Railway Labor Act of 1926 was in force. 44 Stat. 577. Though it differed in substantial respects from the Railway Labor Act of 1934, now in effect (48 Stat. 1185), it contained provisions for the three procedures of negotiation, mediation and arbitration which, for present purposes, were identical with or substantially similar to those of the later statute. The 1934 changes related principally to the machinery for making the procedures effective, though in some instances it more definitely crystallized legal obligations. \n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] Much of the debate in Congress related to previous railway labor disputes, including the Pullman controversy of 1894 and the shop-craft strike of 1922, and to decisions relating to injunctions which had been issued in connection with these disputes, e.g., In re Debs, \n158 \nU.S. 564\n, 15 S.Ct. 900; cf. 75 Cong.Rec. 4618-4620, 5472-5479, 5503- 5504. \n[\nFootnote 14\n] Cf. the debates in Congress, 75 Cong.Rec. 4505-4510, 4618-4626, 5462-5515. \n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] Cf. notes 13, 14 supra. \n[\nFootnote 16\n] 75 Cong.Rec. 5504. And, at 5508, in response to an inquiry whether or not Section 8's requirements would apply where it might be impossible to move for settlement by negotiation, mediation or arbitration, he stated:\n'The answer to that is simple. In seeking a restraining order a party believed to be aggrieved comes into court and under a certain state of facts, which are enumerated in the bill itself, asks for a restraining order. If time has not permitted him or the corporation to avail itself of the existing governmental machinery for the settlement of a labor dispute, he recites that as one of his facts, which is a full compliance, of course, with the provisions of section 8, which makes it a condition precedent that every remedy must be exhausted to settle the strike before the injunction will issue.' (Emphasis added.) \n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] 75 Cong.Rec. 5464. It was partly for fear of the effects of requiring compliance with Section 8's provisions, upon interruption of service, that Mr. Beck, who led opposition to the bill, urgently advocated an amendment exempting public utilities. 75 Cong.Rec. 5503-5504. \n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] It may be assumed that the negotiation must be done in good faith, as is true under the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq., cf. e.g., N.L.R.B. v. George P. Pilling & Son Co., 3 Cir., 119 F.2d 32. \n[\nFootnote 19\n] 'The employer is not compelled to avail himself of all three methods; any one of them will fulfill the requirements. Thus in Mayo v. Dean, 5 Cir., 82 F.2d 554, 556, it was held that the employer is not obliged to propose both mediation and arbitration.' 132 F.2d 265, 271. \n[\nFootnote 20\n] Cf. note 11, supra. \n\n[\nFootnote 21\n] Cf. Lockerty v. Phillips, \n319 \nU.S. 182\n, 63 S.Ct. 1019, and authorities cited. \n[\nFootnote 22\n] Respondent's brief contains the following:\n'... respondent had reached the point where its only recourse was to request an impartial body, namely: an emergency board, to hear the evidence and decide the issues involved.\n\n'There is no presumption that this governmental agency would be fair, just and impartial, in the conduct of the arbitration, and with the experience which the respondent had had in the mediation, it could not be charged with bad faith in refusing to sign an arbitration agreement, where the arbitration proceedings were to be conducted under the same atmosphere.\n\n'Respondent has always insisted upon a fair and impartial hearing of this labor dispute before a body which has no connection with either the Brotherhood interests or the railroad interests, and to this date it has been unsuccessful to have its case presented to a body of that character.'

GERDES(1944)\nNo. 183\nArgued: January 4, 1944Decided: February 7, 1944\n\n\n\n\n[321 \nU.S. 178, 179]\n\u00a0\n Mr. William C. Scott, of New York City, for petitioners.\n Mr. John Gerdes, of New York City, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question in this case is whether the New York court or the federal bankruptcy court has the power to fix the fees of petitioners who as attorneys represented the bankruptcy estate in litigation in the state courts. The \n\n[321 \nU.S. 178, 180]\n\u00a0\n New York Court of Appeals held that that jurisdiction rested exclusively in the bankruptcy court. 290 N.Y. 468, 49 N.E.2d 718. The case is here on a petition for writ of certiorari which we granted because of the importance of the problem under the Bankruptcy Act.\n In January, 1939, a petition for reorganization of Reynolds Investing Co., Inc. was approved under Ch. X of the Bankruptcy Act. 52 Stat. 883, 11 U.S.C.  501 et seq., 11 U.S.C.A.  501 et seq. In August, 1938, while the petition was pending but before its approval, the bankruptcy court authorized the debtor to commence an action in the New York courts to enforce and collect certain claims which the debtor had against its former officers and directors. See Gerdes v. Reynolds, Sup., 28 N.Y.S.2d 622. It also authorized retention of petitioners as counsel in the suit. After the approval of the petition the respondent trustees were authorized to prosecute the action and to be substituted as plaintiffs. That was done; and other actions were instituted by the trustees under order of the bankruptcy court with petitioners as counsel. In 1941 before final judgments were obtained in any of the suits, the trustees discontinued petitioners' services. Thereafter petitioners, pursuant to a stipulation1 which reserved respondents' right to question the jurisdiction of the state court, instituted this suit in that court to fix and enforce their liens on the actions under  475 of the New York Judiciary Law, Consol. Laws N.Y. c. 30.2 Respondents' objection to the ju- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 178, 181]\n\u00a0\n risdiction of the state court was overruled, the value of petitioners' services determined and the liens fixed. Those orders were affirmed by the Appellate Division (264 App.Div. 852, 36 N.Y.S.2d 420) but reversed by the Court of Appeals. And as we read the opinion of that court the basis of its decision was that 'exclusive jurisdiction' to fix these fees was in the bankruptcy court (290 N.Y. pages 472, 473, 475, 49 N.E.2d pages 719, 720), not that New York as a matter of local law or policy would not undertake to fix them because of the special circumstances of this case.\n We agree with the Court of Appeals that the power to determine the amount of these fees rests exclusively in the bankruptcy court.\n Sec. 77B, like  77 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A.  207, 2053 had as one of its purposes the establishment of more effective control over reorganization fees and expenses (Dickinson Industrial Site, Inc. v. Cowan, \n309 \nU.S. 382, 388\n, 60 S.Ct. 595, 599; Callaghan v. Reconstruction Finance Corp., \n297 \nU.S. 464, 469\n, 56 S.Ct. 519, 521) in recognition of the effect which a depletion of the cash resources of the estate may have on both the fairness and feasibility of the plan of reorganization. United States v. Chicago, Milwaukee, St. P. & P.R. Co., \n282 \nU.S. 311\n, 333-340, 51 S.Ct. 159, 165-168 ( dissenting opinion). And Ch. X of the Chandler Act which took the place of  77B set up even more comprehensive supervision over compensation and allowances (H. Rep. No. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 178, 182]\n\u00a0\n 1409, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 45, 46) and provided a centralized control over all administration expenses, of which lawyers' fees are a part. Watkins v. Sedberry, \n261 \nU.S. 571\n, 43 S.Ct. 411. Sec. 241, 11 U.S.C.A.  641, gives the judge authoity to fix 'reasonable compensation for services rendered' by various persons, including attorneys for the trustees. Allowances may be made only after hearing and upon notice to specified persons and groups of persons.  247, 11 U.S.C.A .  647. Where the reorganization supersedes a prior proceeding in either the federal or state court the bankruptcy court is the one which is authorized to allow the 'reasonable costs and expenses incurred' in the prior proceeding.  258, 11 U.S.C.A.  658. In all cases persons who seek compensation for services or reimbursement for expenses are held to fiduciary standards.  249, 11 U.S.C.A.  649; Woods v. City National Bank & Trust Co., \n312 \nU.S. 262\n, 267-269, 61 S.Ct. 493, 496, 497. And  250, 11 U.S.C.A.  650 contains special appeal provisions governing orders granting or denying allowances. Dickinson Industrial Site, Inc. v. Cowan, supra. Moreover, a plan of reorganization must provide 'for the payment of all costs and expenses of administration and other allowances which may be approved or made by the judge.'  216(3), 11 U.S.C.A.  616(3 ). In addition the plan must provide, in furtherance of the purpose of the Act to protect the security holders against previous acts of mismanagement and to preserve all assets of the estate (S. Rep. No. 1916, 75th Cong., 3d Sess., p. 22; H. Rep. No. 1409, supra, pp. 42-44), for retention and enforcement by the trustee of all claims of the debtor or the estate not settled or adjusted in the plan.  216(13). Finally,  221(4), 11 U.S.C.A .  621(4) provides that in approving any plan the judge must be satisfied that 'all payments made or promised' by the debtor, the new company, or any other person 'for services and for costs and expenses' are not only fully disclosed but 'are reasonable or, if to be fixed after confirmation of the plan, will be subject to the approval of the judge.'\n Thus Ch. X not only contains detailed machinery governing all claims for allowances from the estate. It also \n\n[321 \nU.S. 178, 183]\n\u00a0\n requires the plan to contain provisions for the payment of all allowances and places on the judge the duty to pass on their reasonableness. The approval of the plan of reorganization has been entrusted to the bankruptcy court exclusively. Even reports on plans submitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission are 'advisory only'.  172, 11 U.S.C.A .  572. It could hardly be contended that the bankruptcy court might dispense with the finding required by  221(2) that the plan is 'fair and equitable, and feasible' and confirm the plan on another basis or delegate the task to another court or agency. See Case v. Los Angeles Lumber Products Co., \n308 \nU.S. 106, 114\n, 115 S., 60 S.Ct. 1, 6, 7; Consolidated Rock Products Co. v. Du Bois, \n312 \nU.S. 510\n, 61 S.Ct. 675. But if that cannot be done, it is difficult to see how a plan could be confirmed which left the approval of certain allowances to a state court. The finding as to allowances required by  221(4) is as explicit and as mandatory as the finding of 'fair and equitable, and feasible' required by  221(2). On each Congress has asked for the informed judgment of the bankruptcy court, not another court or agency. In the present case the plan of reorganization which was approved in 1940 gave the trustees full power to retain or displace attorneys representing them; and it retained in the bankruptcy court continuing jurisdiction over all claims in favor of the debtor and the prosecution thereof. And in accordance with the express requirements of  241(3) it left to the bankruptcy court the power to fix the 'reasonable compensation' to be paid the attorneys of the trustees. Those requirements, prescribed by the Act, cause any conflicting procedure in the state courts to give way. \n4\n Kalb v. Feuerstein, \n308 \nU.S. 433\n, 60 S.Ct. 343. The jurisdiction which Congress has conferred on the bankruptcy \n\n[321 \nU.S. 178, 184]\n\u00a0\n court is paramount and exclusive. Gross v. Irving Trust Co., \n289 \nU.S. 342\n, 53 S.Ct. 605, 90 A.L.R. 1215. Thus the supervention of bankruptcy deprives a state court, in which a receivership was pending, of power to fix the compensation of the receivers and their counsel who were appointed by the state court and who rendered service in the state proceedings. Gross v. Irving Trust Co., supra; Emil v. Hanley, \n318 \nU.S. 515, 519\n, 63 S.Ct. 687, 689.\n Sherman v. Buckley, 2 Cir., 119 F.2d 280, which arose in ordinary bankruptcy, is relied upon for the contrary conclusion. In that case an action brought by the bankrupt had been pending in the state court for seven years before the adjudication in bankruptcy. The trustee obtained the consent of the bankruptcy court to allow the action to be prosecuted in the state court on behalf of the estate and to substitute attorneys other than those retained by the bankrupt. It was held that the state court could require as a condition upon the substitution the liquidation of the New York charging lien of the displaced attorneys. Whether that case was correctly decided on its facts we need not stop to inquire. It is sufficient to say that it does not state the correct rule of law under Ch. X of the Act.\n It is said, however, that  77B rather than Ch. X measures the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court since the main suit was instituted in the state court prior to the effective date of Ch. X, September 22, 1938. See  7, 11 U.S.C.A.  25. But the short answer is that the petition was approved after that date and the provisions of Ch. X were thus brought into play. \n5\n It is suggested that since  23 of \n\n[321 \nU.S. 178, 185]\n\u00a0\n the Act6 was applicable to reorganizations under  77B but inapplicable7 to those under Ch. X ( 102, 11 U.S.C.A.  502), there was a greater limitation on the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court over plenary suits at the time the main suit was instituted than there was after Ch. X became effective. \n8\n From that it is argued that since Congress left the enforcement of such claims to the state courts, it permitted them to control all incidents of the litigation including the fixing of attorneys' liens. Sec. 23 deals with questions of the jurisdiction of federal district courts, e.g., whether in suits by trustees in bankruptcy against adverse claimants the jurisdiction of the district courts rests on consent of the parties regardless of diversity of citizenship. Schumacher v. Beeler, \n293 \nU.S. 367\n, 55 S.Ct. 230. The fact that the suits against the former officers and directors of the debtor could have been brought in the state courts alone does not advance the solution of the present problem. A bankruptcy trustee who by choice or by necessity resorts to a state court for the prosecution of a claim is of course bound by the adjudication made in the state proceeding. Winchester v. Heiskell, \n119 \nU.S. 450\n, 7 S.Ct. 281; Fischer v. Pauline Oil \n\n[321 \nU.S. 178, 186]\n\u00a0\n & Gas Co., \n309 \nU.S. 294, 303\n, 60 S.Ct. 535, 539. The state court has full control over the litigation. But even as an incident thereto, it may not take action which involves the performance of functions which Congress has entrusted to the bankruptcy court. See Eau Claire National Bank v. Jackman, \n204 \nU.S. 522, 537\n, 538 S., 27 S.Ct. 391, 396.\n The suggestion has been made that New York could open its courts to the prosecution of such suits as the trustees instituted on condition that New York control the legal fees incident to the litigation; and that so long as New York did not discriminate against those asserting rights under the federal act such condition would be valid. Cf. Douglas v. New York, N. H. & H.R. Co., \n279 \nU.S. 377\n, 49 S.Ct. 355. It does not appear, however, that New York has followed that course. The fact that New York has adopted measures designed to protect attorneys practicing in its courts does not demonstrate that New York has made its control over the fees a condition to the use of its tribunals. There is no such indication in the opinion of the New York Court of Appeals. Thus we cannot say that New York has provided conditions for entry into its courts which collide with a Congressional enactment. We can only assume therefore that the case is no different in principle from the one where a state grants to creditors attachments in aid of the collection of their claims. There can be no doubt that such liens could be nullified by supervening bankruptcy whether the creditor be lawyer or merchant.\n But if it is assumed that New York might have refused to entertain such suits as were brought against the old management (cf. Mondou v. New York, N.H. & H.R. Co., \n223 \nU.S. 1\n, 56-59, 32 S.Ct. 169, 177, 178, 38 L.R.A., N.S., 44), it does not follow that it could take jurisdiction of them but fail to apply any federal law in which those claims might be rooted. Garrett v. Moore-McCormack Co., \n317 \nU.S. 239\n, 63 S. Ct. 246. Where Congress has prescribed the rule to govern the compensation of those em- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 178, 187]\n\u00a0\n ployed by the bankruptcy court, those claims are no less dependent on the federal rule because they are asserted as an incident to another suit. If the state court could disregard the federal rule in that situation, then any of the duties of administration which Congress has imposed on the bankruptcy court could be absorbed by the state tribunal. Eau Claire National Bank v. Jackman, supra. Congress has fixed the fees which various representatives or officers of the bankruptcy court may receive for their services.  40, 48, 11 U.S.C.A.  68, 76. Among these are the bankruptcy trustees.  48(c). As in the present case those trustees may at times choose to act as their own attorneys. But it would be novel doctrine indeed to hold that state courts could increase any maximum allowance which Congress might authorize bankruptcy trustees to receive from the estate merely because the trustees rendered some of their services in state tribunals. Yet if Congress can protect bankruptcy estates by itself prescribing maximum fees for those representing or rendering service to the estate, it is not apparent why it may not reach the same result by delegating that authority to the bankruptcy court. Whatever doubts may have once existed as to the functions of a reorganization court, it is clear under this recent bankruptcy legislation that the approval of all fees as part of the plan has been entrusted to the bankruptcy court exclusively. The case is therefore controlled by the principle of Hines v. Lowrey, \n305 \nU.S. 85\n, 59 S.Ct. 31. In that case we held that where an Act of Congress limited to ten dollars the fees for services in connection with veterans' War Risk Insurance claims, the New York court could not award a greater amount to an attorney representing a guardian of an insane veteran even where the guardian was appointed by the New York court. We reversed a judgment of the New York court granting the attorney $ 1500 for his services. The purpose of Congress to place the control of petitioners' \n\n[321 \nU.S. 178, 188]\n\u00a0\n fees in the bankruptcy court is no less clear than its purpose to limit the amount of fees in the Hines case. In each the federal rule is the supreme law of the land.\n We only hold that the bankruptcy court has exclusive authority under Ch. X to fix the amount of allowances for fees. Whether the amount so fixed could be secured by a lien created by local law raises a question which we do not reach.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS concurs in the result.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER, concurring.\n\n 1. \nSince 1789, rights derived from federal law could be enforced in state courts unless Congress confined their enforcement to the federal courts. This has been so precisely for the same reason that rights created by the British Parliament or by the Legislature of Vermont could be enforced in the New York courts. Neither Congress nor the British Parliament nor the Vermont Legislature has power to confer jurisdiction upon the New York courts. But the jurisdiction conferred upon them by the only authority that has power to create them and to confer jurisdiction upon them-namely the law-making power of the State of New York-enables them to enforce rights no matter what the legislative source of the right may be. See, for instance, United States v. Jones, \n109 \nU.S. 513, 520\n, 3 S. Ct. 346, 351\n\n\n 2. In short, subject to only one limitation, each State of the Union may establish its own judicature, distribute judicial power among the courts of its choice, define the conditions for the exercise of their jurisdiction and the modes of their proceeding, to the same extent as Congress is empowered to establish a system of inferior federal courts within the limits of federal judicial power, and the States are as free from control by Congress in establishing \n\n[321 \nU.S. 178, 189]\n\u00a0\n state systems for litigation as is Congress free from state control in establishing a federal system for litigation. The only limitation upon the freedom of a State to define the jurisdiction of its own courts is that implied by Article IV, Section 2 of the Constitution, whereby 'The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.' The Constitution does not require New York to give jurisdiction to its courts against its will. But 'If the state does provide a court to which its own citizens may resort in a certain class of cases, it may be that citizens of other states of the Union also would have a right to resort to it in cases of the same class.' Anglo-Am. Provision Co. v. Davis Provision Co. No. 1, \n191 \nU.S. 373, 374\n, 24 S.Ct. 92, 93. The matter was well put by Judge Cuthbert Pound in connection with litigation under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, 45 U.S.C.A.  51 et seq., in the state courts: 'the state courts must make no hostile discrimination against litigants who come within the act in question; ... they must treat litigants under the federal act as other litigants are treated; ... they are to act in conformity with their general principles of practice and procedure and are not to deny jurisdiction merely because the right of action arises under the act of Congress.' Murnan v. Wabash Railway Co., 246 N.Y. 244, 247, 158 N.E. 508, 509, 54 A.L.R. 1522.\n\n 3. \nThe upshot of the matter is that 'rights, whether legal or equitable, acquired under the laws of the United States, may be prosecuted in the United States courts, or in the State courts, competent to decide rights of the like character and class; subject, however, to this qualification, that where a right arises under a law of the United States, Congress may, if it see fit, give to the Federal courts exclusive jurisdiction.' Claflin v. Houseman, Assignee, \n93 \nU.S. 130, 136\n, 137 S.. Whether a state court is 'competent to decide rights of the like character and class', whether the particular litigation is to be tried by jury and, if so, how the jury \n\n[321 \nU.S. 178, 190]\n\u00a0\n is to be composed, whether it is to be a jury of twelve or less, whether decision is to be by unanimity or majority, whether security is to be furnished and of what nature-in sum, whether a state court can take jurisdiction and what the incidents of the litigation should be-all these are matters wholly within the control of the State creating the court and without the power of Congress. See, for instance, Minneapolis & St. Louis R.R. v. Bombolis, \n241 \nU.S. 211\n, 36 S.Ct. 595, L.R.A.1917A, 86, Ann.Cas.1916E, 505. As it was put by Mr. Justice Story in Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, 1 Wheat. 304, 330, 331, 'Congress cannot vest any portion of the judicial power of the United States, except in courts ordained and established by itself'. Congress may avail itself of state courts for the enforcement of federal rights, but it must take the state courts as it finds them, subject to all the conditions for litigation in the state courts that the State has decreed for every other litigant who seeks access to its courts.\n\n 4. \nCongress from the beginning has allowed federally created rights to be enforced in state courts not only by the general implications of our legal system but also by explicit authorization. The nature of the obligation of the state court under such legislation has been most litigated in connection with the Federal Employers' Liability Act, and after thorough canvass the matter was thus summarized by Mr. Justice Holmes in Douglas v. New York, New Haven, etc., R. Co., \n279 \nU.S. 377, 387\n, 388 S., 49 S.Ct. 355, 356, 'As to the grant of jurisdiction in the Employers' Liability Act, that statute does not purport to require State Courts to entertain suits arising under it but only to empower them to do so, so far as the authority of the United States is concerned. It may very well be that if the Supreme Court of New York were given no discretion, being otherwise competent, it would be subject to a duty. But there is nothing in the Act of Congress that purports to force a duty upon such Courts as against an otherwise valid excuse.' \n\n[321 \nU.S. 178, 191]\n\u00a0\n 5. The simple fact is that from 1789 to this day no act of Congress has attempted to force upon state courts the duty of enforcing any right created by federal law on terms other than those on which like litigation involving rights other than federal rights is required to be conducted in a state court. It certainly has not done so by the Bankruptcy Act nor can any implication to that effect be derived from the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution. For the Supremacy Clause does not give greater supremacy to the Bankruptcy Act over the free scope of the States to determine what shall be litigated in their courts and under what conditions, than it gives with reference to rights directly secured by the Constitution, such as those guaranteed by the Full Faith and Credit Clause, see Anglo- American Provision Co. v. Davis Provision Co. No. 1, supra, or with reference to the power exercised by Congress under the Commerce Clause, see Minneapolis & St. Louis R.R. v. Bombolis, supra.\n\n 6. \nThe exercise of a right which Congress has not sought to exercise since 1789 and evidently has not exercised because of the constitutional relation of federal rights to their enforcement in state courts should not be read into Chapter X. c. 575, 52 Stat. 883, 11 U.S.C.  501 et seq., 11 U.S.C.A.  501 et seq. We should hesitate long before we find that Congress has assumed the power to render unconstitutional state legislation by which access to a state court would be allowed to a litigant on no different terms than those which the State has prescribed for its own litigants to whom access to its courts is given in like cases. And certainly such a wholly novel doctrine of constitutional law should not be resorted to gratuitously when the case before us can be disposed of on the conclusive ground that the litigation conducted in the New York courts was conducted under an arrangement consonant with New York law, namely that the attorneys' fees were to be fixed not by the New York courts \n\n[321 \nU.S. 178, 192]\n\u00a0\n but by the Bankruptcy Court. See Matter of Heinsheimer, 214 N.Y. 361, 108 N.E. 636, Ann.Cas.1916E, 384. Recognition that such is New York law and that therefore the remission of fee-fixing in this case to the Bankruptcy Court is not in conflict with that law appears from the opinion below: 'as a matter of fact the retainer of these attorneys was subject to the condition that the amount of any fees would be fixed by the United States District Court.' 290 N.Y. 468, 475, 49 N.E.2d 718, 720. The disposition of this case requires neither the assumption made in the Court's opinion relating to New York law, nor the application given to Chapter X, both of which must be inescapable before we even reach the constitutional issue needlessly projected.\n\n 7. \nHines v. Lowrey, \n305 \nU.S. 85\n, 59 S.Ct. 31, does not touch this problem. That case involved  500 of the World War Veterans' Act, 38 U.S.C.A.  551, which limited to $10 the fee that may be allowed for services in pressing a claim before the United States Veterans' Bureau and made it a crime to charge more. A New York court granted a fee of $ 1500 for such services because the estate of the veteran was being administered by a committee appointed by the state court which had appointed an attorney to press the claim before the Veterans' Bureau. Of course this Court held that a state court cannot sanction that which Congress has outlawed as a crime. The New York court in effect denied the authority of federal law to fix fees for litigation before a federal tribunal-a very different thing from denying to the State of New York the authority to fix fees for litigation in its own courts. The limitations in the Hines case fixed by Congress did not run counter to any requirement of New York law governing the conduct of suits in its courts. That case was not concerned with such a situation, and therefore could not possibly hold that, if New York had a policy for litigation in its courts contrary to that expressed by Congressional enactment, a federal right could be pursued in disregard of the conditions for entry \n\n[321 \nU.S. 178, 193]\n\u00a0\n into New York courts applicable to all other litigants. Congress has never said that it can subvert the declared policy of a State as to the manner in which, or the conditions under which, litigation in state courts should be conducted. The federal law in any field within which Congress is empowered to legislate is the supreme law of the land in the sense that it may supplant state legislation in that field, but not in the sense that it may supplant the existing rules of litigation in state courts. Congress has full power to provide its own courts for litigating federal rights. The state courts belong to the States. They are not subject to the control of Congress though of course state law may in words or by implication make the federal rule for conducting litigation the rule that should govern suits to enforce federal rights in the state courts. Surely it cannot be that should New York decide to regulate the public profession of the law by putting the determination of all attorneys' fees in charge of its courts, Congress could provide that actions thereafter brought in New York courts in the enforcement of federal rights shall not be subject to New York's fee system. I repeat, Hines v. Lowrey, supra, gives no support whatever to a claim which was not involved in that case, which it did not consider, and which runs counter to the whole course of federal judiciary legislation and federal adjudication.\n We ought not to go out of our way to embarrass consideration of such delicate questions in the working of our federal system whenever in the future they may call for decision by this Court.\n Mr. Justice JACKSON joins in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Respondents sought an order from the bankruptcy court directing petitioners to turn over their papers and memoranda. That motion was resisted by petitioners who claimed that the New York court had exclusive jurisdiction. Thereupon a stipulation was entered into with the approval of the bankruptcy court whereby respondents withdrew their motion and petitioners agreed to institute a suit in the state court for fixation of their liens, if any.

ELECTRIC UTILITIES EMPLOYEES UNION(1944)\nNo. 74\nArgued: November 17, 1944Decided: December 4, 1944\n\n\n\n\n[323 \nU.S. 72, 73]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Warren E. Magee, of Washington D.C., for Jeff Busby and others.\n Mr. John J. Carmody, of Washington, D.C., for Electric Utilities Employees Union.\n\n PER CURIAM.\n In this case the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, pursuant to Judicial Code,  239, 28 U.S.C.  346, 28 U.S.C.A.  346, has certified to this Court the following question: 'Is an unincorporated Labor Union, with its principal office in the District of Columbia, suable as such in an action in debt brought against it in the District Court of the United States for the District of Columbia, where service of process is duly had upon its President at its principal office?'\n Rule 17(b) of the Rules of Civil Procedure for the District Courts of the United States, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c, provides, in the case of a party other than an individual or a corporation, that: 'capacity to sue or be sued shall be determined by the law of the state in which the district court is held; except that a partnership or other unincorporated association, which has no such capacity by the law of such state, may sue or be sued in its common name for the purpose of enforcing for or against it a substantive right existing under the Constitution or laws of the United States.'\n By Rule 81(e), the 'law of the state' in proceedings in the District Court of the United States for the District of Columbia is 'the law applied in the District of Columbia.' That law is derived from the common law and statutes of Maryland in force at the time of the cession of the District to the United States, as modified by statutes of Congress and as determined and developed by the courts of the District. Act of February 27, 1801, 2 Stat. \n\n[323 \nU.S. 72, 74]\n\u00a0\n 103; Armstrong v. Lear, 12 Wheat. 169, 176; McKenna v. Fisk, 1 How. 241, 249.\n Under these Rules, a plaintiff may proceed in the District Court for the District of Columbia against an unincorporated labor union in its common name if, by the law of the District, it has capacity to be sued as such. Only if it be decided that by the local law such a union does not have capacity to be sued in its own name need there be consideration of the second part of Rule 17(b), which permits a suit against an unincorporated association for the enforcement of 'a substantive right existing under the Constitution or laws of the United States.'\n The certificate in this case discloses that the Court of Appeals is in doubt as to the meaning and application of the rule laid down in United Mine Workers v. Coronado Coal Co., \n259 \nU.S. 344\n, 383-392, 42 S.Ct. 570, 573-577, 27 A.L.R. 762, and the effect upon it of the second part of Rule 17(b); cf. Brown v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 134, 141\n, 48 S.Ct. 288, 289; People of Puerto Rico v. Russell & Co., \n288 \nU.S. 476\n, 480-482, 483, 484, 53 S.Ct. 447, 448, 449, 450; Moffat Tunnel League v. United States, \n289 \nU.S. 113, 118\n, 53 S.Ct. 543, 545. But under Rules 17 and 81 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, as we have said, that question cannot arise in the present suit, unless it is first decided that under the law of the District an unincorporated labor union is without capacity to be sued in its own name. And we do not understand the certificate to seek our aid in the determination of this question of local law.\n In any event, we think it appropriate that the question of local law should be answered by the courts of the District before this Court is called upon to answer it, or to consider the application and effect of the second part of Rule 17(b) in an action in debt brought in the District of Columbia against an unincorporated labor union. There are cogent reasons why this Court should not undertake to decide questions of local law without the aid of some expression of the views of judges of the local courts \n\n[323 \nU.S. 72, 75]\n\u00a0\n who are familiar with the intricacies and trends of local law and practice. We do not ordinarily decide such questions without that aid where they may conveniently be decided in the first instance by the court whose special function it is to resolve questions of the local law of the jurisdiction over which it presides. Huddleston v. Dwyer, \n322 \nU.S. 232, 237\n, 64 S.Ct. 1015, 1018, and cases cited. Only in exceptional cases will this Court review a determination of such a question by the Court of Appeals for the District. District of Columbia v. Pace, \n320 \nU.S. 698, 702\n, 64 S.Ct. 406, 408, and cases cited.\n It is not the function of the certificate authorized by 28 U.S.C.  346, 28 U.S.C.A.  346, to require this Court to answer questions not shown to be necessary to the decision of the case. A question will not be answered if it is hypothetical, Webster v. Cooper, 10 How. 54, 55; Pelham v. Rose, 9 Wall. 103, 107; White v. Johnson, \n282 \nU.S. 367, 373\n, 51 S.Ct. 115, 118; Lowden v. Northwestern National Bank & Trust Co., \n298 \nU.S. 160, 162\n, 163 S., 56 S.Ct. 696, 697, 698, or if it is dependent upon other questions which may not appropriately be answered, Jewell v. Knight, \n123 \nU.S. 426, 432\n, 433 S., 435, 8 S.Ct. 193, 194, 195, 196; Lowden v. Northwestern National Bank & Trust Co., supra, \n298 \nU.S. 166\n, 56 S.Ct. 699. This Court will not answer a question which will not arise in the pending controversy unless another issue, not yet resolved by the certifying court, is decided in a particular way. Triplett v. Lowell, \n297 \nU.S. 638\n, 647-649, 56 S.Ct. 645, 649, 650; Webster v. Cooper, supra, 10 How. 55; cf. United States v. Buzzo, 18 Wall. 125, 129.\n We do not answer the question as to the effect of the second part of Rule 17(b), since the answer will be decisive of the case only in the event that a question of local law, not answered by the Court of Appeals and inappropriate for us to consider in the first instance, receives one rather than another answer. We have no occasion to discuss the meaning and application of the rule of the Coronado case or the second part of Rule 17( b), which are relevant only for the purpose of answering the question \n\n[323 \nU.S. 72, 76]\n\u00a0\n which, as we have said, we cannot properly answer. The certificate is accordingly dismissed. So ordered.\n Certificate dismissed.\n Mr. Justice RUTLEDGE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER, concurring.\n I join in the per curiam on the assumption that after the Court of Appeals will have disposed of all issues to be decided by local District of Columbia law nothing will be left in the certified question for this Court to answer.\n This is a suit for a lawyer's fee, that is, an ordinary District of Columbia common-law action of debt and not one to enforce 'a substantive right existing under the Constitution or laws of the United States.' For, I take it, in allowing an unincorporated association to be sued 'in its common name for the purpose of enforcing ... a substantive right existing under the ... laws of the United States', Rule 17(b) of the Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c, referred to laws of general applicability throughout the United States and not to the body of local law governing the District of Columbia. Therefore, suability of an unincorporated labor union is a local procedural problem to be determined, according to Rule 17(b) in conjunction with Rule 81(e), by the local law of the District. That 'the suability of trades unions ... is after all in essence and principle merely a procedural matter' is vouched for by the Coronado case, \n259 \nU.S. 344, 390\n, 42 S.Ct. 570, 576, 27 A.L.R. 762, the scope of which has been authoritatively defined in Brown v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 134, 141\n, 48 S.Ct. 288, 289, and Moffat Tunnel League v. United States, \n289 \nU.S. 113, 118\n, 53 S.Ct. 543, 545. Since substantive rights were outside the authority given by Congress for prescribing rules of civil procedure, Rule 17(b) and the note thereto by the Advisory Committee on Rules, by dealing with capacity to sue or be sued, decisively confirm the \n\n[323 \nU.S. 72, 77]\n\u00a0\n statement in the Coronado case that the suability of a trade union is a procedural matter.\n But if such a procedural matter may be cast in the form of a substantive issue for the determination of status, it would, in this case in any event, be a question of the substantive law of the District and not raise any substantive issue of federal law. If a suit like this were brought in the District Court for the Southern District of New York under diversity jurisdiction, no conceivable question other than that of the procedural or substantive law of the State of New York could arise. No federal question is infused into the litigation because such a local suit was brought in the District of Columbia.\n In view of the increase in the volume and the complexity of the business that is coming to this Court, and the bearing of this increase upon the proper discharge of its work (see Ex parte Republic of Peru, \n318 \nU.S. 578\n, 602-604, 63 S.Ct. 793, 806, 807), I deem it important to avoid any encouragement however slight to futile resort to this Court. \n\n\n\n","18":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nC.I.R. v. LANE-WELLS CO.(1944)\nNo. 115\nArgued: January 12, 1944Decided: February 14, 1944\n\n\n\n Mr. J. Louis Monarch, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Raphaell Dechter, of Los Angeles, Cal., for respondents. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 219, 220]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice JACKSON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Lane-Wells Company is a transferee and successor of the taxpayer Technicraft Engineering Corporation and as such is liable for its taxes. The Commissioner, the Board of Tax Appeals,1 and the Circuit Court of Appeals2 have held that Technicraft was a personal holding company in 1934, 1935, and 1936, and that question is no longer open.\n For the years named, Technicraft filed the usual corporation income tax returns on Treasury Form 1120. On this form the following appeared: 'Is the corporation a personal holding company within the meaning of section 351 of the Revenue Act of 1934 (or the appropriate year)? (If so, an additional return on Form 1120H must be filed.)' To this each year Technicraft answered, 'No.' In none of the years in question did it file a personal holding company return on Form 1120H. It was advised, and in good faith believed, that it was not a personal holding company within the meaning of the Act.\n The Commissioner relies upon the taxpayer's alleged default in two respects. First, the deficiency notices were given within three years of the filing of the corporate return on Form 1120 for the year 1936, but not within three years of such returns for 1934 and 1935 and not within four years (the period as to a transferee) of the 1934 return. Hence, a part of the tax is barred by the statute of limitations if the return filed is the only one required to start the statute. Second, the Commissioner has assessed and the Board has upheld as to each year a 25 per cent penalty for failure to file the personal holding company return. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 219, 221]\n\u00a0\n The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals. It held the one return sufficient to start the running of the limitation statute as to both income taxes and personal holding company taxes and held that there was no default warranting imposition of the penalty. This decision conflicted with that of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Simpson & Co. v. Commissioner, 128 F. 2d 742, and we granted certiorari, \n320 \nU.S. 724\n, 64 S.Ct. 41.\n Prior to 1934, as now, personal holding companies were liable for the regular corporation income taxes under Title I of the Revenue Acts and they, like all other corporations, were subject to additional tax upon an accumulation of profits where there was present a purpose of avoiding surtaxes upon shareholders. \n3\n The obscurity of corporate taxpayers' purposes and difficulties of proof made the latter tax something of a dead letter in practice, and a new tax was devised 'to provide for a tax which will be automatically levied upon the holding company without any necessity for proving a purpose of avoiding surtaxes.' \n4\n The new tax was included in a separate title of the Revenue Act of 1934, Title IA- Additional Income Taxes, and constituted Section 351, entitled Surtax on Personal Holding Companies. As part (c) thereof it enacted that administrative provisions, including penalties, applicable in respect of the taxes imposed by Title I should apply in respect of the tax imposed by this section. \n5\n It seems \n\n[321 \nU.S. 219, 222]\n\u00a0\n clear that this section created a new tax separate from that on income of ordinary corporations.\n Among the administrative provisions of Title I incorporated by reference in the personal holding company tax section are  54(a),6 which requires one liable for such tax to 'make such returns, and comply with such rules and regulations, as the Commissioner, with the approval of the Secretary, may from time to time prescribe,' and  62, which directs the Commissioner to prescribe and publish 'all needful rules and regulations for the enforcement of this title.' \n7\n Pursuant thereto Treasury Regulations were promulgated providing unequivocally: 'A separate return is required for the surtax imposed under section 351. Such return shall be made on Form 1120H.' \n8\n\u00a0\n\n The taxpayer has not complied with this regulation. It says, however, that its regular corporation income tax return must be taken as an equivalent to the separate return, under our decision in Germantown Trust Co. v. Commissioner, \n309 \nU.S. 304\n, 60 S.Ct. 566, both for starting the period of limitation and for avoiding the penalty. The taxpayer in the Germantown case filed a return on a wrong form. The return contained, however, 'all of the data from which a tax could be computed and assessed although it did not purport to state any amount due as tax,' and the Court said, 'this defect falls short of rendering it no return whatever.' 309 U.S. at pages 308, 310, 60 S.Ct. at pages 568, 569. There the only liability involved was for a Title I income tax, and the return \n\n[321 \nU.S. 219, 223]\n\u00a0\n was addressed to that liability, as to which the court held that it set the statute of limitations running. Here the taxpayer is under liabilities for two taxes and under an obligation to file two returns, and it says that one return addressed to but one of the liabilities answers the purpose of both.\n It is contended by the Government that the returns in the present case were insufficient to advise the Commissioner that any liability existed for the holding-company tax. The Board of Tax Appeals found that the returns filed by the corporation disclosed its gross income and deductions and its resulting net income, 43 B.T.A. 470, 471. The Circuit Court of Appeals construed this as finding that they 'showed all the facts necessary for the respondent to compute the taxes as a personal holding company obligation.' 134 F.2d at page 978. But it seems admitted that the returns did not show the facts on which liability would be predicated. Such liability was expressly denied by the return, and to obtain data on which corporations subject to the tax could be identified and assessed was the very purpose of requiring a separate return addressed to that liability. Taxpayer says that the information called for by Form 1120H is information that could have been called for by Form 1120. We assume so, but we do not see how the fact helps the taxpayer, for the Treasury was fully within the statute in requiring that information in a separate return.\n Congress has given discretion to the Commissioner to prescribe by regulation forms of returns and has made it the duty of the taxpayer to comply. It thus implements the system of selfassessment which is so largely the basis of our American scheme of income taxation. The purpose is not alone to get tax information in some form but also to get it with such uniformity, completeness, and arrangement that the physical task of handling and verifying returns may be readily accomplished. For such \n\n[321 \nU.S. 219, 224]\n\u00a0\n purposes the regulation requiring two separate returns for these taxes was a reasonable and valid one and the finding of the Board of Tax Appeals that the taxpayer is in default is correct.\n Since no personal holding company returns were filed, the statute of limitations did not commence to run,9 and the assessment of the tax was not barred. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n Since the taxpayer defaulted in filing a required return for the years 1934 and 1935, the 25 per cent penalty in the applicable acts became mandatory11 and was correctly upheld by the Board of Tax Appeals.\n For 1936 the penalty presents a different question. The statute applicable provides that it could be lifted if \n\n[321 \nU.S. 219, 225]\n\u00a0\n it were shown that such failure was 'due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect.' Revenue Act of 1936,  291, 49 Stat. 1727, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code,  291. The Board has made no finding on that subject, apparently assuming that the mandatory provisions applied to all years. The question is one of fact in the first instance for the Board's determination. Dobson v. Commissioner, \n320 \nU.S. 489\n, 64 S.Ct. 239. The Government does not object to a remand to the Board for the limited purpose of reconsidering the imposition of the 25 per cent penalty for the year 1936 only, if the respondent shall seasonably apply to the Board therefor. In all things else the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals is affirmed. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the cause remanded with directions to remand to the Tax Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 43 B.T.A. 463. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 9 Cir., 134 F.2d 977, 980. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] E.g., Revenue Act of 1932,  104, 47 Stat. 195, 26 U.S.C.A.

If the corporation subject to section 351 fails to make a return, the tax may be assessed at any time.' Regulations 86, Art. 351-8.\n The Court of Appeals thought this unauthorized. As we have indicated, we do not agree that it was beyond the delegated authority, and it appears only to declare what was even otherwise the law. \n[\nFootnote 11\n] The 1934 statute reads: 'In case of any failure to make and file a return required by this title, within the time prescribed by law or prescribed by the Commissioner in pursuance of law, 25 per centum of the tax shall be added to the tax, except that when a return is filed after such time and it is shown that the failure to file it was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect no such addition shall be made to the tax,'  291, 48 Stat. 746, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 750. A 25 per cent penalty is likewise mandatory in this case under  406 of the Revenue Act of 1935, 49 Stat. 1014, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 811. This provision excuses late filing, for reasonable cause, but not complete failure to file. \n\n\n\n\n","19":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nC.I.R. v. SCOTTISH AMER. INV. CO.(1944)\nNo. 52-to-54\nArgued: November 16, 1944Decided: December 4, 1944\n\n\n\n\n[323 \nU.S. 119, 120]\n\u00a0\n Mr. J. Louis Monarch, of Washington, D.C., for Commissioner of Internal Revenue.\n Mr. Marion N. Fisher, of New York City, for the taxpayers, Scottish American Investment Co., Ltd., and others.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n We are confronted here with another aspect of the problem of the judicial reviewability of Tax Court determinations.\n The three taxpayers involved in these cases are investment trusts organized under the laws of Great Britain, with principal offices in Edinburgh, Scotland. Each is engaged in the business of investing the funds of its security holders for the primary purpose of deriving income from investments. The Tax Court, formerly known as the Board of Tax Appeals, has held that these taxpayers \n\n[323 \nU.S. 119, 121]\n\u00a0\n had an 'office or place of business' within the United States during the four years in question and hence were entitled to be taxed as resident foreign corporations under Section 231(b) of the Revenue Acts of 1936 and 1938, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev. Code,  231(b). 47 B.T.A. 474. Such a holding would result in substantial tax savings that would be unavailable to them had they not maintained such an office in this country. The tax returns for the various years having been filed in different collectors' offices, the Commissioner appealed to two Circuit Courts of Appeal. \n1\n The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, dealing with the 1936 and 1937 tax returns, affirmed the Tax Court's decision as to those years. Helvering v. Scottish American Inv. Co., 4 Cir., 139 F.2d 419. But the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, considering the identical facts and substantially the same statutes and regulations, held that the taxpayers did not have an office or place of business within the United States during 1938 and 1939; the decision of the Tax Court as to those years was accordingly reversed. Helvering v. Scottish American Inv. Co., 3 Cir., 142 F.2d 401. The irreconcilable conflict between the two courts below led us to grant certiorari.\n The Tax Court made virtually undisputed findings of fact which need not be repeated here in detail. In brief, it was found that the three taxpayers jointly appointed a member of an American accounting firm as their assistant secretary. He was instructed to establish and maintain an office in the United States for them in order to obtain better representation of their interests in this country, large amounts of American securities being held as investments by them. By establishing this office they also sought \n\n[323 \nU.S. 119, 122]\n\u00a0\n to obtain certain tax advantages. The office was accordingly opened and two full-time assistants to the assistant secretary were employed. The American securities were kept in the custody of two banks, through which the securities were bought and sold, and assistance on certain matters was obtained from the accounting firm. This office of the taxpayers kept full records concerning all American holdings, collected and received dividends on such holdings, acted on proxies and performed other duties relative to the maintenance of these investments. The assistant secretary made periodic financial, economic and political reports to the home offices, as well as specific reports concerning particular holdings. United States tax returns were prepared in this office and local expenses were disbursed therefrom. All decisions as to the buying and selling of securities and as to investment policies, however, were made by the home offices in Edinburgh.\n Certain inferences and conclusions were then drawn from these facts by the Tax Court. It refused to consider each separate activity in this office apart from its integral relation to the entire investment trust business and was of the opinion that 'an office handling affairs to this extent must be regarded as real and substantial. It was here that a very large part of the affairs of petitioners in this country were taken care of.' The Tax Court further concluded that this office was not a sham but was a place for the necessary transaction of the American affairs of the taxpayers; 'the office was used for the regular transaction of business and not as a place where casual or incidental transactions might be, or were, effected.'\n Utilizing the provisions of Section 231(b) and of the regulations promulgated thereunder,2 the Tax Court reached the \n\n[323 \nU.S. 119, 123]\n\u00a0\n ultimate conclusion that the taxpayers maintained an office or place of business within the United States and were therefore entitled to be taxed as resident foreign corporations. There is no charge here that the Tax Court failed to follow the applicable statutes or regulations. No clear cut mistake of law is alleged. Nor are any constitutional issues involved. The sole issue revolves about the propriety of the inferences and conclusions drawn from the evidence by the Tax Court. The taxpayers claim that these determinations are supported by substantial evidence and hence were not reversible by an appellate court. The Commissioner charges that the facts demonstrate that the American office was not intended to be used for the transaction of the regular business of making investments and that it was improper as a matter of law to classify the taxpayers as resident foreign corporations.\n The answer is to be found in a proper realization of the distinctive functions of the Tax Court and the Circuit Courts of Appeal in this respect. The Tax Court has the primary function of finding the facts in tax disputes, \n\n[323 \nU.S. 119, 124]\n\u00a0\n weighing the evidence, and choosing from among conflicting factual inferences and conclusions those which it considers most reasonable. The Circuit Courts of Appeal have no power to change or add to those findings of fact or to reweigh the evidence. And when the Tax Court's factual inferences and conclusions are determinative of compliance with statutory requirements, the appellate courts are limited to a determination of whether they have any substantial basis in the evidence. The judicial eye must not in the first instance rove about searching for evidence to support other conflicting inferences and conclusions which the judges or the litigants may consider more reasonable or desirable. It must be cast directly and primarily upon the evidence in support of those made by the Tax Court. If a substantial basis is lacking the appellate court may then indulge in making its own inferences and conclusions or it may remand the case to the Tax Court for further appropriate proceedings. But if such a basis is present the process of judicial review is at an end. Helvering v. National Grocery Co., \n304 \nU.S. 282, 294\n, 58 S.Ct. 932, 938; Wilmington Trust Co. v. Helvering, \n316 \nU.S. 164, 168\n, 62 S.Ct. 984, 986; Commissioner v. Heininger, \n320 \nU.S. 467, 475\n, 64 S.Ct. 249, 254; Dobson v. Commissioner, \n320 \nU.S. 489\n, 64 S.Ct. 239.\n Our examination of the record convinces us that the factual inferences and conclusions of the Tax Court are supported by substantial evidence. While decisions as to the purchase and sale of American securities were made in the Edinburgh offices, there was abundant evidence that the American office performed vital functions in the taxpayers' investment trust business. The uncontradicted evidence showed that this office collected dividends from the vast holdings of American securities and did countless other tasks essential to the proper maintenance of a large investment portfolio. Although some matters pertaining to the American business were taken care of by others, this office performed a very substantial part \n\n[323 \nU.S. 119, 125]\n\u00a0\n of these duties and could be held to have satisfied the statutory requirements. We cannot say that it was unreasonable for the Tax Court to conclude that this office was more than a sham and that it was used for the regular transaction of business. Hence it was proper as a matter of law for the Tax Court to classify the taxpayers as resident foreign corporations under Section 231(b). We do not decide or imply that the contrary inferences and conclusions urged by the Commissioner are entirely unreasonable or completely unsupported by any probative evidence. We merely hold that such contentions are irrelevant so long as there is adequate support in the evidence for what the Tax Court has inferred. It follows that the Tax Court's conclusions in this case cannot be set aside on appellate review.\n Moreover, this case exemplifies one type of factual dispute where judicial abstinence should be pronounced. The decision as to the facts in this case, like analogous ones that preceded it,3 is of little value as precedent. The factual pattern is too decisive and too varied from case to case to warrant a great expenditure of appellate court energy on unravelling conflicting factual inferences. The skilled judgment of the Tax Court, which is the basic fact-finding and inference-making body, should thus be given wide range in such proceedings.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit is affirmed. The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit is reversed.\n One judgment affirmed; other judgment reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The taxpayers' returns for 1936 and 1937 were filed with the Collector of Internal Revenue for the District of Maryland.

The Tax Court and the two courts below did not pass upon the Commissioner's contention, renewed before us, that the taxpayers were not 'engaged in trade or business' within the meaning of this section. We likewise do not discuss that claim here since it is sufficient if it be found that the taxpayers in this case had 'an office or place of business' in this country. See B. W. Jones Trust v. Commissioner, 4 Cir., 132 F.2d 914, 917.\n Art. 231-1 of Treasury Regulations 94, promulgated under the Revenue Act of 1936, provides in part: 'Whether a foreign corporation has an 'office or place of business' within the United States depends upon the facts in a particular case. The term 'office or place of business,' however, implies a place for the regular transaction of business and does not include a place where casual or incidental transactions might be, or are, effected.'

Lane, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The limited writ of certiorari in this case was granted to review petitioners' conviction, affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, for a violation of the Filled Milk Act. \n1\n The Court was moved to allow the petition in order to examine the contentions that the accused articles of food cannot, under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, be banned from commerce when these compounds are nutritionally sufficient and not 'in imitation or semblance' of milk or any milk product within the meaning of the statute and are not sold as milk or a milk product.\n The contentions which are raised by petitioners to avoid their conviction were not dealt with in our prior decision which upheld the act's validity upon demurrer to an earlier indictment which charged its violation. United States v. Carolene Products Co., \n304 \nU.S. 144\n, 58 S.Ct. 778.2 Since these is- \n\n[323 \nU.S. 18, 20]\n\u00a0\n sues are important to those affected by the act, certiorari was granted. \n321 \nU.S. 760\n, 64 S.Ct. 845. Questions of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment, similar to those presented here, had arisen from state filled milk legislation with varying results. \n3\n Consideration by this Court of the filled milk legislation of Kansas appears in Sage Stores et al. v. Kansas, \n323 \nU.S. 32\n, 65 S.Ct. 9.\n The facts which are undisputed are fully set out in the opinions of the District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals. It is sufficient for our purposes to summarize them as follows. The corporate petitioner sells the products mentioned in the indictment which are manufactured for it by another corporation from skim milk, that is, milk from which a large percentage of the butterfat has been removed. The process of manufacture consists of taking natural whole milk, extracting the butterfat content and then adding cottonseed or cocoanut oil and fish liver oil, which latter oil contains vitamins A and D. The process includes pasteurization of the milk, evaporation, homogenization of the mixture and sterilization. The compound is sold under various trade names in cans of the same size and shape as those used for evaporated milk. \n\n[323 \nU.S. 18, 21]\n\u00a0\n The contents of the can are practically indistinguishable by the buying public from evaporated whole milk, but the cans are truthfully labeled to show the trade names and the ingredients.\n The indictment charged the petitioner corporation and the individual petitioners, its president and vice president, with violation of the statute by making interstate shipments of the compounds contrary to Section 2.4 The convictions and sentences are assailed as improper on three grounds: first, that the petitioner's compounds were not covered by the rationale of the Filled Milk Act; second, that the Act did not cover the compounds because they were not 'in imitation or semblance' of a milk product; and third, that since the compounds were wholesome food products and sold without fraud, in any sense, Congress could not constitutionally prohibit their interstate shipment.\n First. As a basis for petitioner's position that the Filled Milk Act does not cover their compounds, it is argued that the nutritional deficiencies of filled milks led to the Act's enactment so as to protect the public health. These deficiencies occurred because the extraction of the butterfat from the whole milk removed a large proportion of the fat soluble vitamins A and D. The hearings on the bill and the course of the debate make it quite clear that this vitamin deficiency was of major importance in bringing about the enactment of the act. \n5\n Petitioners then offered \n\n[323 \nU.S. 18, 22]\n\u00a0\n in the trial court to prove that since the passage of the Filled Milk Act in 1923, the technique of fortification of foods with vitamins A and D had advanced to a point where these vitamins could be restored to skim milk compounds so that the compounds were equally valuable in that respect to whole milk products and that their products had been so enriched. The offer was refused.\n Filled milk is defined in Section 1(c) of the act as any milk, 'whether or not condensed, evaporated, concentrated, powdered, dried, or desiccated, to which has been added, or which has been blended or compounded with, any fat or oil other than milk fat, so that the resulting product is in imitation or semblance of milk ..., whether or not condensed, evaporated, concentrated, powdered, dried, or desiccated.' The petitioner's compounds, it is agreed, fall within this definition. But, petitioners contend, they do not fall within its spirit, since the vitamins which cause deficiency have been restored and that therefore the act is inapplicable to the enriched compounds within that rule of statutory construction, as illustrated by Rector, etc., of Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States, \n143 \nU.S. 457\n, 12 S.Ct. 511; United States v. AEtna Explosives Co., \n256 \nU.S. 402\n, 41 S.Ct. 513, and other cases, which excludes from the coverage of a statute things or situations which are beyond the legislative intent.\n Petitioners' position as to the legislative purpose of the act was not accepted by the trial or reviewing court. We agree with those courts. While, as we have stated above, the vitamin deficiency was an efficient cause in bringing about the enactment of the Filled Milk Act, it was not the sole reason for its passage. A second reason was that the compounds lend themselves readily to substitution \n\n[323 \nU.S. 18, 23]\n\u00a0\n for or confusion with milk products. Although, so far as the record shows, filled milk compounds as enriched are equally wholesome and nutritious as milk with the same content of calories and vitamins, they are artificial or manufactured foods which are cheaper to produce than similar whole milk products. When compounded and canned, whether enriched or not, they are indistinguishable by the ordinary consumer from processed natural milk. The purchaser of these compounds does not get evaporated milk. This situation has not changed since the enactment of the act. The possibility and actuality of confusion, deception and substitution was appraised by Congress. \n6\n The prevention of such practices or dangers through control of shipments in interstate commerce is within the power of Congress. United States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U.S. at page 148, 58 S.Ct. at page 781; cf. McCray v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 27, 63\n, 24 S.Ct. 769, 779, 1 Ann.Cas. 561. The manner by which Congress carries out this power, subject to constitutional objections which are considered hereinafter in part \n\n[323 \nU.S. 18, 24]\n\u00a0\n 'Third' of this opinion, is within legislative discretion,7 even though the method chosen is prohibition of manufacture, sale or shipment. \n8\n Congress evidently determined that exclusion from commerce of filled milk compounds in the semblance of milk was an appropriate method to strike at evils which it desired to suppress. Although it now is made to appear that one evil, the nutritional deficiencies, has been overcome, the evil of confusion remains and Congress has left the statute in effect. It seems to us clear, therefore, that there is no justification for judicial interference to withdraw these assumedly nondeleterious compounds from the prohibitions of the act. It follows from the point of view of the coverage of the \n\n[323 \nU.S. 18, 25]\n\u00a0\n act that it was not erroneous to refuse to consider the evidence which petitioners offered as to the wholesomeness of the compounds.\n Second. The petitioners urge another reason why the act does not cover their compounds. This ground is that the compounds are not 'in imitation or semblance' of milk within the meaning of the act's definition of filled milk. Section 1(c), supra, p.22. Compare State v. Carolene Products Co., 346 Mo. 1049, 1060-1062, 144 S.W.2d 153. We agree that the product must be in imitation or semblance of milk to fall within the prohibition of the act.\n Petitioners rely upon the admitted fact that no ingredient is added to the skim milk, oil and vitamins to alter the appearance of the compound. Accepting the evidence that the compounds are indistinguishable from whole milk products by purchasers, it is urged that they cannot be held to be in 'imitation or semblance' of milk unless the manufacturer purposefully adds something to make the mixture simulate milk. It is said Congress adopted this language from  64(3) of the Farms and Markets Law of New York. \n9\n Prior to that time, the Court of Appeals of New York, in construing the words 'imitation or semblance' as they appeared in another section of the New York law directed at the regulation of oleomargarine, had interpreted them as denouncing trade in oleomargarine only when the manufacturer consciously and purposefully attempted to create an imitation or semblance of milk products. People v. Guiton, 210 N.Y. \n\n[323 \nU.S. 18, 26]\n\u00a0\n 1, 8, 9, 103 N.E. 773, L.R.A.1915A, 757. The adoption of these words after this interpretation and in the face of the Congressional knowledge of the New York decision and of the controversy over the effect of the use of such language,10 petitioners contend, brings into play the general rule that adoption of the wording of a statute from another legislative jurisdiction, carries with it the previous judicial interpretations of the wording. Willis v. Eastern Trust & Banking Co., \n169 \nU.S. 295, 307\n, 18 S.Ct. 347, 352; cf. James v. Appel, \n192 \nU.S. 129, 135\n, 24 S.Ct. 222, 223; Joines v. Patterson, \n274 \nU.S. 544, 549\n, 47 S.Ct. 706, 708.\n The cases just cited have established under suitable conditions the rule for which petitioners contend that the interpretation goes with the act. It is a presumption of legislative intention, however, which varies in strength with the similarity of the language, the established character of the decisions in the jurisdiction from which the language was adopted and the presence or lack of other indicia of intention. Copper Queen Mining Co. v. Arizona Board, \n206 \nU.S. 474, 479\n, 27 S.Ct. 695, 696; Whitney v. Fox, \n166 \nU.S. 637, 647\n, 17 S.Ct. 713, 717.\n Here we cannot be sure that Congress, deliberately or otherwise, adopted the wording from the New York statute. In  2 of the Federal act of August 2, 1886, 24 Stat. 209, taxing and regulating oleomargarine, somewhat similar language occurs. \n11\n That may be the source of the \n\n[323 \nU.S. 18, 27]\n\u00a0\n phrase. Furthermore the Guiton case did not interpret the section of the New York statute upon which petitioners contend the Federal act is modeled. In the Guiton case, the Court of Appeals explained the force of 'imitation and semblance' as used in the oleomargarine section,  38, N.Y.Laws 1909, ch. 9, Consol.Laws N.Y.1909, c. 1. That court relied upon the special statutory definition of oleomargarine in  30, id., as a reason for its conclusion that the words prohibited only conscious imitation, 210 N.Y. 7, 103 N.E. 775. Oleomargarine was there defined as an article 'in the semblance of butter.' The court thought that as the sale of natural oleomargarine, which might have the 'semblance' of butter was permitted, it was not intended to prohibit products which looked like butter unless the imitation came from choice. As no corresponding definition of filled milk occurs, there could be no certainty that the same result would be reached, if New York had been called upon to interpret section 64.\n Finally, as determinative of the intention of Congress to include compounds whose resemblance to milk products arises from their ingredients and not from conscious effort, we note the fact that compounds of this innocent character were specifically included by name in the list of compounds which the Congressional reports pointed out as products which were covered by the proposed act. \n12\n Petitioner's compounds were themselves so named. The addition of vitamins does not affect their physical likeness to milk products.\n Third. If the Filled Milk Act is applicable to the compounds whose shipment was the basis of the indictment in this case, as we have just concluded, petitioners assert \n\n[323 \nU.S. 18, 28]\n\u00a0\n that the act, as thus applied, violates the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. Their argument runs in this manner. Since these enriched compounds are admittedly wholesome and sold under trade names with proper labels without the commission of any fraud by petitioners on the public, Congress cannot prohibit their interstate shipment without denying to petitioners a right protected by the due process clause, the right to trade in innocent articles. They rely upon Weaver v. Palmer Bros. Co., \n270 \nU.S. 402\n, 46 S.Ct. 320, and continue their protest against the refusal of the trial court to receive the evidence as to the wholesomeness of their product.\n We do not need to consider the refusal of the trial court to receive evidence of the purity and wholesomeness of petitioner's products. Such evidence could be material only if the sole basis for Congressional action was impurity and unwholesomeness. \n13\n Under the first point of this opinion, we have determined that the avoidance of confusion furnished a reason for the enactment of the Filled Milk Act. The trial court took judicial notice, as did the District Court of the District of Columbia, United States v. Carolene Products Co., D.C., 51 F.Supp. 675, 678, 679, and as we do, of the reports of the committees of the House of Representatives and the Senate which show that other considerations than nutritional deficiencies influenced the prohibition of the shipment of filled milk in interstate commerce. These unchallenged reports as we indicated \n\n[323 \nU.S. 18, 29]\n\u00a0\n in part 'First' above, furnish an adequate basis, other than unwholesomeness, for the action of Congress. \n14\n The reports show that it was disputable as to whether wholesome filled milk should be excluded from commerce because of the danger of its confusion with the condensed or evaporated natural product or whether regulation would be sufficient. The power was in Congress to decide its own course. We need look no further. \n15\n\u00a0\n\n Weaver v. Palmer Bros., supra, is not to the contrary. This Court thought that under the facts of that record there was no reasonable basis for the legislative determination that the use of shoddy in comfortables was dangerous to the public health or that it offered opportunity for deception, 270 U.S. at pages 412 and 414, 46 S.Ct. at pages 322 and 323. Therefore the prohibition of its use violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Sterilization, inspection and labeling were deemed to be sufficient to negative the possibility of such evils. It was pointed out in the course of the opinion, 270 U.S. at page 413, 46 S.Ct. at page 322, that where the possibility of evil was not negatived, legislation prohibiting the sale of a wholesome article would not be invalidated. Powell v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, \n127 \nU.S. 678\n, 8 S.Ct. 992, 1257. In dealing with the evils of filled milk, Congress reached the conclusion that labeling was not an adequate remedy for deception. On the point of the constitutionality in relation to due process of the prohibition of trade in articles which are not in themselves dangerous but which make other evils more difficult \n\n[323 \nU.S. 18, 30]\n\u00a0\n to control, such as confusion in the filled milk legislation, the Powell case is authority for the validity of Congressional action in the Filled Milk Act. It involved a sale of an article assumed to be just as good as butter but which was prohibited because of its ingredients. In the Powell case, this Court said:\n'The defendant then offered to prove by Prof. Hugo Blanck that he saw manufactured the article sold to the prosecuting witness; that it was made from pure animal fats; that the process of manufacture was clean and wholesome, the article containing the same elements as dairy butter, ... that the oleaginous substances in the manufactured article were substantially identical with those produced from milk or cream; and that the article sold to the prosecuting witness was a wholesome and nutritious article of food, in all respects as wholesome as butter produced from pure, unadulterated milk, or cream from unadulterated milk.' (At pages 681, 682 of 127 U.S., at page 994 of 8 S.Ct..)\n\n'It will be observed that the offer in the court below was to show by proof that the particular articles the defendant sold and those in his possession for sale, in violation of the statute, were, in fact, wholesome or nutritious articles of food. It is entirely consistent with that offer that many, indeed, that most kinds of oleomargarine butter in the market contain ingredients that are or may become injurious to health. The court cannot say, from anything of which it may take judicial cognizance, that such is not the fact. ...\n\n'Whether the manufacture of oleomargarine, or imitation butter, of the kind described in the statute, is or may be conducted in such a way, or with such skill and secrecy, as to baffle ordinary inspection, or whether it involves such danger to the public health as to require, for the protection of the people, the entire suppression of the business rather than its regulation in such manner as to permit the manufacture and sale of articles of that class \n\n[323 \nU.S. 18, 31]\n\u00a0\n that do not contain noxious ingredients, are questions of fact and of public policy which belong to the legislative department to determine. And as it does not appear upon the face of the statute, or from any facts of which the court must take judicial cognizance, that it infringes rights secured by the fundamental law, the legislative determination of those questions is conclusive upon the courts.' (At pages 684, 685 of 127 U.S., at page 995 of 8 S.Ct.).\n\n In Hebe Co. v. Shaw, \n248 \nU.S. 297\n, 39 S.Ct. 125, this Court in 1919 upheld the validity of an Ohio statute which prohibited the sale of condensed milk made otherwise than from whole milk against an attack under the Fourteenth Amendment. It was assumed that the compound was wholesome and it was properly labeled. The act was sustained, however, as a proper exercise of legislative power to protect the public against fraudulent substitution, at pages 302, 303 of 248 U.S., at page 126, 39 S. Ct.. Purity Extract & Tonic Co. v. Lynch, \n226 \nU.S. 192, 204\n, 33 S.Ct. 44, 47.\n In the action of Congress on filled milk there is no prohibition of the shipment of an article of commerce merely because it competes with another such article which it resembles. Such would be the prohibition of the shipment of cotton or silk textiles to protect rayon or nylon or of anthracite to aid the consumption of bituminous coal or of cottonseed oil to aid the soybean industry. Here a milk product, skimmed milk, from which a valuable element-butterfat-has been removed is artificially enriched with cheaper fats and vitamins so that it is indistinguishable in the eyes of the average purchaser from whole milk products. The result is that the compound is confused with and passed off as the whole milk product in spite of proper labeling.\n When Congress exercises a delegated power such as that over interstate commerce, the methods which it employs to carry out its purposes are beyond attack without a clear and convincing showing that there is no rational basis for \n\n[323 \nU.S. 18, 32]\n\u00a0\n the legislation; that it is an arbitrary fiat. \n16\n This is not shown here. The judgment is\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice BLACK and Mr. Justice DOUGLAS concur in the result. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of March 4, 1923, 42 Stat. 1486, 21 U.S.C.A.  61-63; United States v.

COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA(1944)\nNo. 134\nArgued: January 6, 1944Decided: January 31, 1944\n\n\n\n Appeals from the Supreme Court of Appeals of the State of virginia.\n Mr. John S. Battle, of Charlottesville, Va., for appellants Carter and another.\n Mr. Warren E. Miller, of Washington, D.C., for appellants Dickerson and others.\n Mr. Abram P. Staples, of Richmond, Va., for appellee. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 131, 132]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellants were convicted of violations of the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Act1 and certain Regulations issued pursuant to it, concerning the transportation of intoxicating liquor through the Commonwealth. Their contention that the pertinent provisions of the Act and Regulations2 violated the Commerce Clause, Article I, Section 8(3), of the Federal Constitution was rejected by Virginia's highest court, the Supreme Court of Appeals. 181 Va. 306, 24 S.E.2d 569; 181 Va. 313, 24 S.E. 2d 550. The cases are here on appeals pursuant to Section 237(a) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  344(a), 28 U.S.C.A.  344(a).\n The Act in question contains a comprehensive scheme for the control of trade in alcoholic beverages within the territory of Virginia. By the statute an Alcoholic Beverage Control Board is established and authorized to adopt such regulations 'as it may deem necessary' to confine the transportation of liquor 'to legitimate purposes.' \n3\n The A.B.C. Board promulgated regulations applicable to \n\n[321 \nU.S. 131, 133]\n\u00a0\n transportation through Virginia. \n4\n The requirements here in issue are these : (1) The vehicle must use the most direct route and carry a bill of lading showing the route it will travel; (2) The carrier must post a bond in the penal sum of $1,000 conditioned on lawful transportation; and (3) \n\n[321 \nU.S. 131, 134]\n\u00a0\n The bill of lading must show the name of the true consignee, and that consignee must have a legal right to receive the beverages at the stated destination.\n Both cases reached the Virginia Supreme Court on stipulated facts. In No. 134, it was agreed that Carter and Macemore received 168 gallons of whiskey from a wholesaler in Maryland for transportation to an individual consignee in Thomasville, North Carolina. The appellants were apprehended in Rappahanock County, Virginia, while carrying the whiskey by truck. The appellants themselves did not post a bond, and a bond which was posted by the registered owner of the truck was cancelled because he was reputed to be a bootlegger. Their bill of lading did not show the route to be traversed through Virginia, and the intended delivery to the consignee was forbidden by the laws of North Carolina.\n The facts stipulated in No. 198 are similar. Dickerson was arrested in Prince William County, Virginia, while driving a truck carrying more than one gallon of alcoholic beverages. He was traveling by the most direct route from Maryland to his employer-consignee, Page, in North Carolina. Page had posted the required bond, but the bill of lading did not show the route to be traveled, and Page was forbidden by the laws of North Carolina to accept delivery there.\n All the individuals involved in the two cases were residents of North Carolina.\n The appellants argue, first, that the Twenty-first Amendment gives Virginia no power to prohibit absolutely the shipment of liquor from Maryland to North Carolina through Virginia; second, that its power to regulate such shipments is limited by the Commerce Clause to regulations reasonably necessary to enforce its local liquor laws and not unduly burdensome on interstate commerce; third, that Virginia has no authority to penalize prospective violations of the criminal laws of North Carolina or \n\n[321 \nU.S. 131, 135]\n\u00a0\n the United States. It will be observed that the intoxicating liquors in question are intended for continuous shipment through Virginia, so that here, as in the Duckworth case,5 a different question arises from those considered under the Twenty-first Amendment,6 where transportation or importation into a state for delivery or use therein was prohibited. But we may put aside the first and third contentions, for we are satisfied that Virginia may, notwithstanding the Commerce Clause and independently of the Twenty-first Amendment, in order to protect herself from illicit liquor traffic within her borders, subject the shipment of liquor through Virginia to the regulations here in question.\n We have recognized that the several states in the absence of Federal legislation may require regulatory licenses for through shipments of liquor in order to guard against violations of their own laws. Duckworth v. Arkansas, \n314 \nU.S. 390\n, 62 S.Ct. 311, 138 A.L.R. 1144. Thus this Court has extended to this very field its recognition that regulation of interstate commerce by local authority in the absence of Congressional action is admissible to protect the state from injuries arising from that commerce. People of State of California v. Thompson, \n313 \nU.S. 109, 113\n, 115 S., 61 S.Ct. 930, 932, 933, and cases cited; Clark v. Paul Gray, Inc., \n306 \nU.S. 583, 591\n, 59 S.Ct. 744, 749; Morf v. Bingaman, \n298 \nU.S. 407, 410\n, 56 S.Ct. 756, 757; Clyde Mallory Lines v. Alabama, \n296 \nU.S. 261, 267\n, 56 S.Ct. 194, 196. The commerce power of Congress is not invaded by such police regulations as Virginia has here enforced.\n The state of transit may compel the carrier to furnish information necessary for checking the shipment against unlawful diversion, and the requirement that the truck follow a direct, stated route is within the rule of Duck- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 131, 136]\n\u00a0\n worth v. Arkansas, supra. Similarly, a state may require a reasonable bond of one who wishes to engage in interstate trade of a kind dangerous to well-recognized local interests. People of State of California v. Thompson, \n313 \nU.S. 109\n, 61 S.Ct. 930\n\n\n The state court did not pass upon the legality under state or Federal law of the cancellation of the bond in No. 134, since it concluded that only the bondsman, who was not a party to the proceeding, had standing to object under applicable state procedure. As no procedural due process point is raised, we accept its conclusion without further examination. United Gas Co. v. Texas, \n303 \nU.S. 123, 139\n, 625 S., 58 S.Ct. 483, 491. It is urged, however, that the Board's power to cancel a bond because of doubts as to the trust-worthiness of the bondsman amounts to an undue burden on interstate commerce.\n The bond is to be furnished, according to Section 42 of the Regulations, by the person transporting the liquor. Thus the requirement that the bond be signed by a responsible person appears to raise the same type of question as the requirement that delivery be lawful at the place of consignment, and the two may be considered together. Of the latter rule, the Virginia court said,\n'We cannot escape the conclusion that one who deliberately and intentionally violates the Federal Constitution and the law of his resident State, in the unlawful transportation of liquor would hardly hesitate to violate the laws of this State while passing through if he thought he might profit thereby. We cannot shut our eyes to the possibilities of such a situation and the necessity of prevention.' 181 Va. 313, 24 S.E.2d 550, 556.\n\n We are therefore dealing with a case in which Virginia is attempting no more than the enforcement of her own laws; she is not seeking to inflict punishment for the violation of the laws of North Carolina. Whether or not she is entitled thus to enforce her laws must be judged in the \n\n[321 \nU.S. 131, 137]\n\u00a0\n light of our long-standing recognition of the exceptional problems involved in successfully regulating trade in intoxicating liquors. James Clark Distilling Co. v. Western Maryland R. Co., \n242 \nU.S. 311, 332\n, 37 S. Ct. 180, 187, L.R.A. 1917B, 1218, Ann.Cas.1917B, 845; Duckworth v. Arkansas, supra, 314 U.S. at page 396, 62 S.Ct. at page 314, 138 A.L.R. 1144. We do not consider the appellee's suggestion that complete exclusion (and hence these partial restraints) of motor carriers from the through liquor traffic and a limitation of through transit to rail carriers would be consonant with the Commerce Clause. Cf. Ziffrin, Inc., v. Reeves, \n308 \nU.S. 132, 140\n, 60 S.Ct. 163, 167. Whatever may be the effect of the Twenty-first Amendment, this record presents no problem that may not be resolved under the Commerce Clause alone. That Clause remains in the Constitution as a grant of power to Congress to control commerce and as a diminution pro tanto of absolute state sovereignty over the same subject matter. The Twenty-first Amendment limits that grant of power as to intoxicating liquor by prohibiting 'transportation or importation into any State, Territory, or possession of the United States for delivery or use therein ... in violation of the laws thereof.' By interpretation of this Court the Amendment has been held to relieve the states of the limitations of the Commerce Clause on their powers over such transportation or importation. \n7\n It has also been held that shipment through a state is not transportation or importation into the state within the meaning of the Amendment. Collins v. Yosemite Park Co ., \n304 \nU.S. 518, 535\n, 538 S., 58 S.Ct. 1009, 1017, 1018. But in the present case we need not consider the power of Virginia under the Twenty-first Amendment to regulate through shipments. It is enough that Virginia could conclude, in the absence of contrary Federal legislation, that she could not safely permit the transportation \n\n[321 \nU.S. 131, 138]\n\u00a0\n of liquor through her territory by those who concededly mean to break Federal laws8 and the laws of a neighboring state. By her ruling she has imposed no substantial clog on whatever cognate rights her sister states may have to determine their own policies regarding intoxicating liquors and to receive alcoholic beverages in interstate commerce, if they so desire.\n For these reasons the judgment is affirmed.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice JACKSON concurs in the result only, for the reasons stated in his separate opinion in Duckworth v. Arkansas, \n314 \nU.S. 390\n, 62 S.Ct. 311, 138 A.L.R. 1144.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK, concurring.\n I am not sure that state statutes regulating intoxicating liquor should ever be invalidated by this Court under the Commerce Clause except where they conflict with valid federal statutes. Cf. dissenting opinions, McCarroll v. Dixie Greyhound Lines, Inc., \n309 \nU.S. 176, 183\n, 60 S.Ct. 504, 507; Gwin, White & Prince, Inc. v. Henneford, \n305 \nU.S. 434, 442\n, 59 S.Ct. 325, 329; Adams Manufacturing Co. v. Storen, \n304 \nU.S. 307, 316\n, 58 S.Ct. 913, 918, 117 A.L.R. 429. The Twenty-first Amendment has placed liquor in a category different from that of other articles of commerce. Though the precise amount of power it has left in Congress to regulate liquor under the Commerce Clause has not been marked out by decisions, this much is settled: local, not national, regulation of the liquor traffic is now the general Constitutional policy. Ziffrin, Inc. v. Reeves, \n308 \nU.S. 132\n, 60 S.Ct. 163; Indianapolis Brewing Co. v. Liquor Control Commission, \n305 \nU.S. 391\n, 59 S. Ct. 254; State Board of Equalization of California v. Young's Market Co., \n299 \nU.S. 59\n, 57 S.Ct. 77.\n Whatever limited force the Commerce Clause may retain with regard to the liquor traffic, it should not require the invalidation of the Virginia statutes here involved, \n\n[321 \nU.S. 131, 139]\n\u00a0\n which do not conflict with any Act of Congress, and which are designed to enforce local liquor policies. Virginia seems to think that, unless adequate precautionary regulations are devised and enforced, liquor shipments ostensibly being transported through her territory to a neighboring state could be diverted for bootleg purposes contrary to her laws. Such precautionary regulations must come from either Virginia or the federal government. The legislature of Virginia has provided them; the Congress has not. This Court could invalidate the Virginia regulations, but only the Congress could devise and substitute effective federal regulations to take their place. I therefore agree with the Court 'that Virginia could conclude, in the absence of contrary Federal legislation, that she could not safely permit the transportation of liquor through her territory by those who concededly mean to break Federal laws and the laws of a neighboring state.'\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER, concurring.\n\n 1. \nAfter as thorough a consideration as it ever gave to a problem, this Court, in a long series of cases beginning with Bowman v. Chicago, etc., Railway Co., \n125 \nU.S. 465\n, 8 S.Ct. 689, 1062, decided that intoxicating liquor is a legitimate subject of commerce, as much so as cabbages and candlesticks, and as such within the protection of the Commerce Clause. In the absence of regulation by Congress, the movement of intoxicants in interstate commerce like that of all other merchantable goods was 'free from all state control.' James Clark Distilling Co. v. Western Md. Ry. Co., \n242 \nU.S. 311, 323\n, 327 S., 37 S.Ct. 180, 184, 185, 186, L.R.A. 1917B, 1218, Ann.Cas.1917B, 845, citing Leisy v. Hardin, \n135 \nU.S. 100\n, 10 S.Ct. 681; In re Rahrer, \n140 \nU.S. 545\n, 11 S.Ct. 865; Vance v. W. A. Vandercook Company (No. 1), \n170 \nU.S. 438\n, 18 S.Ct. 674; Rhodes v. Iowa, \n170 \nU.S. 412\n, 18 S.Ct. 664. All of these decisions are still on the books. And so, before the Twenty-first Amendment displaced the Eighteenth, Mr. Justice Holmes was able to say: 'I cannot for a moment believe that apart from the Eight- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 131, 140]\n\u00a0\n eenth Amendment special constitutional principles exist against strong drink. The fathers of the Constitution so far as I know approved it.' Knickerbocker Ice Co. v. Stewart, \n253 \nU.S. 149, 169\n, 40 S.Ct. 438, 443, 11 A.L.R. 1145.\n\n 2. \nIf then the Commerce Clause be the measure of State action, such a requirement as the posting of a bond for transportation of goods from without Virginia would be beyond Virginia's powers even if the shipment of the liquor were for delivery into Virginia. Heyman v. Southern Railway Co., \n203 \nU.S. 270\n, 27 S.Ct. 104, 7 Ann.Cas. 1130; Adams Express Co. v. Kentucky, \n206 \nU.S. 129\n, 27 S.Ct. 606. Cases like People of State of California v. Thompson, \n313 \nU.S. 109\n, 61 S.Ct. 930, which recognize the power of States to regulate local activities by taxation or otherwise related even though they be to interstate commerce, but none of which was concerned with restricting the through-passage of goods, liquor or any other, afford no basis for suggesting that a State has power to license the movement of goods in interstate commerce on oppressive or prohibitive terms. A fortiori, the Commerce Clause would prohibit and not permit such legislation as is before us in the case of liquor arriving in Virginia for ultimate delivery without. Heyman v. Hays, \n236 \nU.S. 178\n, 35 S.Ct. 403.\n\n 3. \nIn the light of the uniform current of decisions under the Commerce Clause prior to the Twenty-first Amendment, the Virginia legislation could not survive as to shipments bound beyond its borders. If the legislation is valid, as I believe it to be, it must be solely because the range of State control over liquor has been extended by the Twenty- first Amendment beyond the permissive bounds of the Commerce Clause.\n\n 4. \nThe legislation is sustainable under the Twenty-first Amendment on one of two considerations. It is a notorious fact that State prohibition laws were to no small measure evaded by illicit diversion of liquor claimed to be transported through a State. Since we are dealing with \n\n[321 \nU.S. 131, 141]\n\u00a0\n a constitutional amendment that should be broadly and colloquially interpreted, liquor that enters a State in the manner in which the liquor here came into Virginia may, without undue liberty with the English language, be deemed to be for 'delivery' there even though it is consigned for another State. The Twenty-first Amendment prohibits the 'transportation or importation into any State ... of intoxicating liquors, in violation of the laws thereof', not when the liquor is for delivery and use but for 'delivery or use therein.' In other words, liquor need not be intended for consumption in a State to be deemed to be imported into the State and therefore subject to control by that State. The decision in Collins v. Yosemite Park Co., \n304 \nU.S. 518\n, 58 S.Ct. 1009, 1010, has nothing whatever to do with the relation of the Commerce Clause to the power given the States by the Twenty-first Amendment to control the liquor traffic. That was a suit 'to restrain enforcement of the (California) Alcoholic Beverage Control Act within Yosemite Park, on the theory that the Park is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States.' All that was there decided, after extended consideration of the relation of the United States to the Yosemite Park, was that the United States did exercise exclusive jurisdiction over the land ceded by California to the Federal Government for park purposes, and that of course when 'exclusive jurisdiction is in the United States, without power in the State to regulate alcoholic beverages, the XXI Amendment is not applicable.' 304 U.S. at page 538, 58 S.Ct. at page 1018. State control must yield to superior federal power, but State control by one State, since the Twenty-first Amendment, need not yield to State control by another State.\n\n 5. \nIn the alternative, since Virginia has power to prohibit the importation of liquor within that Commonwealth, it may effectuate that purpose by measures \n\n[321 \nU.S. 131, 142]\n\u00a0\n deemed by it necessary to prevent evasion of its policy by pretended through-shipments. In a word, having the power to prohibit liquor from coming into a State, a State may take measures against frustration of that power by resort to the claim that liquor passing through a State enjoys the protection of the Commerce Clause. If a State may take these protective measures, as surely it may, who is to decide what measures are necessary for its protection? If a State may ask for the posting of a $1, 000 bond, may she not require a $10,000 bond? If a State should urge that its experience shows that any regulatory system is ineffective because illicit diversion is too resourceful for control by mere regulation and requires prohibition, who is to say, in view of the history embedded in the Twenty-first Amendment, that a State may not fairly act on such a judgment? Are not these peculiarly political, that is legislative, questions which were not meant by the Twenty-first Amendment to continue to be the fruitful apple of judicial discord, as they were before the Twenty-first Amendment?\n\n 6. \nIt is now suggested that a State must keep within 'the limits of reasonable necessity' and that this Court must judge whether or not Virginia has adopted 'regulations reasonably necessary to enforce its local liquor laws'. Such canons of adjudication open wide the door of conflict and confusion which have in the past characterized the liquor controversies in this Court and in no small measure formed part of the unedifying history which led first to the Eighteenth and then to the Twenty-first Amendment.\n\n 7. \nLess than six years ago this Court rejected the impossible task of deciding, instead of leaving it for legislatures to decide, what constitutes a 'reasonable regulation' of the liquor traffic. The issue was fairly presented in Ma- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 131, 143]\n\u00a0\n honey v. Triner Corp., \n304 \nU.S. 401\n, 58 S.Ct. 952. And this was the holding:\n'We are asked to limit the powers conferred by the amendment so that only those importations may be forbidden which, in the opinion of the Court, violate a reasonable regulation of the liquor traffic. To do so would, as stated in the Young's Market Case, (\n299 \nU.S. 59\n) page 62, 57 S. Ct. 77, page 78, 'involve not a construction of the amendment, but a rewriting of it.\" 304 U.S. at page 404, 58 S.Ct. at page 953.\n\n Therefore if a State, in aid of its powers of prohibition, may regulate, without let or hindrance by courts regarding the 'reasonableness' of a regulation it may do so whether the liquor is openly consigned for consumption within it or intended for consumption there although, by subterfuge too difficult to check, nominally destined elsewhere.\n\n 8. \nFuller consideration has therefore convinced me that the power exercised by the State in Duckworth v. Arkansas, \n314 \nU.S. 390\n, 62 S.Ct. 311, 138 A.L.R. 1144, as well as in this case must rest on the authority given to the States by the Twenty-first Amendment. And since Virginia derives the power to legislate as she did from the Twenty-first Amendment, the Commerce Clause does not come into play. So this Court has twice ruled. 'Since the Twenty-first Amendment, ... as held in the Young Case (\n299 \nU.S. 59\n, 57 S.Ct. 77), the right of a state to prohibit or regulate the importation of intoxicating liquor is not limited by the commerce clause.'

Putnam, of Minneapolis, Minn., for intervener appellee Glendenning Motorways, Inc.\n\n Mr. Justice JACKSON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellants are five railroads operating in Minnesota and North Dakota. They claim to be aggrieved by an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission granting operating authority to a motor carrier of goods in that territory. Appellee Cornelius Styer, doing business as Northern Transportation Company, made application for two classes of common-carrier rights. As to certain routes he sought 'grandfather rights' under Section 206(a) of Part II of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.  306(a), 49 U. S.C.A.  306(a). As to certain others, he sought authority under sections 206(a) and 207(a) of the Act, 49 U.S.C.  306(a), 307(a), 49 U.S.C.A.  306(a), 307(a), by showing that the proposed service 'is or will be required by the present or future public convenience and necessity.' After due hearings both classes of rights were granted. Styer later transferred them to the appellee Glendenning Motorways, Inc.\n The railroads brought an action in the District Court for Minnesota against the Commission and the carriers to annul the Commission's certificate, pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  41(28), 28 U.S.C.A.  41(28). The cause came on before a court of three judges who dismissed the complaint on the merits. It was brought here by direct appeal.\n It is contended that there is no evidence to support the findings on which the Commission granted operating rights. The court below examined the evidence as to each challenged finding and found each 'not unsupported by \n\n[322 \nU.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n evidence.' It declined, quite properly, to substitute inferences of its own for those drawn by the Commission from testimony and declined to weigh anew conflicts in it. This was no error, and we affirm the findings. Gregg Cartage and Storage Co. v. United States, \n316 \nU.S. 74\n, 62 S.Ct. 932; Rochester Telephone Corp. v. United States, \n307 \nU.S. 125\n, 59 S. Ct. 754\n\n\n The question of law in the case is whether the Commission on its finding need for such service had power to authorize service of intermediate points not asked for by the applicant. The applicant has accepted and is defending the grant, but the competing rail carriers complain of it.\n In the grandfather case Styer stated that he did not claim and was not applying for authority to carry goods in interstate commerce from any Minnesota point to any Minnesota point. But he had begun operations only two months prior to the 'grandfather' date. The Commission found that he had held out service to such intermediate points and that there was public need for it.\n In the convenience and necessity case, before hearing Styer filed an amendment to his application which withdrew request for authority as to 'all service in interstate commerce between points in Minnesota.' The Commission, however, found that he had served such intermediate points on the route as shippers had requested it, that such service was fulfilling a public need, and was required by the public convenience and necessity.\n It is said that these actions withdrew the intermediate points from issue and threw the protesting parties off their guard and that they did not have opportunity for adequate hearing on the matters ultimately decided. However, after receiving the report of Division 5 recommending granting, as was done, the railroads filed a petition for reconsideration. It is not in evidence. Whether surprise was claimed and evidence was indicated that could \n\n[322 \nU.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n be added on rehearing, we do not know. The Court endeavors to protect the right of parties to fair hearings, but it will not presume that their rights have been substantially denied when they do not embrace the opportunity to prove their grievance in the court below.\n It is clear that the Commission on the facts found had power to include in the authorization provision for service greater than the carrier had asked. Section 208(a) of the Act provides that in any certificate issued under either Section 206 or Section 207 'there shall, at the time of issuance and from time to time thereafter, be attached to the exercise of the privileges granted by the certificate such reasonable terms, conditions, and limitations as the public convenience and necessity may from time to time require, including terms, conditions, and limitations as to the extension of the route or routes of the carrier.' 49 U.S.C.  308(a), 49 U.S.C.A.  308(a).\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","23":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCITY OF YONKERS v.

Sec. 1(18), ( 19), (20), 49 U.S.C.  1(18), (19), (20), 49 U.S.C.A.  1(18-20), 24 Stat. 379, 41 Stat. 477, 478. But the Act also provides that that authority of the Commission 'shall not extend' to the abandonment 'of street, suburban, or interurban electric railways, which are not operated as a part or parts of a general steam railroad system of transportation.' Sec. 1(22), 49 U.S. C.  1(22), 49 U.S.C.A.  1(22).\n The New York Central Railroad Co. filed an application with the Commission for a certificate under  1(18-20) of the Act authorizing it to abandon an electric branch line extending 3.1 miles from Van Cortlandt Park Junction, New York City, to Getty Square, Yonkers, New York. This line was constructed in 1888 by a predecessor company for the purpose of developing suburban business between Yonkers and New York City. The line was electrified in 1926 with the hope that the suburban business would increase. It is now a physical part of the New York Central's Putnam Division with which it connects at Van Cortlandt Park Junction. The Putnam Division in turn connects with the Hudson Division which is part of the main line of the New York Central from New York City to Chicago. The Hudson Division follows the east bank of the Hudson River through Yonkers to Albany. The Putnam Division extends north from Sedgwick Avenue and West 161st Street, New York City, through Yonkers to Brewster, New York. The Putnam Division lies east of, and is roughly parallel with, the Hudson Division. In the City of Yonkers the two divisions are about a mile apart. The electric line in question is between the Hudson and Putnam Divisions. Getty Square, its terminal in Yonkers, is .3 mile east of the Yonkers station on the Hudson Division. The New York Central system is for the most part operated by steam. Some portions of its lines are electrified, including the Hudson Division be- \n\n[320 \nU.S. 685, 687]\n\u00a0\n tween New York City and Harmon, New York, and Harlem Division so far as White Plains, New York, the Putnam Division between Sedgwick Avenue and Van Cortlandt Park Junction, and the Yonkers line in question. With the exception noted, no part of the Putnam Division is electrified, its trains being operated by steam.\n This Yonkers electric branch handles no freight, mail, express, or milk traffic and no industries are dependent on it for such service. Its traffic is exclusively passenger traffic, principally commuter travel between Getty Square and three other stations in Yonkers and Grand Central Station in New York City. The trains serving stations on this Yonkers electric branch do not go through to Grand Central Station on account of the congested condition of the main-line tracks funnelling into Grand Central Station. Accordingly, these trains run only from Getty Square to Van Cortlandt Park Junction and thence over the main line of the Putnam Division to the terminal at Sedgwick Avenue. Passengers from Yonkers to Grand Central Station must transfer to Hudson Division trains at either High Bridge or University Heights stations which are north of the Sedgwick Avenue Station. Tariffs of the New York Central provide for one-way, monthly-commutation, and other tickets usable between the stations in Yonkers and Grand Central Station. Time tables of the New York Central disclose the service on this electric branch. And its operating results are reflected in the accounts of the New York Central.\n The trains running on this electric branch are composed of two, three or four cars. The trains are hauled not by a locomotive but by so-called multiple unit cars. The structure of the line is such that locomotives cannot be used on it. The trains on this electric branch proceed only to Getty Square, Yonkers, and not beyond.\n The Commission though adverting to a number of the facts which we have mentioned did not address itself to \n\n[320 \nU.S. 685, 688]\n\u00a0\n the question whether this electric branch line was or was not 'operated as a part or parts of a general steam railroad system of transportation' within the meaning of  1(22). The Commission did not undertake to review the evidence relevant to that issue. It made no findings respecting it. It authorized the abandonment on the grounds that continued operation would impose 'an undue and unnecessary burden' upon the New York Central and upon interstate commerce. \n1\n The Commission says that the question of its jurisdiction under  1(22) was neither presented in limine nor urged in the briefs, in the exceptions to the examiner's report, or in the oral arguments. It was, however, presented in petitions for reconsideration which the Commission denied without opinion.\n This suit to enjoin the order of the Commission, brought before a District Court of three judges, 38 Stat. 219, 220, 28 U.S.C.  47, 28 U.S. C.A.  47, was initiated by the Public Service Commission of New York, the City of Yonkers, and a committee of Yonkers commuters. \n2\n The jurisdiction of the Commission was challenged before the District Court. And that objection which was overruled there (50 F.Supp. 497) has been renewed on the appeal which brings the case here. 28 U.S.C.  47a, 345, 28 U.S.C.A .  47a, 345.\n The District Court in sustaining the order of the Commission, reviewed the evidence and concluded that the operation of this electric branch was 'intertwined with the operation of the system as a whole.' It relied especially on the fact that the bulk of the traffic on this electric branch transfers at High Bridge or University Heights \n\n[320 \nU.S. 685, 689]\n\u00a0\n to the Hudson Division and that those transfers made it necessary for the New York Central to provide seats on the hudson Division trains for all the transferred Yonkers passengers for the remaining short run to Grand Central Station.\n The Commission itself has noted that in the 'construction of these exclusion cluases great difficulty has been experienced, particularly in determining the roads properly classifiable as interurban electric railways.' Annual Report (1928), p. 80. That difficulty is apparent here by the division of opinion which exists in the Court whether this Yonkers branch is an 'interurban electric' railway which is 'operated as a part' of the New York Central system. 3  1(22). As stated by Mr. Justice Brandeis in United States v. Idaho, \n298 \nU.S. 105, 109\n, 56 S.Ct. 690, 692, the determination of what is included within the exemption of  1(22) involves a 'mixed question of fact and law.' Congress has not left that question exclusively to administrative determination; it has given the courts the final say. Id., 298 U.S. at page 109, 56 S.Ct. at page 692. It is settled that the aid of the Commission need not be sought before the jurisdiction of a court is invoked to enjoin violations of the provisions in question. Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Gulf, C. & S.F. Ry. Co., \n270 \nU.S. 266\n, 46 S.Ct. 263. And the fact that the Commission fails to make a finding on this jurisdictional question obviously does not preclude the reviewing court from making that determination initially. But we deem it essential in cases involving a review of orders of the Commission for the courts to decline to make that determination without the basic jurisdictional findings first having been made by the Commission. \n\n[320 \nU.S. 685, 690]\n\u00a0\n The power of the Commission to control the abandonment of intrastate branches of interstate carriers stems from the power of Congress to protect interstate commerce from undue burdens or discriminations. Colorado v. United States, \n271 \nU.S. 153\n, 46 S.Ct. 452; Transit Commission v. United States, \n284 \nU.S. 360\n, 52 S.Ct. 157; Purcell v. United States, \n315 \nU.S. 381\n, 62 S.Ct. 709. And see United States v. Hubbard, \n266 \nU.S. 474\n, 45 S.Ct. 160, for an application of the doctrine of the Shreveport case (Houston, E. & W. T.R. Co. v. United States, \n234 \nU.S. 342\n, 34 S.Ct. 833) to the intrastate rates of interurban electric railroads. The exemptions contained in  1(22) do not necessarily reflect the lack of constitutional power to deal with the excepted phases of railroad enterprise. Underlying  1(22) is a Congressional policy of reserving exclusively to the states control over that group of essentially local activities. See H.Rep. No. 456, 66th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 18. We recently stated that the extension of federal control into these traditional local domains is a 'delicate exercise of legislative policy in achieving a wise accommodation between the needs of central control and the lively maintenance of local institutions.' Palmer v. Massachusetts, \n308 \nU.S. 79, 84\n, 60 S.Ct. 34, 36. In the application of the doctrine of the Shreveport case, this Court has required the Commission to show meticulous respect for the interests of the States. It has insisted on a 'suitable regard to the principle that, whenever the federal power is exerted within what would otherwise be the domain of state power, the justification of the exercise of the federal power must clearly appear.' Florida v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 194, 211\n, 212 S., 51 S.Ct. 119, 124. In that case this Court set aside an intrastate rate order of the Commission because of the 'lack of the basic or essential findings required to support the Commission's order.' Id., 282 U.S. at page 215, 51 S.Ct. at page 125. The principle of the Florida case is applicable here. The question is not merely one of elaborating the grounds of decision and bringing into focus what is vague and obscure. See United States \n\n[320 \nU.S. 685, 691]\n\u00a0\n v. Chicago, M. St. P. & P.R. Co., \n294 \nU.S. 499\n, 55 S.Ct. 462. Cf. Securities & Exchange Commission v. Chenery Corp., \n318 \nU.S. 80\n, 63 S.Ct. 454. Here as in the Florida case the problem is whether the courts should supply the requisite jurisdictional findings which the Commission did not make and to which it even failed to make any reference. \n 4\n\u00a0\n\n Congress has withheld from the Commission any power to authorize abandonment of certain types of railroad lines. It is hardly enough to say that the Commission's orders may be set aside by the courts where the Commission exceeds its authority. The Commission has a special competence to deal with the transportation problems which are reflected in these questions. The Congress has entrusted to the Commission the initial responsibility for determining through application of the statutory standards the appropriate line between the federal and state domains. Proper regard for the rightful concern of local interests in the management of local transportation facilities makes desirable the requirement that federal power be exercised only where the statutory authority affirmatively appears. The sacrifice of these legitimate local interests may be as readily achieved through the Commission's oversight or neglect (Illinois Commerce Commission v. Thomson, \n318 \nU.S. 675\n, 63 S.Ct. 834) as by improper findings. The insistence that the Commission make these jurisdictional \n\n[320 \nU.S. 685, 692]\n\u00a0\n findings before it undertakes to act not only gives added assurance that the local interests for which Congress expressed its solicitude will be safe-guarded. It also gives to the reviewing courts the assistance of an expert judgment on a knotty phase of a technical subject.\n We are asked to presume that the Commission, knowing the limit of its authority, considered this jurisdictional question and decided to act because of its conviction that this branch line was not exempt by reason of  1(22). But that is to deal too cavalierly with the Congressional mandate and with the local interests which are pressing for recognition. Where a federal agency is authorized to invoke an overriding federal power except in certain prescribed situations and then to leave the problem to traditional state control, the existence of federal authority to act should appear affirmatively and not rest on inference alone.\n This is not to insist on formalities and to burden the administrative process with ritualistic requirements. It entails a matter of great substance. It requires the Commission to heed the mandates of the Act and to make the expert determinations which are conditions precedent to its authority to act.\n We intimate no opinion on the merits of the controversy. For in absence of the requisite jurisdictional findings we think the order of the Commission should have been set aside.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER, dissenting.\n Congress has empowered the Interstate Commerce Commission to authorize a railroad, when public convenience permits, to abandon any portion of its line. But when such portion is a suburban or interurban electric railway abandonment may be authorized only if it is part of a general steam railroad system of transportation. \n\n[320 \nU.S. 685, 693]\n\u00a0\n Section 1(18) and (22) of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended 49 U.S.C .  1(18) and (22), 49 U.S.C.A.  1(18, 22). This Court has held that whether such a line is of a character to permit abandonment under federal authority need not be determined in the first instance by the Interstate Commerce Commission; and such determination when made does not foreclose an independent judicial judgment. Texas & Pac. R. v. Gulf, etc., R. Co., \n270 \nU.S. 266\n, 46 S.Ct. 263, and United States v. Idaho, \n298 \nU.S. 105\n, 56 S.Ct. 690. On such an independent examination of the issue the court below had no doubt that the Yonkers branch of the New York Central, the portion of the Central lines for which abandonment was here sought, was not 'a suburban or interurban line unconnected with the rest of the Central's railroad system' but was in fact 'intertwined with the operation of the (New York Central Railroad) system as a whole'. 50 F.Supp. 497, 498. The record amply sustains this conclusion. If this Court, however, on its own estimate of the various elements in the financial, physical and transportation relations between the rest of the New York Central lines and this Yonkers branch, had struck a contrary balance and found that the Yonkers branch was not operated as a part of the general New York Central system, I should not have deemed the matter of sufficient importance to warrant expression of dissent.\n But the Court does not decide on the merits. In effect, it remits the controversy to the Interstate Commerce Commission on the ground that the Commission did not make a formal finding, described as 'jurisdictional', that the Yonkers branch was in fact 'operated as a part ... of a general steam railroad system of transportation'. The Commission may very well now formally make such a finding of a connection between the Yonkers branch and the New York Central, which in fact is writ large in the Commission's report in granting the application for abandonment, and the weary round of litigation may be re- \n\n[320 \nU.S. 685, 694]\n\u00a0\n peated to the futile end of having this Court then, forsooth, express an opinion on the merits opposed to that of the Commission and the District Court. This danger if not likelihood of thus marching the king's men up the hill and then marching them down again seems to me a mode of judicial administration to which I cannot yield concurrence. I think the case should be disposed of on the merits by affirming the judgment of the District Court.\n This seems to me all the more called for since I find no defect in the foundation of the Commission's order. No doubt the Interstate Commerce Commission like other administrative agencies should keep within legal bounds and courts should keep them there, in so far as Congress has entrusted them with judicial review over administrative acts. Of course when a statute makes indispensable 'an express finding', an express finding is imperative, see Wichita R. & Light Co. v. Public Util. Comm., \n260 \nU.S. 48, 59\n, 43 S.Ct. 51, 55. But the history of the Interstate Commerce Act and its amendments illumine the different legal functions expressed by the term findings. When Congress exacts from the Commission formal findings there is an end to the matter. For certain duties of the Commission and at certain stages in the history of the Interstate Commerce Act, Congress did require formal findings, but experience led Congress later to dispense with such formal requirements. See Manufacturers R. Co. v. United States, \n246 \nU.S. 457, 489\n, 490 S., 38 S.Ct. 383, 392. But courts have also spoken of the need of findings as the basis of validity of an order by the Interstate Commerce Commission in the absence of a Congessional direction for findings. The requirement of findings in such a context is merely part of the need for courts to know what it is that the Commission has really determined in order that they may know what to review. 'We must know what a decision means before the duty becomes ours to say whether it is right or \n\n[320 \nU.S. 685, 695]\n\u00a0\n wrong.' See United States v. Chicago, M., St. P. & P.R. Co., \n294 \nU.S. 499\n, 509-511, 55 S.Ct. 462, 466, 467\n\n\n This is the real ground for the decisions which have found Interstate Commerce Commission orders wanting in necessary findings. They have all been cases where the determination of an issue is not open to independent judgment by this Court, and where the case as it came here rested on conflicting inferences of fact left unresolved by the Commission. Such were the circumstances, for instance, in Florida v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 194\n, particularly at pages 214, 215, 51 S.Ct. 119, at pages 124, 125, and United States v. Baltimore & O.R. Co., \n293 \nU.S. 454\n, 455, particularly at 463, 464, 55 S.Ct. 268, at page 272. Findings in this sense is a way of describing the duty of the Commission to decide issues actually in controversy before it. Analysis is not furthered by speaking of such findings as 'jurisdictional' and not even when-to adapt a famous phrase-jurisdictional is softened by a quasi. 'Jurisdiction' competes with 'right' as one of the most deceptive of legal pitfalls. The opinions in Crowell v. Benson, \n285 \nU.S. 22\n, 52 S.Ct. 285, and the casuistries to which they have given rise bear unedifying testimony of the morass into which one is led in working out problems of judicial review over administrative decisions by loose talk about jurisdiction.\n The nub of the matter regarding the requirement of findings, where the formal making of them is not legislatively commanded, is indicated in United States v. Louisiana, \n290 \nU.S. 70\n, 54 S.Ct. 28. Reviewing the validity of the Commission's order is the serious business of sitting in judgment upon a tribunal of great traditions and large responsibility. An order of the Commission should not be viewed in a hypercritical spirit nor even as though elegantia juris were our concern. We should judge a challenged order of the Commission by, 'the report, read as a whole,' 290 U.S. supra at page 80, 54 S.Ct. at page 33, and by the record as a whole out of which the report arose. \n\n[320 \nU.S. 685, 696]\n\u00a0\n Viewing its order in this light makes plain enough why the Commission never formally stated that the line which it authorized to be abandoned was in fact operated as part of the New York Central system. It never formally made this statement because it was never questioned before it. On the face of the application, in the report proposed by the Commissioner's examiner, and in the report of the Commission, by Division 4, authorizing the issuance of a certificate of abandonment, the facts showing that the Yonkers branch was a part of the operating system of the New York Central are set forth in detail. Extensive exceptions were taken to the examiner's report by the City of Yonkers and a committee of Yonkers commuters but not even remotely did they take the point which is now made the ground for invalidating the Commission's order. Elaborate petitions for rehearing were filed by the protestants, including the Public Service Commission of New York, as the guardian of the local interests of New York,1 but not one of these petitions raised the objection now raised. The jurisdiction of the Commission was questioned, but no claim was made that the Yonkers branch was not an operating part of the New York Central. The City of Yonkers enumerated four grounds in challenging \n\n[320 \nU.S. 685, 697]\n\u00a0\n the jurisdiction of the Commission, but it did not specify the one now taken by the Court. The committee of commuters rested their claim of want of jurisdiction on the specific grounds that '(1) the line sought to be abandoned is an interurban electric passenger railway located wholly within the State of New York and (2) ... the alleged annual operating deficit' of the Yonkers branch was too insignificant to burden the operation of the New York Central. Exercising the discretion which Congress explicitly conferred upon it, the full Commission denied the petition for rehearing. Interstate Commerce Act,  17(6), 49 U.S.C.A.  17( 6). In any fair construction of the action of the Commission such a denial is an adverse finding of such claims as were made in the petitions for rehearing. The crucial fact is that only when the present bill was filed in the court below did the objection which the Court now sustains emerge in the specific claim that the Yonkers 'branch is not operated as a part or parts of a general steam railroad system of transportation.'\n Can there be any doubt that this contention was not put to the Commission because it was an afterthought? This issue was never tendered to the Commission because the facts which deny it were never questioned in the proceedings conducted before it with vigor and ability by several protestants during the three successive stages that preceded a challenge in the courts.\n The case is now sent back to the Commission. The facts regarding the relation of the Yonkers branch to the New York Central are spread at large upon the record and are not in controversy. In view of the three proceedings before the Commission it is reasonable to assume that the Commission will add to its report the formal finding now requested of it. If the case then returns here I find it too hard to believe that this Court would reject the conclusion of the Commission and of the lower Court that the Yonkers branch is an operating part of the New York Central \n\n[320 \nU.S. 685, 698]\n\u00a0\n within  1(22). Is not insistence on such an empty formalism a reversion to seventeenth century pleading which required talismanic phrases, as for instance that a seller could not be held to warrant that he sold what he purported to sell unless the buyer pleaded warrantizando vendidit or barganizasset? On the other hand, if the Court with all the facts before it does not think the Yonkers branch is a part of the railway operations of the New York Central, now is the time to say so.\n Mr. Justice REED and Mr. Justice JACKSON join in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The certificate authorizes a complete abandonment of the Yonkers branch, including dismantlement and salvaging. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The Public Service Commission of New York, which took the lead in attacking the order of the Commission before the District Court but which has not appeared here, asserted in its complaint that authority to discontinue the four stations was required by New York law but had not been sought or obtained. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Cf. Piedmont & N.R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n286 \nU.S. 299, 307\n, 52 S.Ct. 541, 543, and United States v. Chicago, N.S. & M.R. Co., \n288 \nU.S. 1\n, 9-12, 53 S.Ct. 245, 247-248, which emphasize in determining the status of independent electric roads the dominance of interurban passenger service and the prepounderance of local traffic. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] For cases dealing with the exception of suburban or interurban electric railways where the Commission has passed on the jurisdictional question see In the Matter of Michigan United Rys.

Idaho, supra. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Due concern for local interests in the administration of the Interstate Commerce Act hardly calls for an exaggerated concern for formal findings. The Interstate Commerce Act relies primarily on state authorities for the safeguarding of local interests. It is therefore relevant to note that the New York Public Service Commission, which is charged with the duty of protecting the local interests of New York against federal encroachments and which does not appear to have been unalert in doing so, has acquiesced in the decision below and is not here urging the local interest on which the decision of this Court seems to be based. That the state agency had best be looked to for the vindication of conflicting local interests within a state is well illustrated by the fact that while the City of Yonkers protested against the abandonment of the branch line, the City of New York urged it. \n\n\n\n\n","24":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCLARIDGE APARTMENTS CO. v. C.I.R.(1944)\nNo. 28\nArgued: Decided: December 4, 1944\n\n\n\n Mr. John E. Hughes, of Chicago, Ill., for petitioner.\n Mr. Chester T. Lane, of Washington, D.C., for respondent. \n\n[323 \nU.S. 141, 142]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice RUTLEDGE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The issues arise out of deficiency assessments made in respect to petitioner's federal income and excess profits taxes for the years 1935 to 1938 inclusive. They involve the applicability of Section 270 of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended,1 so as to require reduction of depreciation allowances claimed. \n\n[323 \nU.S. 141, 143]\n\u00a0\n The transactions arose in connection with a reorganization proceeding under Section 77B, 48 Stat. 912, 11 U.S.C.A.  207. They consisted essentially of petitioner's acquisition of all the assets of the insolvent debtor corporation, by an exchange of its capital stock, without pay value for the latter's bonds then outstanding. The Commissioner contends that the exchange resulted in a cancellation or reduction of indebtedness within the meaning of Section 270, so as to require a corresponding reduction in the basis of the property transferred. Accordingly he now urges that the assessment should be made, as the section requires, upon the basis of the fair market value of the property. 2 The taxpayer's claim is made on the higher basis of the debtor corporation, in the view that Section 270 is not applicable to such a transaction.\n This difference has been the basic one between the parties in proceedings before the Tax Court,3 the Circuit Court of Appeals and here. Others include a similar question with respect to the extinction of the debtor's liability for the accrued unpaid interest on the bonds and whether Section 270 is made applicable retroactively to the years prior to 1938, by virtue of the provisions of Section 276, sub. c(3) of the Chandler Act, 11 U.S.C.A.  676, sub. c(3).4 \n\n[323 \nU.S. 141, 144]\n\u00a0\n The Tax Court decided the principal issue on the merits in favor of the taxpayer, except with respect to the accrued interest. Cf. also Capento Securities Corp. v. Commissioner, 47 B.T.A. 691, affirmed, 140 F. 2d 382. It likewise limited the application of Section 270 to the year 1938 and succeeding years. 1 T.C. 163. The Court of Appeals reversed the Tax Court's decision in both respects, holding there was a cancellation of indebtedness with respect to the unpaid principal5 and that Section 270 was applicable retroactively to require the prescribed reduction in basis for each of the tax years in question. 138 F.2d 962. Certiorari was granted, \n321 \nU.S. 759\n, 64 S.Ct. 788, because of the importance of the questions presented and a conflict on the question of retroactivity. \n6\n The facts are stated shortly in the margin, to give concrete perspective. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n[323 \nU.S. 141, 145]\n\u00a0\n I.\n Petitioner earnestly argues that the Tax Court's decision, so far as this was in its favor, should be affirmed on the authority of Dobson v. Commissioner, \n320 \nU.S. 489\n, 64 S.Ct. 239, though in other respects it seeks a reversal of that court's judgment. \n8\n For reasons presently to be stated, we think the case must be disposed of in its entirety by the application of Section 276, sub. c(3), which determines the extent to which Sections 268 and 270 are applicable in point of time. Accordingly, we are not required to pass upon the merits of the other interesting issues or whether they fall within the Dobson admonition. On the other hand, the question of the applicability of Sections 268 and 270, under the terms of Section 276, sub. c(3), to the transactions involved in this case obviously is one of law and of a sort not requiring the specialized experience of the Tax Court to determine. Furthermore, it involves making an accommodation between the conflicting policies, in part, of the bankruptcy laws and the revenue enactments. Sections 268 and 270 are integral parts of the former, though related in subject matter to the latter, and were so placed for purposes relevant primarily to that legislation. For these reasons the issue falls beyond the scope of the Dobson case. \n\n[323 \nU.S. 141, 146]\n\u00a0\n II.\n The question presented by Section 276, sub. c(3) must be determined in the light of the problem created by Sections 268 and 270. A statement of their history is necessary to a general understanding of that problem. It stems basically from United States v. Kirby Lumber Co., \n284 \nU.S. 1\n, 52 S.Ct. 4, and subsequent decisions which have applied the principle of that case. \n9\n By them a corporation may realize income from the cancellation or reduction of indebtedness, depending upon the circumstances in which the transaction occurs. However, the line between income producing reductions and others is not precise or definite and great uncertainty prevailed concerning it, both in 1934 when Section 77B was enacted and in 1938 when Chapter X of the Chandler Act was adopted, 11 U.S.C.A.  501 et seq. The uncertainty was greatest perhaps in relation to transactions occurring in the course of insolvent reorganizations. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n Some of the obscurity has been created by the very legislation enacted to remove it. This has been true of the successive 'reorganization' provisions, including those for 'nonrecognition' and for transfer of 'basis,' which have appeared in the various revenue acts from 1918 (cf. 40 Stat. 1057) forward. Closely related, as these have been, to the problem whether income is realized by the cancellation or reduction of indebtedness in connection with a reorganization, they have tended to obscure if not to blot \n\n[323 \nU.S. 141, 147]\n\u00a0\n out that problem altogether in situations covered by their terms. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n By and large the provisions are the product of and have reflected efforts at compromise, none too successful, between the conflicting pulls of policy involved in the revenue acts and in the bankruptcy legislation. They were drawn and enacted however as parts of the revenue laws and have reflected increasingly the policy of that legislation. \n12\n Accordingly, the succession of statutes relating to this field, prior to Sections 268 and 270, represents a series of shifts in the legislative pendulum from initial broad tax relief, to encourage needed reorganizations, toward narrowed exemption, in order to discourage use of reorganization for evasion of taxes. The general purpose of the provisions, however, was to postpone the tax consequences which otherwise might ensue upon transactions occurring in such circumstances that immediate imposition was regarded as economically unjustifiable. \n13\n This continued in the 1934 general revision,14 which remained in effect during the period of this litigation.\n In some respects, as compared with the preexisting legislation, the 1934 provisions broadened, but in others they restricted the scope of application of the principles of nonrecognition and transfer of basis. \n15\n Nevertheless, \n\n[323 \nU.S. 141, 148]\n\u00a0\n they were applicable to all exchanges falling within their terms, whether or not the plan was executed in connection with a judicial proceeding. Consequently, when in June, 1934, Section 77B was adopted, the 1934 revenue provisions became applicable to reorganizations under that section, but only if they met the tests prescribed in the revenue acts, including such judicially interpolated matters as 'continuity of interest' and 'business purpose.' \n16\n Many 77B reorganizations did not qualify under these tests or on substantial grounds were thought not to do so.\n The consequence was seriously to clog the use of the 77B procedure. Obstacles were imposed not only by the differences in the two statutory definitions of 'reorganization,' but also by ambiguities in each definition which in themselves created considerable areas of uncertainty. 17 And underlying these remained the mystery of when income would be regarded as realized, which continued to haunt reorganizers unsure of whether they could bring themselves within the statutory exemptions. In short, the necessity of squaring the reorganization first with Section 77B, then with the different terms of the revenue provisions, and the uncertainties involved under each statute in doing this, added to the puzzle of 'realized income,' made the process of creditors' reorganization under the former act a highly dubious adventure. To an undetermined extent \n\n[323 \nU.S. 141, 149]\n\u00a0\n the effect of the revenue act's provisions was to nullify or make impossible of realization the objects of Section 77B.\n In this setting Congress adopted the Chandler Act in 1938. That statute was a general revision of the provisions for bankruptcy reorganization, including those previously made under Section 77B. One of its principal objects was to encourage the freer use of bankruptcy reorganization in order to avoid unnecessary or premature liquidations. By this time Congress had become aware of the hazardous and hampering effects of the 1934 revenue provisions upon the operation of bankruptcy reorganizations under Section 77B. The objectives of the Chandler Act, in similar situations, could not be achieved without removal of these impediments. Some provision was essential to prevent them from having the same effects upon the working of the new legislation. Accordingly Section 268 was devised for this purpose and became a part of the Chandler Act itself. It had no other object, and there was no other occasion for its being, than to free Chapter X reorganizations from the tax deterrents, including tax uncertainties, imposed by the existing revenue act provisions.\n The relieving effect of Section 268 was confined in three ways, namely, (1) to transactions occurring in a Chapter X reorganization; (2) to transactions involving a modification or a cancellation, in whole or in part, of the debtor's indebtedness; and (3) its benefits were limited to the debtor corporation, the trustee, if any, provided for in the plan, and the successor or transferee corporation. Within these limitations the section provided that 'no income or profit, taxable under any law ... shall ... be deemed to have accrued to or to have been realized by ...' the parties specified, and thus removed Chapter X transactions from incidence of the uncertainties characterizing the general 'reorganization' provisions. One who followed the procedure could be assured he would \n\n[323 \nU.S. 141, 150]\n\u00a0\n not thereby run into tax consequences which would be worse than the economic illness requiring that cure.\n As it was originally considered by the House Committee, the Chandler Act contained no counterpart of the present Section 270. Had Section 268 thus been left to stand alone, with no accompanying provision for 'basis,' either there would have been no applicable provision for 'basis' or the general 'basis' provisions would have remained applicable to Chapter X reorganizations falling within their terms, with the result that they would apply to some Chapter X reorganizations but not to others. The latter view apparently was generally accepted. Under it much of the previous uncertainty would have remained, but with its focus shifted from 'realized income' to 'basis.' Moreover, it was the view of Treasury officials, apparently in the assumption of continued transfer of 'basis' under the general provisions, that the effect of Section 268 would be to provide a double deduction in some cases,18 unless complemented by a corresponding 'basis' provision, and thus be unfair to the revenue.\n Accordingly the Treasury, and others, made various proposals,19 which eventuated in the adoption of Section 270 in its original form. This provided for transfer of basis, as did the code provisions, but required that it be decreased by the amount of the reduction of indebtedness, a measure at variance with the terms of the code. It was from the requirement of reduction, and the measure provided for it, that new difficulties were derived. Although the only occasion for making a further provision concerning basis arose from the adoption of Section 268 and although the legislative history discloses the purpose of Congress exactly \n\n[323 \nU.S. 141, 151]\n\u00a0\n contrary to placing Chapter X reorganizations at radical disadvantage from others, the literal effect of the original Section 270 came near if not entirely to wiping out the whole benefit conferred by Section 268.20 Soon it was realized that literal application of the specified new measure of reduction would require decrease of basis in many instances to zero or even to a point below zero, because the amount of the debt cancelled or reduced would equal or exceed the value of the property or that assigned to the basis transferred. Thus, any tax benefit derived from Section 268, in such cases, would be more than offset by the higher taxes resulting in later years from the absence of any depreciation base and in case of sale of the property acquired. And in cases where no benefit could be derived from Section 268, the effect of applying Section 270 was, if not to impose a capital levy,21 then to deny the new owners equal treatment, not only with other transferees under the code provisions, but with all other taxpayers.\n Congress, in view of its original object in adopting Section 268, could not possibly have intended such consequences for Section 270. The cure was worse than the disease. \n22\n The legislative history gives the clear impression that adoption of the original Section 270 was a plain blunder, the consequences of which were not foreseen, understood or intended by those who finally gave it the form of law. \n23\n\u00a0\n\n[323 \nU.S. 141, 152]\n\u00a0\n Legislative relief obviously was in order and was forthcoming at the next session of Congress, in the amendment of Section 270 adding the language giving it its present form. \n24\n The amendment removed some, but not all of the uncertainty confronting Chapter X reorganizers. It placed a floor to the amount of reduction required. In no case would basis be reduced below fair market value. But this was only partial cure of the original infirmities. Above the floor, debt cancellation remained the measure of reduction, thus keeping Chapter X reorganizations generally at a disadvantage with those taking place under the code. But, what was more important, the chief hazard remained, namely, whether Section 270 was intended to operate only where Section 268 was effective to afford actual tax benefit or, as the Government contends, regardless of whether such relief was afforded. And in this case the hazard has been realized in assessment.\n\n\n III.\n\n With this background we turn to Section 276, sub. c(3). By their own terms Sections 268 and 270 apply only to transactions arising in connection with proceedings 'under this chapter,' that is, Chapter X of the Chandler Act. The instant transactions arose in proceedings, not under Chapter X, but under Section 77B, which had been closed by final decree \n\n[323 \nU.S. 141, 153]\n\u00a0\n March 1, 1937. The Chandler Act became effective September 22, 1938. Accordingly, Sections 268 and 270, of their own force, are not applicable to these transactions. If they are so at all it is by virtue of Section 276, sub. c(3), which the Government says must be construed to extend their operation retroactively to include these facts. This petitioner disputes.\n The language immediately in question is the italicized part of subdivision (3), as follows:\n'c. the provisions of sections 77A and 77B ... shall continue in full force and effect with respect to proceedings pending ... upon the effective date of this amendatory Act, except that-\n\n'(3) sections 268 and 270 of this Act shall apply to any plan confirmed under section 77B before the effective date of this ammendatory Act and to any plan which may be confirmed under section 77B on and after such effective date, except that the exemption provided by section 268 of this Act may be disallowed if it shall be made to appear that any such plan had for one of its principal purposes the avoidance of income taxes, and except further that where such plan has not been confirmed on and after such effective date, section 269 of this Act shall apply where practicable and expedient.' (Emphasis added.) 52 Stat. 905, 11 U.S.C.A.  676, 11 U.S.C.A.  676.\n\n Three constructions have been advanced. Shortly stated they are that Sections 268 and 270 apply to transactions involved in 77B proceedings (1) only if the proceedings were pending September 22, 1938; (2) only for 1938 and later tax years, but including transactions in proceedings closed before September 22, 1938; (3) for all tax years from 1934 forward as to transactions in all proceedings in which a plan had been or should be confirmed, regardless of whether the proceedings were pending or had been closed on September 22, 1938. \n\n[323 \nU.S. 141, 154]\n\u00a0\n The petitioner advances the first two views, alternatively; the Government the third. The Government interprets the italicized language as if it were wholly disconnected from and unrelated to the preceding portions of Section 276, sub. c, in other words, as an entirely independent provision unlimited by its statutory context. Petitioner, on the other hand, regards it as merely a part or phase of Section 276, sub. c,25 and thus reaches the exactly contrary view of its meaning. The statute, it says, refers in the first paragraph of 'c' to 'proceedings pending' under 77B and, to quote the brief, 'exceptions (1), (2) and (3) are keyed into this first paragraph and refer to pending proceedings also. They merely except from the pending cases those to which 77B is not to apply. Since sub. c deals only with pending cases and not closed cases, they refer also to pending cases.' The Government concedes there is force in this \n\n[323 \nU.S. 141, 155]\n\u00a0\n view, though it suggests, we think untenably,26 that the question is doubtfully open. The Court of Appeals accepted the Government's view, the Tax Court the alternative or second view advanced by the taxpayer. We think neither can be accepted and that the effect of Section 276, sub. c(3) is to confine the application of Sections 268 and 270, in 77B proceedings, to proceedings pending when the Chandler Act became effective.\n If Sections 268 and 270 were to be applied to all reorganizations completed under Section 77B, literally they would cover all such transactions running back to 1934, when the latter section was enacted. As to proceedings closed when the Chandler Act took effect, this would involve disturbance of tax consequences already settled for five years, unless cases are excepted where the statute of limitations had run. \n27\n We have no means of knowing how much resurrection of old claims or generation of new ones in respect to settled matters this would create. Nor did the authors of \n\n[323 \nU.S. 141, 156]\n\u00a0\n the Chandler Act. But, from the circumstances of the time and the very necessities which brought about adoption of Section 77B, the volume must have been considerable.\n To construe Section 276, sub. c(3) to produce such consequences in no way would further the primary objects of Sections 268 and 270, which were to encourage use of Chandler Act procedures, at the same time preventing their abuse for tax advantage. Rather it would pervert those sections by changing their character, to the extent of their retroactive operation, from relief provisions to purely revenue measures of the worst type. In adopting them Congress was not uprooting the whole tax past of reorganized debtors and their creditors. It was, or purported to be, giving relief from harsh or uncertain tax consequences to persons reorganizing presently or in the future. \n28\n\u00a0\n\n The language does not require such unlimited construction. The words are not directed expressly to past tax years. Nor are they focused upon transactions in closed proceedings. It is true that Section 276, sub. c(3), if construed as though it were entirely independent of the remainder of Section 276, sub. c, does not refer explicitly to pending 77B proceedings, except in its concluding clause. Yet it is part and parcel of that section, which in all other respects deals only with pending and future proceedings, not with closed ones. And the concluding clauses of (3) afford additional evidence that it was intended to apply only to plans confirmed or to be confirmed in pending proceedings, as does also its setting in the context of Section 276 as a whole. \n29\n\u00a0\n\n[323 \nU.S. 141, 157]\n\u00a0\n Thus Section 276, in subsections a, b and c (excepting only Section 276, sub. c(3)), deals exclusively with pending or future proceedings. Congress' concern in 'a' was that Chapter X should apply notwithstanding the substantive rights of debtors, creditors and others had arisen before the effective date of the Act. In 'b' it was that the pendency of bankruptcy and receivership proceedings should not defeat resort to the Chandler Act's provisions; in 'c' it was with an accommodation of the provisions of Sections 77A and 77B and those of the Chandler Act as to pending proceedings. Apart from Section 276, sub. c(3), therefore, the whole \n\n[323 \nU.S. 141, 158]\n\u00a0\n problem treated in Section 276 was to give the Chandler Act as wide room as possible for future operation, notwithstanding the previous vesting of substantive rights or institution of bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding. Congress was concerned with the Act's future operation, as a remedial provision, not as a method of creating new and retroactive substantive rights and liabilities.\n This being true, it is difficult to understand why Congress might wish to follow exactly the opposite policy with reference to newly created substantive tax rights and liabilities. It would seem wholly incongruous to imply such a purpose in the absence of language unquestionably requiring it, both as a matter of general legislative policy and, more especially, as one of accommodation with the purposes of the particular legislation. In short, apart from subdivision (3), relating to tax incidents of reorganization, all of Section 276 was devoted entirely to matters affecting pending and future proceedings. We can find reason for no other view than that this was true also of the provisions for application of the new tax features.\n This is borne out by the concluding clauses of Section 276, sub. c(3) itself, which provide for exceptions to its operation. The second exception in terms relates only to pending proceedings. It contemplated future confirmation exclusively. The first exception, standing alone, literally could be applied in the case of a closed proceeding. But reaching such cases was not a necessary reason for including it. Such a reason existed, however, in the necessity for covering plans already confirmed in pending proceedings, unless parties then reorganizing under Section 77B were to be treated differently from others reorganizing at the same time under Chapter X. The two exceptions thus dovetailed to provide complete coverage for disallowing the exemption given by Section 268 in pending proceedings. They comprehended distinct situations and provided dif- \n\n[323 \nU.S. 141, 159]\n\u00a0\n ferent sanctions,30 all however consistent with application only in pending proceedings. Thus the entire language of Section 276, sub. c(3) was capable of full and complete application, although confined to pending proceedings. To give it greater scope, retroactively, is required neither by the terms nor by the purposes of the specific provision or others related to it in context or by reference.\n That the narrower application was the intended one seems most apparent when the nature of the problem with which Section 276, sub. c(3), sought to deal is considered. There was no problem, arising from enactment of the Chandler Act, with reference to closed 77B proceedings. And there was no reason originally, when Section 268 stood alone, for giving the relief it afforded to taxpayers involved in such proceedings. Nothing in the legislative history of Section 268, or of Section 270, shows any concern, intent or occasion for dealing with such taxpayers. The whole desire related rather, as has been shown, to taxpayers who might be adversely affected by the general revenue provisions in taking advantage of the Chandler Act.\n However, that Act itself created another problem, namely, how far its terms should apply in pending 77B proceedings. Congress decided that the Chandler procedure should be followed as far as possible, though not to the extent of displacing the 77B procedure in reorganizations far advanced. 31 The same policy was framed for other chapters. Consequently Sections 276, sub. c(1) and (2), were \n\n[323 \nU.S. 141, 160]\n\u00a0\n included, as were also comparable provisions in other chapters. \n32\n With them in, the problem was presented whether the Chandler Act's tax relief provisions, including Sections 268 and 270, should apply also in the pending 77B proceedings and, if so, to what extent-only to those converted into Chandler Act proceedings by Section 276, sub. c(1), or also to those partially converted under Section 276, sub. c(2) by an exercise of judicial discretion and those falling within 276, sub. c(2) but so nearly completed or otherwise situated that application of the Chandler Act in any respect would be impracticable and therefore 77B would continue exclusively effective.\n Although these pending 77B proceedings, and particularly those nearing completion, having been already begun, were generally without the scope of the encouragement Sections 268 and 270 were intended to give to persons contemplating reorganization, Congress undoubtedly felt it would be unfair to give the relief to taxpayers following the Chandler Act procedure, but deny it to persons following that of 77B at the same time. To make this discrimination might force conversion of pending 77B proceedings into Chapter X proceedings, solely on account of tax consequences, where but for them such conversion would not be proper or desirable. Accordingly, by Section 276, sub. c(3) Congress extended the tax relief provided by Sections 268 and 270 also to pending 77B proceedings in order to put persons continuing 77B reorganization on the same basis with others proceeding under Chapter X. There was no other occasion or object for the extension.\n In view of these considerations both of context and of consequence, we do not think Section 276, sub. c(3) can be regarded as applicable to closed proceedings. The purpose rather, as in the other provisions of Section 276, was to look to the future and in doing so to make the necessary adjustment, so far as was possible, between the provisions of the Chandler \n\n[323 \nU.S. 141, 161]\n\u00a0\n Act and preexisting laws as to proceedings pending when the former took effect. Thus construed, Section 276, sub. c(3) becomes consistent, both in form and in the purpose and effects of applying the new tax provisions, with the other provisions of Section 276 and with the general policy of the Chandler Act as to applicability of its terms. \n33\n Any other view would make Section 276, sub. c(3) a unique provision in the statute's setting and one inconsistent with, if not also contradictory to, the Act's general purposes and the limited objects of the particular provisions immediately in issue.\n Further support for this view would seem to be afforded, when the consequences of applying it or the contrary one to similar provisions appearing in other chapters of the Chandler Act34 are taken into account. If those pro- \n\n[323 \nU.S. 141, 162]\n\u00a0\n visions are to be given retroactive application comparable to what the Government says should be given to Sections 268, 270 and 276, sub. c(3), the disruption of settled tax situations, by virtue of the Chandler Act's adoption, may be multiplied many times over what would follow from giving such an effect only to Sections 268, 270 and 276, sub. c(3). Although the immediate consequences of decision in this case are limited to the specific effects of these sections, it is at least doubtful that they could be given a different construction, as to retroactive application, from what might be given to the comparable sections of other chapters. The possibility that uniform interpretation may be required gives pause, at least, before adopting a view in this case which, if extended to the other provisions, would open so wide a door for retroactive taxation.\n As against this interpretation, the Government's argument rests primarily on two bases: (1) that the words of Section 276, sub. c(3) require its construction; and (2) that unless this is given, discriminations as to tax consequences will be created between taxpayers involved in closed proceedings and those in pending and future ones, with the result that mere speed in getting the proceedings pending prior to September 22, 1938, to a final decree would determine whether taxpayers equally deserving would be afforded the relief provided by Sections 268 and 270.\n The answers are obvious. In the first place, the wording of Section 276, sub. c(3) does not require the Government's con- \n\n[323 \nU.S. 141, 163]\n\u00a0\n struction. That view can be taken only if subdivision (3) is torn, formally and substantively, from its context in the statute and the problems with which these surrounding provisions, including Sections 268 and 270, undertook to deal. Thus to treat the provision not only would disregard the purposes of all these related provisions. It would convert subdivision (3), in its practical application, into an entirely independent tax measure, solely in the nature of an amendment to the general revenue legislation, and with the harshest retroactive tax consequences. This in fact seems to be the Government's view of the character of the legislation. 35 But that view wholly disregards the fact that neither Sections 268 and 270 nor Section 276, sub. c(3) had any purpose originally or later merely to produce larger revenues or to operate exclusively as revenue measures. It is true they modified the preexisting revenue provisions, so far as they were applicable by their terms to do so. But this was a function of their primary object, which was to give relief to parties undertaking reorganization, not simply to impose new and different taxes upon them, much less to do so with respect to transactions long since settled \n\n[323 \nU.S. 141, 164]\n\u00a0\n both as to taxes and as to reorganization. The objects of Section 276, sub. c(3) cannot be ignored or distorted by thus stripping the provision, formally and substantively, from its statutory setting and the limitations this clearly imposes.\n So far as respects the Government's concern over the possible discriminations which will be created between taxpayers by acceptance of petitioner's view, it is perhaps enough to say that some such discrimination is inevitable with whatever solution may be accepted; and we think what follows from applying Sections 268 and 270 only to 'pending proceedings' not only is preferable to any other but is most consistent with the normal course of legislation. Retroactivity, even where permissible, is not favored, except upon the clearest mandate. It is the normal and usual function of legislation to discriminate between closed transactions and future ones or others pending but not completed. The discrimination which the Government fears will follow from acceptance of the taxpayer's view admittedly will result. But it is one consistent with the normal consequences of legislation in the drawing of a line between the past or the present and the future. It also was one necessary for Congress to make if it were not to make another or others equally bad or worse. The Government's concern in this case is not that the taxpayer will suffer harsher discrimination under petitioner's construction than under its own. It is rather that he will not suffer it. For, as interpreted by the Government,36 Sections 268, 270 and 276, sub. c(3) applied in conjunction would be much more likely to produce new, and retroactive, tax burdens than tax benefits. The present case in an illustration. To this the Government might be entitled if the statutory mandate were clear. It cannot have that \n\n[323 \nU.S. 141, 165]\n\u00a0\n advantage by dubious construction which ignores so much of the statute's setting, purpose and history. The letter does not require this. The consequences forbid it.\n There remains for consideration the refusal of the Court of Appeals to reverse the findings of the Tax Court as to the original cost of the apartment building and the propriety of deductions claimed in 1937 for decorating expenses. \n37\n The Tax Court, in arriving at the cost of the building, refused to allow an alleged ten per cent contractor's commission paid to the debtor company's principal promoter and original sole shareholder because it was not convinced by petitioner's witness 'that any amount was actually paid by the old company for contractor's services. ... ' 1 T.C. 163, 175. The Tax Court also concluded, after hearing vague testimony on two small deductions in 1937 for decorating and repairs, that these were not properly taken, because the same deductions for the same purposes had been claimed and allowed in 1936. These issues were well within the principle of the Dobson case. The Tax Court was upheld in these respects by the Court of Appeals and we accept these findings.\n Accordingly, the judgments are reversed and the causes are remanded to the Circuit Court of Appeals for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Bankruptcy Act of July 1, 1898, c. 541, 30 Stat. 544, as amended by the Act of June 22, 1938, c. 575, 52 Stat. 904, and the Act of July 1, 1940, c. 500, 54 Stat. 709, 11 U.S.C.  668, 670, 11 U.S.C.A.  668, 670. Section 270 is complementary to Section 268, with which originally it was enacted as part of Chapter X of the Chandler Act. The two sections are as follows, the italicized portion of 270 constituting the whole of the amendment made in 1940.\n'Sec. 268. Except as provided in section 270 of this Act, no income or profit, taxable under any law of the United States or of any State now in force or which may hereafter be enacted, shall, in respect to the adjustment of the indebtedness of a debtor in a proceeding under this chapter, be deemed to have accrued to or to have been realized by a debtor, by a trustee provided for in a plan under this chapter, or by a corporation organized or made use of for effectuating a plan under this chapter by reason of a modification in or cancelation in whole or in part of any of the indebtedness of the debtor in a proceeding under this chapter.'\n\n'Sec. 270. In determining the basis of property for any purposes of any law of the United States or of a State imposing a tax upon income, the basis of the debtor's property (other than money) or of such property ( other than money) as is transferred to any person required to use the debtor's basis in whole or in part shall be decreased by an amount equal to the amount by which the indebtedness of the debtor, not including accrued interest unpaid and not resulting in a tax benefit on any income tax return, has been canceled or reduced in a proceeding under this chapter, but the basis of any particular property shall not be decreased to an amount less than the fair market value of such property as of the date of entry of the order confirming the plan. Any determination of value in a proceeding under this chapter shall not be deemed a determination of fair market value for the purposes of this section. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, shall prescribe such regulations as he may deem necessary in order to reflect such decrease in basis for Federal income-tax purposes and otherwise carry into effect the purposes of this section.' (Emphasis added.) \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Cf. note 1 supra. Originally the Commissioner contended that the taxpayer's basis for depreciation was the market value of the property on acquisition in 1935 and this was a major issue before the Tax Court, cf. 1 T.C. 163. But the Tax Court held petitioner had acquired the assets in connection with a reorganization as comprehended by Section 112(g) of the Revenue Act of 1934, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 695, and that therefore its basis was the adjusted basis in the hands of the debtor corporation. This ruling was not contested on appeal and is not in question here. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Cf. note 2 supra. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] The section is set forth in Part III of the opinion. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Consequently it made no ruling with reference to the accrued interest, since the amount of the principal held to have been 'cancelled' was more than sufficient to bring the basis down to the fair market value in 1935. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] Cf. Commissioner v. Commodore, 6 Cir., 135 F.2d 89, holding that Section 276, sub. c(3) does not make Sections 268 and 270 retroactively applicable to tax years prior to 1938. The importance of the questions for the future has been minimized by repeal of Section 270 by Section 121 of the Revenue Act of 1943, Pub.L. 235, 78th Cong., 2d Sess., 26 U.S.C.A. Int. Rev.Code,  113(a)(22). \n[\nFootnote 7\n] The property consists of an apartment building, with furnishings, in Chicago. It was constructed in 1924 by the Claridge Building Corporation at a cost in excess of $385,000. The corporation at that time issued its 6 1\/2 per cent first mortgage bonds for $340,000. By October 1, 1931, the bonds outstanding amounted to $277,000. In consequence of defaults, on that date the trustee filed his bill of foreclosure, took possession of the property, and thereafter collected the rents. A decree for foreclosure was entered the following February, but there was no sale and the foreclosure proceeding was never consummated.\n On June 16, 1934 the Building Corporation filed its voluntary petition under Section 77B. In November of that year a plan of reorganization was agreed upon, which was confirmed and approved May 14, 1935. Pursuant to this the taxpayer corporation was organized and the property was transferred to it. Ninety per cent of its shares were issued to trustees for depositing bondholders and to nondepositing bondholders, on the basis of one share of stock for each $100 face amount of bonds; and ten per cent of the stock was issued to the shareholders in the old corporation. The final decree in the Section 77B proceeding was entered March 1, 1937.\n According to findings of the Tax Court, the fair market value of the building, as of May 14, 1935 (when the plan was confirmed, cf.  270, note 1 supra), was not in excess of $141,000. The adjusted basis of the taxpayer's predecessor in that year was $239,377.33, at which time the building had a remaining useful life of twenty-five years. The fair market value of petitioner's stock did not exceed $45 per share in 1935. The Tax Court also found that the Claridge Building Corporation was insolvant throughout the reorganization proceedings. \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Cf. text infra at note 37. \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Cf., e.g., Helvering v.

A significant letter written by Congressman Chandler shortly after the passage of the Chandler Act was submitted at the 1940 Hearings (Hearings on H.R. 9864, at 52) and was received by the subcommittee into the record. For some reason it was not published in the record, although the Chandler letter was referred to in a letter which was published (Hearings on H.R. 9864, at 56). The Chandler letter may be found in Banks, Treatise on Bankruptcy for Accountants (1939) 84, 85. \n\n[\nFootnote 24\n] Cf. Note 1 supra. \n\n[\nFootnote 25\n] Petitioner's statement of the argument does not take account expressly of the obvious difference between what he calls 'exceptions (1) and (2),' on the one hand, and 'exception (3),' on the other. (1) and (2) are clearly true substantive exceptions to the general mandate of 'c.' That is, they provide instances in which Section 77B shall not continue to operate, contrary to the general provision of 'c' for its continued effectiveness in pending proceedings. Like effect however cannot be given to (3). It does not purport expressly to provide for nonoperation of 77B. Rather its force is to provide for an extended operation of Sections 268 and 270, with reference to 77B proceedings.\n The formal difficulty however is more apparent than substantial. Nothing in (3) is at all inconsistent with its limitation to pending 77B proceedings. And the formal connection with 'c,' though awkwardly made, affords some evidence of purpose to limit the effects of (3) to such proceedings. The same consequence, however, would seem to be dictated, if the formal connection, as an 'exception' to 'c,' were disregarded and (3) were treated as a separate subsection, like the corresponding provisions of other chapters. Cf. note 35 infra. The substantive relationship with the subject matter and purposes of the preceding provisions of the section as a whole would remain. Cf. text infra Part III. \n\n[\nFootnote 26\n] It is true petitioner did not present this interpretation in the Court of Appeals or in the Tax Court. It was advanced as a question presented on the petition for a writ of certiorari, the matter has been argued here, and the Government does not claim surprise. The issue of retroactivity and proper interpretation of Section 276, sub. c(3) has been a focal point of the controversy in the Court of Appeals and in the Tax Court. Petitioner has maintained throughout that there was no tax deficiency for either 1938 or any prior year. Thus the issue has been presented at all stages, although a theory to sustain petitioner's position concerning it has been advanced here which was not put forward in prior stages of the litigation. \n[\nFootnote 27\n] It may be noted that the terms of Section 276, sub. c(3) make no provision concerning the statute of limitations. They apply literally to all prior 77B proceedings. The Commissioner and the Treasury have not interpreted the section to make Sections 268 and 270 apply beyond the time when the general statute has run. But this interpretation is not necessarily controlling, in the face of the breadth of the language used, if it is taken as unlimited by its context. No assessment was made in this case for 1934 because the petitioner corporation was not organized until 1935. \n\n[\nFootnote 28\n] Cf. Part II of this opinion. \n[\nFootnote 29\n] The section comprises the whole of Article XVI of Chapter X, entitled 'When Chapter Takes Effect.' It is as follows:\n'Sec. 276. a. This chapter shall apply to debtors by whom or against whom petitions are filed on and after the effective date of this amendatory Act and to the creditors and stockholders thereof, whether their rights, claims, or interests of any nature whatsoever have been acquired or created before or after such date; \n\n'b. a petition may be filed under this chapter in a proceeding in bankruptcy which is pending on such date, and a petition may be filed under this chapter notwithstanding the pendency on such date of a proceeding in which a receiver or trustee of all or any part of the property of a debtor has been appointed or for whose appointment application has been made in a court of the United States or of any State;\n\n'c. the provisions of sections 77A and 77B of chapter VIII, as amended, of the Act entitled 'An Act to establish a uniform system of bankruptcy throughout the United States', approved July 1, 1898, shall continue in full force and effect with respect to proceedings pending under those sections upon the effective date of this amendatory Act, except that-\n\n'(1) if the petition in such proceedings was approved within three months prior to the effective date of this amendatory Act, the provisions of this chapter shall apply in their entirety to such proceedings; and\n\n'(2) if the petition in such proceedings was approved more than three months before the effective date of this amendatory Act, the provisions of this chapter shall apply to such proceedings to the extent that the judge shall deem their application practicable; and\n\n'(3) sections 268 and 270 of this Act shall apply to any plan confirmed under section 77B before the effective date of this amendatory Act and to any plan which may be confirmed under section 77B on and after such effective date, except that the exemption provided by section 268 of this Act may be disallowed if it shall be made to appear that any such plan had for one of its principal purposes the avoidance of income taxes, and except further that where such plan has not been confirmed on and after such effective date, section 269 of this Act shall apply where practicable and expedient.' (Emphasis added.) 52 Stat. 905, 11 U.S.C.  676, 11 U.S.C.A.  676. \n\n\n[\nFootnote 30\n] I.e., refusal of confirmation where the plan had not been approved ( cf.  269) and disallowance of the tax exemption, if the plan had been confirmed. For tax purposes these come to the same result, a fact also indicative that both exceptions were intended to operate within the general limitation of pending proceedings. \n[\nFootnote 31\n] S. Rep. No. 1916, 75th Cong., 3d Sess., 39; Hearings before the House Committee on the Judiciary on H.R. 8046, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., 375- 376, 383; Hearings before Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary on H.R. 8046, 75th Cong., 2d Sess., 6, 7. \n\n[\nFootnote 32\n] Cf. note 34 and text infra. \n\n[\nFootnote 33\n] 'Except as otherwise provided in this amendatory Act, the provisions of this amendatory Act shall govern proceedings so far as practicable in cases pending when it takes effect; but proceedings in cases then pending to which the provisions of this amendatory Act are not applicable shall be disposed of conformably to the provisions of said Act approved July 1, 1898, and the Acts amendatory thereof and supplementary thereto.' Act of June 22, 1938, c. 575,  6, sub. b, 52 Stat. 940, 11 U.S. C.A.  1 note. \n[\nFootnote 34\n] Chapters XI, XII and XIII, 11 U.S.C.A.  701 et seq., 801 et seq., 1001 et seq., deal respectively with Arrangements, Real Property Arrangements by Persons Other Than Corporations, and Wage Earners' Plans. Each of these chapters embodies sections corresponding in principle to Sections 268, 270 and 276. Those comparable to Section 276 are Section 399 in Chapter XI, Section 526 in Chapter XII, and Section 686 in Chapter XIII. Each, like Section 276, contains the whole of an article entitled 'When Chapter Takes Effect.' Each contains four subsections (with a fifth in Section 686), corresponding to subsections a, b and c of Section 276 and subdivision c(3) of that section. Thus, Sections 399(4), 526(4), and 686(4) correspond to subdivision 276, sub. c(3). They differ from it however in that they are formally independent subsections, whereas Section 276, sub. c(3) is formally a part of Subsection 276, sub. c, dependent upon its general mandate, and thus perhaps even more clearly limited by the preceding provisions. Cf. note 25 supra.\n Sections 268, 270 and 276, therefore, do not represent isolated instances of legislation peculiar to corporate reorganizations under Chapter X. They are rather particular instances of a general pattern of legislation, relating to a common problem running through Chapters X, XI, XII and XIII, namely, to what extent the Chandler Act's terms should be applied to pending reorganizations, arrangements, wage earners' plans, etc. Because of detailed differences in the situations affected, the provisions corresponding to Sections 268, 270 and 276 vary somewhat in detail. But the similarities rather than the variations, whether in situation or in terms, are significant for present purposes. \n\n[\nFootnote 35\n] Thus, in its brief the Government asserts, concerning petitioner's argument that Sections 268 and 270 apply only to 'pending' proceedings: 'This contention, although plausible, neglects the fact that Sections 268 and 270 are essentially tax provisions.' (Emphasis added.) To this it may be answered that the sections, in origin, purpose and function were 'essentially reorganization provisions' or, to put it differently, 'essentially tax relief provisions.' The Government's emphasis upon the sections as taxing measures ignores their primary object and function, which were to provide tax relief for parties undertaking reorganization and to prevent the clogging effects of the existing tax laws upon the operation of the Chandler Act. It also fails to note that retroactive application, in closed proceedings, could have no possible relation to the latter aim. The matter is one of emphasis. But it is not permissible, in construing provisions designed to encourage reorganizations, by giving relief from taxes, to take them by such an emphasis as if they were framed exclusively for raising revenue. \n\n[\nFootnote 36\n] That is, with Section 270 as operating independently of Section 268, to require reduction in basis even though no actual tax benefit has been derived under 268. \n\n[\nFootnote 37\n] Cf. text at note 8 supra. \n\n\n\n\n","25":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCLIFFORD F. MACEVOY CO. v. UNITED STATES(1944)\nNo. 483\nArgued: March 7, 1944Decided: April 24, 1944\n\n\n\n\n[322 \nU.S. 102, 103]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Edward F. Clark, of New York City, for petitioners.\n Mr. Benjamin P. DeWitt, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The United States entered into a contract with the petitioner Clifford F. MacEvoy Company whereby the latter agreed to furnish the materials and to perform the work necessary for the construction of dwelling units of a Defense Housing Project near Linden, New Jersey, on a cost-plus-fixed-fee basis. Pursuant to the Miller Act,1 MacEvoy as principal and the petitioner Aetna Casualty and Surety Company as surety executed a payment bond in the amount of $1,000,000, conditioned on the prompt payment by MacEvoy 'to all persons supplying labor and material in the prosecution of the work provided for in said contract.' The bond was duly accepted by the United States.\n MacEvoy thereupon purchased from James H. Miller & Company certain building materials for use in the prosecution of the work provided for in MacEvoy's contract with the Government. Miller in turn purchased these materials from the respondent, Calvin Tomkins Company. Miller failed to pay Tomkins a balance of $12,033.49. There is no allegation that Miller agreed to perform or did perform any part of the work on the construction project. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 102, 104]\n\u00a0\n Nor is it disputed that MacEvoy paid Miller in full for the materials.\n Within ninety days from the date on which Tomkins furnished the last of the materials to Miller, Tomkins gave written notice to MacEvoy and the surety of the existence and amount of Tomkins' claim for materials furnished to Miller. Tomkins as use-plaintiff then instituted this action against MacEvoy and the surety on the payment bond. The District Court granted petitioners' motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim against them. 49 F.Supp. 81. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the judgment. 137 F.2d 565. We granted certiorari because of a novel and important question presented under the Miller Act. \n320 \nU.S. 733\n, 64 S.Ct. 267.\n Specifically the issue is whether under the Miller Act a person supplying materials to a materialman of a Government contractor and to whom an unpaid balance is due from the materialman can recover on the payment bond executed by the contractor. We hold that he cannot.\n The Heard Act,2 which was the predecessor of the Miller Act, required Government contractors to execute penal bonds for the benefit of 'all persons supplying him or them with labor and materials in the prosecution of the work provided for in such contract.' We consistently applied a liberal construction to that statute, noting that it was remedial in nature and that it clearly evidenced 'the intention of Congress to protect those whose labor or material has contributed to the prosecution of the work.' United States, for Use of Hill, v. American Surety Co., \n200 \nU.S. 197, 204\n, 26 S.Ct. 168, 170. See also Mankin v. United States to Use of Ludowici-Celadon Co., \n215 \nU.S. 533\n, 30 S.Ct. 174; United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. v.

United States for Use and Benefit of Powell, \n302 \nU.S. 442\n, 58 S.Ct. 314. We accordingly held that the phrase 'all persons supplying (the contractor) ... with labor and materials' included not only those furnishing labor and materials directly to the prime contractor but also covered those who contributed labor and materials to subcontractors. United States, for Use of Hill, v. American Surety Co., supra, \n200 \nU.S. 204\n, 26 S.Ct. 170; Mankin v. United States for Use of Ludowici-Celadon Co., supra, \n215 \nU.S. 539\n, 30 S. Ct. 176; Illinois Surety Co. v. John Davis Co., \n244 \nU.S. 376, 380\n, 37 S.Ct. 614, 616. We had no occasion, however, to determine under that Act whether those who merely sold materials to materialmen, who in turn sold them to the prime contractors, were included within the phrase and hence entitled to recover on the penal bond. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n The Miller Act, while it repealed the Heard Act, reinstated its basic provisions and was designed primarily to eliminate certain procedural limitations on its beneficiaries. \n4\n There was no expressed purpose in the legis- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 102, 106]\n\u00a0\n lative history to restrict in any way the coverage of the Heard Act; the intent rather was to remove the procedural difficulties found to exist under the earlier measure and thereby make it easier for unpaid creditors to realize the benefits of the bond. Section 1(a)(2) of the Miller Act requires every Government contractor, where the amount of the contract exceeds $2,000, to furnish to the United States a payment bond with a surety 'for the protection of all persons supplying labor and material in the prosecution of the work provided for in said contract for the use of each such person.' Section 2(a) further provides that 'every person who has furnished labor or material in the prosecution of the work provided for in such contract' and who has not been paid in full therefor within ninety days after the last labor was performed or material supplied may bring suit on the payment bond for the unpaid balance. A proviso then states:\n'Provided, however, That any person having direct contractual relationship with a subcontractor but no contractual relationship express or implied with the contractor furnishing said payment bond shall have a right of action upon the said payment bond upon giving written notice to said contractor within ninety days from the date on which such person did or performed the last of the labor \n\n[322 \nU.S. 102, 107]\n\u00a0\n or furnished or supplied the last of the material for which such claim is made ....'\n\n The Miller Act, like the Heard Act, is highly remedial in nature. It is entitled to a liberal construction and application in order properly to effectuate the Congressional intent to protect those whose labor and materials go into public projects. Fleisher Engineering & Construction Co. v. United States, for Use and Benefit of Hallenbeck, \n311 \nU.S. 15, 17\n, 18 S., 61 S.Ct. 81, 82, 83; cf. United States to Use of Noland Co., Inc., v. Irwin, \n316 \nU.S. 23, 29\n, 30 S., 62 S.Ct. 899, 902. But such a salutary policy does not justify ignoring plain words of limitation and imposing wholesale liability on payment bonds. Ostensibly the payment bond is for the protection of 'all persons supplying labor and material in the prosecution of the work' and 'every person who has furnished labor or material in the prosecution of the work' is given the right to sue on such payment bond. Whether this statutory language is broad enough to include persons supplying material to materialmen as well as those in more remote relationships we need not decide. Even if it did include such persons we cannot disregard the limitations on liability which Congress intended to impose and did impose in the proviso of Section 2(a). However inclusive may be the general language of a statute, it 'will not be held to apply to a matter specifically dealt with in another part of the same enactment . ... Specific terms prevail over the general in the same or another statute which otherwise might be controlling.' Ginsberg & Sons v. Popkin, \n285 \nU.S. 204, 208\n, 52 S.Ct. 322, 323.\n The proviso of Section 2(a), which had no counterpart in the Heard Act, makes clear that the right to bring suit on a payment bond is limited to (1) those materialmen, laborers and subcontractors who deal directly with the prime contractor and (2) those materialmen, laborers and sub- contractors who, lacking express or implied contractual relationship with the prime contractor, have direct contractual relationship with a subcontractor and who give \n\n[322 \nU.S. 102, 108]\n\u00a0\n the statutory notice of their claims to the prime contractor. To allow those in more remote relationships to recover on the bond would be contrary to the clear language of the proviso and to the expressed will of the framers of the Act. \n5\n Moreover, it would lead to the absurd result of requiring notice from persons in direct contractual relationship with a subcontractor but not from more remote claimants.\n The ultimate question in this case, therefore, is whether Miller, the materialman to whom Tomkins sold the goods and who in turn supplied them to MacEvoy, was a subcontractor within the meaning of the proviso. If he was, Tomkins' direct contractual relationship with him enables Tomkins to recover on MacEvoy's payment bond. If Miller was not a subcontractor, Tomkins stands in too remote a relationship to secure the benefits of the bond.\n The Miller Act itself makes no attempt to define the word 'subcontractor.' We are thus forced to utilize ordinary judicial tools of definition. Whether the word includes laborers and materialmen is not subject to easy solution, for the word has no single, exact meaning. \n6\n In a broad, generic sense a subcontractor includes anyone who has a contract to furnish labor or material to the prime contractor. In that sense Miller was a subcontractor. But under the more technical meaning, as established by usage \n\n[322 \nU.S. 102, 109]\n\u00a0\n in the building trades, a subcontractor is one who performs for and takes from the prime contractor a specific part of the labor or material requirements of the original contract, thus excluding ordinary laborers and materialmen. To determine which meaning Congress attached to the word in the Miller Act, we must look to the Congressional history of the statute as well as to the practical considerations underlying the Act.\n It is apparent from the hearings before the subcommittee of the House Committee on the Judiciary leading to the adoption of the Miller Act that the participants had in mind a clear distinction between subcontractors and materialmen. In opening the hearings, Representative Miller, the sponsor of the bill that became the Miller Act, stated in connection with the various proposed bills that 'we would like to have the reaction and opinion of members in reference to those bills that deal with the general subject of requiring a bond for the benefit of laborers and materialmen who deal with subcontractors on public works.' \n7\n And the authoritative committee report8 made numerous references to and distinguished among 'laborers, materialmen and subcontractors.' Similar uncontradicted statements were made in both houses of Congress when the Act was pending before them. \n9\n The fact that \n\n[322 \nU.S. 102, 110]\n\u00a0\n subcontractors were so consistently distinguished from materialmen and laborers in the course of the formation of the Act is persuasive evidence that the word 'subcontractor' was used in the proviso of Section 2(a) in its technical sense so as to exclude materialmen and laborers. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n Practical considerations underlying the Act likewise support this conclusion. Congress cannot be presumed, in the absence of express statutory language, to have intended to impose liability on the payment bond in situations where it is difficult or impossible for the prime contractor to protect himself. The relatively few subcontractors who perform part of the original contract represent in a sense the prime contractor and are well known to him. It is easy for the prime contractor to secure himself against loss by requiring the subcontractors to give security by bond, or otherwise, for the payment of those who contract directly with the subcontractors. United States, for Use of Hill, v. American Surety Co., supra, \n200 \nU.S. 204\n, 26 S.Ct. 168; Mankin v. United States for Use of Ludowici-Celadon Co., supra, \n215 \nU.S. 540\n, 30 S.Ct. 177. But this method of protection is generally inadequate to cope with remote and undeterminable liabilities incurred by an ordinary materialman, who may be a manufacturer, a wholesaler or a retailer. \n11\n Many such materialmen are usually involved in large \n\n[322 \nU.S. 102, 111]\n\u00a0\n projects; they deal in turn with innumerable sub-materialmen and laborers. To impose unlimited liability under the payment bond to those sub- materialmen and laborers is to create a precarious and perilous risk on the prime contractor and his surety. To sanction such a risk requires clear language in the statute and in the bond so as to leave no alternative. \n12\n Here the proviso of Section 2(a) of the Act forbids the imposition of such a risk, thereby foreclosing Tomkins' right to use on the payment bond.\n The judgment of the court below is reversed.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of August 24, 1935, c. 642, 49 Stat. 793; 40 U.S.C.  270a et seq., 40 U.S.C.A.  270a et seq. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Act of August 13, 1894, c. 280, 28 Stat. 278, as amended by Act of February 24, 1905, c. 778, 33 Stat. 811, 40 U.S.C.  270, 40 U.S.C.A.  270. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] In United States, for Use of Hill, v. American Surety Co., \n200 \nU.S. 197, 204\n, 26 S.Ct. 168, 170, we said, 'There is no language in the statute nor in the bond which is therein authorized limiting the right of recovery to those who furnish material or labor directly to the contractor but all persons supplying the contractor with labor or materials in the prosecution of the work provided for in the contract are to be protected. The source of the labor or material is not indicated or circumscribed. It is only required to be 'supplied' to the contractor in the prosecution of the work provided for.' This broad language, which went beyond that required by the facts and the holding in that case, might seem to justify recovery by persons supplying materials to materialmen. Such was the holding in Utah Construction Co. v. United States, 9 Cir., 15 F.2d 21. Our denial of certiorari in that case, \n273 \nU.S. 745\n, 47 S.Ct. 344, was not a determination by us of the issue, however. Compare Continental Casualty Co. v. North American Cement Corp., 67 App.D.C. 234, 91 F.2d 307, expressing the opposite opinion under an identical District of Columbia statute. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] Under the Heard Act, a single bond was required to protect both the Government and the suppliers of labor and materials. The Government was given the sole right to sue on the bond for six months after completion of the work and final settlement. Other claimants could sue only thereafter and had to join in a single action. Serious inconveniences and delays resulted. The claimants, often in need of immediate funds, were compelled to settle meritorious claims for less than the full amount. The Miller Act was designed to meet these difficulties by requiring that the prime contractor execute two bonds-a performance bond to protect the Government and a payment bond to protect the creditors. Creditors can sue on the latter bond without waiting for the Government and even without waiting for completion of the project. Each creditor may sue separately ninety days after the labor is completely performed or materials fully supplied.

KAPLAN(1944)\nNo. 307\nArgued: Decided: December 4, 1944\n\n\n\n Mr. Edward Rothbart, of Chicago, Ill., for petitioner.\n Mr. Norman H. Nachman, of Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case concerns the powers of a bankruptcy court when a claim adverse to the bankrupt estate is asserted. \n\n[323 \nU.S. 97, 98]\n\u00a0\n An involuntary petition for adjudication in bankruptcy was filed against Gold Medal Laundries on September 22, 1941. A month later the adjudication was made. On December 22, petitioner, the trustee in bankruptcy, filed with the referee a petition for an order directing the respondents to turn over certain assets, allegedly belonging to the bankrupt, which had come into possession of the respondents some fifteen months prior to the institution of the bankruptcy proceedings. Respondents' answer claimed ownership in themselves and prayed dismissal of the petition. Extensive hearings were held to determine whether the property was in the constructive possession of the bankrupt. Prior to the close of the hearings respondents orally moved that the petition be dismissed for want of summary jurisdiction and a formal motion to this effect was filed on May 19, 1942. On June 24, 1942, the referee granted this motion. The District Court reversed, whereupon the referee denied a turnover order on the merits and the District Court again reversed. Appeals from both decisions of the District Court were taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Having found that the objection to the summary jurisdiction had been timely and had not been waived, that court sustained the referee's dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. 142 F.2d 301. Conflicting views having been expressed in different circuits on matters affecting bankruptcy administration which ought not to be left in doubt, we granted certiorari. \n323 \nU.S. 691\n, 65 S. Ct. 67.\n A bankruptcy court has the power to adjudicate summarily rights and claims to property which is in the actual or constructive possession of the court. Thompson v. Magnolia Petroleum Co., \n309 \nU.S. 478, 481\n, 60 S.Ct. 628, 629. If the property is not in the court's possession and a third person asserts a bona fide claim adverse to the receiver or trustee in bankruptcy, he has the right to have the merits of his claim adjudicated 'in suits of the ordinary character, with the rights \n\n[323 \nU.S. 97, 99]\n\u00a0\n and remedies incident thereto.' Galbraith v. Vallely, \n256 \nU.S. 46, 50\n, 41 S.Ct. 415, 416; Taubel-Scott-Kitzmiller Co. v. Fox, \n264 \nU.S. 426\n, 44 S.Ct. 396. But the mere assertion of an adverse claim does not oust a court of bankruptcy of its jurisdiction. Harrison v. Chamberlin, \n271 \nU.S. 191, 194\n, 46 S.Ct. 467, 468. It has both the power and the duty to examine a claim adverse to the bankrupt estate to the extent of ascertaining whether the claim is ingenuous and substantial. Louisville Trust Co. v. Comingor, \n184 \nU.S. 18, 25\n, 26 S., 22 S. Ct. 293, 296. Once it is established that the claim is not colorable nor frivolous, the claimant has the right to have the merits of his claim passed on in a plenary suit and not summarily. Of such a claim the bankruptcy court cannot retain further jurisdiction unless the claimant consents to its adjudication in the bankruptcy court. MacDonald v. Plymouth County Trust Co., \n286 \nU.S. 263\n, 52 S.Ct. 505\n\n\n Consent to proceed summarily may be formally expressed, or the right to litigate the disputed claim by the ordinary procedure in a plenary suit, like the right to a jury trial, may be waived by failure to make timely objection. MacDonald v. Plymouth County Trust Co., supra, 286 U.S. at pages 266, 267, 52 S.Ct. at page 506. Consent is wanting where the claimant has throughout resisted the petition for a turnover order and where he has made formal protest against the exercise of summary jurisdiction by the bankruptcy court before that court has made a final order. Louisville Trust Co. v. Comingor, supra. In the Comingor case although the claimant 'participated in the proceedings before the referee, he had pleaded his claims in the outset, and he made his formal protest to the exercise of jurisdiction before the final order was entered.' Id., 184 U.S. at page 26, 22 S.Ct. at page 296. This it was held negatived consent and thereby the right to proceed summarily.\n Thus, what a bankruptcy court may do and what it may not do when a petition for a turnover order is resisted by an adverse claimant is clear enough. But whether or not \n\n[323 \nU.S. 97, 100]\n\u00a0\n there was the necessary consent upon which its power to proceed may depend is, as is so often true in determining consent, a question depending on the facts of the particular case. And so we turn to the facts of this case.\n When the trustee filed his petition for a turnover order, respondents denied any basis for such an order and asserted their adverse claim. There is no dispute about that. Before the matter went to the referee for determination, respondents explicitly raised objection to the disposition of their claim by summary procedure. They later amplified that objection by a written motion and supported it by extended argument. The established practice based on the criteria of the Comingor case was thus entirely satisfied. We reject the suggestion that respondents conferred consent by participating in the hearing on the merits. See In re West Produce Corp., 2 Cir., 118 F.2d 274, 277. In view of the referee's opinion that the hearings were held to determine whether the bankrupt had constructive possession of the property, the petitioner can hardly claim the benefit of the restricted rule which he invokes. In any event, such a view is contrary to that which was decided in Louisville Trust Co. v. Comingor, supra, which held, as we have noted, that consent is not given even though claimant 'participated in the proceedings' provided formal objection to summary jurisdiction is made before entry of the final order. And the Comingor case 'has been repeatedly cited as determinative of the law and practice in similar cases.' Galbraith v. Vallely, \n256 \nU.S. 46, 49\n, 41 S.Ct. 415, 416.\n We find no merit in other questions raised by the petitioner. But they do not call for elaboration.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","27":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOLUMBIA GAS & ELECTRIC CORP. v.

Williams and Frank W. Cottle, both of Cincinnati, Ohio, for appellant.\n Mr. L. J. Obermeier, of New York City, for appellees, American Fuel & Power Co. et al.\n Mr. Charles Fahy, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D.C., for intervener appellee, the United States.\n\n PER CURIAM.\n This is an appeal from a judgment of the District Court directly to this Court, taken under  2 of the Expediting \n\n[322 \nU.S. 379, 380]\n\u00a0\n Act of February 11, 1903, 32 Stat. 823, as amended, 15 U.S.C.  29, 15 U.S. C.A.  29. The United States, as an intervenor in the District Court and appellee here, has moved to dismiss the appeal as unauthorized by the Expediting Act.\n Separate proceedings were brought in bankruptcy in the District Court under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A.  501 et seq., for the reorganization of the three appellee debtors, American Fuel and Power Company, and two of its subsidiaries, Inland Gas Corporation and Kentucky Fuel Gas Corporation. Appellant Columbia Gas & Electric Corporation filed its proofs of claim in the reorganization proceedings as the owner and holder of stock, and of notes and bonds and open accounts of the debtors.\n The District Court, on application of the debtors' trustees, entered an order in the bankruptcy proceedings approving a proposed compromise settlement of all of appellant's claims against the debtors. On appeal by certain creditors the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed. 122 F.2d 223. It held that the facts of record disclosed that appellant Columbia's stock and money claims against the debtors had been acquired and used by it to secure control of them in violation of the Sherman and Clayton Anti-Trust Acts, 15 U.S.C.A.  1-7, 15 note, and  12 et seq. and were consequently not provable or allowable claims in a bankruptcy reorganization. It accordingly remanded the cause to the District Court with instructions that all claims against the debtor, which Columbia had acquired in violation of the federal anti-trust laws, be rejected. But its opinion pointed out that appellant had not appeared in the proceeding in the District Court for the approval of the proposed compromise and it was consequently not bound by the appellate court's findings of fact in that proceeding.\n After the remand the District Court granted the application of the United States to be allowed to intervene in the bankruptcy proceedings. The United States' petition for intervention asserted that it was concerned in arresting \n\n[322 \nU.S. 379, 381]\n\u00a0\n any action of the bankruptcy court which might tend to defeat or curtail the relief to which it might be entitled in a pending equity suit which it had brought against appellant in the District Court for Delaware. The purpose of this latter suit was to restrain appellant from violations of the anti-trust laws by the control of the debtors through the acquisition and holding of the same stock and money obligations, as are the subjects of appellant's claims in this proceeding.\n The United States, as intervenor, and certain creditors filed objections to the allowance of appellant's claims in bankruptcy. The proceedings on the claims were consolidated for hearing and after a trial in which appellant participated, the District Court found that appellant had acquired and used the subjects of its claims in the prosecution of a conspiracy to acquire control of the debtors in violation of the anti- trust laws. It gave judgment rejecting appellant's claims as not provable or allowable in bankruptcy. From this judgment appellant has taken the present appeal to this Court under  2 of the Expediting Act. It has also appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.\n Section 2 of the Expediting Act, as found in 15 U.S.C.  29, 15 U.S.C. A.  29, provides, 'In every suit in equity brought in any district court of the United States under sections 1-7 or 151 of this title (provisions of the Sherman and Clayton \n\n[322 \nU.S. 379, 382]\n\u00a0\n Acts), wherein the United States is complainant, an appeal from the final decree of the district court will lie only to the Supreme Court ....' Accordingly, to be appealable to this Court under the provisions of this section, the present proceeding must be a 'suit in equity' 'brought' in a district court 'wherein the United States is complainant'.\n The nature of the equity suit, referred to in  2 of the Expediting Act, is defined and restricted by 15 U.S.C.  4, 15 U.S.C.A.  4, which authorizes the United States to bring equity suits for enforcement of the Sherman Act. Section 4 invests the district courts with jurisdiction to 'prevent and restrain violations of sections 1-7 and 15 of this title', and makes it the duty of the United States attorneys in their districts under direction of the Attorney General 'to institute proceedings in equity to prevent and restrain such violations'. Section 25 of 15 U.S.C., 15 U.S.C.A.  25, makes provision for like suits in equity to be brought under the direction of the Attorney General to 'prevent and restrain violations' of provisions of the Clayton Act embodied in 15 U.S.C.  12, 13, 14-21, and 22-27, 15 U.S.C.A.  12, 13, 14-21, 22-27. Such a suit brought under  14 was held to be appealable directly from the district court to this Court in International Business Machines Corp. v. United States, \n298 \nU.S. 131\n, 56 S.Ct. 701\n\n\n By 15 U.S.C.  28, 15 U.S.C.A.  28 derived from  1 of the Expediting Act of 1903, it was provided that in any suit in equity brought in any district court of the United States under  1-7 or  15 of that title 'wherein the United States is complainant', the Attorney General may file in court a certificate of public importance and that thereupon such case shall be given precedence over others, shall be in every way expedited, and shall be assigned for hearing before a court of three judges selected as provided in the section. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[322 \nU.S. 379, 383]\n\u00a0\n The present is a bankruptcy proceeding, and even though a court of bankruptcy possesses and may exercise equity powers in the disposition of suits in bankruptcy, see Bankruptcy Act  2, 11 U.S.C.  11, 11 U.S.C.A.  11; Securities & Exchange Commission v. United States Realty Co., \n310 \nU.S. 434, 455\n, 60 S.Ct. 1044, 1053, and cases cited, a bankruptcy proceeding is not itself a suit in equity either by statutory definition or in common understanding. This bankruptcy proceeding is not one 'wherein the United States is complainant', nor is it brought under the anti-trust laws of the United States and we cannot say that the intervention of the United States in this proceeding has so altered it as to make it a suit in equity within the meaning of  2 of the Expediting Act.\n By its petition and intervention the United States has aligned itself with the debtors' trustees, who are asking only to have appellant's claims rejected. The United States likewise, by its petition in intervention, asked that the District Court adjudge that appellant's claims against the debtors be rejected and that appellant take nothing by them. As an intervenor the United States was limited to the field of litigation open to the original parties. Chandler & Price Co. v. Brandtjen & Kluge, Inc., \n296 \nU.S. 53\n, 57-60, 56 S.Ct. 6, 7-9. and cases cited; Vinson v. Washington Gas Light Co., \n321 \nU.S. 489\n, 64 S.Ct. 731. That position of the trustees in the proceeding for allowance of appellant's claims, conducted in conformity to the mandate of the Circuit Court of Appeals, was not that of complainants in an equity suit. The trustees did not seek in that proceeding, nor were they authorized to seek, equitable relief for the prevention of future violations. They were rather in the position of \n\n[322 \nU.S. 379, 384]\n\u00a0\n defendants resisting the claims of appellant on the ground that its claims were tainted with illegality because of its past conduct in acquiring them. No more than the trustees, could the United States be said to be a complainant in a suit in equity, such as is defined by 15 U.S.C.  4, 15 U. S.C.A.  4, 'to prevent and restrain violations' of the anti-trust laws.\n It is of some significance also that the suits in equity referred to by  2 of the Expediting Act are the suits which under 15 U.S.C.  28, 15 U.S.C.A.  28 are required, on certification of the Attorney General, to be expedited in the District Court and to be tried there by a court of three judges. But we find no intimation in  28 that there is authority for convening a district court of three judges to sit as a bankruptcy court for the trial of an issue in bankruptcy because it involves the determination of questions arising under the anti-trust laws, and we think that the United States as intervenor in a bankruptcy proceeding limited to the allowance of claims or their rejection, if found to have been acquired in violation of the anti-trust laws, could not invoke the procedure for trial of that issue by a court of three judges.\n We conclude that the order in intervention authorized the Government to urge the rejection of appellant's claims in the bankruptcy proceeding; that in so doing it was not acting as a complainant in an equity suit within the meaning of  2 of the Expediting Act, and consequently no appeal lies to this Court from the order of the District Court rejecting appellant's claims. The appeal will therefore be dismissed for want of jurisdiction of this Court to entertain it. Since appellant has also taken an appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals, we need not exercise our supervisory power to vacate the judgment below, in order to permit a proper appeal to be taken.

The compilers of the United States Code, in place of 'any of said Acts', refer only to  1-7 and 15 of Title 15 of the Code. It is not apparent why  15 is included, since it provides for the recovery of treble damages for violation of the anti-trust laws, and since the United States is not authorized by the section to maintain such a suit. See United States v. Cooper Corp., \n312 \nU.S. 600\n, 61 S.Ct. 742. It is probable that the compilers of the Code intended to refer to 15 U.S.C.  25, 15 U.S. C.A.  25, which is  15 of the Clayton Act and which is discussed in the text of this opinion. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] By Act of April 6, 1942,  1, 56 Stat. 198, 15 U.S.C.A.  28, this section was amended so as to include 'any civil action' brought in a district court under the anti-trust laws in which the United States 'is plaintiff'. Congress, insofar as it may have extended the procedure for a trial by a district court of three judges to proceedings other than suits in equity, has nevertheless left unamended  2 of the Expediting Act, which restricted direct appeals to the Supreme Court to suits in equity wherein the United States is complainant. \n\n\n\n\n","28":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. HARMON(1944)\nNo. 33\nArgued: Decided: November 20, 1944\n\n\n\n Rehearing Denied Dec. 18, 1944\n\n\n See \n323 \nU.S. 817\n, 65 S.Ct. 310.\n Mr. Samuel O. Clark, Jr., Asst. Atty. Gen., for petitioner.\n Mr. Villard Martin, of Tulsa, Okl., and Mr. L. Karlton Mosteller, of Oklahoma City, Okl., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question posed by this case is whether, upon a state's adoption of an optional community property law, a husband and wife who elect to come under that law are entitled thereafter to divide the community income equally between them for purposes of federal income tax.\n July 29, 1939, Oklahoma adopted a community property law, 32 O.S.1941  51 et seq., operative only if and when husband and wife \n\n[323 \nU.S. 44, 45]\n\u00a0\n elect to avail of its provisions. In conformity to the requirements of the statute, the respondent and his wife filed, October 26, 1939, a written election to have the law apply to them. From November 1 to December 31, 1939, they received income consisting of his salary, dividends from his stocks, dividends from her stocks, interest on obligations due him, distribution of profits of a partnership of which he was a member, and oil royalties due to each of them. The Act constitutes all of these receipts community income. The taxpayer and his wife filed separate income tax returns for 1939 in which each reported one half of the November and December income. The Commissioner determined a deficiency in the view that the respondent was taxable on all of the income derived from his earnings and from his separate property, but on none of that derived from his wife's separate property.\n The Tax Court sustained the method adopted by the respondent and his wife. 1 The Circuit Court of Appeals, one judge dissenting, affirmed the decision. 2 Both courts relied on Poe v. Seaborn, \n282 \nU.S. 101\n, 51 S.Ct. 58. They concluded that, after election to take the benefit of the law, the wife became vested with one half of all community income as therein defined. And, since this court held in Poe v. Seaborn that the community income there involved was, as to one half, the income 'of' the wife within the intent of what is now Sec. 11 of the Internal Revenue Code, 3 because she had an original and not a derivative vested property interest therein, it must follow that, under the Oklahoma law, one half of the income is the wife's for income tax purposes. They overruled the petitioner's contention that, as the statute permits voluntary action which effects a transfer of rights of the husband and wife, the case is \n\n[323 \nU.S. 44, 46]\n\u00a0\n governed by Lucas v. Earl, \n281 \nU.S. 111\n, 50 S.Ct. 241, and other decisions of like import. \n4\n We hold that the petitioner's view is the right one.\n Under Lucas v. Earl an assignment of income to be earned or to accrue in the future, even though authorized by state law and irrevocable in character, is ineffective to render the income immune from taxation as that of the assignor. On the other hand, in those states which, by inheritance of Spanish law, have always had a legal community property system, which vests in each spouse one half of the community income as it accrues, each is entitled to return one half of the income as the basis of federal income tax. Communities are of two sorts,-consensual and legal. A consensual community arises out of contract. It does not significantly differ in origin or nature from such a status as was in question in Lucas v. Earl, where by contract future income of the spouses was to vest in them as joint tenants. In Poe v. Seaborn, supra, the court was not dealing with a consensual community but one made an incident of marriage by the inveterate policy of the State. In that case the court was faced with these facts: The legal community system of the States in question long antedated the Sixteenth Amendment and the first Revenue Act adopted thereunder. Under that system, as a result of State policy, and without any act on the part of either spouse, one half of the community income vested in each spouse as the income accrued and was, in law, to that extent, the income of the spouse. The Treasury had consistently ruled that the Revenue Act applied to the property systems of those States as it found them and consequently husband and wife were entitled each to return one half the community income. The Congress was fully conversant of these rulings and the practice thereunder, was asked to alter the provisions of \n\n[323 \nU.S. 44, 47]\n\u00a0\n later revenue acts to change the incidence of the tax, and refused to do so. In these circumstances, the court declined to apply the doctrine of Lucas v. Earl.\n In Oklahoma, prior to the passage of the community property law, the rules of the common law, as modified by statute, represented the settled policy of the State concerning the relation of husband and wife. A husband's income from earnings was his own; that from his securities was his own. The same was true of the wife's income. Prior to 1939, Oklahoma had no policy with respect to the artificial being known as a community. Nor can we say that, since that year, the State has any new policy, for it has not adopted, as an incident of marriage, any legal community property system. The most that can be said is that the present policy of Oklahoma is to permit spouses, by contract, to alter the status which they would otherwise have under the prevailing property system in the State.\n Such legislative permission cannot alter the true nature of what is done when husband and wife, after marriage, alter certain of the incidents of that relation by mutual contract. Married persons in many noncommunity states might, by agreement, make a similar alteration in their prospective rights to the fruits of each other's labors or investments, as was done in Lucas v. Earl. This would seem to be possible in every State where husband and wife are permitted freely to contract with each other respecting property thereafter acquired by either.\n Much of counsel's argument is addressed to specific features of the Oklahoma community property law and comparison of those features with the laws of the traditional community property States. We lay this aside and assume that, once established, the community property status of Oklahoma spouses is at least equal to that of man and wife in any community property State with whose law we were concerned in Poe v. Seaborn. To cite \n\n[323 \nU.S. 44, 48]\n\u00a0\n examples: We think it immaterial, for present purposes, that the community status may or may not be altered by contract between the parties, may or may not be avoided by antenuptial agreements, or that certain assets of a spouse may or may not be classed as 'separate' property excluded from the community. The important fact is that the community system of Oklahoma is not a system, dictated by State policy, as an incident of matrimony.\n Our decisions in United States v. Robbins, \n269 \nU.S. 315\n, 46 S.Ct. 148, and in United States v. Malcolm, \n282 \nU.S. 792\n, 51 S.Ct. 184, do not, as respondent argues, require an affirmance of the judgment. Those cases dealt with the community property law of California. The receipt of community property came to California from the Spanish law, as it did in other States whose territory had once been a part of the Spanish possessions on this continent. There had been a series of decisions in California with respect to the character of the wife's rights in the community. The courts had at times indicated that this was a vested property right and on other occasions had indicated that all the wife had was a mere expectancy which ripened on the death of the husband. Prior to the decision in the Robbins case the Supreme Court of the State had finally ruled that her interest was of the latter sort. The Treasury had taken the same view and had denied California spouses the privilege of each returning one-half of the community income. In view of the decision of the Supreme Court of California this court sustained the Treasury's ruling in the Robbins case. This was in spite of the fact that over a period of years the legislature of California had adopted statutes which indicated that the wife's interest was in fact more than a mere expectancy. In 1927 the California legislature, in an effort to settle this controversy of long standing, adopted a statute declaring that the wife's interest in the community was a present vested interest. Then came the Malcolm case in which the Circuit Court of Appeals \n\n[323 \nU.S. 44, 49]\n\u00a0\n for the Ninth Circuit certified to this court two questions: First, whether in view of the law of California the husband must return the entire income, and, second, whether the wife, under the Act of 1927, had such an interest in the community income that she should separately reprot and pay tax on one half thereof. In a per curiam opinion this court answered the first question 'No' and the second question 'Yes.' Two circumstances must be borne in mind in connection with that decision. The incidents of the system had been the subject of litigation for years. The final action of the legislature could well be taken as declaratory of what it involved and implied as respects the interests of husbands and wives. Thus the court was not required to meet any such question as is presented here by the permissive initiation of community property status. In addition, inspection of the briefs and of the report will show that the court's action was bottomed on a concession by the Government that 'with respect to the particular income here in question, the interests of the husband and wife were such as to bring the case within the rulings' in Poe v. Seaborn, and related cases 'because of amendments of the California statutes made since United States v. Robbins, \n269 \nU.S. 315\n, 46 S.Ct. 148, was decided.' It is apparent, therefore, that our decisions dealing with California law do not answer the question presented in this case.\n The judgment is reversed.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice BLACK concurs, dissenting.\n The federal income tax law makes a discrimination in favor of the community property states. In 1937 the Secretary of the Treasury pointed out1 that \n\n[323 \nU.S. 44, 50]\n\u00a0\n 'A New York resident with a salary of $100,000 pays about $32,525 Federal income tax; a Californian with the same salary may cause one-half to be reported by his wife and the Federal income taxes payable by the two will be only $18,626. The total loss of revenue due to this unjustifiable discrimination against the residents of 40 States runs into the millions.' That discrimination has become increasingly sharp as surtax rates have increased. \n2\n The source of that discrimination is to be found in decisions of this Court.\n Those decisions3 are best illustrated by Poe v. Seaborn, \n282 \nU.S. 101\n, 51 S.Ct. 58, which involved the community property system of the State of Washington. They held that the husband need pay the federal income tax on only one-half of his salary and other income from the community, since the other half of those earnings from their very inception belonged to his wife. The collector had argued that the control exercised by the husband over the community was sufficient to make him liable for the tax on the full amount. That result had indeed been indicated by Mr. Justice Holmes speaking for the Court in United States v. Robbins, \n269 \nU.S. 315, 327\n, 46 S.Ct. 148, 149. And it has been strongly urged that our recent decisions-such as Helvering v. Clifford, \n309 \nU.S. 331\n, 60 S.Ct. 554, and Harrison v. Schaffner, \n312 \nU.S. 579\n, 61 S.Ct. 759-make for the same result. \n4\n But in Poe v. Seaborn and related cases the Court discarded that test. It was more concerned with legal doctrine than it was with economic realities. It held that the wife's interest in the com- \n\n[323 \nU.S. 44, 51]\n\u00a0\n munity (including the husband's salary) was 'vested'5 and that therefore the husband need pay the federal income tax on only half of that income.\n One dubious decision does not of course justify another. But if Texas can reduce the husband's income tax by creating in his wife a 'vested' interest in half his salarly and other income, I fail to see why its neighbor, Oklahoma, may not do the same thing. The Court now concedes that once established, the community property status of Oklahoma spouses is at least equal to that of man and wife in any community property state. How then can Oklahoma be denied the same privilege which other community property states enjoy?\n It is said that the elective feature of the Oklahoma statute causes it to run afoul of Lucas v. Earl, \n281 \nU.S. 111\n, 50 S.Ct. 241, which held that an assignment of income to be earned or to accrue in the future was ineffective to render the income immune from taxation as that of the assignor. But the Court was not troubled with Lucas v. Earl in Poe v. Seaborn. It disposed of that argument by saying that in Lucas v. Earl the 'very assignment' was bottomed on the fact that 'the earnings would be the husband's property, else there would have been nothing on which it could operate. That case presents quite a different question from this, because here, by law, the earnings are never the property of the husband, but that of the community.' 282 U.S. at page 117, 51 S.Ct. at page 61. (Italics added.) By the same reasoning we should say that Oklahoma has made these earnings the 'property' of the community once the written election \n\n[323 \nU.S. 44, 52]\n\u00a0\n has been filed and that income which accrues thereafter never becomes the sole 'property' of the husband. Indeed we have the word of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma that such a transfer was effected by the written election filed by the husband and wife in this case. Harmon v. Oklahoma Tax Commission, 189 Okl. 475, 118 P.2d 205. There is no suggestion that the transfer of 'property' interests in this case is any less genuine or effective than it was in Poe v. Seaborn. The written election once filed is irrevocable. Only death or a decree of absolute divorce can alter it. Okl.Stat.Ann.1941, Title 32,  51. If as Poe v. Seaborn holds the crucial circumstance is whether the income as it accrues is the 'property' of the community, it should make no difference for federal income tax purposes that the transfer from the husband to the community was effected by the act of filing a written election rather than by the act of marriage. If, 'by law, the earnings are never the property of the husband, but that of the community' (Poe v. Seaborn, supra, 282 U.S. at page 117, 51 S.Ct. at page 61), the husband should fare no better in Washington or Texas or California than in Oklahoma. The source of the 'law' which determines whether or not that result obtains is the same in each case-the legislature and the judiciary of the particular state. If they declare that the husband has lost and the wife acquired a 'property' interest by a certain act (whether by marriage, or by the filing of a paper), it is the 'law' though it is a recent pronouncement and not an 'inveterate' and long standing rule of that particular state. The consequence under the federal income tax statute is of course for us to decide. My only point is that if that is the formula for some states it should be the formula for all. We should apply it equally and without discrimination or we should discard it completely.\n But it is said that the filing of a written election under the Oklahoma statute is an 'anticipatory arrangement' \n\n[323 \nU.S. 44, 53]\n\u00a0\n for the disposition of income under the rule of Lucas v. Earl; that a 'consensual' community will not be recognized for federal income tax purposes but that a 'legal' community will. As the Tax Court, however, pointed out (1 T.C. 40, 49) such a distinction will not stand scrutiny. Community property created by marriage is the effect of a contract. 6 It is the result of a consensual act. The same is true where husband and wife agree to leave Oklahoma and establish their domicile in Texas so as to gain the advantages of a community property system. I can see no difference in substance whether the state puts its community property system in effect by one kind of contract or another. One is as much 'legal' as another. The agreement to marry or the agreement to move from Oklahoma to Texas is as 'consensual' as the act of filing a written election under the Oklahoma statute.\n But if a distinction is taken between a 'legal' and a 'consensual' community, it cannot be consistently maintained for federal income tax purposes. In the first place, even the distinction which the Court seeks to take between this case and Poe v. Seaborn vanishes when after-acquired property is considered. Let us assume there is property first acquired in Oklahoma after the written election has been filed7 and in Washington after marriage. How are we justified in saying that Lucas v. Earl makes the written election but not the marriage an anticipatory arrangement affecting the income from that after-acquired property? Oklahoma is as explicit as Washington in saying \n\n[323 \nU.S. 44, 54]\n\u00a0\n that property so acquired by the husband 'shall be deemed the community or common property of the husband and wife and each, subject to the provisions of this Act, shall be vested with an undivided one-half interest therein.' Okl.Stat.Ann.1941, Title 32,  56. In both cases the husband never was and never could be the sole owner of that property if local law is to be the guide. His 'status' under Oklahoma law is as fixed and irrevocable as it is under Washington law. How can it be said that after-acquired property is governed by 'status' in one case and by 'contract' in the other? If such a distinction is drawn, we are indeed making income tax liability turn on 'elusive and subtle casuistres'. Cf. Helvering v. Hallock, \n309 \nU.S. 106, 118\n, 60 S.Ct. 444, 450, 125 A.L.R. 1368. In the second place, the Tax Court pointed out in this case that the difference 'between a community property law which is operative only when expressly invoked and one which operates unless expressly revoked' (1 T.C. at page 46) has no practical basis. There may be a 'consensual' community within a so-called 'legal' community. In some of the so-called 'legal' community property states separate property of one spouse may be converted by contract or deed into community property or vice versa. Volz v. Zang, 113 Wash. 378, 194 P. 409; State ex rel. Van Moss v. Sailors, 180 Wash. 269, 39 P.2d 397; Kenney v. Kenney, 220 Cal. 134, 136, 30 P.2d 398. But see Kellett v. Kellett, 23 Tex.Civ.App. 571, 56 S.W. 766; McDonald v. Lambert, 43 N.M. 27, 85 P.2d 78, 120 A.L.R. 250. And it has been supposed since Poe v. Seaborn that income from that type of community property was not thereafter to be treated as the separate property of the spouse who originally owned it. See 3 Mertens, The Law of Federal Income Taxation (1942)  19.29. That has been the consistent view8 both \n\n[323 \nU.S. 44, 55]\n\u00a0\n of the courts (Black v. Commissioner, 9 Cir., 114 F.2d 355) and of the Tax Court. Shoenhair v. Commissioner, 45 B.T.A. 576, 579; Harmon v. Commissioner, 1 T.C. 40, 46, 47. And that has been the Treasury position. G.C.M. 19248, Int. Rev. Bull., Cum. Bull. 1937-2, p. 59. If Poe v. Seaborn states the correct rule, that view seems irrefutable. Community property is no less created 'by law' whether it was created by the contract of marriage or by a post-nuptial agreement.\n But are we now to understand that postnuptial agreements in all community property states are ineffective for federal income tax purposes because they are 'consensual'? Or is the Court willing to give income tax effect to such contracts only within the established community property states? If it is the former, then we are overriding settled administrative construction on which great reliance was placed in Poe v. Seaborn, 282 U.S. at page 116, 51 S.Ct. at page 61, 75 L.Ed 239. If it is the latter, then we can hardly say that the difference between the Oklahoma system and the Washington system is that Washington has created its system 'as an incident of matrimony' while Oklahoma has not. In that event we make unmistakably plain the discrimination against Oklahoma-we give income tax effect to a post-nuptial agreement between spouses in eight states and deny effect to a similar agreement in Oklahoma. The only apparent basis for such discrimination is that the community property systems in the eight states are traditional; that those eight states have a well settled policy; that Oklahoma merely gives its citizens a choice to get under or stay out of its community property system. Yet how can we say that the state which allows husband and wife to revoke or alter its community property system by \n\n[323 \nU.S. 44, 56]\n\u00a0\n contract has a more 'settled' policy towards community property than a state which gives husband and wife the choice to invoke its community property system or to keep their marital property on a common law basis? The truth is that there is a wide range of choice in each. But the fact that there is a choice should not be deemed fatal when Oklahoma's case comes before the Court and irrelevant when Washington's case is here.\n The distinctive feature of the community property system is that the products of the industry of either spouse are attributed to both; the husband is never the sole 'owner' of his earnings; his wife acquires a half interest in them from their very inception. 1 de Funiak, Principles of Community Property (1943)  239. That was the test which Poe v. Seaborn adopted. If Oklahoma meets that test, then she should be treated on a parity with her sister states. The fact that her system is new-born9 does not make it any the less genuine.\n I do not mean to defend Poe v. Seaborn. I only say that if we are to stand by it, we should not allow it to become a 'vested' interest of only a few of the states. The truth of the matter is that Lucas v. Earl and Helvering v. Clifford on the one hand and Poe v. Seaborn on the other state competing theories of income tax liability. Or to put it another way, Poe v. Seaborn has been carved out as an exception to the general rules of liability for income taxes. If we are to create such exceptions we should do so uniformly. We should not allow the rationale of Poe v. Seaborn to be good for one group of states and for one group only. If we are to abandon the \n\n[323 \nU.S. 44, 57]\n\u00a0\n rationale of Poe v. Seaborn, we should do so openly and avowedly. If the practical consequences of applying the rationale of Poe v. Seaborn to other situations would be disastrous to federal finance, it is time to reexamine the case. The rule which it fashions is the rule of this Court. We have the responsibility for its creation. If we adhere to it, we should apply it without discrimination. If we are not to apply it equally to all states, we should be rid of it. This is the time to face the issue squarely. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] T.C. 40. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 10 Cir., 139 F.2d 211. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] 26 U.S.C.  11, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev. Code,  11.

UNITED STATES(1944)\nNo. 384\nArgued: Decided: April 3, 1944\n\n\n\n\n[321 \nU.S. 634, 635]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Robert S. Erskine, of New York City, for appellant.\n Mr. Robert L. Pierce, of Washington, D.C., for appellees United States and Interstate Commerce Commission.\n Mr. Christopher E. Heckman, of New York City, for appellee National Water Carriers Ass'n, Inc.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Cornell operates tugboats for hire on the Hudson River and in and about New York harbor. Its tugs carry no cargo but move scows, barges, and similar vessels belonging to others which themselves usually carry cargo. This towing service Cornell offers to perform for the public in general. About ninety-five per cent of the vessels which it serves are moved from points in New York to other points in the same State, but these movements generally traverse New Jersey as well as New York waters. Part III of the Interstate Commerce Act1 provides that contract or common carriers by water in interstate commerce are subject to the Act's regulating provisions. In appropriate proceedings the Interstate Commerce Commission held Cornell's business covered. Cornell Steamboat Co. Contract Carrier Application, 250 I.C.C. 301; Id., 250 \n\n[321 \nU.S. 634, 636]\n\u00a0\n I.C.C. 577. A three judge District Court sustained the Commission's order. 53 F.Supp. 349. The case is here on direct appeal. 28 U.S.C.  47a, 345, 28 U.S.C.A.  47a, 345.\n First. Cornell argues that its towboats are not 'water carriers' within the meaning of Part III of the Act. Looking at Part III, we find that, read together,  302(c), (d) and (e) define a 'water carrier' as any person who engages in the 'transportation by water ... of ... property ... for compensation.' Section 302(h) defines 'transportation' as including 'all services in or in connection with transportation', as well as 'the use of any transportation facility.' Any 'vessel', which means any 'watercraft',  302(f), is such a facility.  302(g). Congress has thus carefully and explicitly set out the conditions which in combination describe the kinds of carriers it intended to subject to regulation. Cornell's tugboats fall squarely within the description. If further proof of this be needed,  303(f) (1) and (2) expressly exempt from regulation under Part III certain types of towage service, but not that such as Cornell provides. Congress hardly would have exempted some towers, as it did in these sections, had it intended to exempt all towers.\n Nevertheless, Cornell argues that the Act's language, which appears on its face plainly to include transportation by means of towers, should not be so construed. In support of this contention, it is said that towers do not have that common law or statutory liability to shippers which generally attaches to common carriers, see Sun Oil Co. v. Dalzell Towing Co., Inc., \n287 \nU.S. 291\n, 53 S.Ct. 135; cf. The Murrell, D.C., 200 F. 826; and that a 'carrier' has been judicially defined as one who undertakes to transport the goods of another, a definition not inclusive of Cornell, since it does not make contracts to carry goods but only to move vessels which have goods on them. See Sacramento Nav. Co. v. Salz, \n273 \nU.S. 326, 328\n, 47 S.Ct. 368, 369; The Propeller Niagara, etc., v. Cordes, 62 U.S. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 634, 637]\n\u00a0\n 7, 22. But the authorities relied upon by Cornell are of little or no assistance here. The case at bar does not require that we determine at large the legal obligations of a tower or define the usual characteristics of a carrier. We are called upon only to interpret a single Act of Congress. With unquestioned power to regulate Cornell's business, Congress in this Act has given its own definition to Cornell's activities in words literally inclusive of those activities, and which operate to subject to the Act interstate activities in the business of towing, which at common law was a common calling. Sproul v. Hemmingway, 14 Pick., Mass., 1, 6, 25 Am.Dec. 350. The Act in which Congress has included this definition is designed, not to determine the legal status of vessels for all purposes,2 but to provide for regulation of the rates and services of competing interstate water carriers as part of a broad plan of regulation for all types of competing interstate transportation facilities. Cornell is in active competition with other types of interstate water carriers as well as with trucks and railroads. Therefore, if Cornell's particular method of providing water transportation facilities for others is not subject to regulation under the Act, it would appear to present an anomalous exception to the Congressional plan for regulation of competing transportation activities. We conclude that the language of the Act brings Cornell's business within its coverage, and that to construe the Act otherwise would frustrate the purpose of Congress.\n Second. Cornell argues that even if it is covered by Part III of the Act, there was error in holding it to be a 'common' rather than a 'contract' carrier. Section 302 \n\n[321 \nU.S. 634, 638]\n\u00a0\n (d) defines a 'common carrier' as one 'which holds itself out to the general public to engage in the transportation by water ... of ... property ... for compensation.' The Commission found from evidence offered that Cornell did so hold itself out to the general public. Upon review the District Court held the Commission's finding was supported by substantial evidence. The opinions of the Commission and the District Court showed the evidence relied on and it is unnecessary to repeat it here. Sufficient it is to say that we agree with the District Court's conclusion.\n Third. The five per cent of Cornell's business which consists of moving vessels between New York and New Jersey ports is unquestionably covered by the Act, because  302(i)(1) specifically includes transportation 'wholly by water from a place in a State to a place in any other State.' \n3\n But about ninety-five per cent of the vessels towed by Cornell are picked up at New York ports and pulled to other ports in the same State. Cornell contends that none of these movements come within the Commission's jurisdiction. We accept findings of the Commission and the District Court that at least a substantial proportion of these latter movements regularly and ordinarily pass over New Jersey territorial waters. While moving on New Jersey waters, Cornell's vessels are not \n\n[321 \nU.S. 634, 639]\n\u00a0\n at that time at 'a place' in New York. Certain of its towing activities therefore actually move vessels from places in New York to places in New Jersey and thence back to places in New York. Such movements, if made on land by rail carriers, would be classified as interstate for regulatory purposes under previous decisions of this Court;4 and, as the Commission's opinion points out, these decisions have cast grave doubts upon the power of a single state to regulate such movements in whole or in part. Water transportation between two ports of a single state may touch many other states, and pass through hundreds of miles of other states' waters, far removed from the state in which the terminal ports of the voyage are located. Power of the Commission to regulate such movements appears to come well within the broad purposes declared by Congress in passing legislation designed comprehensively to coordinate a national system of all types of transportation. We are unpersuaded that Congress has inadvertently left such a gap in its plan as acceptance of Cornell's argument would create.\n The pertinent language Congress used in defining what should be interstate commerce in Part III of the Act reg- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 634, 640]\n\u00a0\n ulating water carriers is to all practical intents and purposes the same as it used in Part I regulating rail carriers. 5 Part III of the Act, including this definition, first was drafted in the House Committee on Interstate Commerce as part of a general revision of an omnibus transportation bill (S. 2009) proposed by the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce. See H.R. No. 1217, 76th Cong., 1st Sess. In reporting on the provisions of Part III, the House Committee, a body well acquainted with transportation legislation, made the statement that, 'Most of the regulatory provisions included in the new part III were modeled on provisions of part I dealing with the same subject.' Id., p. 18. At the time to this reports, the definition of interstate commerce in Part I upon which that in Part III was modeled had long before been interpreted both by the Commission and the courts as broad enough to cover railroad movements which pass through the territory of two states, even though the freight be carried from a place in one state to another place in the same state. Missouri Pac. R. Co. v. Stroud, \n267 \nU.S. 404\n, 45 S.Ct. 243.6\n Parts I, II, and IV of the Interstate Commerce Act, relating respectively to regulation of rail carriers, motor carriers, and freight forwarders, explicitly or by judicial interpretation cover all shipments which pass through the territory of two or more states even though both terminal points are in the same state. \n7\n And so if railroads or truck- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 634, 641]\n\u00a0\n ers should use tugs for the same purposes and over the same route as Cornell the movements would be interstate under the Act and subject to regulation by the Commission; and apparently the same is true of freight forwarders. From the language of Part III of the Act, its history, and its general purpose, we conclude that the Commission and District Court correctly decided Cornell's transportation through New York and New Jersey waters also is subject to regulation by the Commission. \n8\n\u00a0\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER, dissenting in part.\n When in 1940 Congress provided for the regulation of water carriers in interstate and foreign commerce, it defined 'transportation in interstate ... commerce' for \n\n[321 \nU.S. 634, 642]\n\u00a0\n the purpose of such regulation to mean 'transportation of persons or property-(1) wholly by water from a place in a State to a place in any other State, whether or not such transportation takes place wholly in the United States.'  302(i)(1) of the Transportation Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 898, 929, 49 U.S.C.  902(i)(1), 49 U.S.C.A.  902(i)(1). To the extent that the decision of the Court construes the field of regulation thus defined by Congress to include tugboats moving on the Hudson River from place to place in New York simply because they leave the New York boundary of the river and navigage on what are deemed Jersey waters, I dissent. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 634, 643]\n\u00a0\n The problem is here, as it was before the Commission, for the first time. And the Court's duty of construction is not aided by the light of continuous administrative practice, though of course even the initial conclusion by the Commission on such a question of law should have its weight. But since the matter ultimately turns on general considerations regarding the manner in which legislation should be construed, I deem it appropriate to add a few words to the views expressed by Commissioner Splawn that Part III of the Interstate Commerce Act does not bring within the regulatory powers of the Interstate Commerce Commission transportation on a boundary stream between points in the same State merely because a water carrier crosses a state boundary in a stream.\n The terms by which Congress conferred jurisdiction upon the Commission successively over rail carriers, motor carriers and water carriers are different. In a field so well trodden as this, involving as it does the distribution of authority as between States and Nation over transportation facilities of interest to both governments, one would suppose that only the environment of legislation and the history of its enactment could dislodge the natural assumption that different literary roads taken by Congress had different objectives. For we are here concerned with three different definitions having different genealogies in the general field of regulation incorporated in one piece of legislation, namely the Transportation Act of 1940. There is nothing in the legislative history of the extent of the power over transportation by water carriage committed to the Commission to show that Congress meant that the phrasing which it employed was in purpose to be identic with the different phrasings Congress used as to rail and motor carriers. The legislative history indicates the contrary.\n The Cullom Act of 1887, as is well known, was in direct response to Wabash, etc., R. Co. v. People of State of Illinois, 118 \n\n[321 \nU.S. 634, 644]\n\u00a0\n U.S. 557, 7 S.Ct. 4. That decision rested fundamentally on the view that rail transportation has a physical unity and to such an extent that, as held very early, regulation of rail rates cannot be 'split up' between two States or left only to one State even as to transportation which begins and ends in the same State but passes through the territory of another. See Hanley v. Kansas City Southern R. Co., \n187 \nU.S. 617\n, 23 S. Ct. 214. The terms in which Congress granted regulatory power over railroads to the Interstate Commerce Commission reflected this view. The Commission was authorized to regulate rail transportation 'from one State ... to any other State', but the provisions of the Act were not to apply 'to the transportation ... wholly within one State ....'  1 of the Act to Regulate Commerce, 24 Stat. 379, 49 U.S.C.  1(1), (2)(a), 49 U.S.C.A.  1(1), (2)(a). When Congress in 1935 brought motor carriers within the regulatory powers of the Commission, it was not content to define the scope of the transportation to be regulated in terms of the scope of the regulated railroad transportation. It defined the motor transportation to be regulated to include 'commerce between any place in a State and any place in another State or between places in the same State through another State.'  203(a)(10) of the Motor Carrier Act of 1935, 49 Stat. 543, 544, 49 U.S.C.  303(a)(10), 49 U.S.C.A.  303(a)(10). It used this explicit and precise language because the conditions of motor transportation in relation to state control differ from the conditions of interstate railroad transportation, and it wished to leave no doubt whatever that it was regulating rates on motor transportation within the same State through another. The same explicitness was again used by Congress when in 1942 it swept freight forwarders who serve interstate transportation within federal control.  402(a)(6), 56 Stat. 284, 285, 49 U.S.C. (Supp. 1942)  1002(a)(6), 49 U.S.C.A.  1002(a)(6).\n A totally different situation was presented to Congress by the heavy water traffic on boundary stremas through- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 634, 645]\n\u00a0\n out the country. In his report as Federal Coordinator of Transportation, the late Commissioner Eastman pointed out that thirty-two States had laws regulating water transportation 'on inland waters and in some instances on bordering streams or lakes and coastal waters.' Sen. Doc. No. 152, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 158. This Court, in Port Richmond Ferry & Berry Point v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of Hudson County, \n234 \nU.S. 317\n, 34 S.Ct. 821, had occasion to call attention to this lively water traffic which, throughout our history, presented 'a situation essentially local, requiring regulation according to local conditions.' 234 U.S. at page 332, 34 S.Ct. at page 826. For that reason it sustained State regulation of ferry rates even for transportation from one State to another. 1 The doctrine of Hanley v. Kansas City Southern R. Co., supra, is thus a doctrine applicable to railroads and has not been applied to water carriers. See Wilmington Transp. Co. v. Railroad Comm. of California, \n236 \nU.S. 151, 155\n, 156 S., 35 S.Ct. 276, 278, 279.\n In 1940 Congress did undertake to regulate water transportation. But in view of the different ways in which rail, motor and water transportation are entangled with state interests and therefore state authority, it becomes vital to heed the exact language in which Congress expressed its purpose of regulation and the manner in which it finally passed the provisions by which it defined the Commission's authority. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 634, 646]\n\u00a0\n In a word, the bill as enacted was in quite a different form from the bill as originally introduced. As the bill came out of the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce and as passed by the Senate it had this provision: 'the term 'interstate commerce' means transportation ... from a place in one State ... to a place in another State ... or between places in the same State by a route or routes passing beyond the borders of said State ....' 84 Cong.Rec. 5964. This was not merely a choice of language but a choice of purpose. The Committee and the Senate, that is, asserted a control as extensive as that which Congress asserted in 1935 over motor carriers. The practical result of the purpose thus manifested was to exclude state control over water carriers from port to port in the same State but entering the water of a border State. The House evidently had other views, for that provision was deleted after the Senate bill was committed to the House Committee. That Committee reported and the House passed this restrictive provision: 'The term 'interstate or foreign transportation' ... means transportation of persons or property-(1) wholly by water from a place in a State to a place in any other State, whether or not such transportation takes place wholly in the United States'. 84 Cong.Rec. 9956. The Senate receded from its formulation (H. Rep. No. 2016, 76th Cong., 3d Sess., p. 30), and the restrictive House provision became the law. But we are now told that this change from explicit assumption of jurisdiction is meaningless, and the fact that the provision in the Senate bill was left out as the bill went through the House, the Conference and to passage has precisely the same significance as though the original Senate provision had remained in it. As to this as well as other phases of water transportation, Congress circumscribed the Commission's authority and left state regulation to continue to operate as to matters \n\n[321 \nU.S. 634, 647]\n\u00a0\n which, in the case of rail and motor transportation, federal control has been asserted. Thus for instance, use of the Shreveport doctrine (see Houston E. & W.T.R. Co. v. United States, \n234 \nU.S. 342\n, 34 S.Ct. 833)-the control over state rates discriminatory against interstate rates-is explicitly denied ( 303(k), and numerous other exceptions and exemptions show 'congressional intent to confer more limited jurisdiction than has been given in the other parts of the act.' Cornell Steamboat Co. Contract Carrier Application, 250 I.C.C. 577, 586.\n No doubt, as the House Committee said, 'Most of the regulatory provisions included in the new part III were modeled on provisions of part I dealing with the same subject.' H.R. No. 1217, 76th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 18. In its context, the idea behind the phrase 'regulatory provisions' bears on how to regulate not what is regulated. And the fact that 'most' provisions were the same, not all, indicates that variations from Part I were made in Part III. When therefore we find differences in definition of the 'commerce' to be regulated between Part I and Part III, it will not do to disregard them and find identity through variation. Particularly is this true when there are practical differences to account for the variation. We must first define the field of the regulation-what 'commerce' between two points in the same State but going through another becomes federally regulated although theretofore free from state regulation as was rail transportation, and what 'commerce' is given over to federal regulation although theretofore it was within the province of state regulation as was water transportation in a situation like that under discussion. We thus have the practical differences between water- borne and land traffic, the practical problems in the distribution between state and federal power raised by water-borne traffic on boundary streams, and the actual differences in the definitions of 'commerce' in the same Act of Congress responding to \n\n[321 \nU.S. 634, 648]\n\u00a0\n these differences of fact between water-borne and land transportation. All enjoin judicial regard for these differences in the construction of the Statute.\n The definition originally proposed in the Senate bill was intended to cover all three types of carrier-rail, water and motor. Particularization in this proposed definition of transportation within one State but through a second is clear proof that the Hanley doctrine applicable to rail carriers did not carry over to water and motor carriage. When Congress finally rejected the all-inclusive definition proposed by the Senate and decided on separate definitions of the commerce to be regulated, it did so precisely because it realized that the legal situation as to the three types was not the same. This careful process of distinctive definition by Congress is now in effect held to have been a futile legislative endeavor. The all-inclusive definition in the original Senate bill which the Congress rejected this Court restores.\n A final word. We must not be unmindful that the Committees on Interstate Commerce out of which issued this legislation have a continuity of membership which makes them well versed in the problem before us: namely, how much of the constitutional power possessed by Congress for the control of utility services should in fact be committed to the Interstate Commerce Commission. (The Chairmen of the Senate and House Committees on Interstate Commerce, who had charge of the bills that became the Transportation Act of 1940, have been members of these Committees for twenty and twenty-three years respectively.) Particularly therefore when dealing with legislation coming from these Committees and in matters involving displacement of state by federal authority, we ought not to assume that Congress did not attach significance to what it said and meant to convey that which skilled language withheld. It is more respectful of Congress to attribute to it care instead of casualness. It is \n\n[321 \nU.S. 634, 649]\n\u00a0\n certainly more consonant with judicial tradition and more conducive to legislative responsibility for courts to act on that belief.\n I am therefore compelled to conclude that the Commission was not given power to regulate transportation by Cornell from one port in New York to another port in the same State.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS joins in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Transportation Act of 1940, c. 722, 54 Stat. 898, 929, 49 U.S.C.A.  901 et seq. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Compare  320(d) of Part III of the Act: 'Nothing in this part shall be construed to affect any law of navigation, the admiralty jurisdiction of the courts of the United States, liabilities of vessels and their owners for loss or damage, or laws respecting seamen, or any other maritime law, regulation, or custom not in conflict with the provisions of this part.' 49 U.S.C.  920(d), 49 U.S.C.A.  920(d), 54 Stat. 950. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] This section should be read together with  303(j) and (k) of Part III which are as follows:\n'(j) Nothing in this part shall be construed to interfere with the exclusive exercise by each State of the power to regulate intrastate commerce by water carriers within the jurisdiction of such State.\n\n'(k) Nothing in this part shall authorize the Commission to prescribe or regulate any rate, fare, or charge for intrastate transportation, or for any service connected therewith, for the purpose of removing discrimination against interstate commerce or for any other purpose.'\n\n The words 'intrastate commerce' and 'intrastate transportation' as used in these two subsections are not expressly defined in Part III. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Hanley v.

As previously stated this has been construed to include transportation starting in one state, passing through a second state, and returning to the first state. See Note 6, supra.\n Part II,  203(a)(10) of the Act defines the 'interstate commerce' by motor vehicle over which the Commission has jurisdiction as including 'commerce ... between places in the same State through another State ....' 49 U.S.C.  303(10), 49 U.S.C.A.  303(10), 49 Stat. 543, 544, as amended.\n And Part IV,  402(a)(6) defines that transportation which shall be deemed 'interstate commerce' for the purpose of regulation of freight forwarders as including 'transportation ... between points within the same State but through any place outside thereof.' 49 U.S.C.  1002(a)(6), 49 U.S.C.A.  1002(a)(6), 56 Stat. 284, 285. \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] As reported in the Senate, the original omnibus transportation bill ( S. 2009) contained a single definiton of 'interstate commerce' applicable alike to rail, motor, and water carriers. This definition embodied the holding of the Stroud case, \n267 \nU.S. 404\n, 45 S.Ct. 243, cited in our opinion by expressly including 'transportation ... between places in the same State by a route ... passing beyond the borders of said State.'  3(25), Bill S. 2009, reported to the Senate May 16, 1939. It has been suggested that the failure of the House Committee's revision of Bill S. 2009 to retain this part of the definition contained in the original bill indicates an intention that the rule of the Stroud case should not apply to water transportation. In reaching our conclusion in the present case, we have considered this suggestion and have rejected it for several reasons.\n In the first place, the House Committee's failure to retain in Part III the particular language of the definition of 'interstate commerce' in original S. 2009 is sufficiently explained by the fact, noted in the body of our opinion, that the Committee modeled Part III, not upon the provisions of original S. 2009, but upon the existing Part I of the act. And from the report of the House Committee, a body experienced in matters of transportation legislation, we may fairly infer that, in thus using the language of Part I, it had in mind the same objective as the Senate Committee which drafted the original S. 2009, namely to save 'so far as possible the existing language so that full advantage may be taken of the many interpretations, both judicial and administrative, which have been put upon the respective sections.' See S.R. No. 433, 76th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 4; and H.R. No. 1217, 76th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 18-19. Cf. McLean Trucking Co., Inc. v. United States, \n321 \nU.S. 67\n, 64 S.Ct. 370.\n Furthermore, had the experienced House Committee intended to place in Part III a definition of 'interstate commerce' different in scope from that in Part I, it hardly would have expressed such an intention by adopting substantially the identical language of Part I. But neither the House nor the Senate Committee appears to have had any such intention. As shown by their reports and the language of the bills which they drafted, the intention of both Committees, and of Congress, was to provide for regulation of the same sort of interstate water shipments as already were being regulated in the case of interstate rail shipments. See H.R. No. 1217, supra; S.R. No. 433, supra. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'It has never been supposed that because of the absence of Federal action the public interest was unprotected from extortion, and that in order to secure reasonable charges in a myriad of such different local instances, exhibiting an endless variety of circumstance, it would be necessary for Congress to act directly, or to establish for that purpose a Federal agency. ... The practical advantages of having the matter dealt with by the states are obvious, and are illustrated by the practice of one hundred and twenty-five years. And in view of the character of the subject, we find no sound objection to its continuance. If Congress at any time undertakes to regulate such rates, its action will, of course, control.' 234 U.S. at page 332, 34 S.Ct. at page 826. \n\n\n\n\n","30":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCRITES v. PRUDENTIAL INS. CO. OF AMERICA(1944)\nNo. 317\nArgued: March 1, 1944Decided: May 22, 1944\n\n\n\n Messrs. Isaac E. Ferguson and Joseph Rosenbaum, both of Chicago, Ill., for petitioners.\n Messrs. Osmer C. Ingalls and Clarence D. Laylin, both of Columbus, Ohio, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n We granted certiorari in this case to determine certain important questions concerning the proper administration of federal receiverships.\n Henry M. Crites and his wife, May R. Crites, executed mortgages in 1929 to the Prudential Insurance Company of America upon 22 parcels of adjoining farm property in \n\n[322 \nU.S. 408, 409]\n\u00a0\n Madison and Pickaway Counties, Ohio. Each mortgage, being in default, was matured by acceleration on December 30, 1931. On February 17, 1932, Prudential began 22 separate foreclosure proceedings against the Crites and Crites, Inc., the petitioner. Only the 11 proceedings relating to the 11 contiguous farms in Madison County, on which the mortgages aggregated $ 192,000, are now before us.\n An involuntary petition in bankruptcy had been filed against Henry M. Crites. Petitioner is an Ohio corporation formed by Crites' creditors in an effort to salvage something from the farms. To it had been conveyed all the properties of the Crites, including the equities of redemption. Prudential requested that a receiver be appointed to take charge of the mortgaged farms pending the termination of the foreclosure proceedings. The District Court accordingly appointed as co-receivers the respondents Simkins and Florence 'to collect the rents and proceeds of the real estate ... to operate and manage said real estate through tenants, lesses, or otherwise, to rent and lease said real estate, to pay delinquent taxes and assessments and insurance premiums, to make such repairs as may be necessary to preserve the value of the premises and to produce normal income therefrom, and to do such other acts as may be from time to time ordered by the court.' Subsequent orders authorized them to borrow money from Prudential and from the local bank to pay necessary expenses relating to the farms and to execute leases of the farms upon a share or crop rental basis.\n No answers to the foreclosure complaints were filed. In the hope that economic conditions would improve and bring about a higher sale value, the District Court allowed the receivers to operate the farms for a year before entering decrees pro confesso on May 2, 1933. By these decrees the mortgages and equities of redemption were declared foreclosed and the marshal was directed to sell each farm \n\n[322 \nU.S. 408, 410]\n\u00a0\n individually on July 1, 1933, at a public sale for cach at not less than two-thirds of the appraised value. The appraisers set the value of the 11 Madison County farms at $244,080, making $162,720 the minimum price at which they could be sold. The decree indebtedness in the 11 cases was $223, 742.32. Prudential made the sole bids at the public sale on July 1 and secured title to the 11 farms for $163,900, slightly more than the upset price. The District Court confirmed this sale on July 18.\n Prudential subsequently objected to the allowance of the receivers' claims on the ground that they were excessive. Petitioner also filed objections Hearings were held before a special master. The District Court overruled petitioner's exceptions to the special master's report and its counterclaim, amended and approved the receivers' accounts, and affirmed the special master's report. Petitioner alone appealed, the court below affirming the action of the District Court with a slight modification as to additional fees for the receivers' attorneys. 6 Cir., 134 F.2d 925.\n\n\n I.\n\n\n Petitioner's first contention is that Simkins' actions in connection with the foreclosure sales constituted a breach of his duty as a receiver and rendered him accountable for certain profits made by him and others.\n The evidence indicates that a Col. Proctor of Cincinnati was interested in purchasing the entire 11 Madison County farms as a unit and that he employed a real estate agent, Edwin Jones,1 to represent him in the matter. Several weeks before the foreclosure sales, Jones visited Simkins and told him that he understood that Simkins was one of the attorneys in the matter and that he was inter- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 408, 411]\n\u00a0\n ested in buying the farms. Simkins, in addition to being one of the co- receivers, was an attorney who had represented Prudential in other foreclosure proceedings in Ohio and who had served Jones in a professional capacity on other matters. Simkins replied that 'we are in no position to offer it right now, not in position until after the foreclosure proceedings and the Prudential Insurance Company acquires title for it, then they will be in position to offer it to anybody else trying to buy it.' Simkins agreed, however, to intercede on Jones' behalf. They then drew up a contract whereby Simkins was to assist Jones in securing title to the 11 farms from Prudential after the latter had secured title by purchase at the public sale. The compensation of Simkins was dependent upon the success of the deal. Simkins did not know at this time the name of Jones' principal or how much the principal was willing to pay for the farms as a unit. Simkins then informed petitioner's counsel and the district judge that there 'might be some parties interested' in the 11 farms as a unit, but was informed that they could not be sold as a group. It does not appear that he told counsel or the court that he had accepted employment from Jones. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n At Jones' request, Simkins conferred on June 25, 1933, with Prudential representatives concerning the possibility of purchasing the 11 farms from Prudential. No definite arrangements were then made, the representatives stating that they could not discuss terms until Prudential had bought the farms at the sale. On June 27 Jones submitted through Simkins a written offer of $249,106 to Prudential for the 11 farms, including 'the company's undivided one-half interest in the growing corn crop thereon.' The offer was witnessed by Simkins and another person and was \n\n[322 \nU.S. 408, 412]\n\u00a0\n enclosed in a letter which was addressed to one of Prudential's representatives and which was signed by Simkins. In this letter Simkins vouched for the responsibility of 'Mr. Jones' buyer.' Jones also enclosed a $3000 certified check in support of his offer. Simkins by this time clearly was aware of the identity of Jones' principal and of the terms of the offer to Prudential. But he made no effort to inform either the district judge or petitioner of these facts prior to or at the sale.\n At the public sale held by the marshal on July 1, Prudential made the sole bids and secured title to the 11 farms for a total sum of $163,900. Jones attended the sale but Col. Proctor had not authorized Jones to bid since he desired to buy only when he could be assured of securing all the 11 farms at once and when title to them was supported by a warranty deed from Prudential. Two days later, on July 3, Prudential accepted Jones' offer of $249,106.\n Prudential then moved to confirm the public sales, giving due notice to petitioner of the hearing on the motion. At this hearing on July 18, objections to the motion 'were suggested by reason of alleged commitments made by the plaintiff (Prudential) for the sale of certain of said properties, prior to public sale.' It does not appear who made these objections or whether the petitioner's counsel was present. Harrison, one of the attorneys for the receivers, thereupon orally advised the judge of the terms and amount of Jones' offer and its acceptance by Prudential. At the judge's suggestion, Harrison set forth these facts in the form of an affidavit, which was later introduced at the hearing on the receivers' accounts. The court was not informed, however, as to Simkins' participation in the matter or as to the fact that Col. Proctor was the actual purchaser of the farms. Simkins was present in the court room at this time but said nothing. The judge confirmed the sales on the same day, July 18. Soon afterwards Prudential executed a warranty deed to Col. Proctor's nom- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 408, 413]\n\u00a0\n inee, the deed reciting a consideration of $249,106 but bearing tax stamps apparently indicating a substantially greater price. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n Simkins received a total of $2,797 from Jones, nearly all of which was in payment for his aid in consummating the purchase of the farms from Prudential.\n On the basis of these facts, petitioner seeks to have Simkins surcharged with (a) all payments received by him from Jones for his assistance in consummating the resale of the farms to Col. Proctor; (b) the commission or profit received by Jones; and (c) the amount received by Prudential in excess of the decree indebtedness or, in the alternative, the amount by which the appraised value of the farms exceeded the decree indebtedness. Petitioner claims that Simkins must be surcharged with these amounts because he breached his duty as co-receiver by accepting employment from Jones in advance of the foreclosure sales to help bring about a resale of the farms from Prudential to Col. Proctor. Respondents, on the other hand, resist this claim on the ground that Simkins was appointed co-receiver only to collect the rents and to operate the farms and had no fiduciary duty with respect to the foreclsoure sales.\n It is true that Simkins' official duties as co-receiver were limited to those conferred upon him by the court and that he had no authority to sell or to cause a sale of the farms in question. The foreclosure sales were conducted by the marshal under the direct supervision of the District Court and there was no evidence that Simkins unduly influenced the actual execution of the sales in any way. It \n\n[322 \nU.S. 408, 414]\n\u00a0\n is obvious, moreover, that Simkins was bound to perform his delegated duties with the high degree of care demanded of a trustee or other similar fiduciary. He was not free to deal with the property under his control as co-receiver in such a way as to benefit himself or his associates. Any profits that might have resulted from a breach of these high standards, including the profits of others who knowingly joined him in pursuing an illegal course of action, would have to be disgorged and applied to the estate. Michoud v. Girod, 4 How. 503; Magruder v. Drury, \n235 \nU.S. 106\n, 35 S.Ct. 77; Jackson v. Smith, \n254 \nU.S. 586\n, 41 S.Ct. 200.\n But Simkins' conduct is not to be measured solely by the arbitrary dichotomy of functions relating to the conservation and liquidation of the farm properties. As a co-receiver in charge of collecting the rents and operating the farms, Simkins was also an officer or arm of the court. He was appointed to assist the court in protecting and preserving, for the benefit of all parties concerned, the properties in the court's custody pending the foreclosure proceedings. Booth v. Clark, 17 How. 322, 331; Davis v. Gray, 16 Wall. 203, 217, 218; Stuart v. Boulware, \n133 \nU.S. 78, 81\n, 10 S.Ct. 242, 243; Porter v. Sabin, \n149 \nU.S. 473, 479\n, 13 S.Ct. 1008, 1010; Atlantic Trust Co. v. Chapman, \n208 \nU.S. 360, 370\n, 371 S., 28 S.Ct. 406, 408, 409, 13 Ann.Cas. 1155. The court's authority and duties, however, covered all phases of the foreclosure proceedings. They included not only the conservation but the liquidation of the farm properties. The court had discretion to delegate these duties as it saw fit. But whatever the functional distribution, all the court officers were bound to act fairly and openly with respect to every aspect of the proceedings before the court. The mere fact that any one aspect did not fall within the delegated function of a particular court officer did not give that officer free rein to act in a secret, non-judicial manner as to that aspect. The court, as well as all the interested parties, had the right to expect that its officers would not make undisclosed private agreements, fail to reveal any \n\n[322 \nU.S. 408, 415]\n\u00a0\n pertinent information or use their official position for their own profit or to further the interests of themselves or any associates.\n It is impossible to reconcile the activities of Simkins relating to the foreclosure sales with the basic standard of conduct demanded of him as an officer of the court. One of the prime purposes of the foreclosure proceedings was to obtain enough money from the farm properties to pay in full the mortgage indebtedness, with any surplus going to the owner of the equities of redemption. All information to that end which came to Simkins or to any other court officer belonged to the court and to the parties interested in the foreclosure proceedings. Here Simkins had knowledge of a prospective purchaser of the farms who was willing to pay more than the mortgage indebtedness on the properties. Yet he made no effort to reveal this important information prior to the foreclosure sales other than to state that there 'might be some parties interested' in buying the 11 farms as a unit. He was told that the court could not order a public sale of the farms as a unit. But it is clear that the court and petitioner might well have profited if Simkins had more fully revealed to them in advance of the sales that there was a prospect of selling all 11 farms to a responsible buyer at an advantageous price. Petitioner could well have been given the opportunity to bargain directly with Col. Proctor for a private sale of the farms as a unit. \n4\n This suppression of vital information was in no way mitigated by the partial revelation of the facts at the hearing on the motion to confirm the sales to \n\n[322 \nU.S. 408, 416]\n\u00a0\n Prudential, after Prudential had accepted the resale offer, or by any subsequent knowledge obtained by petitioner. The information was most valuable prior to the foreclosure sales when the prospects were greater for successful bargaining, and it should have been divulged at that time.\n Moreover it was inconsistent with his position as an officer of the court for Simkins to make a secret arrangement with Jones to bring about, by active intervention, a resale of the properties in the custody of the court. The fact that he was not a liquidating receiver did not absolve him of the duty to act openly at all times with respect to the subject matter of the proceedings. Due regard for his official position demanded that he at least notify and obtain the approval of the court and of the interested parties before entering into an employment contract with a third party where in his compensation was dependent upon a particular bidder being successful at the foreclosure sales. This arrangement brought out in even bolder relief the reprehensibleness of Simkins' failure to disclose all the facts regarding Col. Proctor's interest in purchasing the farms. Had such facts been revealed prior to the public foreclosure sales, Prudential might not have obtained title to the farms and Simkins would not have earned any compensation under his contract with Jones. It was thus to Simkins' personal benefit not to disclose all the pertinent facts.\n Since the course taken by Simkins was one which he as an officer of the court could not legally pursue and since profits resulted to him, the law makes him accountable to the trust estate for all such profits. Cf. Magruder v. Drury, supra; Jackson v. Smith, supra. We need not speculate as to whether his conduct operated to dampen the foreclosure sales to any appreciable degree or whether the estate was in any other way injured. It is enough that his activities had a tendency to dampen the sales. For that reason alone he may be held to forfeit all profits he derived \n\n[322 \nU.S. 408, 417]\n\u00a0\n from his misconduct, regardless of whether it actually had an adverse effect or not. In this type of situation 'the incidence of a particular conflict of interest can seldom be measured with any degree of certainty.' Woods v. City National Bank & Trust Co., \n312 \nU.S. 262, 268\n, 61 S.Ct. 493, 497. Proof of profits resulting from an irregular or conflicting course of conduct is sufficient. Simkins was thus accountable for the payments received by him from Jones for his assistance in consummating the resale of the farms from Prudential to Col. Proctor. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n Under the circumstances of this case, however, Simkins was not surchargeable with the commission received by Jones, with any amount received by Prudential or with the amount by which the appraised value of the farms exceeded the decree indebtedness. We perceive no basis in this record for holding Simkins responsible for any possible misconduct on the part of Jones or Prudential or for any profits that they may have obtained thereby. We do not, of course, determine in this proceeding whether petitioner could recover any such profits in a direct action against either Jones or Prudential.\n\n\n II.\n\n\n Petitioner also claims that Simkins should be surcharged with all his receivership fees because of a fee-splitting arrangement which he made with Harrison and Ingalls, the attorneys for the co-receivers as well as for Prudential. The three agreed to pool the fees allowed \n\n[322 \nU.S. 408, 418]\n\u00a0\n them by the District Court and to divide them equally, although this arrangement apparently was not completely carried out.\n Petitioner excepted to all credits in the receivers' accounts for fees to either Simkins or Ingalls because of this arrangement. The court below allowed credit to the receivers for the $250 fees received by Harrison and Ingalls from the court as preliminary compensation and for all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the two attorneys on behalf of the estate. But all credits were denied for additional attorney fees paid to them. Petitioner objects to the failure to disallow the $250 fee allowed Simkins by the District Court and the additional $1,800 fee which he paid to himself on account of his services as co-receiver.\n A fee-splitting arrangement of this nature is clearly unenforceable and void as against public policy. Weil v. Neary, \n278 \nU.S. 160\n, 49 S.Ct. 144. But whether the parties to such a contract should be allowed any fees at all, and if so the amount thereof, are normally matters within the sound discretion of the District Court and are not reviewable except where a clear abuse of discretion is apparent. In this case, however, the fact that Simkins entered into a fee-splitting contract so patently illegal, plus the fact that he engaged in other misconduct and indiscretions incompatible with his position as an officer of the court, compel the conclusion that all fees and compensation as co-receiver should have been denied him. Cf. Woods v. City National Bank & Trust Co., supra, 312 U.S. at page 268, 61 S.Ct. at page 497.\n The judgment of the court below is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS.\n I am of the opinion that certiorari should not have been granted in this case and that the writ should be dismissed. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 408, 419]\n\u00a0\n The Circuit Court of Appeals recognized established principles in determining to what extent the respondent Simkins should be denied compensation for services by reason of his acting in inconsistent relations. That court canvassed the authorities which this court cites in its opinion and not only did not refuse to follow and apply them but, as I think, in perfect good faith, proceeded to examine and appraise the facts and circumstances in order to apply the relevant legal principles.\n There is not a suggestion of any conflict amongst the federal courts respecting the law which should govern decision nor is there any suggestion that, on an identical set of facts, any federal court has reached a result contrary to that reached by the court below. In essence, the case presents the question whether the action taken by the Circuit Court of Appeals was sufficiently drastic in the circumstances disclosed.\n I think it plain that this case falls within the category to which I referred in Bailey v. Central Vermont Ry. Co., \n319 \nU.S. 350, 354\n, 63 S.Ct. 1062, 1064. All the considerations there mentioned apply equally here. If this court is to spend its time correcting mistakes in the appraisal of facts in individual cases by courts below the performance of its essential functions, necessarily will suffer. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Jones was familiar with the 11 Madison County farms, having made an offer of $500,000 for them 'a year or more' prior to 1933 on behalf of a New York principal. Crites rejected this offer, however. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Simkins testified that the fact of his employment by Jones 'was no secret' and that 'I may have told Judge Hough. I would not have hesitated in telling him.' \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Petitioner claims that the stamps indicate that Col. Proctor paid approximately $281,000, 'presumably, $249,106 net to Prudential ... and the difference of $31,894 to Jones.' There was no proof, however, that Jones received that amount. He testified merely that he received $15,000 and an additional amount that he did not remember, from which amounts he paid Simkins. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The special master and the court below found that Col. Proctor was interested in purchasing the 11 farms as a unit only if he could obtain a warranty deed from Prudential. But there was no evidence that petitioner could not have furnished muniments of title equally satisfactory to Col. Proctor or that he would not have been satisfied with a warranty deed from petitioner. According to Jones, Col. Proctor 'said a general warranty deed from the Prudential Insurance Company was good enough for him.' \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] It is unnecessary to consider petitioner's argument relating to the sale to Prudential of the growing crops on the farm lands, inasmuch as petitioner seeks to surcharge Simkins with the same amounts as in connection with the sale of the lands and no different considerations are present. Respondents' claim that petitioner is barred from relief because of laches is without merit. Nothing in the record indicates that petitioner discovered the full facts concerning Simkins' activities until several years after the foreclosure sales. Petitioner then made timely exceptions to the receivers' accounts. \n\n\n\n\n","31":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDAVIES WAREHOUSE CO. v. BOWLES(1944)\nNo. 112\nArgued: November 18, 1943Decided: January 31, 1944\n\n\n\n Mr. Reginald L. Vaughan, of San Francisco, Cal., for petitioners.\n Mr. Nathaniel L. Nathanson, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice JACKSON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner, Davies Warehouse Company, is incorporated under the laws of California and conducts a public warehouse in Los Angeles. Its business is declared to be that of a public utility both by the Constitution of \n\n[321 \nU.S. 144, 145]\n\u00a0\n California1 and its Public Utilities Act. \n2\n The Act subjects to regulation by the Railroad Commission all warehouses which serve the public generally for compensation.  2 1\/2. New warehouses may be established only after obtaining certificates of public convenience and necessity, which the Commission may refuse or condition and may suspend or revoke at any time for cause.  50 1\/2. Petitioner must grant nondiscriminatory and equal rates to everyone, and it may not alter any existing rate or charge without permission.  19, 15. The Commission upon its own motion or upon complaint may determine 'the just, reasonable or sufficient rates' and fix the same by order.  32. Petitioner is required to make periodic reports and is subject to numerous restrictions and disabilities.  29, 51, 52, 75, 76, et seq.\n Several public warehouses, including the one before us, made application to the Commission for general rate increases. The Commission gave a public hearing in Feb- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 144, 146]\n\u00a0\n ruary 1942. From undisputed testimony it appeared that: notice of hearing had been sent to over 3,000 customers and no one appeared in opposition; rates had not been advanced since 1938; wages, however, had been advanced on four different occasions; materials and supplies and wages of clerical and supervisory employees had also increased; overall costs of operation had risen during the period 20-26 per cent. On May 12, 1942, the Commission authorized a general 15 per cent advance which, it said, 'will permit applicants to increase their rates to reimburse them in part for their added labor expense.' The permission was so conditioned, however, that the reasonableness of any particular rate could be attacked by any customer, either by way of reparation proceeding, for which the Act makes provision, or otherwise. The effective date of the new rates was set by the Commission as May 22, 1942\n\n\n In the meantime the United States Price Administrator, acting under the Emergency Price Control Act,3 on April 28, 1942 issued a General Maximum Price Regulation. The effect of the federal regulation and later amendments would have been to prohibit petitioner after July 1, 1942 from charging the rate authorized by the California Railroad Commission.\n This federal Act provides that 'nothing in this Act shall be construed to authorize the regulation of ... (2) rates charged by any common carrier or other public utility.' \n4\n\u00a0\n\n[321 \nU.S. 144, 147]\n\u00a0\n Petitioner, asserting itself to be within this exemption, made timely protest to the Price Administrator, which was denied. It then filed a complaint with the United States Emergency Court of Appeals, on which the Act confers exclusive original jurisdiction to determine the validity of regulations,5 asking it to set aside the General Maximum Price Regulations in so far as they purport to regulate its charges. The Emergency Court of Appeals dismissed the complaint. Davies Warehouse Co. v. Brown, 137 F.2d 201, 209. Importance of the construction of the Act to its administration led us to grant certiorari. 64 S.Ct. 40.\n Congress, in omitting to define 'public utility' as used in the Act, left to the Administrator and the courts a task of unexpected difficulty. Use of that term in a context of generality wears an appearance of precision which proves illusory when exact application becomes necessary. Relevant authorities and considerations are numerous and equivocal, and different plausible definitions result from a mere shift of emphasis. It may be contended that the exemption runs in favor of any business generally and traditionally regarded as a utility, irrespective of ac- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 144, 148]\n\u00a0\n tual state regulation. Or it may be urged to include any enterprise actually regulated as are utilities, regardless of traditional classification. Or it may be said to extend only to those businesses where actual utility regulation exists along with general and traditional utility character.\n The Emergency Court of Appeals weighed the conflicting factors in thorough opinions and divided as to result. \n6\n Judges Maris and Magruder gave little weight to the existence of actual regulation and held the phrase to comprehend enterprises of the general utility type, among which they thought this warehouse had no place. They held that the federal price regulation superseded that of the state, but said, 'This is one of those unfortunate cases where doubts would remain whichever way the case was decided'-a reservation we share. Chief Judge Vinson declared that this public warehouse possesses the basic indicia of a public utility and in addition has its rates fixed by an agency of the state, and under these circumstances must be considered a public utility within the meaning of the Act. He thought the state regulation should prevail over that of the Federal Price Administrator.\n In Munn v. Illinois, 1877, \n94 \nU.S. 113\n, 152, this Court recognized that the business of public warehousing is 'affected with a public interest' and that its regulation by the state is appropriate and constitutionally permissible. Cf. Budd v. New York, \n143 \nU.S. 517, 544\n, 12 S.Ct. 468, 476. Twenty-one states regulate warehouses in some respects. \n7\n Three states include warehouses in their statutory definition of \n\n[321 \nU.S. 144, 149]\n\u00a0\n public utilities,8 and eight include limited types of warehouses. \n9\n Forty- seven states have adopted the Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act, which gives warehouse receipts legal standing somewhat similar to that of a common carrier's bill of lading. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n We cannot, therefore, assume that Congress was unaware that a general statutory reference to 'public utilities' might well be taken at least in some states to comprehend public warehouses. But Congress did not see fit to employ that precision of definition which it has used when it desired to make sure that its classification of public utilities for federal purposes would depend upon the nature of their activities uninfluenced by any state policy. \n11\n Legislative history is ambiguous, and in no instance was attention directed to the particular problem presented here as to the scope of the term 'public utility.' But the phrase was used to measure inclusions as well as exemptions and it seems to have been employed in a practical rather than legalistic sense. An effort was made \n\n[321 \nU.S. 144, 150]\n\u00a0\n in the Senate to insert a provision that public utility rates should not be increased without consent of the President. \n12\n That proposal was rejected, however, and a provision was substituted which required any public utility which asked for an increase in rates to notify the President and to assent to the appearance of such agent as the President may designate to appear in behalf of the consuming public before the appropriate railroad or public utility commission, be it a state, federal, or municipal commission. \n13\n It is difficult to believe that a different scope was intended to be given to the same words in different sections of the legislation. The use of the same generic term in these different contexts indicates that it had no narrower connotation and should receive no stricter interpretation in the exemption merely because used to define an exemption.\n Legislative history is unequivocal in its showing that rates already subject to state regulation as public utility rates were not considered in need of further control. Mr. Leon Henderson, one of the authors of the bill and the first Price Administrator, gave as reasons for exempting utilities that they seemed to be under an adequate system of state regulation;14 that this was an area not likely to give difficulty or to cause, so far as could then be seen, any inflationary trend; that utilities had problems peculiar to themselves and no further regulation seemed necessary;15 \n\n[321 \nU.S. 144, 151]\n\u00a0\n and that he had found the agencies in control of utility rates 'just as earnest as we are about keeping those costs down.' \n16\n\u00a0\n\n Under these circumstances the reasonable view appears to be that Congress by the term 'public utilities' exempted those whose charges already were regulated as public utilities and hence were not probable sources of inflationary dangers. It may be and probably is the case that in its rate regulation the California Commission will take account of different factors and have different objectives than does the Federal Price Administrator. That might have appealed to Congress as a reason for not exempting utilities at all, but it hardly helps define the limits of the exemption, for that objection is as cogent against what admittedly is included as against that which is left in doubt.\n We think Congress desired to depart from the traditional partitioning of functions between state and federal government only so far as required to erect emergency barriers against inflation. No question as to the power of Congress to reach and regulate this business, should it find it necessary to do so, has been raised here. But as matter of policy Congress may well have desired \n\n[321 \nU.S. 144, 152]\n\u00a0\n to avoid conflict of occasions for conflict between federal agencies and state authority which are detrimental to good administration and to public acceptance of an emergency system of price control that might founder if friction with public authorities be added to the difficulties of bringing private self-interest under control. \n17\n Where Congress has not clearly indicated a purpose to precipitate conflict, we should be reluctant to do so by decision. \n18\n In view of assurances to Congress that the evil would proceed only in a minor degree, if at all, from public utilities already under state price control, we think Congress did not intend, and certainly has given no clear indication that it did intend, to supersede the power of a state regulatory commission, exercising comprehensive control over the prices of a business appropriately classified as a utility. Classification by California of the public warehouse business as a utility is not novel, surprising, or capricious. The regulation imposed is not merely nominal or superficial but appears to be penetrating and complete. Therefore, we would have little hesitation in holding that petitioner's public warehouse under the circumstances is a public utility within the exemption of the Price Control Act, but for certain practical objections to that interpretation, urged on behalf of the Administrator with an earnestness which deserves, in view of the difficulties and importance of his task, careful examination.\n\n 1. \nIt is urged that if the status of an industry under state law is to be considered, the Administrator 'woudl have to face the question whether the particular business concerned was sufficiently 'affected with a public interest' constitutionally to justify the type of legal obligation \n\n[321 \nU.S. 144, 153]\n\u00a0\n which the state imposes.' The argument, in short, is that the Administrator would have to decide whether the state regulation is constitutional before he should recognize it. We cannot give weight to this view of his functions, which we think it unduty magnifies. State statutes, like federal ones, are entitled to the presumption of constitutionality until their invalidity is judicially declared. Certainly no power to adjudicate constitutional issues is conferred on the Administrator. Collusion between a state and a favored industry to impose forms of local regulation as a shield against federal control might be conceivable and if such a sham occurred the Administrator could perhaps challenge its effectiveness to support an exemption. But it more nearly accords with experience to assume that an industry does not submit to price regulation until it has explored all possible constitutional objections and litigated hopeful ones. We think the Administrator will not be remiss in his duties if he assumes the constitutionality of state regulatory statutes, under both State and Federal Constitutions, in the absence of a contrary judicial determination.\n\n 2. \nIt also is objected that if we consider the status of an industry under state law, the Price Administrator 'would have to scrutinize and differentiate many kinds of franchises. Thus the Administrator, as an incident to the task of price control, would be called upon to determine in any number of particular instances questions of state law which require the most painstaking examination of statutes and decisions.' We are not prepared to deny that in some degree this will be true, for we do not hold that all warehouses, or even that all warehouses regulated in some aspects, come within the exemption. We think the Administrator will have to form judgments and that they will be judgments of some difficulty. Simplicity of administration is a merit that does not inhere in a federal system of government, as it is claimed to do in a unitary \n\n[321 \nU.S. 144, 154]\n\u00a0\n one. A federal system makes a merit, instead, of the very local autonomy in which complexities are inherent. Nor would the interpretation advocated by the Administrator avoid the necessity of ascertaining and considering rights thought to be possessed under local laws and not likely to be yielded readily. One effect of the Administrator's interpretation would be to postpone study of local laws from consideration in connection with wise administration to the time of litigation, as in this case. Local institutions, customs, and policies will not be overridden without fighting for consideration. The existence and force and function of established institutions of local government are always in the consciousness of lawmakers and, while their weight may vary, they may never be completely overlooked in the task of interpretation. At a time when great measures of concentration of direction are concededly necessary, it may be thought more farsighted to avoid paralyzing or extinguishing local institutions which do not seriously conflict with the central government's place. Congress has given no indication that it would draw all such state authority into the vortex of the war power. Nor should we rush the trend to centralization where Congress has not. It could never be more appropriate than now to heed the maxim reiterated recently by the Court that 'the extension of federal control into these traditional local domains is a 'delicate exercise of legislative policy in achieving a wise accommodation between the needs of central control and the lively maintenance of local institutions.\" City of Yonkers v. United States, \n320 \nU.S. 685, 690\n, 64 S.Ct. 327, 330, decided January 3, 1944; Palmer v. Massachusetts, \n308 \nU.S. 79, 84\n, 60 S.Ct. 34, 36. At least in the absence of a congressional mandate to that effect, we cannot adopt a rule of construction, otherwise unjustified, to relieve federal administrators of what we may well believe is a substantial burden but one implied by the terms of the legislation \n\n[321 \nU.S. 144, 155]\n\u00a0\n when viewed against the background of our form of government.\n\n 3. \nIt also is contended that an interpretation must prevail as matter of principle which will give the exemption a general and uniform operation in all states irrespective of local law. It is, of course, true that uniform operation of a federal law is a desirable end, and other things being equal, we often have interpreted statutes to achieve it. \n19\n But in no case relied upon did we achieve uniformity at the cost of establishing overlapping authority over the same subject matter in the state and in the Federal Government. When we do at times adopt for application of federal laws within a state a rule different from that used by a state in administering its laws, the two rules may subsist without conflict, each reigning in its own realm. It is a much more serious thing to adopt a rule of construction, as we are asked to do here, which precludes the execution of state laws by state authority in a matter normally within state power. The great body of law in this country which controls acquisition, transmission, and transfer of property, and defines the rights of its owners in relation to the state or to private parties, is found in the statutes and decisions of the state. The custom of resorting to them to give meaning and content to federal statutes is too old and its use too diversified to permit us to say that considerations of nationwide uniformity must prevail in a particular case over our judgment that it is out of harmony with other objective more important to \n\n[321 \nU.S. 144, 156]\n\u00a0\n the legislative purpose. \n20\n What content we should give to the exemption in the case of a conventional utility not subject to a state regulatory statute or subject only to partial regulation is, of course, not before us.\n\n 4. \nLastly, it is contended that we should accept the Administrator's view in deference to administrative construction. The administrative ruling in this case was no sooner made than challenged. We cannot be certain how far it was determined by the considerations advanced, mistakenly as we think, in its defense in this case. It has hardly seasoned or broadened into a settled administrative practice. If Congress had deemed it necessary or even appropriate that the Administrator's order should in effect be final in construing the scope of the national price- fixing policy, it would not have been at a loss for words to say so. We do not think it should overweigh the considerations we have set forth as to the proper construction of the statute.\n We hold that the petitioner's business is that of a public utility within the exemption of the Act, and the judgment below is accordingly reversed.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice BLACK and Mr. Justice MURPHY concur, dissenting.\n I think the present decision places an unwarranted burden on those who are waging the present war against in- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 144, 157]\n\u00a0\n flation. The Act exempts from federal price control the 'rates charged by any common carrier or other public utility.'  302(c), 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix  942(c). The Administrator has accordingly granted exemptions to enterprises furnishing the public with gas, electricity, water, light, heat or power, and telephone and telegraph services. That group embraces those enterprises which together with common carriers were traditionally included in the category of a 'public utility'. It should not be expanded by interpretation to include the filigree variety with which we are now concerned.\n The purpose of the Act is to provide an instrument for national control of the inflationary forces set loose by the war. The need for uniformity in the enforcement of the Act is acute-to avoid inequality in burden and sacrifice; to weigh the odds for success as heavily as possible on the side of the public interest. The other exemptions in the Act apply uniformly throughout the country-wages, insurance rates, theatre admissions, fees for professional services, and the like. If the 'public utility' exemption is confined to the traditional classes of utilities, substantial uniformity will be obtained as they are almost universally subject to rate regulation in the States. But under the view taken by the Court warehouses will be exempt in some States but not in others. The same will be true of wharves and docks, slaughter houses, public markets, cotton gins and what not. And even in the same State there will be exemptions for some warehouses but not for others. This dependence of exemptions on the vagaries of state law would be quite understandable if the federal act were designed to mesh with state control-federal control being interposed to take up where state regulation was impossible or ineffective, as in various types of public utility regulation. Then there would be a great need in view of our federal system to preserve as much local autonomy as possible. The same would also be true where only a partial overriding of state controls was necessary to reach the \n\n[321 \nU.S. 144, 158]\n\u00a0\n limited federal objective. But the war against inflation is a grim affair calling for quite different requirements. It cannot be waged along those traditional lines. The luxuries of peace-time arrangements do not always fit the exigencies of this was emergency. Nor do the state rate- regulations in question supplement the federal system. They override it. And standards which they prescribe are not the standards for price-fixing under the present Act. The conventional power to fix rates is governed by criteria quite different from those which control the Administrator's action. He is to fix those maximum prices which 'will be generally fair and equitable and will effectuate the purposes of this Act.'  2(a), 50 U. S.C.A.Appendix  902(a).\n Every exception read into the Act creates another point of leakage, multiplies the task of enforcement, and creates a favored class of businesses. I would not read the Act with such a hostile eye. Where two interpretations are possible I would take the one which avoids those results. The choice between the 'letter' and the 'spirit' is an ancient one even in the law. See Radin, A Short Way With Statutes, 56 Harv.L.Rev. 388. In this case I think the wrong choice has been made. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'The Legislature shall pass laws for the regulation and limitation of the charges for services performed and commodities furnished by telegraph and gas corporations, and the charges by corporations or individuals for storage and wharfage, in which there is a public use ....'

Construing the applicable statutes of Puerto Rico in the light of the practical construction given to them by public officials and political parties of the island, and other matters of which it took judicial notice, the insular court came to the conclusion that 'the tenure of office of the City Manager ... is that of four years, provided that during the same he observe good behavior'. On appeal from this judgment the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, 1 Cir., 136 F.2d 419. We granted certiorari, \n321 \nU.S. 757\n, 64 S.Ct. 614, for the reason already stated and because some observations in the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals have raised serious questions with respect to the appropriate rule governing decision of cases involving local laws, brought from the insular courts of Puerto Rico for review by the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit and by this Court.\n The Court of Appeals, in affirming the judgment of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, pointed out that  21 of Act No. 99 of 1931, which established the government of the city of San Juan, the capital of Puerto Rico, provided that the city manager 'shall be appointed by the Board of Commissioners created by this Act and shall hold office \n\n[322 \nU.S. 451, 454]\n\u00a0\n during good conduct'. It said (136 F.2d 425): 'If we were free to take a wholly independent view of the point at issue we would be inclined to conclude that the meaning of  21 is clear, and that the court below went beyond the permissible limits of interpretation in reading the clause 'and shall hold office during good conduct' as meaning that 'the tenure of office of the city manager of the capital is that of four years, provided that during the same he observe good behavior.\" But it felt constrained to affirm the judgment of the Puerto Rican tribunal by our decision and opinion in Bonet v. Texas Company, \n308 \nU.S. 463, 471\n, 60 S.Ct. 349, 353.\n In that case, in reversing a decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals, Texas Co. v. Sancho, 1 Cir., 102 F.2d 710, which had reversed the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico on a point of local law, we said, 'to justify reversal in such cases, the error must be clear or manifest; the interpretation must be inescapably wrong; the decision must be patently erroneous.' And since the Court of Appeals in this case was not prepared to say that the judgment now under review is 'inescapably wrong', and as it thought that this Court's statement in the Bonet case had reduced the duty of the Court of Appeals to the performance of a mere mechanical function, it felt compelled to affirm the judgment. It also suggested that, as the rule of decision applicable to appeals from the insular Supreme Court, as announced by the Bonet case, had not been applied in appeals from the United States District Court for Puerto Rico, different interpretations of local law might be established in the Court of Appeals, depending on whether the case was appealed from the insular court or from the United States District Court for Puerto Rico.\n Our opinion in the Bonet case was the culmination of efforts by this Court, beginning with Garcia v. Vela, 1910, \n216 \nU.S. 598, 599\n, 602 S., 30 S. Ct. 439, 440, 441; Lewers & Cooke v. Atcherly, 1911, \n222 \nU.S. 285, 294\n, 32 S.Ct. 94, 95; and Ker & Co. v. Couden, 1912, \n223 \nU.S. 268, 279\n, 32 S.Ct. 284, 286, to insure a review by the federal courts of decisions of the local courts of our insular possessions in \n\n[322 \nU.S. 451, 455]\n\u00a0\n matters of peculiarly local concern which should leave appropriate scope for the development by those courts of a system of law which differing from our own in its origins and principles, would nevertheless be suitable to local customs and needs. In thus interpreting the function of the federal appellate courts in reviewing decisions of the insular tribunals we only followed a principle which had long been established for appeals to federal courts from the courts of our territories within the United States. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n From the beginning we have recognized that the appellate review of insular cases was not given to the federal courts for the purpose of superimposing upon the Spanish law our common law preconceptions, except so far as that law must yield to the expressed will of the United States. Diaz v. Gonzales, \n261 \nU.S. 102, 105\n, 106 S., 43 S.Ct. 286, 287, 288. Hence we have emphasized as a cardinal principle of review in such cases that the mere fact that our own system of law and statutory construction would call for the application of one rule to a given set of facts, does not preclude the adoption of a different one by the insular courts. See Waialua Agr. Co. v. Christian, \n305 \nU.S. 91, 109\n, 59 S.Ct. 21, 30. If the rule thus announced by the insular court is one which is not plainly inconsistent with established principles of the local law, or in their absence is one accepted by the practice of the community, it will not be rejected here merely because it is not in logical harmony with the rules which we would apply to \n\n[322 \nU.S. 451, 456]\n\u00a0\n a community within the United States. It will be rejected only on a clear showing that the rule applied by the local court does violence to recognized principles of local law or established practices of the local community.\n The guiding principle, which is incapable of statement in a short formula, has been variously phrased in terms which in every case must be interpreted in the light of the particular situation to which they were applied. \n3\n But the principle which these phrases were intended to express has not been more accurately and comprehensively stated than by Mr. Justice Holmes in words which are completely applicable to the present case, in Diaz v. Gonzales, supra, \n261 \nU.S. 105, 106\n, 43 S.Ct. 287, 288: \n\n[322 \nU.S. 451, 457]\n\u00a0\n 'This Court has stated many times the deference due to the understanding of the local courts upon matters of purely local concern. It is enough to cite (De) Villanueva v. Villanueva, \n239 \nU.S. 293, 299\n, 36 S. Ct. 109, (111); Nadal v. May, \n233 \nU.S. 447, 454\n, 34 S.Ct. 611, (612). This is especially true in dealing with the decisions of a Court inheriting and brought up in a different system from that which prevails here. When we contemplate such a system from the outside it seems like a wall of stone, every part even with all the others, except so far as our own local education may lead us to see subordinations to which we are accustomed. But to one brought up within it, varying emphasis, tacit assumptions, unwritten practices, a thousand influences gained only from life, may give to the different parts wholly new values that logic and grammer never could have gotten from the books. In this case a slight difference in the caution felt in dealing with the interest of minors (Baerga v. Registrar of Humacao, 29 P.R. 440, 442), and a slight change of emphasis in the reading of statutes, explain the divergence between the Supreme Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals.'\n Beyond the fact that common law judges in such cases are reviewing civil law decisions, it is of significance that considerations relevant for decision must be drawn from an environment unfamiliar to and far removed from that in which the reviewing court sits. That which is familiar and accepted in the island forum, in construing a statute or formulating a rule of law, may appear strange or unorthodox in a common law setting. In bridging gaps between legal systems having different origins and history, and governing two different polities, the rule we have announced has special importance.\n Repeated admonitions that in cases coming from the Puerto Rican insular courts to the federal courts for review, where the Constitution or statutes of the United States were not involved, great deference must be paid to \n\n[322 \nU.S. 451, 458]\n\u00a0\n local decisions, having failed of their purpose, see Bonet v. Yabucoa Sugar Co., \n306 \nU.S. 505\n, \n307 \nU.S. 613\n, 59 S.Ct. 626,4 we restated them in more emphatic form in Bonet v. Texas Company, supra, \n308 \nU.S. 470\n, 60 S.Ct. 353, in the sentence quoted in the opinion below which we have repeated here. In order that its true purport might not be misunderstood we accompanied the sentence by the statement of Mr. Justice Holmes in Diaz v. Gonzales, supra, \n261 \nU.S. 105, 106\n, 43 S.Ct. 287, 288, which we have quoted, and in the light of that exposition we added: 'Such judgment of reversal (by the Circuit Court of Appeals) would not be sustained here even though we felt that of several interpretations that of the Circuit Court of Appeals was the most reasonable one'.\n Thus interpreted and read in its context the principle, as restated in the Bonet case, that to justify reversal by the federal courts of a decision of an insular supreme court in a matter of local concern, 'the error must be clear or manifest; the interpretation must be inescapably wrong', is not a mere mechanical device which requires or admits, save in exceptional cases, of the summary disposition of appeals from that court. Nor does it minimize the importance or dignity of the appellate function in such cases. On the contrary, we think that it imposes on the Court of Appeals and on this Court the peculiarly delicate task of examining and appraising the local law in its setting, with the sympathetic disposition to safeguard in matters of local concern the adaptability of the law to local practices and needs. It is one which ordinarily cannot be performed summarily or without full argument and examination of the legal questions involved. But if in the light of such an examination it is found that the rule adopted by the lo- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 451, 459]\n\u00a0\n cal tribunal is an intelligible one, not shown to be out of harmony with local law or practice, it is not to be rejected because we think a better could have been devised or because we find it out of harmony with our own traditional system of law and statutory construction.\n Nor does it follow that the deference due, on appeals from the local tribunals, to their understanding of matters of local concern will lead to the establishment of a local law differing from that developed in decisions in appeals from the federal district courts sitting in our insular possessions. It is not any the less the duty of the federal courts in cases pending in the federal district court or on appeal from it to defer to that understanding, when it has found expression in the judicial pronouncements of the insular courts, Nadal v. May, \n233 \nU.S. 447, 454\n, 34 S.Ct. 611, 612; Diaz v. Gonzales, supra, \n261 \nU.S. 105\n, 43 S. Ct. 287; Waialua Agr. Co. v. Christian, supra, \n305 \nU.S. 109\n, 59 S.Ct. 30. Once understood what deference is to be paid, the problem is comparable to that presented when, upon appeals from federal district courts sitting in the states, the federal appellate courts are required to follow state law under the rule of Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, \n304 \nU.S. 64\n, 58 S.Ct. 817, 114 A.L.R. 1487. See Wichita Royalty Company v. City Nat. Bank, \n306 \nU.S. 103\n, 59 S.Ct. 420; Huddleston v. Dwyer, \n322 \nU.S. 232\n, 64 S.Ct. 1015\n\n\n There remains for consideration the appropriate application of these principles to the facts of the present case. The Act of the Puerto Rican legislature of May 15, 1931, Act No. 99 of 1931, established a special form of city government for the capital city, San Juan. \n5\n Legislative powers are vested in a Board of five Commissioners; the first Commissioners were to be appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Senate, for terms of one, two, \n\n[322 \nU.S. 451, 460]\n\u00a0\n three, four and five years, respectively ( 9), but the Commissioners so appointed were to hold office only until the first Monday in January, 1937 , ( 50), and thereafter the 'Board of Commissioners created by this Act' was to be elected at the general election held in 1936 and every fourth year thereafter ( 50).6 The Act provides that the City Manager, who is the chief executive of the city, 'shall be appointed by the Board of Commissioners created by this Act and shall hold office during good conduct' ( 21). He 'may be removed by the Board of Commissioners, for just cause' after hearing, and causes for removal are enumerated ( 22). Five other administrative officers are appointed by the City Manager ( 26 ), and an Auditor is appointed by the Board of Commissioners ( 36); the provisions as to their tenure of office and removal by the agency appointing them (ss 27, 36) are identical with those for the City Manager, 7 save that only as to the City Manager does the Act specify a tenure of office 'during good conduct.' Other employees, appointed by the officers under whom they serve, 'shall be appointed for the term for which each officer is appointed' And are also removable for cause after hearing, the causes not being specified, however ( 39). No provision is made for bringing such employees within the Puerto Rican Civil Service Act, Act No. 88 of 1931, adopted four days before the adoption of Act No. 99.\n The Puerto Rican Supreme Court refused to hold that the provision that the City Manager 'shall hold office \n\n[322 \nU.S. 451, 461]\n\u00a0\n during good conduct' so conclusively established that he was to hold office for life as to preclude resort to extrinsic evidence of legislative intention. It held that his term was the same as that of the Board of Commissioners which appointed him, so that petitioner, who was appointed in 1937, by a Board of Commissioners elected for four years, held office for 'four years provided that during the same he observe good behavior.' \n8\n We cannot say that these holdings were so clearly wrong as to require a federal appellate court to refuse to pay deference to the insular court's decision.\n While a provision that an office be held 'during good behavior' is generally deemed indicative of an intention to create a life tenure unless cause for removal arises, see Matter of Hennen, 13 Pet. 230, 259; Smith v. Bryan, 100 Va. 199, 203, 40 S.E. 652, 653; Chesley v. Council of Lunenberg, 28 Dom.L.R. 571, 572, it has not been regarded, even where traditional notions of Anglo-American law prevail, as a rigid formula precluding any other construction. \n9\n And a tenure for a period of years \n\n[322 \nU.S. 451, 462]\n\u00a0\n during good behavior has not been regarded as a contradiction in terms by American courts. \n10\n In Shurtleff v. United States, \n189 \nU.S. 311, 316\n, 23 S. Ct. 535, this Court recognized and applied the strong presumption against the creation of a life tenure in a public office under the federal government. To hold that the City Manager was appointed for life would, according to the terms of  39, give to all employees appointed by him a tenure for his life. An intention to create such an estate pur autre vie in a public office would at least be somewhat unusual. On the other hand, if they are to be deemed appointed for their own lives, the result would be that on the death or resignation of one City Manager, his successor would be unable to select even his most immediate subordinates and a life tenure would be implied for a large group of municipal employees in disregard of the rule of Shurtleff v. United States.\n Moreover there is no provision that the other municipal officers are to serve during good conduct, and  39 seems to assume that they shall have defined terms of office. To hold that they could be appointed for life would be inconsistent with the rule of Shurtleff v. United States, supra, which the insular court accepted and approved. Since the Act is silent as to their terms of office, they can presumably \n\n[322 \nU.S. 451, 463]\n\u00a0\n be appointed for any term not exceeding that of the officer appointing them. The interpretation contended for by petitioner would seemingly produce the result that all of the other city officers, save the Auditor, and the employees in their respective offices, could be appointed for the life of the City Manager, unless he should, as the Puerto Rican court assumed he could, decide to appoint them for a shorter term (see  26, 39 ). In the latter case appointees of other officials, themselves appointed for short terms, would necessarily have a like tenure of office ( 39), while those of the City Manager would have a tenure for his life, and those of the Auditor a tenure of four years. Such incongruities the Puerto Rican court thought weighed heavily against the contention that petitioner's tenure was for life. This is the more so because the appointees of the City Manager and of officers appointed by him include most of the municipal officers and employees, none of whom are subject to the insular civil service laws, but who could be appointed for petitioner's life should petitioner's construction of the Act prevail.\n In addition to considering the consequences of such a holding the Puerto Rican Supreme Court looked to the practical construction placed on the Act by the political parties of Puerto Rico, as shown by facts of which it could properly take judicial notice. It said that 'the political parties of the Island have always construed this statute in the sense that the term of office of the City Manager of the capital is that of four years.' It pointed out that at the general election held in 1936 and at that held in 1940 each of the political parties participating proposed a candidate for the office of City Manager, although that office did not appear on the ballot. It said that it was well known that petitioner was the candidate of the winning party at the 1936 election and was appointed City Manager by the newly elected Board of Commissioners to replace the then incumbent, and that another was the \n\n[322 \nU.S. 451, 464]\n\u00a0\n candidate of petitioner's party at the 1940 election, and was appointed City Manager by the newly elected Board of Commissioners. This practical construction by the electorate and political parties, of which petitioner was himself the beneficiary,11 strongly supports the interpretation of the Act as conferring on the City Manager a tenure no longer than that of the Board of Commissioners which appointed him.\n In view of these considerations and of the principles long observed by this Court in reviewing decisions of the insular courts, which we have stated, we cannot say that we should not defer to the view of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico that the meaning of  21, when examined with the related provisions of Act No. 99, in the light of the prevailing practical construction of it, is not so plain and unambiguous as to preclude resort to extrinsic aids to interpretation. Nor can we say, that the practical construction given the Act, together with the strong presumption against life tenures, and the principle, accepted by the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico on the authority of numerous American decisions, that ambiguities should be resolved in favor of the shorter term of office,12 were clearly insufficient to support the construction which it adopted.\n Petitioner calls to our attention an opinion of the Attorney General of Puerto Rico, dated January 30, 1937, stating that 'The administrative officers of the Capi- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 451, 465]\n\u00a0\n tal . . . were appointed during good behavior' and that the appointments 'participate of the nature of a life tenure.' He also refers to correspondence of the first City Manager which could be taken as supporting respondent's position as much as it does petitioner's. It does not appear that these were called to the attention of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, but in any event they do not, in our opinion, counterbalance the weight rightly to be given to the decision of the insular Supreme Court as the ultimate insular interpreter of the local law. We have considered but do not find it necessary to discuss other contentions of lesser moment, most of which were dealt with in the opinion of the Court of Appeals below, and none of which call for a conclusion different from that which it reached.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See 48 U.S.C.  863, 48 U.S.C.A.  863. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Sweeney v.

Christian, \n305 \nU.S. 91\n, 59 S.Ct. 21. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The form of government for other municipalities in Puerto Rico is prescribed by Act No. 53 of 1928, which provides for a Mayor to be elected 'in the same manner required by this Act for members of the municipal assembly' ( 29), and hence presumably to serve a term of four years (cf.  17). \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] By Act No. 10 of 1937 the Board was increased to nine, beginning in 1941, four Commissioners to be appointed every four years by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Puerto Rican Senate, and five to be elected as previously provided. \n[\nFootnote 7\n] In the English text the City Manager is removable for 'inexcusable negligence in the performance of his duties', the officers appointed by him for 'inexcusable ignorance in the performance of their duties' ( italics added.) In the Spanish text the word is 'negligencia' in both cases. \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] We need not consider what, under this construction, was the term of office of the City Manager first appointed in May, 1931. An admissible construction would be that the Board of Commissioners appointed by the Governor to serve until January, 1937 was regarded as a single body with a five year term, despite the annual changes in its membership, and hence the City Manager, whose term of office was that of the body appointing him, also had a tenure of some six and one-half years. At least this conforms to what in fact occurred. \n[\nFootnote 9\n] State courts have held that a provision for tenure 'during good behavior' does not preclude the termination of the tenure by good faith abolition of the office, Shira v. State, 187 Ind. 441, 119 N.E. 833, 834; that such a provision is not necessarily inconsistent with a constitutional restriction on the number of years for which the office can be held but will be read as creating a tenure for a term of years during good behavior, Callaghan v. Tobin, 40 Tex.Civ.App. 441, 448, 90 S.W. 328, 331; Callaghan v. Irvin, 40 Tex.Civ.App. 453, 459, 90 S.W. 335, 338; Callaghan v. McGown, Tex.Civ.App., 90 S.W. 319, 322; Neumeyer v.

CITY BANK FARMERS TRUST CO.(1944)\nNo. 227\nArgued: December 10, 1943Decided: January 17, 1944\n\n\n\n On Appeals from the Surrogate's Court of New York County, State of New york. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 36, 37]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Francis J. Mahoney, for appellants Demorest.\n Mr. James N. Vaughan, for appellant Dyett.\n Mr. Albert Stickney, for appellee Emma M. West.\n Mr. C. Alexander Capron, for appellee City Bank Farmers Trust Co., trustee.\n Mr. Louis J. Merrell, for appellees Title Guarantee & Trust Co. and others.\n\n Mr. Justice JACKSON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellants in these two cases challenge the constitutionality of Subdivision 2 of  17-c of the Personal Property Law of the State of New York, approved April 13, 1940.1 \n\n[321 \nU.S. 36, 38]\n\u00a0\n Because of retroactivity it is said to offend the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution by taking for benefit of income beneficiaries property to which the appellants as beneficiaries of principal \n\n[321 \nU.S. 36, 39]\n\u00a0\n claim vested rights. It is asserted, also, to deny equal protection of the laws.\n The facts in No. 52 are these: Henry West died in 1934. His will, so far as concerns us, left a residuary estate in trust. Net income less certain payments to a brother was given to his wife during her life or widowhood. Thereafter, subject to certain further trusts, the residue was to go to contingent remaindermen, among whom are the appellants.\n At death West owned a number of mortgages. Owing to defaults, titles to nine of the underlying properties were acquired either by foreclosure sale or by deed in lieu thereof, and held in separate accounts as assets of the trust. The trustee's accounting disclosed that two such salvage operations were completed by sale of the properties prior to the enactment of  17-c of the Personal Property Law. No distribution had been made of the proceeds. Objections on behalf of remaindermen questioned the validity of the statute as applied to apportioning such proceeds between income and principal. Surrogate Foley, however, upheld the statute and resolved the apportionment under its terms. His decree was unanimously affirmed by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court for the First Judicial Department and thereafter was affirmed by the Court of Appeals, two judges dissenting. Matter of West's Estate, 289 N.Y. 423, 46 N.E.2d 501. The case is brought here by appeal.\n In No. 227, Auguste Schnitzler died in 1930, leaving a will which put her residuary estate in trust with the income payable to a sister for life. The income beneficiary died in 1939. Salvage operations had begun in the lifetime of the beneficiary and were completed after her death. Surrogate Delehanty found that operation of the statute 'resulted over the whole salvage period in taking for income account more than the whole of what the property earned in that period. The deficit in so-called \n\n[321 \nU.S. 36, 40]\n\u00a0\n 'income' was made up by taking principal, of course.' (40 N.Y.S.2d 554, 555.) He considered the result startling' but settled the accounts under the statute, leaving its validity to be determined by appellate courts. The Court of Appeals affirmed without opinion on the authority of Matter of West and the case comes here by appeal.\n The grievance of remaindermen in these cases is not that they have suffered loss or deprivation of any specific property to which they had legal title. Under the law of New York the whole legal estate vests in the trustee for purposes of the trust,2 including title to mortgages and to real estate acquired upon or in lieu of their foreclosure, which becomes personalty for the purposes of the trust. \n3\n Where the instrument creating the trust directs payment of income to one set of beneficiaries and corpus to another, allocation of receipts and disbursements as between capital and income is sometimes attended with difficulty. Mortgage investments may be imperiled by default in interest only, or payments of principal alone, or of both, but in either event both income and capital interests require protection. Advancements often must be made to remove tax liens or other prior charges, pay costs of foreclosure, make property tenantable, or take care of operating losses, watchmen, or insurance. On final sale the price, together with rentals, may leave either a loss or a profit, and to forego income for a period may result in a better sale of the capital asset. The variety of circumstances under which trustees are called upon to allocate items between capital and income are innumerable in salvage operations, the will rarely provides guidance, and the wisest and most faithful trustee is unable to draw the line with any great assurance. Either the income beneficiary \n\n[321 \nU.S. 36, 41]\n\u00a0\n or the remaindermen may challenge his accounts, for they have equitable interests which chancery will enforce that the trust be administered diligently and faithfully according to the will and the law. The flood of issues as to allotment of receipts and disbursements to capital or income account, following the depression, led the Court of Appeals to attempt to clarify the chancery rules on the subject for better guidance of trustees and the courts that supervise them. \n4\n When this was only partially successful, the problem of clarification was carried further by legislation. The remaindermen claim an unconstitutional taking of their property results from this legislative enactment of rules for distribution as between income and capital beneficiaries of trust property involved in salvage operations, because they are less favorable to the remainder interests in these cases than the rules they claim otherwise would have applied.\n Appellants' contention is that the New York Court of Appeals established a rule of apportionment of proceeds of salvage operations of mortgaged property as between income and principal which became a settled rule of property under which property rights vested in them prior to accounting by the trustees. This, they say, was accomplished by the decisions in Matter of Chapal's Will, 1936, 269 N.Y. 464, 199 N.E. 762, 103 A.L.R. 1268, and Matter of Otis' Will, 1937, 276 N.Y. 101, 11 N.E.2d 556, 115 A.L.R. 875. The Court of Appeals, however, in one of the present cases holds to the contrary, saying that those opinions represent tentative judicial efforts to guide the discretion of trustees; that they did not establish rules of property; and that the legislature appears to have done no more than to direct trustees to do what they already had discretion to do, in which case \n\n[321 \nU.S. 36, 42]\n\u00a0\n remaindermen could not have insisted upon their being surcharged under the law before the enactment.\n In thus rejecting appellants' version of its previous decisions the Court of Appeals disposed of their cases on the ground that appellants have never possessed under New York law such a property right as they claim has been taken from them. If this is the case, appellants have no question for us under the Due Process Clause. Decisions of this Court as to its province in such circumstances were summarized in Broad River Power Co. v. South Carolina, \n281 \nU.S. 537, 540\n, 50 S.Ct. 401, 402, as follows: 'Whether the state court has denied to rights asserted under local law the protection which the Constitution guarantees is a question upon which the petitioners are entitled to invoke the judgment of this Court. Even though the constitutional protection invoked be denied on nonfederal grounds, it is the province of this Court to inquire whether the decision of the state court rests upon a fair or substantial basis. If unsubstantial, constitutional obligations may not be thus evaded. ... But, if there is no evasion of the constitutional issue, ... and the nonfederal ground of decision has fair support, ... this Court will not inquire whether the rule applied by the state court is right or wrong, or substitute its own view of what should be deemed the better rule for that of the state court.' \n5\n\u00a0\n\n Despite difference of opinion within the Court of Appeals as to the effect of its earlier cases, we think that the decision of the majority that they did not amount to a \n\n[321 \nU.S. 36, 43]\n\u00a0\n rule of property does rest on a fair and substantial basis. The opinion in the Otis case had indicated a tentative quality in its pronouncements, saying: 'Perhaps it should be added that a general rule for such situations cannot be attained at a bound, that no rule can be final for all cases, and that any rule must in the end be shaped by considerations of business policy. Accordingly, we have here put aside inadequate legal analogies in the endeavor to express fair, convenient, practical guides that will be largely automatic in their application. Only the sure result of time will tell how far we have succeeded.' And the opinion had pointed out that the disbursement of net income during salvage operations was left to the discretion of the trustee with the admonition that the discretion 'should be exercised with appropriate regard for the fact that unless a life tenant gets cash he does not get anything in the here and now.' 276 N. Y. 101, 115, 11 N.E.2d 556, 559, 115 A.L.R. 875.\n The executive committee of the Surrogates' Association of the State of New York, composed of the judicial officers immediately charged with application of these decisions to the instruction of and accountings by trustees held a similar view of the discretion left to trustees. The legislature appears to have been of the same mind in adopting the new legislation. \n6\n The judicial effort was \n\n[321 \nU.S. 36, 44]\n\u00a0\n to formulate general rules to guide fiduciary discretion. The Chapal decision was rendered in response to a trustee's petition for instructions. But while such decisions were useful as precedents, they were felt not adequate to \n\n[321 \nU.S. 36, 45]\n\u00a0\n protect trustees aginst the hazards of litigation in particular cases, and the avowed effort of the court to adapt the law to the situation resulting from the depression failed in practice. \n7\n Hence the legislature intervened, \n\n[321 \nU.S. 36, 46]\n\u00a0\n adopted a rule which the trustee might have applied before, in its discretion, and prescribed it as a definite standard for setting apart income, protecting trustees against liability to remaindermen if they followed it. What ap- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 36, 47]\n\u00a0\n pears really to have been taken from the remainderman in his right to question the equity of the rule in his individual circumstances, a right which he had while it was a rule of the court. In the case of the Schnitzler trusts where the rule results in invasion of the remainderman's principal to make good to the life beneficiary the statutory allowance of income, Surrogate Delehanty implied, and no one has denied, that the flexibility of the former rule would probably have resulted in a surcharge of the trustee's accounts, and hence that the remainderman has been deprived of the value which benefit of the Chapal-Otis ruile would likely add to his remainder. Of course the very purpose of the statute, as Surrogate Foley points out, is to deprive him of that objection to the accounts, to protect the trustee against that hazard, and to give the remainderman other compensatory advantages. The legislature has furthered certainly at cost of flexibility.\n Constitutional validity of this legislation if it had been made applicable to estates of decedents dying after its enactment is not questioned. It is objected only that application to an estate whose administration began before the Act so as to take away the remainderman's right to judicial examination of the trustee's computation of income makes it void for retroactivity.\n It may be observed that insofar as appellants stand on the Chapal- Otis rule it can benefit them only if it may be retroactive. Both of these decedents died several years before either of those decisions. If a property right to some particular rule of income allotment in salvage proceeds vested at all, it would seem to have done so at death of the testator. If so, remaindermen would have to show that their property right was established by decisions then in existence, or else that advantages derived from a later judicial decision may not be repealed. The case comes to this: Appellants took remainders at a time when the rules by which to sequester their interests in proceeds from \n\n[321 \nU.S. 36, 48]\n\u00a0\n complicated operations to salvage property were so indefinite that several years later the Court made an effort to devise more definitive rules for the purpose. They were but partly successful, and a few years later the legislature made further and perhaps more authoritative and final rules. Comparing the later with the earlier effort, the remainderman in these particular cases finds himself prejudiced. He says we must confirm him in the earlier by striking down the later of two retroactive rules of law.\n This statute does not purport to open accountings already closed or to take away rights or remainders judicially settled under the old rule. The statute is applied only to judicial settlements pending at or instituted after its enactment. Rights to succession by will are created by the state and may be limited, conditioned, or abolished by it. Irving Trust Company v. Day, \n314 \nU.S. 556\n, 62 S.Ct. 398, 137 A.L.R. 1093. The whole cluster of vexatious problems arising from uses and trusts, mortmain, the rule against perpetuities, and testamentary directions for accumulations or for suspensions of the power of alienation, is one whose history admonishes against unnecessary rigidity. The state may extend the testamentary privilege on terms which permit tying up of property in trust for possibly long periods. But the state on creation of such a trust does not lose power to devise new and reasonable directions to the trustee to meet new conditions arising during its administration, such as the depression presented to trusts holding mortgages. Cf. Home Building & Loan Association v. Blaisdell, \n290 \nU.S. 398\n, 54 S.Ct. 231, 88 A.L. R. 1481. Nothing in the Federal Constitution would warrant us in holding that judicial rules tentatively put forward and leaving much to discretion will deprive the legislature of power to make further reasonable rules which in its opinion will expedite and make more equi- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 36, 49]\n\u00a0\n table the distribution of millions of dollars of property locked in testamentary trusts, even if they do affect the values of various interests and expectancies under the trust. The Fourteenth Amendment does not invalidate the Act in question.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice BLACK concurs.\n The New York Court of Appeals stated that in formulating the statutory rule in question the state legislature did no more 'than direct a trustee to do what under the decisions of this court he has discretionary power to do.' 289 N.Y. 423, 430, 46 N.E.2d 501, 505. And it went on to say, 'Before the enactment of this statute, the life tenant could not have demanded as of right the payment to him during liquidation of more of the surplus income than he will receive under the statute. Neither does it appear that the remaindermen could properly have insisted that the trustee should be surcharged if in the exercise of his discretion he had paid to the life tenant the amount which the statute now directs.' Id. That is a question of New York law on which the New York court has the final say. It is none of our business-whether we deem that interpretation to be reasonable or unreasonable, sound or erroneous. Sauer v. New York, \n206 \nU.S. 536\n, 545-548, 27 S.Ct. 686, 688-690. And there is no suggestion here that state law has been manipulated in evasion of a federal constitutional right. Fox River Paper Co. v. Railroad Commission, \n274 \nU.S. 651, 657\n, 47 S.Ct. 669, 671; Broad River Power Co. v. South Carolina, \n281 \nU.S. 537, 540\n, 50 S.Ct. 401, 402. Consequently I can see no possible claim to substantiality of any federal question, whatever view may be taken of the due process clause. I would therefore dismiss the appeal. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] N.Y.Laws 1940, c. 452, p. 1182, Consol.Laws N.Y. c. 41. The subsection provides:\n'2.

The terms and rules of procedure of this subdivision shall apply specifically (a) to the estates of persons dying before its enactment and (b) to mortgages on real property held by a trustee under a deed of trust or other instrument executed before the date of its enactment and (c) to real property acquired by foreclosure of mortgage or real property acquired in lieu of foreclosure before or after the date of its enactment in trusts created or mortgage investments made prior thereto, and (d) to any pending proceeding or action for an accounting of the transactions of an executor or trustee.\n\n'(a) Net income during the salvage operation up to three per centum per annum upon the principal amount of the mortgage shall be paid to the life tenant, regardless of principal advances for the expenses of foreclosure or of conveyance in lieu of foreclosure and arrears of taxes and other liens which occurred prior to such foreclosure or conveyance and the cost of all capital improvements. Any payment of net income heretofore or hereafter made to the life tenant up to such three per centum per annum shall be final and shall be not subject to recoupment from the life tenant or as a surcharge against the trustee or executor.

When principal advances have been satisfied, any excess income shall be impounded (subject to reinvestment under the terms of the will or deed) to await sale and apportionment.\n\n'(c) The unpaid principal advances shall be a primary lien upon the proceeds of sale and shall be paid first out of any cash so derived. If insufficient the balance shall be a primary lien upon any purchase money mortgage received upon the sale. \n\n'(d) The purpose of the enactment of this subdivision is declared to be the simplification of the rules of procedure in mortgage salvage operations and the elimination of present complications which work to the disadvantage of the life tenant, who is usually the principal object of the testator's or settlor's bounty, by deprving him of a fixed right to the actual payment of any net income earned by the property. Such fixed right is granted in lieu of the discretion now given to the trustee to pay net income or any part thereof to the life tenant. The general rules of the apportionment of the proceeds of sale between life tenant and remainderman are retained subject to the express modifications made herein. Only equitable adjustments and balances as between the parties are intended to be effectuated by the provisions of this subdivision.

Its general purposes are:\n\n'(1) To simplify the complicated rules restated in Matter of Chapal's ( Will), 269 N.Y. 464 (199 N.E. 762, 103 A.L.R. 1268) and in Matter of Otis' ( Will), 276 N.Y. 101 (11 N.E.2d 556, 115 A.L.R. 875) relating to mortgage salvage operations (a) in existing trusts as to mortgages hereafter acquired as a trust investment and (b) in testamentary trusts created by the will of decedent dying after its enactment and (c) in inter vivos trusts created by an instrument executed after its enactment. Such simplification is provided in the first subdivision of the new section.\n\n'In recent years section 17-a of the Personal Property law was enacted to avoid the difficult problems of the allocation of stock dividends received during the period of a trust. Under that section they are now allocated wholly to capital. Section 17-b of the Personal Property law was enacted to abolish the intricate rule in Matter of Benson, 96 N.Y. 499 (48 Am.Rep. 646) under which it was necessary to capitalize the income on monies held within the estate for the payment of administration expenses, debts, taxes and pecuniary legacies. In line with this policy the proposed legislation contained in the first subdivision abolishes, in the instances stated above, the Chapal-Otis rules, and will substitute a simple form of the treatment of the foreclosed real property as a principal asset of the trust. It is to be treated just as a railroad bond upon which default in interest before sale has occurred. \n\n'(2) Further modifications are proposed by the second subdivision of the section as to mortgage investments already made in existing trusts. The present rules for apportionment between life tenant and remainderman under the Chapal-Otis cases are continued as to existing trusts where the investment in a mortgage has been made, with modification thereof in two specific instances.\n\n'(a) The Chapal-Otis rule authorizes the trustee to pay surplus net income in his discretion. Trustees have hesitated to pay such net income because in the case of overpayment to the life tenant, the trustee might be surcharged with that amount. The life tenant of the trust must wait in the majority of cases for a long period of time before he becomes entitled to the payment of any income, because of the present requirement that advances from principal for the expenses of foreclosure and for arrears of taxes and other liens must first be paid from the net income of the property. The amendment provides for the immediate payment of income to the life tenant beginning with the date of the acquisition of the property by the trustee by foreclosure or conveyance in lieu of foreclosure. Under the new provisions net income up to three per centum of the face amount of the mortgage is so payable. Under the Chapal-Otis rules the life tenant is entitled in the final apportionment to the inclusion of interest at the mortgage rate during the period of the salvage operation. The rate of three per centum in the new section has been recommended as a fair return to the life tenant and at the same time a protection to the remainderman in the event that the property is sold at less than the face amounts of the income and principal shares employed at the ratio of the apportionment . (b) Surplus net income above three per centum is to be applied to the payment of advances from principal until the amount of such advances are satisfied. When the property in the salvage operation is sold, the unpaid balance of principal advances must be satisfied first out of the cash received from the sale. If there be any unpaid balance due for principal advances, it is made a primary lien upon the purchase money mortgage. The amendment further directs that after principal advances have been paid, the surplus net income above three per centum, accruing during the salvage operation, shall be held by the trustee to await sale and apportionment under the Chapal-Otis rules.' N.Y.Laws 1940, p. 1181. \n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Surrogate Foley in the Demorest case states the effect of this Act as follows, Matter of West's Estate, 175 Misc. 1044, 1048, 26 N.Y.S.2d 622, 628:\n'Two relatively simple modifications of the Chapal-Otis rules were made in this subdivision. Under those rules and particularly under the language of the opinion of Judge Loughran in Matter of Otis' Will, supra, a discretionary power was given to a trustee during a mortgage salvage operation to disburse income to the life tenant, after advances made from principal as an incident to the acquisition of the property had been repaid. It was found, however, that trustees hesitated to make any payment to the life tenant or to exercise the judicial discretion given to them by Matter of Otis' Will, because of the fear of a possible surcharge in the event of an overpayment to the life tenant. The life tenant in almost every instance was the primary object of the testator's bounty. The beneficiary intended to be most favored was thus deprived, by the trustee's inaction or hesitancy, of receiving income during the entire salvage period, and large sums of money were accumulated and frozen. The injustice to the life tenant was aggravated by the fact that because of the lack of a ready market for the resale of the property, the salvage operation was unduly extended for a long period of years. This situation is emphasized by the facts revealed in the present proceeding. Of the seven mortgages now involved in the salvage operations in which no resale has taken place, the longest period of operation has been six years and two months. The shortest period has been four years and ten months. Thus the average period of operation of all seven mortgages has been approximately five years. In the two completed operations the periods of salvage were two years and six months and two years and eight months. This unhappy situation has been corrected by the new legislation. Trustees are expressly authorized to pay promptly net income derived from the foreclosed or acquired property up to three per centum per annum upon the face amount of the mortgage. From the time of the passage of the new act, it has been the practical experience and observation of the surrogates that hundreds of thousands of dollars which had been theretofore accumulated were paid out to life tenants upon the authority granted by the statute. Where the trustee had paid the yearly income up to the 3 per cent maximum to the life tenant, the statute made the payment final. It was specifically stated by the Legislature that such payment up to the maximum was 'not subject to recoupment from the life tenant or as a surcharge against the trustee or executor.' Moreover, under the new statutory rule, net income up to the maximum of 3 per cent became payable from the very beginning of the salvage operation, that is, from the date of acquisition by foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure.\n\n'The other amendment to the Chapal-Otis rules made by the second subdivision of the new section in the balancing of the equities, furnished protection to the remaindermen interested in the principal of the trust. Excess net income earned in any one year during the salvage operation above the 3 per cent maximum payable to the life tenant was directed to be applied to advancements from principal for arrears of taxes and other liens which accrued prior to the foreclosure or acquisition in lieu of foreclosure and to the cost of capital improvements. Where any balance of unpaid principal advances remained due at the close of the salvage operation, such balance was declared to be 'a primary lien upon the proceeds of sale and shall be paid first out of any cash so derived. If insufficient the balance shall be a primary lien upon any purchase money mortgage received upon the sale.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n","34":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDISTRICT OF COLUMBIA v. PACE(1944)\nNo. 117\nArgued: December 13, 1943Decided: January 10, 1944\n\n\n\n\n[320 \nU.S. 698, 699]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Glenn Simmon, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Elmer E. Hazard, of Jacksonville, Fla., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice JACKSON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Charles F. Pace came to the District of Columbia in 1913 from Florida, where he had theretofore been domiciled. His only purpose in coming was to enter the federal service. He became Financial Clerk of the Senate and served continuously until his death in the District in 1940. During these twenty-seven years he lived in boarding houses and in rented apartments and owned no real property in the District. At all times he maintained his registration and qualification to vote in the State of Florida and exercised that right either in person or by absentee ballot. His will, made in 1937, recited that he was 'of the City of Washington, D.C.' It was probated in Florida, and ancillary letters were granted in the District to the respondent executrix. District authorities, upon the premise that Pace was domiciled in the District, assessed an inheritance tax upon the transfer of certain jointly owned bank deposits within the District. Respondents paid the tax under protest and then appealed the assessment to the Board of Tax Appeals of the District on the ground that decedent was domiciled in Florida at the time of his death. The Board of Tax Appeals after hearing argument determined that decedent was domiciled in Florida, and ordered refund of the tax paid. The District appealed to the Court of Appeals, but before hearing this Court decided District of Columbia v. Murphy, \n314 \nU.S. 441\n, 62 S.Ct. 303. The District thereupon moved to remand the \n\n[320 \nU.S. 698, 700]\n\u00a0\n case to the Board of Tax Appeals for reconsideration in the light of the intervening decision. The motion was granted. Upon reconsideration the Board re-adopted the findings theretofore made but concluded that the decedent had not overcome the presumption, arising from maintaining a home in the District, that he was domiciled therein and reversed its former ruling.\n The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia reversed. It accepted and applied our decision in District of Columbia v. Murphy and, weighing the facts in the light of its principles, concluded that the decedent was domiciled in Florida at the time of his death. The evidence before the Board of Tax Appeals took a wide range, and we do not think it is necessary to recite it in detail. As is usual in cases of contested domicile, it gave rise to conflicting inferences, and a decision either way would be supported by substantial evidence. Whether the Board's determination or that of the Court of Appeals should be deemed correct would depend upon the weight to be given to many different items of evidence, the credibility to be given to testimony, and the inferences to be drawn from many admitted events. We did not take this case to determine where Mr. Pace was domiciled. But the scope of review of decisions by the Board of Tax Appeals of the District of Columbia is important to the administration of the District's tax laws, and since that question was not reached or decided in District of Columbia v. Murphy, we granted certiorari in this case.\n Congress has seen fit in certain of the District's tax statutes to make liability dependent upon domicile. In the District, where a large proportion of the population owe their presence to Government service and have the strongest motives for retaining their political connections with and domicile in the enfranchised community from which they came, this test of taxability is bound to give rise to innumerable and difficult conflicts. These the \n\n[320 \nU.S. 698, 701]\n\u00a0\n Board of Tax Appeals is authorized in the first instance to resolve.\n The provisions for review of Board of Tax Appeals decisions present complexities almost as baffling as the test of taxability itself. Section 4(a) of the Act creating the Board of Tax Appeals for the District of Columbia provides that its decisions may be reviewed by the Court of Appeals and that upon such review the court 'shall have the power to affirm, or if the decision of the board is not in accordance with law, to modify or reverse the decision of the board, with or without remanding the case for hearing, as justice may require.' 52 Stat. 371, D.C.Code 1940,  47-2404(a). Had this been all, a strong case would be made for applying the rule of finality applicable to the Federal Board of Tax Appeals, now the Tax Court of the United States. Dobson v. Commissioner, 64 S.Ct. 239, decided December 20, 1943. However, the same organic act contains another and qualifying provision that is not to be found in the acts creating the Tax Court: 'The findings of fact by the board shall have the same effect as a finding of fact by an equity court or a verdict of a jury.' 52 Stat. 371, D.C.Code 1940,  47-2404(a). Since findings of fact by an equity court and the verdict of a jury have from time immemorial been subject to different rules of finality it is puzzling to know what the draftsmen of this section meant by including both in the one rule for reviewing Board of Tax Appeals findings.\n This statute was enacted in May, 1938. The law at that time as to the review of findings of fact in equity was, as stated by Mr. Justice Brandeis for the Court, 'in equity, matters of fact as well as of law are reviewable ....' Virginian R. Co. v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 658, 675\n, 47 S.Ct. 222, 229. Findings of fact by the trial judge of course were presumptively correct and were accepted by reviewing courts unless clearly wrong. Butte & Superior Copper Co. v. Clark-Montana Realty Co., \n249 \nU.S. 12, 30\n, 39 S.Ct. 231, 236. This rule, however, \n\n[320 \nU.S. 698, 702]\n\u00a0\n did not deny power to the Circuit Court of Appeals to review facts, but rather went to the weight to be accorded to the findings of a lower court and had special pertinence where credibility of witnesses was involved. This Court had a well settled rule that 'when two courts have reached the same conclusion on a question of fact, their finding will not be disturbed unless it is clear that their conclusion was erroneous.' Baker v. Schofield, \n243 \nU.S. 114, 118\n, 37 S.Ct. 333, 334. Such a rule would have no support in reason if the second court could not make its findings as a result of its own judgment.\n The statute therefore authorizes review of findings of fact of the Board of Tax Appeals of the District of Columbia, subject to the admonition that they are to be undisturbed unless clearly wrong, if the findings are given the effect of findings of fact by an equity court. If the effect of the jury verdict, provided for in the same sentence, is to prevail, the review is much more restricted. The question as to which of the inconsistent provisions shall govern arises in a local statute confined in its operation to the District of Columbia. 'We will not ordinarily review decisions of the United States Court of Appeals, which are based upon statutes so limited or which declare the common law of the District.' Del Vecchio v. Bowers, \n296 \nU.S. 280, 285\n, 56 S.Ct. 190, 192. Cf. American Security & Trust Co. v. District of Columbia, \n224 \nU.S. 491\n, 32 S.Ct. 553; United Surety Co. v. American Fruit Product Co., \n238 \nU.S. 140\n, 35 S.Ct. 828. Where a local statute contains a conflict on its face as patent and as irreconcilable as this, where either choice seems equally supportable, we cannot say that the Court of Appeals commits error in assuming its review of the Board of Tax Appeals decision to be entitled to the scope of a review of an equity court.\n After the Board of Tax Appeals statute, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure No. 52 was adopted, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c, effective September 1, 1938. It provided as to all actions tried upon the \n\n[320 \nU.S. 698, 703]\n\u00a0\n facts without a jury: 'Findings of fact shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of the credibility of the witnesses.' This general rule, even if it were thought to modify the previous rule as to review of findings of fact in equity cases, would hardly supersede a special statutory measure of review applicable to a special and local tribunal.\n We conclude, therefore, that the Court of Appeals has power to review decisions of the Board of Tax Appeals as under the equity practice in which the whole case, both facts and law, is open for consideration in the appellate court, subject to the long-standing rule that findings of fact are treated as presumptively correct and are accepted unless clearly wrong. The Court of Appeals therefore had power to set aside the determination of the Board of Tax Appeals if convinced, as it was, that the Board was clearly wrong. We are not called upon to separate factual from legal grounds of decision and to determine if reversal of the Board of Tax Appeals by the Court of Appeals could stand on questions of law alone. The judgment therefore is\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice BLACK and Mr. Justice RUTLEDGE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","35":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDIXIE PINE P. CO. v. C.I.R.(1944)\nNo. 84\nArgued: Decided: January 3, 1944\n\n\n\n\n[320 \nU.S. 516, 517]\n\u00a0\n Mr. T. J. Wills, of Hattiesburg, Miss., for petitioner.\n Mr. Arnold Raum, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question presented concerns the propriety of the respondent's disallowance of a deduction from income which petitioner took in its federal income tax return for 1937\n\n\n In 1936 the Mississippi taxing authorities declared that a solvent used by petitioner in its business was gasoline within the meaning of a state law defining gasoline and laying a tax upon its receipt and use. Accordingly a tax was assessed against the petitioner with respect to the receipt and use of the solvent in 1936. Petitioner paid the tax, and, in the same year, brought suit against the Motor Vehicle Commissioner of Mississippi alleging that the solvent was not within the comprehension of the state law and that the Commissioner should be temporarily and permanently enjoined from future collections of tax in respect of it. The Commissioner's demurrer to the complaint was sustained but, on appeal, the Supreme Court of Mississippi decided that, on the pleadings, the solvent was not within the definition of gasoline contained in the state statute. After this decision petitioner denied that it owed, and ceased and refused to pay, any gasoline tax on solvent used by it.\n In December, 1937, on advice of counsel, petitioner (which kept its books and filed its federal income tax returns on the accrual basis) made book entries accruing gasoline tax assessed by the Motor Vehicle Commissioner in 1937. The actual accrual entries were made sometime between January 1 and March 15, 1938, as of December 31, \n\n[320 \nU.S. 516, 518]\n\u00a0\n 1937, in the amount of approximately $21,000, and petitioner deducted this amount from income in making its 1937 federal income tax return, although the sum had not been, and never was, paid.\n In December 1938 petitioner and the Attorney General of Mississippi filed an agreed statement of facts in the state court suit, and, in the same month, the trial judge entered a final decree perpetually enjoining the Motor Vehicle Commissioner from assessing gasoline tax on the solvent used by petitioner. This decree was subsequently affirmed by the Supreme Court of Mississippi. In its 1938 federal income tax return petitioner, by way of compensating entry, included the sum of $21,000 as income and as a recovery, in view of the Mississippi trial court's decree of December 1938.\n The sole question is whether the Commissioner was right in disallowing the deduction for the tax year 1937. The Board of Tax Appeals held that he was, 1 and the court below affirmed its decision.2. We took the case because of a conceded conflict in principle with decisions in other circuits. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n Section 23(c) of the Revenue Act of 19364 permits the deduction from gross income of taxes 'paid or accrued within the taxable year.' Sections 41, 42, and 43 make provision for tax accounting on the accrual basis, where the taxpayer keeps his books on that principle, provided his method clearly reflects his income in any taxable year.\n The provisions of the Revenue Act of 1936 worked no significant change over earlier Acts respecting the permissible basis of calculating annual taxable income. The applicable principles of accounting on the accrual basis had \n\n[320 \nU.S. 516, 519]\n\u00a0\n been adduced and applied by the Board of Tax Appeals in numerous decisions. 5 It has never been questioned that a taxpayer who accounts on the accrual basis may, and should, deduct from gross income a liability which really accrues in the taxable year. \n6\n It has long been held that, in order truly to reflect the income of a given year, all the events must occur in that year which fix the amount and the fact of the taxpayer's liability for items of indebtedness deducted though not paid;7 and this cannot be the case where the liability is contingent and is contested by the taxpayer. \n8\n Here the taxpayer was strenuously contesting liability in the courts and, at the same time, deducting the amount of the tax, on the theory that the state's exaction constituted a fixed and certain liability. This it could not do. It must, in the circumstances, await the event of the state court litigation and might claim a deduction only for the taxable year in which its liability for the tax was finally adjudicated. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n To this effect are the decisions of the Board of Tax Appeals in numerous cases, and the instant decision was in line with earlier rulings as to proper tax accounting practice. Since the Board appled the correct rule of law, its determination that the item in question was not properly deducted on the accrual basis is entitled to the finality indicated by Dobson v. Helvering, \n320 \nU.S. 489\n, 64 S.Ct. 239. The court below properly refused to disturb the Board's determination.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 45 B.T.A. 286. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 134 F.2d 273. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Commissioner v.

COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE(1944)\nNo. 44\nArgued: Decided: February 14, 1944\n\n\n\n Messrs. Leland W. Scott and William L. Prosser, both of Minneapolis, Minn., for petitioners.\n\n Mr. Justice JACKSON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petition for rehearing in two of the four cases decided together on December 20, 1943 states that these contained an issue not present and not considered in the main case. In these two cases the Tax Court held that recoveries by these taxpayers in 1939 did constitute taxable income. It held, also, that the recovery was taxable as ordinary income, despite taxpayer's contention that it should be taxed as capital gain under Section 117 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code,  117. This contention, the petition says, presents questions of law to be determined by this Court, rather than of fact finally to be determined by the Tax Court.\n The weakness of taxpayers' position lies in the fact that not every gain growing out of a transaction concerning \n\n[321 \nU.S. 231, 232]\n\u00a0\n capital assets is allowed the benefits of the capital gains tax provision. Those are limited by definition to gains from 'the sale or exchange' of capital assets. Internal Revenue Code  117(a) (2), (3), (4), (5).\n We certainly cannot say that the items in question were as matter of law proceeds of the 'sale or exchange' of a capital asset. Harwick asserted a claim, and the three other taxpayers involved in these cases filed suit, against the National City Company, demanding rescission of their purchases of stock. Their claims were compromised or admitted; the taxpayers seek to link the recoveries resulting therefrom with their prior sales of the stock, which resulted in losses. The Tax Court did not find as matter of fact, and we decline to say as matter of law, that such a transaction is a 'sale or exchange' of a capital asset in the accepted meaning of those terms. Cf. Helvering v. Flaccus Leather Co., \n313 \nU.S. 247\n, 61 S.Ct. 878; Fairbanks v. United States, \n306 \nU.S. 436\n, 59 S.Ct. 607. In Helvering v.

Nebraska Bridge Supply & Lumber Co., \n312 \nU.S. 666\n, 61 S.Ct. 827, on which petitioner relies, we held as matter of law that losses resulting from a sale were not to be denied the benefits of the capital losses provisions because the sale was a forced or involuntary one, as upon foreclosure. Those cases are no aid to petitioner here.\n Petition for rehearing is denied.\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS dissents. \n\n\n\n","37":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDOUGLAS v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE(1944)\nNo. 130\nArgued: March 7, 1944Decided: May 15, 1944\n\n\n\n Mr. Kimball B. DeVoy, of Minneapolis, Minn., for petitioners. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 275, 276]\n\u00a0\n Miss Helen R. Carloss, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Commissioner of Internal Revenue assessed income tax deficiencies against the petitioners for the year 1937, because of their failure to include in income for that year sums required to be reported by the terms of Article 23(m)-10(c) of Treasury Regulations 94, issued pursuant to Section 23(m), Revenue Act of 1936. The facts were not in dispute. Bessie P. Douglas, the petitioner in Nos. 130 and 131, was in 1929 co-owner with Adeline R. Morse, Charles H. Robinson, and Irene B. Robinson Cirkler of an iron ore mine in St. Louis County, Minnesota, known as the Pettit mine. The petitioners in No. 132 are the executors of the estate of Charles H. Robinson, and the petitioner in No. 133 is the transferee of the assets of the estate of Irene B. Robinson Cirkler, deceased. \n1\n In 1929 its co-owners leased this mine to the Republic Steel Corporation. The lease, as amended in 1933, ran for a term of thirty years, but the lessee was given the power to cancel it at the end of eight years. The lessee undertook to pay a royalty of 40 cents a ton for the ore removed and guaranteed minimum royalties of $20,000 a year for the first five years and $40,000 a year thereafter, subject after \n\n[322 \nU.S. 275, 277]\n\u00a0\n five years to the payment of $60,000 a year as a minimum during the time it failed to remove certain water from the mine. In case the guarantee required the lessee to pay in any one year for more ore than it actually removed, it was entitled to have the excess payment applied against removals in later years. The lessee paid the minimum royalties each year, but it removed no ore at all, and as of July 1, 1937, at the end of the eight year period, it surrendered the lease. Each lessor took a proper depletion deduction in the respective years the royalties were paid, 1929 to 1936, inclusive. In the year 1933, Bessie P. Douglas claimed a depletion deduction of $4,958.05, but since she had sustained a net loss of $13,947.51, this deduction did not affect her tax liability. The Commissioner required all of the deductions to be taxed as income in 1937. The Board of Tax Appeals affirmed his conclusion, except as to the 1933 deductions by Bessie P. Douglas, which was reversed. 46 B.T.A. 943. Upon appeals by the taxpayers and, in No. 131, by the Commissioner, the Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the original assessments. 8 Cir., 134 F.2d 762. We granted petitions for writs of certiorari to settle a question reserved by our decision in Herring v. Commissioner, \n293 \nU.S. 322, 328\n, 55 S.Ct. 179, 181, as to cost depletion, and to consider an issue similar to that involved in Dobson v. Commissioner, \n320 \nU.S. 489\n, 64 S.Ct. 239.\n The Revenue Act of 1913, Section II(G)(b), 38 Stat. 173, granted a deduction for depletion based solely on actual production and 'not to exceed 5 per centum of the gross value at the mine of the output for the year.' Under this Act, advance royalties were taxed without deduction for depletion. In 1916 Congress removed the 5% ceiling, but the deduction was still limited to the year of actual extraction. Revenue Act of 1916, Section 5(a) Eighth (b), 39 Stat. 759. The relevant parts of the depletion section reached substantially their present form in the Revenue Act of 1918,  234(a)(9), 40 Stat. 1078, which, like the 1916 Act, authorized 'a reasonable allow- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 275, 278]\n\u00a0\n ance for depletion ... under rules and regulations to be prescribed' with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury; but the 1918 Act no longer limited the allowance to the product actually mined and sold during the year. The section now reads as follows:\n'Sec. 23. Deductions from gross income.\n\n'In computing net income there shall be allowed as deductions:\n\n'(m) Depletion. In the case of mines, oil and gas wells, other natural deposits, and timber, a reasonable allowance for depletion and for depreciation of improvements, according to the peculiar conditions in each case; such reasonable allowance in all cases to be made under rules and regulations to be prescribed by the Commissioner, with the approval of the Secretary. In any case in which it is ascertained as a result of operations or of development work that the recoverable units are greater or less than the prior estimate thereof, then such prior estimate (but not the basis for depletion) shall be revised and the allowance under this subsection for subsequent taxable years shall be based upon such revised estimate. ...' Revenue Act of 1936, c. 690, 49 Stat. 1648, 1658-1660, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code,  23(m).\n\n From the beginning of income taxation, as now, the regulations covered the conventional situations of payments for ores as mined and made provision for depletion measured by the volume actually extracted. The 1918 Act permitted the new regulations, Regulations 45, Article 215(c), to provide for the first time a deduction in the year of receipt of advance royalties of a depletion allowance calculated on the unit value of the mineral in place. This met a frequently recurring variation from the normal lease. As a corollary the regulations required that in case a lease was surrendered before the lessee had extracted all the ore for which advance royalties had been \n\n[322 \nU.S. 275, 279]\n\u00a0\n paid, a sum equal to the depletion allowance previously granted on such ore should be taxed as income in the year of the surrender of the lease. The bonus or advanced royalty regulations have remained practically unchanged since 1919.2 The subsections applicable to prepaid royalties are as follows:\n'Art. 23(m)-10. Depletion-Adjustments of accounts based on bonus or advanced royalty.\n\n'(b) If the owner has leased a mineral property for a term of years with a requirement in the lease that the lessee shall extract and pay for, annually, a specified number of tons, or other agreed units of measurement, of such mineral, or shall pay, annually, a specified sum of money which shall be applied in payment of the purchase price or royalty per unit of such mineral whenever the same shall thereafter be extracted and removed from the leased premises, an amount equal to that part of the basis for depletion allocable to the number of units so paid for in advance of extraction will constitute an allowable deduction from the gross income of the year in which such payment or payments shall be made; but no deduction for depletion by the lessor shall be claimed or allowed in any subsequent year on account of the extraction or removal in such year of any mineral so paid for in advance and for which deduction has once been made.\n\n'(c) If for any reason any such mineral lease expires or terminates or is abandoned before the mineral which \n\n[322 \nU.S. 275, 280]\n\u00a0\n has been paid for in advance has been extracted and removed, the lessor shall adjust his capital account by restoring thereto the depletion deductions made in prior years on account of royalites on mineral paid for but not removed, and a corresponding amount must be returned as income for the year in which the lease expires, terminates, or is abandoned.' Treasury Regulations 94, promulgated under the Revenue Act of 1936\n\n\n\n The deficiency here assessed falls squarely under the subsections. Their validity is therefore the decisive issue. In our opinion the regulations are valid.\n Since the revenue acts have not forbidden recognition of bonus or advanced royalties as a basis for the calculation of appropriate depletion, the provision of the regulations for a depletion offset against their receipt is within the broad rule-making delegation of Section 23(m). Royalty or bonus payments in advance of actual extraction of minerals are, like sales after severance or royalty payments on actual production, gross income and not a recovery of capital.

Congress has allowed a recovery of the capital invested in a mine but, except in discovery of percentage depletion in special instances which are not here involved, see Section 114, allowed nothing beyond that investment. Sections 23(m) and (n), 113, 114, 49 Stat. 1648, 1660, 1682-1687, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code  23(m, n), 113, 114. Deduction is allowed for the exhaustion of the property-the ore mass. Lynch v.

It may be in step with extraction, where extraction and sale synchronize with payments for the ore or the deduction may be allowed against advance payments of royalties or bonus. The theory of depletion is the same in both cases. In either situation, the depletion deduction is allowed in the ore extracted or expected to be extracted.

Thus the mine owner under Article 23(m)-10 is compensated for the use of his mineral reserves in the production of gross income.\n By the 1919 Regulations, the plan of restoring the sum of depletion deductions to capital and carrying a corresponding amount to income in the year of the termination of a lease without production was adopted instead of a permanent reduction of basis or a restoration of the depletion deductions to income for the years in which they were deducted. The Act- Sec. 23(m)-did not specifically authorize this handling of unrealized depletion. By the terms of the section a reasonable allowance for depletion was required, 'according to the peculiar conditions in each case.' As Congress obviously could not foresee the multifarious circumstances which would involve questions of depletion, it delegated to the Commissioner the duty of making the regulations. Article 23(m)-10(c) was developed to take care of the type of situation where because of a lease's cancellation without extraction, the reason for allowing depletion disappeared. As no diminution occurred in the ore mass, no depletion was appropriate. Congress has enacted numerous revenue acts since that time and has seen no occasion to change the statutory delegation of authority to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue which is the basis of this long standing regulation. This evidences that subsections 23(b)-10(b) and (c) are within the rule-making authority which was intended to be granted the Commis- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 275, 282]\n\u00a0\n sioner. National Lead Co. v. United States, \n252 \nU.S. 140, 145\n, 146 S., 40 S. Ct. 237-239; Murphy Oil Co. v. Burnet, \n287 \nU.S. 299, 307\n, 53 S.Ct. 161, 163.\n As no depletion of the ore mass occurred or can occur under the lease which produced the gross income, the issue is not whether the regulation gives a reasonable allowance for depletion when prepaid royalties are involved. That issue has been decided in favor of the validity of such allowances in other cases. Herring v. Commissioner, \n293 \nU.S. 322\n, 55 S.Ct. 179; Murphy Oil Co. v. Burnet, \n287 \nU.S. 299\n, 53 S.Ct. 161. The problem here is the validity of Article 23(m)-10(c) when the depletion for which a deduction has been previously allowed fails in the manner anticipated as a possibility at the time of deduction.\n A. Petitioners attack the validity of the regulation on the ground that the restoration of the accumulated deductions to capital, i.e., the depletion basis, with a corresponding increase of the taxpayers' annual income for the year of the restoration, is contrary to the requirements of certain sections of the 1936 Act. Sections 23(m), 114(b)(1) and 113(b)(1)( B). It is unnecessary to appraise the effect in other years of the antecedents of these sections. Petitioners urge that the depletion deductions which were the untaxed portion of the royalties paid in prior years were capital recoveries in those prior years which resulted in a statutory, permanent reduction of basis which cannot be restored to basis and hence cannot be treated as income for 1937. Petitioners point to Section 23(m), page 3 supra, as providing for the deduction for depletion on payment of advance royalties. It is contended that Sections 114(b)(1) and 113(b)(1)(B)3 supplement the statutory direction \n\n[322 \nU.S. 275, 283]\n\u00a0\n of 23(m) for depletion by requiring the permanent lowering of the basis to reflect the depletion which Section 23 offers. \n4\n This, of course, is a contention that depletion for advance royalties is, as a matter of statute, not necessarily and inevitably tied to extraction, actual or prospective. Summarily expressed, it is that the depletion was permanent, not conditional, and not subject to recovery when it became clear that no minerals were to be extracted.\n To accept these arguments as a sound interpretation of the meaning of these provisions, however, would put into Section 23(m) of the Act of 1936 a requirement for depletion against advance royalties which the words of Section 114 do not import. We think the Government is correct in its argument that the adjustment of basis authorized by Section 113(b)(1)(A) includes a restoration of depletion to capital account (basis) under the words 'or other items, \n\n[322 \nU.S. 275, 284]\n\u00a0\n properly chargeable to capital account,' when the termination of the lease without extraction of ore forces the reconsideration of depletion. Consequently, we hold that Sections 23(m), 114(b)(1) and 113(b)(1)(B) do not affect the power of the Commissioner under Section 23(m) to restore to the basis the amounts previously deducted in accordance with Article 23(m)- 10(b) of Regulations 94. The taxpayer who receives advance royalties receives a gross income but has no statutory right to depletion apart from actual or prospective extraction. To grant irrecoverable depletion in circumstances where cancellation of the lease occurs prior to extraction would sever depletion from extraction and, if no later extraction followed, deflect income into the capital account without any corresponding capital loss.\n B. Petitioners vigorously press another argument against the validity of the regulations. This is that the separate annual instalments of untaxed royalties (prior depletion deductions), since these untaxed portions of the royalties were income for the prior years, may not be accumulated and taxed for 1937 because such treatment is fictional, distorts the 1937 income to petitioners' detriment, is unreasonable and violates Sections 23(m), 41 and 42 of the Act, 26 U.S.C.A.Int.Rev.Code,  23(m), 41, 42. The latter two sections require the computation of income, net and gross, upon the basis of an annual accounting period and the inclusion of gross income in the year received by the taxpayer. The applicability of all three sections depends upon whether a sum equal to depletion deductions allowed in prior years may be treated as income for 1937. Petitioners deny that this may be done and rely for the soundness of their position upon the familiar principle of annual computation of income, 'as the net result of all transactions within the year.' Burnet v. Sanford & Brooks Co., \n282 \nU.S. 359, 365\n, 51 S.Ct. 150, 152. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 275, 285]\n\u00a0\n It is true that the advanced royalties were income to the taxpayers for the respective years in which they were received. A certain portion of each of such payments was, however, properly deducted from this income for depletion under Article 23(m)-10(b). In accordance with our position and conclusion, as set out in the paragraphs under the preceding section A of this opinion, such deductions were not finally charged to basis but were tentatively so charged, subject to the contingency that there should occur under the lease an actual extraction of mineral units which would be allocable to the deduction. Under subsection (c) there was the further requirement that if the contingency failed, the suspended sums should fall into income in the year that the failure was manifested by the termination of the lease. It seems entirely proper for the Commissioner not only to provide for a reasonable allowance for depletion when advance royalties are paid but also to provide for the situation when the expected depletion did not take place. Annual deductions were made by the taxpayer from his income. These were allowed to compensate for the exhaustion of capital. An event occurred in 1937, the termination of the lease, which restored the deductions for depletion to income. This requirement is, we think, within the delegation of authority to the Commissioner. The power delegated to him to make regulations for depletion must necessarily include power to provide for situations where the anticipated depletion of the mineral mass does not occur.\n The manner in which the Commissioner exercised that power by attributing the sums restored to basis to the 1937 income, rather than to the years 1929 to 1936, is not invalid as an arbitrary penalty or an improper attribution under the theory of an annual period for determination of income taxes. On the termination of the lease, the \n\n[322 \nU.S. 275, 286]\n\u00a0\n lessee surrendered the right to extract without royalty the ore for which royalty had been prepaid. This surrender returned to the taxpayer in 1937 a legal right. Thereupon the taxpayer was in position to again sell the right to extract this ore or to mine that self-same ore itself. The record does not show any valuation of this right which the lessee surrendered. The lessee paid for the right the amount attributed to the petitioners' income. Irrespective of the actual value of the right in 1937, it does not seem unfair for a general regulation to put this value on the right restored to the taxpayer in the year of its restoration. The decisions uphold the regulation. Sneed v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 5 Cir., 119 F.2d 767, 770, 771; Id., 5 Cir., 121 F.2d 725; Lamont v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 8 Cir., 120 F.2d 996; Grace M. Barnett v. Com'r, 39 B. T.A. 864.5 \n\n[322 \nU.S. 275, 287]\n\u00a0\n The restoration of the right to petitioners in 1937 is analogous to the surrender of a leasehold, improved by the lessee, to the lessor. In such a case, the value of the improvements is income to the lessor at the time of the surrender. Helvering v. Bruun, \n309 \nU.S. 461\n, 60 S.Ct. 631. Cf. Maryland Casualty Co. v. United States, \n251 \nU.S. 342\n, 40 S. Ct. 155.\n C. The last contention of petitioners for our consideration is that where depletion deductions were taken in years when no equivalent tax benefit resulted, the amount of the deduction which resulted in no tax benefit should not be attributed to the year of the surrender of the lease. This question arises only in No. 131. The Board of Tax Appeals refused to allow the addition to the 1937 income of the taxpayer of sums which represented the amount of deductions for depletion beyond amounts of deductions which offset income. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed.\n Upon this last point, the decision below in No. 131 is affirmed by an equally divided court. The members of this Court who join in the dissent do not reach this question but their position on other issues results in their voting for a reversal of the entire judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals. Two other members of this Court are of the view that in No. 131 the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be reversed and that the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals should be affirmed.\n In Nos. 130, 132 and 133, the foregoing leads us to the conclusion that the regulations are valid and the judgments of the Circuit Court of Appeals are\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice JACKSON took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice RUTLEDGE, dissenting.\n In my opinion Article 23(m)-10(c) is not a reasonable exercise of the rule-making authority conferred by Section 23. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 275, 288]\n\u00a0\n By that section Congress provided: 'In computing net income there shall be allowed as deductions ... a reasonable allowance for depletion ... according to the peculiar conditions in each case ... under rules and regulations to be prescribed by the Commissioner, with the approval of the Secretary.' Revenue Act of 1936, 49 Stat. 1648, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code  23(m). (Emphasis added.) Since adoption of the Revenue Act of 1918 this authority has been executed in part by Regulation 45, Article 215(c), and its successors, which permit the deduction in years when advance royalties are received. It is not urged, nor could it well be, that the deduction in such circumstances is not one comprehended by the statute. In making that mandate Congress clearly did not intend the privilege to be granted merely on terms which would defeat its operation. Yet this, in my judgment, is exactly the effect of Article 23(m)-10(c).\n In requiring that 'a corresponding amount must be returned as income for the year in which the lease expires, terminates, or is abandoned,' the regulation piles up as 'income' for a single year the sum of all the deductions taken in the previous ones. Wholly apart from whether in theory or in fact 'income' can be said to be realized by thus piling up the deductions,1 this requirement imposes risks and burdens upon taking the deduction heavier than any advantage to be gained from it and therefore prohibitive.\n The consequences hardly could be illustrated better than by the case of Bessie P. Douglas. By taking the deduction during the eight years when she received advance royalties, 1929 to 1936 inclusive, she saved a total in taxes of about $7,000. Then her lease was canceled by the lessee. And in 1937, a year in which she received no cash return from the lease, her tax liability was increased by \n\n[322 \nU.S. 275, 289]\n\u00a0\n about $26,500 for having taken the deduction in previous years. She was thus forced to pay approximately $19,500 more in taxes than if she had never taken it.\n The regulation's destructive effect bears on all who receive advance royalties, not merely on those who actually must return accumulated prior deductions as 'income' in a single year. The taxpayer must take the deduction, if at all, as his royalties accrue, not later as the ore is removed. The system of annual accounting is said to require this. Cf. Burnet v. Thompson Oil & Gas Co., \n283 \nU.S. 301, 306\n, 51 S.Ct. 418, 420; Burnet v. Sanford & Brooks Co., \n282 \nU.S. 359\n, 51 S.Ct. 150. Yet it is said also to require that the deductions be telescoped into 'income' for a single year in which the returns they represent are not received, and with an effect in tax burden, by the mere fact of the aggregation, far beyond any which would be imposed if the deductions never had been authorized or taken. Hence all who receive advance royalties are faced with the choice of taking the deductions and thus risking this pyramiding of 'income,' against the chance the lessee will some day deplete the property, or of foregoing the deductions altogether.\n It is true the taxpayer may receive an economic benefit in the release of his ore from the right of another to remove it. And by the regulation's requirement that he restore to his capital account an amount equal to the sum of the accumulated deductions, he also receives a possible future tax benefit in larger deductions allowable if and when he sells or leases the minerals again. But these benefits are wholly uncertain. In fact, release of his ore from the right of removal gives him not income then realized in cash to the amount of accumulated deductions, but unsold ore in the ground which the lessee has found it unprofitable to remove although he has paid for it. The only contingency on which the taxpayer really benefits by the deductions is in the event the lessee ultimately does deplete the property. But it is difficult to \n\n[322 \nU.S. 275, 290]\n\u00a0\n believe Congress deliberately extended the opportunity for deduction to lessors whose property is not in fact depleted by the lessee's operations2 only to authorize the Commissioner to nullify and penalize that opportunity. This the regulation does, in effect, when it imposes on one who takes the deduction the risk, on a contingency beyond his control, of having to pay in taxes several times the amount of the deductions on the happening of the contingency.\n Nor is the regulation reasonable adapted to recoupment of the losses in revenue, wholly proper when incurred but which later events require to be made up. On the contrary, it perverts recoupment by pyramiding income spread in receipt over many years into 'income' received in a single, entirely different one. And in a day when the tax rate mounts more often than yearly the skyrocketing effect of the process operates with wholly incalculable effect on the taxpayer, who it will be noted has no control over the contingency which brings it into play.\n A regulation which would require the taxpayer to pay the taxes deducted for the prior years together with the usual interest and penalties would be harsh enough in discouragement of taking the deduction. In effect it would penalize one who rightfully takes an allowance as much as one who wrongfully does so. But, even so, this would bear some semblance of reasonable relation to recouping the losses sustained by the revenue and to allocating income to the year in which it is received. However, to amalgamate the deductions into 'income' for a single year, in which none of it is actually received, is an entirely different thing. It is to make of the so-called scheme of deductions a snare for the unwary who violate no law \n\n[322 \nU.S. 275, 291]\n\u00a0\n but comply with it fully; and at the same time to strain the theory of annual accounting beyond any reasonable application.\n The regulation, therefore, both effectively nullifies a privilege which Congress provided the taxpayer shall have and reaches farther than any reasonable recouping provision should go. It is no answer to say deduction is a privilege which Congress need not have extended, or having extended can qualify out of existence. The question is whether Congress did, or authorized the Commissioner to do, the latter. Its language, its prior treatment of this problem3 and its treatment of a related problem in the identical section of the Revenue Act all point to the conclusion it did neither.\n Other questions are raised on the record. It is unnecessary to consider them. In my opinion Congress would not have nullified its grant of the privilege to take 'a reasonable allowance for depletion' by enacting Article 23(m)-10(c) to make exercising it so hazardous, capricious, and unjust in consequence. \n4\n That being true, I do not think authority was delegated to the Commissioner to adopt or to the Secretary to approve it. I would reverse the judgment.\n Mr. Justice MURPHY joins in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Bessie P.

Petitioners' point is that whatever may be the validity of the regulations, taxpayers should not have their depletion deductions, for the years when the Commissioner's acquiescence was in effect, carried to income in a later year. We agree that these decisions held invalid a regulation like Art. 23(m)-10(c) which includes in income for a taxable year deductions allowed in prior years. The effect of the Commissioner's acquiescence is uncertain. Cf. C.B. XIII- 2-IV. During the period of acquiescence, the regulation continued in existence and was republished n the edition of December 1, 1931, approved February 15, 1929, of Regulations 74 under the Revenue Act of 1928, Art. 236(c).

Acquiescence by the Commissioner in a Tax Court ruling followed by action which is inconsistent with the withdrawal of an affected regulation is not a sufficiently definite administrative practice to justify a judicial ruling against the regulation on the strength of the acquiescence.

U. S.(1944)\nNo. 105\nArgued: Decided: February 7, 1944\n\n\n\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York.\n Mr. Charles B. Cotterill, of New York City, for appellants.\n Mr. Robert L. Pierce, of Washington, D.C., for appellees the United States and Interstate Commerce Commission.\n Messrs. Luther M. Walter, Nuel D. Bel. nap, and John S. Burchmore, all of Chicago, Ill., for intervener, National Industrial Traffic League.\n\n Mr. Justice RUTLEDGE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellants are motor carrier associations who seek to put into effect proposed rate schedules in order to meet \n\n[321 \nU.S. 194, 195]\n\u00a0\n rail competition. The schedules cover transportation of hard surface floor covering, e.g., linoleum, from points in New England and Middle Atlantic states to various destinations in Middle Western states. The Interstate Commerce Commission, three Commissioners dissenting, rejected the schedules. 34 M.C.C. 641. In so doing it upheld the previous conclusion of its Division 3. 31 M.C.C. 193. A three-judge District Court, 28 U.S.C.  47, 28 U.S.C.A.  47, sustained the Commission's decision. 48 F.Supp. 432. The appeal, under 28 U.S.C.  47a, 345, 28 U.S.C.A.  47a, 345, brings the decree here for review. Eastern-Central is the principal appellant. We think the judgment must be reversed.\n When the schedules were filed, the motor carriers' rates on carpeting generally were based on minimum weights varying between 16,000 and 20,000 pounds, roughly approximating a truckload. Below this weight the rate was equivalent to 70 per cent of first class. Above it the rate varied somewhat, in the neighborhood of 45 to 50 per cent of first class. Corresponding rail rates then were 70 per cent of first class for shipments of less than 30,000 pounds, (less than carload lots) and 45 per cent for larger shipments. Thus, the differential according to weight was geared in the one case to rail carload capacity and in the other to truckload capacity. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Conceiving that these structures gave the railroads an undue competitive advantage on larger shipments, appellants proposed specific rates designed to enable them to \n\n[321 \nU.S. 194, 196]\n\u00a0\n compete with the railroads for such shipments. They sought to utilize a new minimum weight. The rates tendered were approximately the equivalent of 70 per cent of first class for shipments of less than 20,000 pounds, 47. 5 per cent for 20,000 to 30,000 pounds, and 45 per cent for 30,000 pounds or more. The schedules therefore substantially put rail and motor rates on the same plane for less than 20,000 and more than 30,000 pounds; but placed motor rates substantially lower than rail rates for shipments of 20, 000 to 30,000 pounds.\n Certain western rail carriers protested. Thereupon the proposed rates were made the subject of investigation and suspension proceedings. 49 U.S. C.  316(d), (g), 49 U.S.C.A.  316(d, g), 49 Stat. 558-560, 54 Stat. 924. Hearings were begun before Division 3. While they were pending appellants agreed to make applicable in connection with their proposed rate, minimum 30,000 pounds, a tariff provision that such shipments 'must be received at and transported from the point of origin from one shipper in one day and on one bill of lading.' \n2\n The rail protestants therefore presented no evidence and after the hearing withdrew their protest. While the proceedings were pending the rail carriers also reduced their rates minimum 30,000 pounds to 42.5 per cent of first class.\n The hearings continued and appellants presented evidence which showed, among other things, that one motor carrier, Brady Transfer and Storage Company, of Fort Dodge, Iowa, had received 'since these rates were suspended, four loads from the Western Trunk Line Territory, instead of 398, and three of those we haven't collected the charges on, because the rate was too high ....' It appeared too that the eastbound movement consists largely of dairy products, requiring refrigeration. The \n\n[321 \nU.S. 194, 197]\n\u00a0\n bulk of the westbound movement is frozen or salted fish.\n Division 3 made findings and conclusions first that, based upon the costs proven and comparison with motor carriers' rates on numerous commodities, the proposed rates 45 per cent were 'just and reasonable provided the minimum that is applicable in connection therewith is reasonable.' Accordingly it examined the reasons advanced in support of the proposed minimum of 30,000 pounds.\n On this, it found in No. M-14453 that linoleum shipments which move by rail to the Ohio points generally are consigned to warehouses having rail sidings, while linoleum is tendered to the appellant motor carriers in quantities weighing from 18,000 pounds upward. If found also, and the finding is not questioned, that it is physically impossible to load 30,000 pounds of linoleum into a single unit of equipment operated by appellants. While some of it can transport 25,000 pounds, 'the normal trucking load of linoleum approximates 22,000 pounds.' Rejecting appellants' contention based on Carpets and Carpeting from Official to Southern Territory, 237 I. C.C. 651, the Division stated:\n'The Commission has found repeatedly that carload minimum weights should be established by rail carriers with reference to the loading capacity of their freight cars and has condemned minimum weights in excess of the loading possibilities of the rail equipment. The respondents ( appellants here) have not presented to us a valid reason from the point of view of economy in transportation or otherwise, such as we have found to exist in connection with certain trainload movements,4 why they \n\n[321 \nU.S. 194, 198]\n\u00a0\n should be permitted to establish a minimum weight greater than is physically possible to load in the motor equipment usually used by them, and, in our opinion, no such reason exists. Strictly speaking, the proposed minimum weight of 30,000 pounds is not a truckload minimum weight but rather is a volume minimum weight, which necessitates the use of more than one unit of equipment to load and transport that quantity of linoleum. We adopt as a policy the condemnation as unreasonable of a volume minimum weight, unless it is shown clearly that, as a result thereof, motor carriers can handle the traffic at the volume minimum weight at costs per 100 pounds which are less than the costs incurred at a reasonable truckload minimum weight.' (Italics supplied.)\n\n The Division then found that, on the record, a reasonable truckload minimum on linoleum is 20,000 pounds and there was no showing of operating economies which would result if the proposed rates were restricted to apply only when 30,000 pounds are tendered. It concluded that the proposed schedules 'are just and reasonable and otherwise lawful except to the extent that they propose to establish a minimum of 30,000 pounds; that the proposed minimum of 30,000 pounds is unjust and unreasonable; and that a minimum of 20,000 pounds would be just and reasonable.' The proposed schedules therefore, to the extent found not just and reasonable, were ordered cancelled 'without prejudice to the establishment ... of truckload rates on linoleum, minimum 20,000 pounds, which are not less than 45 per cent of the corresponding first-class rates.' 31 M.C.C. 193.\n Thereafter oral argument was had before the full Commission. At this stage the National Industrial Traffic League intervened and supported the Division's position. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n[321 \nU.S. 194, 199]\n\u00a0\n The Commission affirmed the Division's findings 'that the proposed rates 45 and 47.5 per cent of first class are not unjust or unreasonable except to the extent that the proposed rates, 45 per cent of first class, are subject to a minimum of 30,000 pounds.' Both rates, it said, 'are within the zone of reasonableness.' But 'the proposed rates, minimum 30,000 pounds, would give an unjust advantage to shippers of 30,000 pound lots and be unjustly discriminatory to shippers of 20,000-pound lots.' Since at that time the tariffs disclosed appellants' rates were either 45 or 47.5 per cent of first class, minimum 20,000 pounds, no order for the future was made. The Commission, in concluding its discussion, said:\n'We are mindful of the fact that we approved certain (motor carrier) rates subject to a minimum weight of 30,000 pounds on linoleum in Carpets and Carpeting, Official to Southern Territory, supra. However, our report therein expresses our doubt as to the propriety of establishing a minimum of 30,000 pounds in connection with the proposed column 45 basis because it would require more than one unit of equipment to transport 30,000 pounds. That report was issued over a year ago and now we are convinced that not only were our doubts as expressed therein well founded, but that for the future we shall follow the policy announced in the prior report herein with respect to minimum weight in excess of the loading capacity of the equipment customarily used by the motor carriers.' (Italics supplied.)\n\n The District Court, sustaining the Commission's findings and decision, 6 held that the extent to which competi- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 194, 200]\n\u00a0\n tion should be recognized in arriving at just rates is a matter, within reasonable limits, for the expert judgment of the Commission and that, in exercising its discretion, that body had met the requirements of Section 216(i) of the Motor Carrier Act. \n7\n 49 U.S.C.  316(i), 49 U.S.C.A.  316(i).\n\n\n I.\n\n\n Notwithstanding the apparent difference between the Division and the full Commission, in the former's view that the proposed rate minimum 30, 000 pounds is unreasonable and the latter's that it is both unreasonable and unduly discriminatory, the net effect is that the rate is unlawful, as a matter of policy which condemns all volume minimum rates unless it is clearly shown they will operate at costs per 100 pounds less than the costs incurred at reasonable loading capacity rates. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 194, 201]\n\u00a0\n Whether this policy is now intended to apply to all forms of transportation, rail, motor and water, without regard to competitive conditions affecting two or more of them, is not clear from the abbreviated reports made in this case. But their casting of the matter in terms of unqualified policy, dependent only upon proof of the required reduction in operating costs, gives both appearance and substance to the view this may be true, if not with respect to all carriers, then certainly with reference to motor carriers. If so the effect will be, as appellants urge, not to make reduction in costs merely one factor, nor indeed even the most important factor, in determining the reasonableness and discriminatory or contrary character of rates. It will be rather to make reduction in costs the exclusive criterion, eliminating all other considerations, including competitive conditions amounting to necessity. That is true, notwithstanding the Commission's report, immediately prior to stating its adoption of the policy announced by the Division, gave expression in an abstract way to a directly contrary principle, namely, 'the extent to which competition between carriers may render discrimination and prejudice not unlawful must be decided upon the facts in each case.' \n8\n The latter statement, taken \n\n[321 \nU.S. 194, 202]\n\u00a0\n literally, squarely contradicts the policy unless indeed the statement was intended to qualify it in situations not indicated or contained an implicit limitation from context that the only 'facts in each case' which would be material are those which would prove a reduction in costs.\n That the purpose was not to qualify the policy seems apparent, not only from the latter's unqualified formulation and adoption and from the failure to intimate in what types of situation the qualification might operate, but also from two other considerations. One is that the statement was followed immediately by the broad and conclusive declaration, in general terms, without supporting data or reasons, except as supplied by the policy itself, that 'the competition between rail and motor carriers for linoleum traffic does not constitute such a dissimilarity in circumstances and conditions as to render legal the proposed discrimination.' The statement was not limited to the particular competitive situation. In terms it applied to all between rail carriers and motor carriers. In short, the policy, and therefore the single factor that there was no evidence to show reduction in cost, was the sole criterion of decision. Other facts, including competitive disadvantage, became irrelevant. And the significance of the pol- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 194, 203]\n\u00a0\n icy's application becomes more manifest by virtue of the fact that the case, though presented and decided on its own record, was regarded and determined as a test case. \n9\n Finally, the Commission's review of its previous decisions, upon which appellants relied, shows, we think, that its purpose, in the case of motor carriers at any rate is to adhere strictly to the policy and, in the manner made, may be taken to indicate that it contemplates no departure whatever. If so, the effect of the decision is not merely to adopt 'a policy of administration,' as the Commission and the intervenors before it assert; but is rather to adopt, as a rule of law, the principle that only upon a showing of reduction in operating costs may a volume minimum rate be found reasonable and not unduly discriminatory.\n\n\n II.\n\n\n The Commission considered chiefly previous decisions in Carpets and Carpeting from Official to Southern Territory, supra; Molasses from New Orleans, La., to Peoria and Pekin, Ill., 235 I.C.C. 485; and Petroleum Rail Shippers' Ass'n v. Alton & S.R.R., 243 I.C.C. 589. In the Molasses case, notwithstanding the Commission's previous refusal to authorize rail volume rates for more than carload lots at less than carload rates, it approved a multiple car rate, minimum 1,800 tons, on molasses which was lower than the carload rate. The effect was to authorize a lower rate to a number of carloads tendered as a single shipment. The departure was made to enable the \n\n[321 \nU.S. 194, 204]\n\u00a0\n rail carriers to meet water competition. However, there was a showing that in the circumstances a material saving in costs per 100 pounds would be made in transporting such multiple-car shipments. In the Petroleum Shippers' case the Commission considered authorizing multiple-car rates on petroleum, but declined to do so upon finding that the record did not establish existence of a substantial cost saving in such shipments.\n In the Carpets and Carpeting case the Commission approved certain rates subject to a minimum weight of 30,000 pounds on linoleum. In doing so, it said:\n'We are not convinced that it would be reasonable for the motor carriers to establish a minimum of 30,000 pounds in connection with the postponed column 45 basis, because it would require more than one unit of equipment to transport 30,000 pounds. On this record, however, we are not prepared to say that the column 45 rates, minimum 30,000 pounds, where not lower than the corresponding proposed rail-water carload rates, would be unlawful, provided that a rule is made applicable in connection therewith to the effect that shipments of not less than 30,000 pounds actually will be received at and transported from the point of origin from one shipper in one day and on one bill of lading.' 237 I.C.C. 651, 657, 658.\n\n And in Peanut Butter from Montgomery, Ala., to Georgia, 22 M.C.C. 375, Division 2, although declaring in one breath that motor carriers should not maintain volume rates subject to minimum weights greater than equipment generally available can transport, in the next noted that the national motor-freight classification is replete with such ratings, refused to condemn them and said that if they were restricted to apply only when tendered by one shipper, in one day and on one bill of lading, they would be 'in consonance with Carpets and Carpeting from Official to Southern Territory, supra.' \n\n[321 \nU.S. 194, 205]\n\u00a0\n III.\n These cases disclose departures, though tentatively made, from the Commission's long-standing10 policy in the same respect, adopted when its powers extended only to rail carriers. Influenced primarily by the desire to secure shipping advantages for the small shipper equal to those given the large one and thus to enforce the policy of the interstate commerce legislation against undue discrimination, the Commission at first declined to adopt wholesale rates. \n11\n The major departure was in allowing lower rates for carload lots than for less-than-carload shipments. This was justified by the difference in costs. Accordingly, the structure became fixed with this as the major and for long the only differential; and with it the principle that such a saving in operations alone justifies a differential. That policy received judicial approval12 and remained controlling so long as the Commission had authority only over railroads.\n But with the evolution of other forms of carriage, particularly motor carriage, and the Commission's acquisition of control over their rates and operations, a new situation arose. The Commission's task no longer was merely the regulation of a single form of transport, to secure reasonable and nondiscriminatory rates and service. It became, not merely the regulator, but to some extent the \n\n[321 \nU.S. 194, 206]\n\u00a0\n coordinator of different modes of transportation. With the addition of motor and water carriage to its previous jurisdiction over rails, it was charged not only with seeing that the rates and services of each are reasonable and not unduly discriminatory, but that they are coordinated in accordance with the National Transportation Policy, as declared by the later legislation. \n13\n This, while intended to secure the lowest rates consistent with adequate and efficient service and to preserve within the limits of the policy the inherent advantages of each mode of transportation, at the same time was designed to eliminate destructive competition not only within each form but also between or among the different forms of carriage.\n Necessarily the impact of these changes brought problems the Commission previously had not faced. Necessarily too the Commission in facing them, including those of adjustment among the various forms of transportation, called upon its previous experience in the railroad field for guidance to its judgment. But that experience could not apply fully to the other and different forms of carriage. Nor could it do so always when the interests of two or more \n\n[321 \nU.S. 194, 207]\n\u00a0\n were found in conflict. Each form of transportation presents, by reason of its peculiar operating conditions, its own problems for the function of rate making. And each, by virtue of competition with others, presents additional complications arising from the varied circumstances of their operation. Hence, in such situations, principles previously established for application within a single form of transportation cannot always be transplanted to control its relations with another or those of both with the public generally, without consequences unduly harmful to one or to the public interest.\n Thus, in the problem presented by this case, application of the principle that volume minimum rates will be allowed only when geared to a capacity loading which makes possible a real saving in costs of operation, may be made within either the railroad area or the motor area without substantial disturbance or difficulty. Each has its unit of carriage or loading and that unit has a substantial relation to costs; hence, upon the long-established railroad principle, to reasonableness and the discriminatory or nondiscriminatory character of rates. But, as between rails and motors, the two units are different. And the two forms of carriage compete, unless the lower rates geared to the respective units are of a character that each forces the other form of carriage from the field. The junction of difference in available units, with rates geared to them, and the fact of competition or competitive possibility produces or may produce consequences neither the character of the unit nor the fact of competition, nor both together, could create in either form of service taken alone. In short, the very fact a rail carload is 30,000 pounds and a truckload 20,000, with rates respectively tied to these weights, may make a life-or-death difference in the competitive struggle, with consequences affecting not only the carriers but the public interest as well. And appellants' \n\n[321 \nU.S. 194, 208]\n\u00a0\n argument that a 30,000-pound minimum is necessary to meet rail competition is necessary to meet rail competition is at least consonant with the frequent recognition, both by the Commission and by this Court, that there are occasions when it is appropriate for the former to consider a carriers' need to meet other carriers' competition as a factor justifying what otherwise would be an unreasonable or an unduly discriminatory rate. \n 14\n\u00a0\n\n But whether and to what extent competition may have destructive effect, or other consequences hurtful to the public interest, in a particular situation may depend not merely on the difference in sizes of units, but on other factors. Each form of carriage has some inherent advantages over the others, such as mobility, speed, normal volume capacity, etc. Purely legal restrictions, such as limitations upon tonnage placed on trucks by state laws, create like or contrary effects. Whether, in a particular situation, the mere difference in loading capacity or some other or others of the many important factors affecting competitive position will be controlling depends upon the character of, and the factors involved in, that situation. And this is as true of one form of transportation as of another when, but for rate structures geared solely to costs of operation, it comes within a competitive tangent.\n\n\n IV.\n\n\n In such a situation, therefore, to tie rate differentials exclusively to minimum weights based on available unit size conceivably might allocate all shipments of that size to the form of transportation to which it appertains. Or, if the effect were less extensive, still it might impose conditions upon the competition unduly burdensome or not required by the competitive situation and the applicable statutory policies. Thus, appellants say the Commis- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 194, 209]\n\u00a0\n sion's ruling has such consequences in this case, namely, to force them to make the 45 per cent rate available on shipments between 20,000 and 30,000 pounds, thus placing the railroads at a disadvantage on such tonnages and compelling the motor carriers to reduce their rates on them below what the competition requires; or to compel them to forego an equality of rate with the railroads on shipments of 30,000 pounds and more by charging only the one rate of 47.5 per cent on all shipments of 20,000 pounds and more. From these alternatives it is charged the consequence is to force the truckers 'out of that very large field of traffic' and allocate it to the railroads. Whether this is the effect or not, we have no means of knowing on this record. Nor can we tell, other than by sheer acceptance of the Commission's conclusion, in the form of its statement of the result and cryptic formulation of the policy on which it is rested, whether the proposed rates will give the motor carriers an undue competitive advantage as to shipments of 20,000 to 30,000 pounds, whether there will be discrimination in fact between classes of shippers, or whether though these things may result in the particular situation they will do so only by virtue of its peculiar features or by virtue of its conformity to conditions generally prevailing in regions competitive as between rail and motor carriers.\n These, and other questions of like import, remain unanswered upon the record. The problem is novel. It is not free from complexity, as appears from the Commission's hesitant departures from, then its return to, the long-established railroad rule, in inter-carrier situations. Further, the matter is one of general importance. It affects not only shipments of linoleum, and motor carriers, but many kinds of shipment and all kinds of carriers within the Commission's jurisdiction. It may touch vitally the public interest. It involves, to some extent, the important task of reconciling previously established rail- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 194, 210]\n\u00a0\n road policies with, or adapting them to, the requirements of the presently effective National Transportation Policy and its application to a coordinated transportation system. Upon a matter of such consequence and complexity, our function in review cannot be performed without further foundation than has been made.\n We do not mean by this to imply that the result the Commission has reached would not be sustained if a sufficient basis were supplied in the record. We do not undertake to determine what result the Commission should reach. But we cannot say the one at which it has arrived has the sanction of law without further basis than we now have. This in itself requires reversal. Consequently we need not speak concerning appellants' other contentions, except insofar as the pertinence of some of them to the necessary further proceedings requires.\n\n\n V.\n\n\n Appellants' broadest contention must be rejected at this stage. It is, in effect, that as a matter of law, in the particular circumstances competitive necessity becomes the controlling consideration, and costs of operation, that is the requirement that minimum volume rates be geared to loading capacity, become immaterial. That view must be rejected for the same reason as requires rejection, on this record and until further buttressed, of the Commission's converse view that costs exclusively control and competition becomes immaterial. Conceivably particular circumstances might make one or the other factor predominant and, in such a situation, the choice would be for the Commission to make, upon a proper weighing of the facts and opposing policies possibly applicable. Whether in any case this contention of appellant could be accepted may be doubtful. Certainly it should not be in advance of further action by the Commission and then only in circum- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 194, 211]\n\u00a0\n stances which would justify it as being in the public interest so clearly that no other view would be tenable.\n Appellants also say that as a matter of law there could be no unjust discrimination in the present circumstances, since they insist there is no showing, upon the facts, that different classes of shippers would be affected. On the contrary they assert that all shippers actually are in the same class and all are free to avail themselves of the alternative rates above 20,000 and 30,000 pounds, 47.5 per cent and 45 per cent, respectively, as they please. But the only bases for this assertion are, first, the absence of any finding that the availability of the 45 per cent rate, minimum 30,000 pounds, 'would in practical effect be confined to only a few or a particular class of shippers' and the further assertion that no such finding could be made, since 30,000-pound shipments of linoleum 'are the normal units of quantity purchase and sale as revealed by the railroad carload rates which apply between the same localities only on shipments of 30,000 pounds.' Obviously, as the Commission noted, the mere existence of these rates in the tariffs hardly could be taken to prove the conclusion appellants sought to draw from that fact. Certainly it could not be taken as conclusive evidence. Whether or not, however, the proposed rates in fact would operate to create an undue discrimination between shippers, or classes of them, is a matter upon which the record factually throws no light. It is therefore one for further examination by the Commission.\n In returning the case we emphasize that we do not question the Commission's authority to adopt and apply general policies appropriate to particular classes of cases, so long as they are consistent with the statutory standards which govern its action and are formulated not only after due consideration of the factors involved but with sufficient explication to enable the parties and ourselves to \n\n[321 \nU.S. 194, 212]\n\u00a0\n understand, with a fair degree of assurance, why the Commission acts as it does. Cf. United States v. Carolina Freight Carriers Corp., \n315 \nU.S. 475, 488\n, 489 S., 62 S.Ct. 722, 729, 730. Observance of this requirement is as necessary when an established policy is being extended to new and significant situations as when a new policy is being formulated and applied in the first instance. We do not undertake to tell the Commission what it should do in this case. That is not our function. We only require that, whatever result be reached, enough be put of record to enable us to perform the limited task which is ours.\n The judgment is reversed.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER, with whom the CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice REED concur, dissenting.\n This case in its essentials can be reduced to simple terms; in effect, the question is whether the Interstate Commerce Commission acted unlawfully in holding unreasonable and discriminatory a proposed schedule of rates for the shipment of linoleum in trucks operated by members of appellants, associations of motor carriers. The facts are these. On linoleum shipments between points in New England, New Jersey, Delaware, Pennsylvania, and New York, and destinations in Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, and South Dakota, the members of the Eastern Central Motor Carriers Association charged 50% of first-class rates, minimum 20, 000 pounds. \n1\n This minimum is approximately the weight which conventionally is a truck-load. Railroad rates on linoleum at this time were 70% of first- class for shipments of less than 30,000 pounds and 45% of first-class for those \n\n[321 \nU.S. 194, 213]\n\u00a0\n weighing at least 30,000 pounds-a The Division thereupon concluded that a\n By schedules filed to become effective August 24th, 1940, Eastern proposed rates of 47.5% of first-class, minimum 20,000 pounds, and 45% of first-class, minimum 30,000 pounds. The practical effect of this change would be to require a shipper who could send only 20,000 pounds of linoleum to pay a higher rate than one who could ship a consignment of 20, 000 and 10,000 pounds. And two shippers, one with 10,000 pounds and the other with 20,000 pounds could combine their shipments at the lower rate, while a shipper of 10,000 pounds who could not conveniently join with others would have to pay the higher rate. These are the changes here in controversy. Upon the protest of the western trunk line rail carriers, later withdrawn when the appellants agreed that their 30,000 pound minimum rate would apply only on shipments 'received at and transported from the point of origin, from one shipper in one day and on one bill of lading', operation of the proposed schedules was suspended and Division 3 of the Commission held hearings to determine their validity. Upon their conclusion, Division 3 found that the proposed rates were reasonably compensatory, but that it was physically impossible to load 30,000 pounds of linoleum into a single unit of equipment, and that there was no showing that operating economies result when a 30,000 pound minimum shipment involving a truckload and fraction of another truckload is tendered. The Division thereupon concluded that minimum weight greater than a truckload is unreasonable unless such a rate is justified by savings in cost, and ordered the proposed schedules cancelled to the extent found unjust and unreasonable. 31 M.C.C. 193.\n This decision was fully reviewed by the entire Commission upon oral and printed arguments by the motor car- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 194, 214]\n\u00a0\n riers, the linoleum shippers and the National Industrial Traffic League, a group organized to promote the free interchange of commerce. The shippers and the Traffic League urged the Commission to leave the order of Division 3 undisturbed, while the motor carriers sought to justify the rates as legitimate means of meeting rail competition. The Commission agreed with Division 3 that the rates were unreasonable and held that the 30,000 pound minimum, based on no difference in transportation cost, would be discriminatory. 34 M.C.C. 641.\n If the sole issue were whether there would be discrimination in favor of the 30,000 pound lot shipper as against the 20,000 pound lot shipper, clearly the Commission could find as it did, and the court below properly did not undo what the Commission did. 48 F.Supp. 432. Is there in fact more? The appellants contend that rail competition excuses and legalizes the discrimination beyond the Commission's power to condemn. This Court does not yield to that claim, but it does hold that either the Commission must state with particularity why the evidence of competitive conditions in this record is so vague and inadequate as to afford no justification for discrimination, or, in effect, requires the Commission to proceed with a full-dress investigation of the entire competitive relations between motor and rail carriers.\n The Commission, on the basis of the evidence before it, concluded that 'The competition between rail and motor carriers for linoleum traffic does not constitute such a dissimilarity in circumstances and conditions as to render legal the proposed discrimination'. Prior decisions of this Court surely do not require greater explication of the reasons on which the Commission's conclusions are based. See Beaumont, S.L. & W.R. Co. v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 74, 86\n, 87 S., 51 S.Ct. 1, 5, 6; United States v. Baltimore & O.R. Co., \n293 \nU.S. 454, 464\n, 465 S., 55 S.Ct. 268, 272, 273. The Commission did not adopt an inflexible 'principle that volume minimum rates \n\n[321 \nU.S. 194, 215]\n\u00a0\n will be allowed only when geared to a capacity loading which makes possible a real saving in costs of operation', if its statement that 'The extent to which competition between carriers may render discrimination and prejudice not unlawful must be decided upon the facts in each case' is to be accepted. Burke has said somewhere that he could not imagine English law without the law reports. Substantially the same considerations that call for giving reasons in rendering judicial decisions apply to the determinations of such agencies as the Interstate Commerce Commission. 'We must know what a decision means before the duty becomes ours to say whether it is right or wrong.' See United States v. Chicago, M., St. P. & P.R. Co., \n294 \nU.S. 499, 511\n, 55 S.Ct. 462, 467. But we should not be more exacting of reports of the Interstate Commerce Commission explaining its orders than we are of the opinions of lower courts whose judgments come before us for review.\n Nothing in this record calls for more explicitness than is ordinarily demanded. For nothing in the record requires the Commission to discuss the conceivable validity of proposed schedules which, aside from competitive conditions, are manifestly discriminatory. Such discriminatory rates were supported by a bare recital that railroad rates were nominally lower than motor carrier rates and that the business of one motor carrier had decreased. At the hearing before the Division, a representative of one motor carrier stated that the proposed rates were more than adequate to cover costs, that they did not vary substantially from rates imposed on the shipment of other comparable commodities, and that railroad competition had caused his company's linoleum business to decline. He also testified that his firm competed for linoleum shipments with other motor- carriers. This is the proposed justification for a rate differential concededly based on no difference in transportation cost or in service rendered and which therefore discriminates between those who ship 30,000 pound lots and \n\n[321 \nU.S. 194, 216]\n\u00a0\n those who ship 20,000 pound lots. And the record becomes even more barren when it is noted that the competitive conditions said to require adoption of the proposed discriminatory tariffs were not such as to prevent the rail carriers' acquiescence in the adoption of the new schedule when, on appellants' theory, the rail carriers had advantages intended to be mitigated by the new rates. The Commission found that either 47.5% or 45% was an allowable rate for either a 30,000 or 20,000 pound shipment-either rate 'was within the zone of reasonableness.' It thereby permitted the motor carriers to compete on an entire equality with the rail carriers. But it forbade discrimination as between linoleum shippers equally placed. What the appellants really complain of is not that they cannot meet the railroad competition at the 45% rate on 30,000 pound lots, but that they cannot do so and yet collect 47.5% on lots of 20,000 pounds which are outside rail competition. Be that as it may, a mere arithmetic difference between railroad rates and motor carrier rates is quite blind. The rates themselves may not be at all revealing on competitive conditions; they may not tell what a shipper gets for his money and what he is paying for. That is, the quality of the service, the advantages of one type of service over the other, the availability of equipment, safety, labor cost, and many other factors may all give significance to the figures that figures themselves do not give.\n The present ruling apparently imposes upon the Commission the duty of pursuing such complicated and far-reaching investigations every time a motor carrier rate that may have a relation to a railroad rate is found to be discriminatory in relation to another motor carrier rate affecting the same commodity. Such an investigation is an undertaking of vast scope involving consideration of factors which it would require an expert merely to catalogue. The different characteristics of rail and motor carrier serv- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 194, 217]\n\u00a0\n ices, the economic wisdom of excluding motor carriers from large-bulk linoleum trade or limiting their participation in such trade, the availability of other commodity shipments to replace linoleum trade diverted to rail carriers, the availability of and cost of transporting commodities which might be used to fill the truck only partially loaded with linoleum-these are only a few of the factors which may become relevant. Compare III-B Sharfman, The Interstate Commerce Commission, pp. 572 et seq. The appellants introduced no evidence on the basis of which the Commission could intelligently weigh these considerations. To hold that the Commission must on its own initiative embark on such an investigation in a proceeding of this nature is to impose what may well be a crippling burden.\n To speak more particularly of the task which the Commission now faces, it should be noted that Eastern files tariffs with the Commission for about 650 carrier members. A typical commodities clause from the carriers' certificates of public convenience and necessity provides for the shipment of 'General commodities, except those of unusual value, and except dangerous explosives, household goods as defined in Practices of Motor Common Carriers of Household Goods, 17 M.C.C. 467, commodities in bulk, commodities requiring special equipment, and those injurious or contaminating to other lading, over regular routes ....' Thus it appears that the exceptions are few and the allowable shipments many. An investigation of the scope apparently required by the Court would entail a detailed study of the relations of the rate structures in a case merely involving the rates on specific commodities one to the other. If rail competition turns out to be actually detrimental to the successful operation of appellants' linoleum business, the war-time load on the railroads might become relevant, and the Commission might have to decide whether the atypical circumstances at this time \n\n[321 \nU.S. 194, 218]\n\u00a0\n justify competitive discriminatory rates which might otherwise be unreasonable.\n That the Commission is an expert body to which Congress has seen fit to commit the regulation of the intricate relationships between the various means of national transportation is a well-worn phrase which ought not to lose its significance in practice when the actions of the Commission come here for review. We should be very reluctant to define for the Commission the occasions which appropriately demand investigation of general transportation problems, and more particularly when a contest over the rate on a particular commodity included in a network of tariffs calls for such a general investigation. Surely it is within the special competence of the Commission to put on a discriminating carrier the duty of justifying by proof his plain discrimination as to a particular rate and not permit him to compel the Commission by a mere assertion to embark upon a far-flung inquiry. There are undoubtedly occasions when the Interstate Commerce Commission will undertake such an investigation in the public interest. But it ought not to be compelled to do so upon the occurrence, from an administrative point of view, of a more or less accidental filing of a tariff revision. When the carrier seeks to supplant a lawful rate, as is the case here, the burden is on it to supply all the essential information to justify the proposed new rate.  216(g), Part II of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.  316(g), 49 U.S.C.A.  316(g). If it does not do so, it has failed to sustain the duty cast upon it by law, and the Commission in so finding has duly exercised its authority. The Commission's dispositions of Molasses from New Orleans, La., to Peoria and Pekin, Ill., 235 I.C.C. 485 and Petroleum Rail Shippers' Ass'n v. Alton & S.R.R., 243 I.C.C. 589, are entirely consistent, so far as that is relevant, with its order in this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] So it was found, in each instance, upon the evidence, and the finding is not disputed. The figures are only approximate; that is, 30,000 pounds represents not an exact carload capacity, since differences in loading characteristics of commoditions and slight differences in carload capacities may make possible loading slightly more or less in a car. Similar, perhaps somewhat wider, variations affect trucks. The findings were that 20,000 pounds reasonably can be viewed as a minimum weight geared to truckload capacity, though in some instances as much as 22,000 or 25,000 pounds actually can be loaded in one vehicle. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Cf.

The appearance here is by virtue of an order granting a motion to intervene. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The decree dismissed appellants' bill to set aside and enjoin enforcement of the Commission's order of suspension. The court (48 F.Supp. 433) agreed that the proposed rate of 45 per cent., minimum 30,000 pounds, is 'a mere adoption on a volume basis of rates for railroad carload lots,' having 'no relation to the business of the motor carriers,' both because there was no showing of any saving in operating costs when carrying more than 20,000 pounds and because there was none that a 45 to 47.5 rate, for anything beyond 20,000 pounds 'would not enable them to maintain reasonable competition with the railroads.' As to the finding that rates of either 45 or 47.5 per cent., minimum 20,000 pounds, would not in themselves be unreasonable, the court said this 'does not negative the finding of an unjust advantage to shippers of 30,000 pound lots in cases where shippers of 20,000 pound lots are not given the same treatment.' \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] The court found that the Commission had met the section's requirements 'in that it has given 'due consideration ... to the inherent advantages of transportation by such carriers, (and) ... to the need, in the public interest, of adequate and efficient transportation service by such carriers at the lowest cost consistent with the furnishing of such service ...'.' No specific reference was made, however, to the over-all national transportation policy, or its requirements particularly in relation to the Commission's duty 'to ... foster sound economic conditions ... among the several carriers; to encourage the establishment and maintenance of reasonable charges, ... without ... unfair or destructive competitive practices; ... all to the end of developing, coordinating, and preserving a national transportation system by water, highway, and rail ....'

C.I.R.(1944)\nNo. 492\nArgued: Decided: March 27, 1944\n\n\n\n Rehearing Denied April 24, 1944\n\n\n See \n322 \nU.S. 767\n, 64 S.Ct. 941. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 560, 561]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John L. Grant, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. Chester T. Lane, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question in this case is whether petitioner, a mutual life insurance company, was entitled to deduct from its gross income for 1933 'excess interest dividends' paid within that year. The deduction was authorized if the amounts were 'interest' paid on 'indebtedness'1 within the meaning of  203(a)(8) of the Revenue Act of 1932, 47 Stat. 169, 225, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, pages 547, 548. The Tax Court denied the deduction. 44 B.T.A. 293. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 137 F.2d 623. The case is here on a petition for a writ of certiorari which we granted because the decision below and Penn Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Commissioner, 92 F.2d 962, from the Third Circuit conflicted with Commissioner v. Lafayette Life Ins. Co., 67 F.2d 209, from the Seventh.\n The facts are stipulated and show the following: During and prior to 1933 petitioner issued life insurance policies which gave to the insured ( and in some cases to the beneficiary) the right to have petitioner hold the face amount of the policies upon their maturity under one or more of several optional modes of settlement in lieu of \n\n[321 \nU.S. 560, 562]\n\u00a0\n payment in a lump sum. These optional modes of settlement are exercised under supplementary contracts. Thus one form of supplementary contract provides that the amount of the policy shall be left on deposit with petitioner. And it is provided in case of this, as well as the other types of supplementary contracts which are involved,2 that 'if in any year the Society declares' that funds held under these options shall receive interest in excess of 3% per annum, the payments under them 'shall be increased for that year by an Excess Interest Dividend as determined and apportioned by the Society.' During the year 1933 some $534,000 of excess interest dividends was paid by petitioner under these supplementary contracts. The amount so paid accrued during the year at the rate which had been declared by petitioner's Board of Directors at the beginning of that year.\n Petitioner's argument runs as follows: Nothing in the supplementary contracts or underlying policies conditions the payment of excess interest dividends on the existence of a surplus. The policies and the statutes authorizing their issuance negative the idea that the payment of these excess interest dividends constitute a distribution of surplus or of earnings of prior years. Petitioner's declaration at the beginning of 1933 that it would pay excess interest dividends in that year at a specific rate constituted an offer. Those who elected in 1933 to keep the funds on deposit, rather than to withdraw the amounts of the policies which had become payable during the year, accepted that offer. It is reasonable to assume that but for the declaration at the beginning of the year the new supplementary contracts would not have been made. In at least some of the cases where the funds were already on \n\n[321 \nU.S. 560, 563]\n\u00a0\n deposit at the beginning of 1933 the beneficiaries could have withdrawn them on demand. By refusing to exercise that right and by leaving the funds on deposit the beneficiaries accepted petitioner's offer. And, it is again asserted, but for the declaration of excess interest dividends, it is reasonable to assume that petitioner would not have been permitted to retain and use those funds during that year. As to funds on deposit at the beginning of 1933 and over which the beneficiaries had no power of withdrawal, the argument is that the original promise to pay the excess interest dividends, though conditional, was a promise to pay 'interest'.3\n While these are interesting questions which are propounded, the facts on which most of them turn were not determined by the Tax Court. Its findings of fact did not go beyond the stipulation. And it apparently was not asked to go farther. It based its ruling on Penn Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Commissioner, supra. It may be that custom or a course of dealing or other circumstances would warrant findings of fact which would support at least part of the claimed deduction. But more proof is needed than the provisions of the policies and the contents of the stipulation. It is not our task to draw inferences from facts or to supplement stipulated facts. That function rests with the Tax Court. We may modify or reverse the decision of the Tax Court only if it is 'not in accordance with law.' 44 Stat. 110, 26 U.S.C.  1141(c)(1), 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code,  1141(c)(1); Wilmington Trust Co. v. Helvering, \n316 \nU.S. 164\n, 62 S.Ct. 984; Dobson v. Commissioner, \n320 \nU.S. 489\n, 64 S.Ct. 239. We must make our determination on the record before us. If relevant evidence was offered before the Tax Court but rejected by it, we could remand the case to it for appropriate findings. But no such situation is presented here. Accordingly we \n\n[321 \nU.S. 560, 564]\n\u00a0\n can reverse the judgment below only if we can say on the basis of the provisions of policies and the meager stipulation that the excess interest dividends were 'interest' within the meaning of the Act4 as a matter of law.\n The 'usual import' of the word interest is 'the amount which one has contracted to pay for the use of borrowed money.' Old Colony R. Co. v. Commissioner, \n284 \nU.S. 552, 560\n, 52 S.Ct. 211, 214; Deputy v. Du Pont, \n308 \nU.S. 488, 498\n, 60 S.Ct. 363, 368. We cannot say as a matter of law that the excess interest dividends fall within that category. They appear to be amounts which may be declared or withheld at the pleasure of the board of directors. An obligation to pay may of course arise after the declaration, the same as in case of dividends on stock. But an obligation to pay declared dividends on stock would hardly qualify as 'interest' within the meaning of the Act. The analogy of course is not perfect, as these excess interest dividends may not be payable from surplus or earnings of prior years and the obligation to pay the principal amount under each option was absolute. Yet payments made wholly at the discretion of the company have a degree of contingency which the notion of 'interest' ordinarily lacks. If we expanded the meaning of the term to include these excess interest dividends, we would indeed relax the strict rule of construction which has obtained in case of deductions under the various Revenue Acts. New Colonial Ins. Co. v. Helvering, \n292 \nU.S. 435, 440\n, 54 S.Ct. 788, 790; Deputy v. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 560, 565]\n\u00a0\n Du Pont, supra, 308 U.S. p. 493, 60 S.Ct. 366. Appropriate findings of fact might well bring such payments within the meaning of 'interest', as for example a finding that their declaration was the basis on which new contractual engagements were made. But such is not this case.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This provision of the Act reads in part as follows: 'In the case of a life insurance company the term 'net income' means the gross income less ... All interest paid or accrued within the taxable year on its indebtedness' with exceptions not relevant here. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The other types of optional settlements involved here are instalment options for a fixed period and instalment options in a fixed amount. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The amount of funds in each of these three categories does not appear, though petitioner has offered its rough estimates. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Sec. 163(a) of the Revenue Act of 1942, 56 Stat. 798, 868, 26 U.S.C. A. Int.Rev.Code,  201(c)(6), includes within the definition of 'interest paid' the following: 'All amounts in the nature of interest, whether or not guaranteed, paid within the taxable year on insurance or annuity contracts (or contracts arising out of insurance or annuity contracts) which do not involve, at the time of payment, life, health, or accident contingencies.' The Senate Report points out that this provision was designed to include both guaranteed interest and excess interest dividends. S. Rep.

Johnson, of Lincoln, Neb., for respondent.\n On Rule to Show Cause and Return.\n\n PER CURIAM.\n This case comes here on petitioner's application for leave to file in this Court his petition for writ of habeas corpus. Petitioner is confined in the Nebraska State Penitentiary under sentence for murder imposed by the Nebraska District Court.\n His present proceeding has been prefaced by several earlier applications to both state and federal courts. His petition for habeas corpus was denied without a hearing \n\n[321 \nU.S. 114, 115]\n\u00a0\n by the Nebraska District Court whose decision was affirmed by the Nebraska Supreme Court, Hawk v. O'Grady, 137 Neb. 639, 290 N.W. 911. This Court denied certiorari, \n311 \nU.S. 645\n, 61 S.Ct. 11. Petitioner then filed in the United States District Court for Nebraska a petition for habeas corpus, alleging matters not previously brought to the attention of the state courts. This application was denied without a hearing, and the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed on the ground that petitioner had not exhausted his state remedies, Hawk v. Olson, 130 F. 2d 910. We denied certiorari. \n317 \nU.S. 697\n, 63 S.Ct. 435. Petitioner then urged his present contentions upon the Nebraska Supreme Court in a petition for writ of habeas corpus which that Court denied without opinion. We denied his petition for habeas corpus upon like allegations but without prejudice to presentation of the matters alleged to the United States District Court, Ex parte Hawk, \n318 \nU.S. 746\n, 63 S.Ct. 979.\n Petitioner accordingly renewed his petition for writ of habeas corpus to the United States District Court for Nebraska and filed a like petition with the senior Circuit Judge for the Eighth Circuit; both petitions have been denied, and leave to appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit has been denied by the senior Circuit Judge of that circuit. Petitioner thereupon filed the present application in this Court.\n In the application now before us, and in those filed with the United States District Court and the senior Circuit Judge of the Eighth Circuit, petitioner alleges, among other things, that the state court forced him into trial for a capital offense, Neb.Comp.Stat.  28-401, with such expedition as to deprive him of the effective assistance of counsel, guaranteed by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Powell v. Alabama, \n287 \nU.S. 45\n, 53 S.Ct. 55, 84 A.L.R. 527; see Smith v. O'Grady, \n312 \nU.S. 329\n, 61 S.Ct. 572; compare Betts v. Brady, \n316 \nU.S. 455\n, 62 S.Ct. 1252, and that his conviction was based in part on the intro- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 114, 116]\n\u00a0\n duction at the trial of evidence known by the prosecution to be perjured, Mooney v. Holohan, \n294 \nU.S. 103\n, 55 S.Ct. 340, 98 A.L.R. 406.\n From our examination of the papers presented to us we cannot say that he is not entitled to a hearing on these contentions, Walker v. Johnston, \n312 \nU.S. 275\n, 284-287, 61 S.Ct. 574, 578, 579; Holiday v. Johnston, \n313 \nU.S. 342, 350\n, 550 S., 61 S.Ct. 1015, 1017; Waley v. Johnston, \n316 \nU.S. 101, 104\n, 105 S., 62 S.Ct. 964, 965, 966; Cochran v. Kansas, \n316 \nU.S. 255, 258\n, 62 S.Ct. 1068, 1070. But, as was pointed out by the District Court and Circuit Judge, petitioner has not yet shown that he has exhausted the remedies available to him in the state courts, and he is therefore not at this time entitled to relief in a federal court or by a federal judge.\n So far as appears, petitioner's present contentions have been presented to the state courts only in an application for habeas corpus filed in the Nebraska Supreme Court, which it denied without opinion. From other opinions of that court it appears that it does not usually entertain original petitions for habeas corpus, but remits the petitioner to an application to the appropriate district court of the state, from whose decision an appeal lies to the state Supreme Court, Williams v. Olson, Neb ., 8 N.W.2d 830, 831; see In re White, 33 Neb. 812, 814, 815, 51 N.W. 287. From that court the cause may be brought here for review if an appropriate federal question is properly presented.\n Of this remedy in the state court petitioner has not availed himself. Moreover, Nebraska recognizes and employs the common law writ of error coram nobis which, in circumstances in which habeas corpus will not lie, may be issued by the trial court as a remedy for infringement of constitutional right of the defendant in the course of the trial, Carlsen v. State, 129 Neb. 84, 94-98, 261 N.W. 339. Until that remedy has been sought without avail we cannot say that petitioner's state remedies have been exhausted.\n Ordinarily an application for habeas corpus by one detained under a state court judgment of conviction for \n\n[321 \nU.S. 114, 117]\n\u00a0\n crime will be entertained by a federal court only after all state remedies available, including all appellate remedies in the state courts and in this Court by appeal or writ of certiorari, have been exhausted. Tinsley v. Anderson, \n171 \nU.S. 101, 104\n, 105 S., 18 S.Ct. 805, 807; Urquhart v. Brown, \n205 \nU.S. 179\n, 27 S.Ct. 459; United States ex rel. Kennedy v.

And where those remedies have been exhausted this Court will not ordinarily entertain an application for the writ before it has been sought and denied in a district court or denied by a circuit or district judge. Ex parte Hawk, supra; Ex parte Abernathy, supra.\n The denial of relief to petitioner by the federal courts and judges in this, as in a number of other cases, appears to have been on the ground that it is a principle controlling all habeas corpus petitions to the federal courts, that those courts will interfere with the administration of justice in the state courts only 'in rare cases where exceptional circumstances of peculiar urgency are shown to exist.' (\n269 \nU.S. 13\n, 46 S. Ct. 3). See In re Anderson, 9 Cir., 117 F.2d 939, 940; In re Miller, 9 Cir., 126 F.2d 826, 827; Kelly v. Ragen, 7 Cir., 129 F.2d 811, 814, 815; Hawk v.

Murphy, 2 Cir., 108 F. 2d 861, 862. To this, some courts have added the intimation that when the writ is sought by one held under a state conviction the only remedy ordinarily to be had in the federal court is by way of application to this Court for habeas corpus. Ex parte Jefferson, 9 Cir., 106 F.2d 471, 472; Kramer v. Nevada, 8 Cir., 122 F.2d 417, 419; In re Miller, supra; Hawk v. Olson, supra, 130 F.2d at page 913; cf. Kelly v. Ragen, supra, 129 F.2d 814.\n The statement that the writ is available in the federal courts only 'in rare cases' presenting 'exceptional circumstances of peculiar urgency', often quoted from the opinion of this Court in United States ex rel. Kennedy v. Tyler, \n\n[321 \nU.S. 114, 118]\n\u00a0\n supra, \n269 \nU.S. 17\n, 46 S.Ct. 3, was made in a case in which the petitioner had not exhausted his state remedies and is inapplicable to one in which the petitioner has exhausted his state remedies, and in which he makes a substantial showing of a denial of federal right.\n Where the state courts have considered and adjudicated the merits of his contentions, and this Court has either reviewed or declined to review the state court's decision, a federal court will not ordinarily reexamine upon writ of habeas corpus the questions thus adjudicated. Salinger v. Loisel, \n265 \nU.S. 224\n, 230-232, 44 S.Ct. 519, 521-522. But where resort to state court remedies has failed to afford a full and fair adjudication of the federal contentions raised, either because the state affords no remedy, see Mooney v. Holohan, supra, \n294 \nU.S. 115\n, 55 S.Ct. 343, 98 A.L.R. 406, or because in the particular case the remedy afforded by state law proves in practice unavailable or seriously inadequate, cf. Moore v. Dempsey, \n261 \nU.S. 86\n, 43 S.Ct. 265; Ex parte Davis, \n318 \nU.S. 412\n, 63 S.Ct. 679, a federal court should entertain his petition for habeas corpus, else he would be remediless. In such a case he should proceed in the federal district court before resorting to this Court by petition for habeas corpus.\n As petitioner does not appear to have exhausted his state remedies his application will be denied without prejudice to his resort to the procedure indicated as appropriate by this opinion.\n Application denied. \n\n\n\n","41":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEX PARTE MITSUYE ENDO(1944)\nNo. 70\nArgued: October 12, 1944Decided: December 18, 1944\n\n\n\n\n[323 \nU.S. 283, 284]\n\u00a0\n Mr. James C.

Acting under that section we ordered the entire record to be certified to this Court so that we might proceed to a decision, as if the case had been brought here by appeal.\n Mitsuye Endo, hereinafter designated as the appellant, is an American citizen of Japanese ancestry. She was \n\n[323 \nU.S. 283, 285]\n\u00a0\n evacuated from Sacramento, California, in 1942, pursuant to certain military orders which we will presently discuss, and was removed to the Tule Lake War Relocation Center located at Newell, Modoc County, California. In July, 1942, she filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of California, asking that she be discharged and restored to liberty. That petition was denied by the District Court in July, 1943, and an appeal was prefected to the Circuit Court of Appeals in August, 1943. Shortly thereafter appellant was transferred from the Tule Lake Relocation Center to the Central Utah Relocation Center located at Topaz, Utah, where she is presently detained. The certificate of questions of law was filed here on April 22, 1944, and on May 8, 1944, we ordered the entire record to be certified to this Court. It does not appear that any respondent was ever served with process or appeared in the proceedings. But the United States Attorney for the Northern District of California argued before the District Court that the petition should not be granted. And the Solicitor General argued the case here.\n The history of the evacuation of Japanese aliens and citizens of Japanese ancestry from the Pacific coastal regions, following the Japanese attack on our Naval Base at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, and the declaration of war against Japan on December 8, 1941, 55 Stat. 795, 50 U.S. C.A.Appendix note preceding section 1, has been reviewed in Kiyoshi Hirabayashi v. United States, \n320 \nU.S. 81\n, 63 S.Ct. 1375. It need be only briefly recapitulated here. On February 19, 1942, the President promulgated Executive Order No. 9066, 7 Fed.Reg. 1407. It recited that 'the successful prosecution of the war requires every possible protection against espionage and against sabotage to nationaldefense material, national-defense premises, and national-defense utilities as defined in Section 4, Act of April 20, 1918, 40 Stat. 533, as amended by the Act of No- \n\n[323 \nU.S. 283, 286]\n\u00a0\n vember 30, 1940, 54 Stat. 1220, and the Act of August 21, 1941, 55 Stat. 655 (U.S.C., Title 50, Sec. 104).' And it authorized and directed 'the Secretary of War, and the Military Commanders whom he may from time to time designate, whenever he or any designated Commander deems such action necessary or desirable, to prescribe military areas in such places and of such extent as he or the appropriate Military Commander may determine, from which any or all persons may be excluded, and with respect to which, the right of any person to enter, remain in, or leave shall be subject to whatever restrictions the Secretary of War or the appropriate Military Commander may impose in his discretion. The Secretary of War is hereby authorized to provide for residents of any such area who are excluded therefrom, such transportation, food, shelter, and other accommodations as may be necessary, in the judgment of the Secretary of War or the said Military Commander, and until other arrangements are made, to accomplish the purpose of this order.'\n Lt. General J. L. De Witt, Military Commander of the Western Defense Command, was designated to carry out the duties prescribed by that Executive Order. On March 2, 1942, he promulgated Public Proclamation No. 1 (7 Fed.Reg. 2320) which recited that the entire Pacific Coast of the United States 'by its geographical location is particularly subject to attack, to attempted invasion by the armed forces of nations with which the United States is now at war, and, in connection therewith, is subject to espionage and acts of sabotage, thereby requiring the adoption of military measures necessary to establish safeguards against such enemy operations.' It designated certain Military Areas and Zones in the Western Defense Command and announced that certain persons might subsequently be excluded from these areas. \n\n[323 \nU.S. 283, 287]\n\u00a0\n On March 16, 1942, General De Witt promulgated Public Proclamation No. 2 which contained similar recitals and designated further Military Areas and Zones. 7 Fed.Reg. 2405\n\n\n On March 18, 1942, the President promulgated Executive Order No. 9102 which established in the Office for Emergency Management of the Executive Office of the President the War Relocation Authority. 7 Fed.Reg. 2165. It recited that it was made 'in order to provide for the removal from designated areas of persons whose removal is necessary in the interests of national security.' It provided for a Director and authorized and directed him to 'formulate and effectuate a program for the removal, from the areas designated from time to time by the Secretary of War or appropriate military commander under the authority of Executive Order No. 9066 of February 19, 1942, of the persons or classes of persons designated under such Executive Order, and for their relocation, maintenance, and supervision.' The Director was given the authority, among other things, to prescribe regulations necessary or desirable to promote effective execution of the program.\n Congress shortly enacted legislation which, as we pointed out in Kiyoshi Hirabayashi v. United States, supra, ratified and confirmed Executive Order No. 9066. See 320 U.S. at pages 87-91, 63 S.Ct. at pages 1379-1381. It did so by the Act of March 21, 1942, 56 Stat. 173, 18 U.S.C.A.  97a, which provided: 'That whoever shall enter, remain in, leave, or commit any act in any military area or military zone prescribed, under the authority of an Executive order of the President, by the Secretary of War, or by any military commander designated by the Secretary of War, contrary to the restrictions applicable to any such area or zone or contrary to the order of the Secretary of War or any such military commander, shall, if it appears that he knew or should \n\n[323 \nU.S. 283, 288]\n\u00a0\n have known of the existence and extent of the restrictions or order and that his act was in violation thereof, be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be liable to a fine of not to exceed $5,000 or to imprisonment for not more than one year, or both, for each offense.'\n Beginning on March 24, 1942, a series of 108 Civilian Exclusion Orders1 were issued by General De Witt pursuant to Public Proclamation Nos. 1 and 2. Appellant's exclusion was effected by Civilian Exclusion Order No. 52, dated May 7, 1942. It ordered that 'all persons of Japanese ancestry, both alien and non-alien' be excluded from Sacramento, California,2 beginning at noon on May 16, 1942. Appellant was evacuated to the Sacramento Assembly Center on May 15, 1942, and was transferred from there to the Tule Lake Relocation Center on June 19, 1942. \n\n[323 \nU.S. 283, 289]\n\u00a0\n On May 19, 1942, General De Witt promulgated Civilian Restrictive Order No. 1 (8 Fed.Reg. 982) and on June 27, 1942, Public Proclamation No. 8. 7 Fed.Reg. 8346. These prohibited evacuees from leaving Assembly Centers or Relocation Centers except pursuant to an authorization from General De Witt's headquarters. Public Proclamation No. 8 recited that 'the present situation within these military areas requires as a matter of military necessity' that the evacuees be removed to 'Relocation Centers for their relocation, maintenance and supervision', that those Relocation Centers be designated as War Relocation Project Areas, and that restrictions on the rights of the evacuees to enter, remain in, or leave such areas be promulgated. These restrictions were applicable to the Relocation Centers within the Western Defense Command3 and included both of those in which appellant has been confined-Tule Lake Relocation Center at Newell, California, and Central Utah Relocation Center at Topaz, Utah. And Public Proclamation No. 8 purported to make any person who was subject to its provisions and who failed to conform to it liable to the penalties prescribed by the Act of March 21, 1942. \n\n[323 \nU.S. 283, 290]\n\u00a0\n By letter of August 11, 1942, General De Witt authorized the War Relocation Authority4 to issue permits for persons to leave these areas. By virtue of that dele gation5 and the authority conferred by Executive Order No. 9102, the War Relocation Authority was given control over the ingress and egress of evacuees from the Relocation Centers where Mitsuye Endo was confined. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n[323 \nU.S. 283, 291]\n\u00a0\n The program of the War Relocation Authority is said to have three main features: (1) the maintenance of Relocation Centers as interim places of residence for evacuees; (2) the segregation of loyal from disloyal evacuees; (3) the continued detention of the disloyal and so far as possible the relocation of the loyal in selected communities. \n7\n In connection with the latter phase of its work the War Relocation Authority established a procedure for obtaining leave from Relocation Centers. That procedure, so far as indefinite leave8 is concerned, presently provides9 as follows: \n\n[323 \nU.S. 283, 292]\n\u00a0\n Application for leave clearance is required. An investigation of the applicant is made for the purpose of ascertaining 'the probable effect upon the war program and upon the public peace and security of issuing indefinite leave' to the applicant. \n10\n The grant of leave clearance does not authorize departure from the Relocation Center. Application for indefinite leave must also be made. Indefinite leave may be granted under 14 specified conditions. 11 For example, it may be granted (1) where the applicant proposes to accept an employment offer or an offer of support that has been investigated and approved by the Authority; or (2) where the applicant does not intend to work but has 'adequate financial resources to take care of himself' and a Relocation Officer has investigated and approved 'public sentiment at his proposed destination', or (3) where the applicant has made arrangements to live at a hotel or in a private home approved by a Relocation \n\n[323 \nU.S. 283, 293]\n\u00a0\n Officer while arranging for employment; or (4) where the applicant proposes to accept employment by a federal or local governmental agency; or (5) where the applicant is going to live with designated classes of relatives.\n But even if an applicant meets those requirements, no leave will issue when the proposed place of residence or employment is within a locality where it has been ascertained that 'community sentiment is unfavorable' or when the applicant plans to go to an area which has been closed by the Authority to the issuance of indefinite leave. \n12\n Nor will such leave issue if the area where the applicant plans to reside or work is one which has not been cleared for relocation. \n13\n Moreover, the applicant agrees to give the Authority prompt notice of any change of employment or residence. And the indefinite leave which is granted does not permit entry into a prohibited military area, including those from which these people were evacuated. \n14\n\u00a0\n\n Mitsuye Endo made application for leave clearance on February 19, 1943, after the petition was filed in the District \n\n[323 \nU.S. 283, 294]\n\u00a0\n Court. Leave clearance15 was granted her on August 16, 1943. But she made no application for indefinite leave. \n16\n\u00a0\n\n Her petition for a writ of habeas corpus alleges that she is a loyal and law-abiding citizen of the United States, that no charge has been made against her, that she is being unlawfully detained, and that she is confined in the Relocation Center under armed guard and held there against her will.\n It is conceded by the Department of Justice and by the War Relocation Authority that appellant is a loyal and law-abiding citizen. They make no claim that she is detained on any charge or that she is even suspected of disloyalty. Moreover, they do not contend that she may \n\n[323 \nU.S. 283, 295]\n\u00a0\n be held any longer in the Relocation Center. They concede that it is beyond the power of the War Relocation Authority to detain citizens against whom no charges of disloyalty or subversiveness have been made for a period longer than that necessary to separate the loyal from the disloyal and to provide the necessary guidance for relocation. But they maintain that detention for an additional period after leave clearance has been granted is an essential step in the evacuation program. Reliance for that conclusion is placed on the following circumstances.\n When compulsory evacuation from the West Coast was decided upon, plans for taking care of the evacuees after their detention in the Assembly Centers, to which they were initially removed, remained to be determined. On April 7, 1942, the Director of the Authority held a conference in Salt Lake City with various state and federal officials including the Governors of the inter-mountain states. 'Strong opposition was expressed to any type of unsupervised relocation and some of the Governors refused to be responsible for maintenance of law and order unless evacuees brought into their States were kept under constant military surveillance.' \n17\n Sen. Doc. No. 96, supra, note 7, p. 4. As stated by General De Witt in his report to the Chief of Staff: 'Essentially, military necessity required only that the Japanese population be removed from the coastal area and dispersed in the interior, where the danger of action in concert during any attempted enemy raids along the coast, or in advance thereof as preparation for a full scale attack, would be eliminated. That the evacuation program necessarily and ultimately developed into one of complete Federal supervision, was due primarily to the \n\n[323 \nU.S. 283, 296]\n\u00a0\n fact that the interior states would not accept an uncontrolled Japanese migration.' Final Report, supra, note 2, pp. 43-44. The Authority thereupon abandoned plans for assisting groups of evacuees in private colonization and temporarily put to one side plans for aiding the evacuees in obtaining private employment. \n18\n As an alternative the Authority 'concentrated on establishment of Government-operated centers with sufficient capacity and facilities to accommodate the entire evacuee population.' Sen.Doc. No. 96, supra, note 7, p. 4. Accordingly, it undertook to care for the basic needs of these people in the Relocation Centers, to promote as rapidly as possible the permanent resettlement of as many as possible in normal communities, and to provide indefinitely for those left at the Relocation Centers. An effort was made to segregate the loyal evacuees from the others. The leave program which we have discussed was put into operation and the resettlement program commenced. \n19\n\u00a0\n\n It is argued that such a planned and orderly relocation was essential to the success of the evacuation program; that but for such supervision there might have been a \n\n[323 \nU.S. 283, 297]\n\u00a0\n dangerously disorderly migration of unwanted people to unprepared communities; that unsupervised evacuation might have resulted in hardship and disorder; that the success of the evacuation program was thought to require the knowledge that the federal government was maintaining control over the evacuated population except as the release of individuals could be effected consistently with their own peace and well-being and that of the nation; that although community hostility towards the evacuees has diminished, it has not disappeared and the continuing control of the Authority over the relocation process is essential to the success of the evacuation program. It is argued that supervised relocation, as the chosen method of terminating the evacuation, is the final step in the entire process and is a consequence of the first step taken. It is conceded that appellant's detention pending compliance with the leave regulations is not directly connected with the prevention of espionage and sabotage at the present time. But it is argued that Executive Order No. 9102 confers power to make regulations necessary and proper for controlling situations created by the exercise of the powers expressly conferred for protection against espionage and sabotage. The leave regulations are said to fall within that category.\n First. We are of the view that Mitsuye Endo should be given her liberty. In reaching that conclusion we do not come to the underlying constitutional issues which have been argued. For we conclude that, whatever power the War Relocation Authority may have to detain other classes of citizens, it has no authority to subject citizens who are concededly loyal to its leave procedure.\n It should be noted at the outset that we do not have here a question such as was presented in Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall. 2, or in Ex parte Quirin, \n317 \nU.S. 1\n, 63 S.Ct. 2, where the jurisdiction of military tribunals to try persons according to the law of war was challenged in habeas corpus proceedings. \n\n[323 \nU.S. 283, 298]\n\u00a0\n Mitsuye Endo is detained by a civilian agency, the War Relocation Authority, not by the military. Moreover, the evacuation program was not left exclusively to the military; the Authority was given a large measure of responsibility for its execution and Congress made its enforcement subject to civil penalties by the Act of March 21, 1942. Accordingly, no questions of military law are involved.\n Such power of detention as the Authority has stems from Executive Order No. 9066. That order is the source of the authority20 delegated by General De Witt in his letter of August 11, 1942. And Executive Order No. 9102 which created the War Relocation Authority purported to do no more than to implement the program authorized by Executive Order No. 9066.\n We approach the construction of Executive Order No. 9066 as we would approach the construction of legislation in this field. That Executive Order must indeed be considered along with the Act of March 21, 1942, which ratified and confirmed it (Kiyoshi Hirabayashi v. United States, supra, 320 U.S. at pages 87-91, 63 S.Ct. at pages 1379-1381) as the Order and the statute together laid such basis as there is for participation by civil agencies of the federal government in the evacuation program. Broad powers frequently granted to the President or other executive officers by Congress so that they may deal with the exigencies of war time problems have been sustained. \n21\n And the Constitution when it committed to the Executive and to Congress the exercise of the war power necessarily gave them wide scope for the exercise of judgment and \n\n[323 \nU.S. 283, 299]\n\u00a0\n discretion so that war might be waged effectively and successfully. Kiyoshi Hirabayashi v. United States, supra, 320 U.S. at page 93, 63 S.Ct. at page 1382. At the same time, however, the Constitution is as specific in its enumeration of many of the civil rights of the individual as it is in its enumeration of the powers of his government. Thus it has prescribed procedural safeguards surrounding the arrest, detention and conviction of individuals. Some of these are contained in the Sixth Amendment, compliance with which is essential if convictions are to be sustained. Tot v. United States, \n319 \nU.S. 463\n, 63 S.Ct. 1241. And the Fifth Amendment provides that no person shall be deprived of liberty (as well as life or property) without due process of law. Moreover, as a further safeguard against invasion of the basic civil rights of the individual it is provided in Art. I, Sec. 9 of the Constitution that 'The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.' See Ex parte Milligan, supra.\n We mention these constitutional provisions not to stir the constitutional issues which have been argued at the bar but to indicate the approach which we think should be made to an Act of Congress or an order of the Chief Executive that touches the sensitive area of rights specifically guaranteed by the Constitution. This Court has quite consistently given a narrower scope for the operation of the presumption of constitutionality when legislation appeared on its face to violate a specific prohibition of the Constitution. \n22\n We have likewise favored that interpretation of legislation which gives it the greater chance of surviving the test of constitutionality. \n23\n Those \n\n[323 \nU.S. 283, 300]\n\u00a0\n analogies are suggestive here. We must assume that the Chief Executive and members of Congress, as well as the courts, are sensitive to and respectful of the liberties of the citizen. In interpreting a war-time measure we must assume that their purpose was to allow for the greatest possible accommodation between those liberties and the exigencies of war. We must assume, when asked to find implied powers in a grant of legislative or executive authority, that the law makers intended to place no greater restraint on the citizen than was clearly and unmistakably indicated by the language they used.\n The Act of March 21, 1942, was a war measure. The House Report (H. Rep. No. 1906, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 2) stated, 'The necessity for this legislation arose from the fact that the safe conduct of the war requires the fullest possible protection against either espionage or sabotage to national defense material, national defense premises, and national defense utilities.' That was the precise purpose of Executive Order No. 9066, for, as we have seen, it gave as the reason for the exclusion of persons from prescribed military areas the protection of such property 'against espionage and against sabotage.' And Executive Order No. 9102 which established the War Relocation Authority did so, as we have noted, 'in order to provide for the removal from designated areas of persons whose removal is necessary in the interests of national security.' The purpose and objective of the Act and of these orders are plain. Their single aim was the protection of the war effort against espionage and sabotage. It is in light of that one objective that the powers conferred by the orders must be construed.\n Neither the Act nor the orders use the language of detention. The Act says that no one shall 'enter, remain \n\n[323 \nU.S. 283, 301]\n\u00a0\n in leave, or commit any act' in the prescribed military areas contrary to the applicable restrictions. Executive Order No. 9066 subjects the right of any person 'to enter, remain in, or leave' those prescribed areas to such restrictions as the military may impose. And apart from those restrictions the Secretary of War is only given authority to afford the evacuees 'transportation, food, shelter, and other accommodations.' Executive Order No. 9102 authorizes and directs the War Relocation Authority 'to formulate and effectuate a program for the removal' of the persons covered by Executive Order No. 9066 from the prescribed military areas and 'for their relocation, maintenance, and supervision.' And power is given the Authority to make regulations 'necessary or desirable to promote effective execution of such program.' Moreover, unlike the case of curfew regulations (Kiyoshi Hirabayashi v. United States, supra), the legislative history of the Act of March 21, 1942, is silent on detention. And that silence may have special significance in view of the fact that detention in Relocation Centers was no part of the original program of evacuation but developed later to meet what seemed to the officials in charge to be mounting hostility to the evacuees on the part of the communities where they sought to go.\n We do not mean to imply that detention in connection with no phase of the evacuation program would be lawful. The fact that the Act and the orders are silent on detention does not of course mean that any power to detain is lacking. Some such power might indeed be necessary to the successful operation of the evacuation program. At least we may so assume. Moreover, we may assume for the purposes of this case that initial detention in Relocation Centers was authorized. But we stress the silence of the legislative history and of the Act and the Executive Orders on the power to detain to emphasize that any such authority which exists must be implied. If there is to be \n\n[323 \nU.S. 283, 302]\n\u00a0\n the greatest possible accommodation of the liberties of the citizen with this war measure, any such implied power must be narrowly confined to the precise purpose of the evacuation program.\n A citizen who is concededly loyal presents no problem of espionage or sabotage. Loyalty is a matter of the heart and mind not of race, creed, or color. He who is loyal is by definition not a spy or a saboteur. When the power to detain is derived from the power to protect the war effort against espionage and sabotage, detention which has no relationship to that objective is unauthorized.\n Nor may the power to detain an admittedly loyal citizen or to grant him a conditional release be implied as a useful or convenient step in the evacuation program, whatever authority might be implied in case of those whose loyalty was not conceded or established. If we assume (as we do) that the original evacuation was justified, its lawful character was derived from the fact that it was an espionage and sabotage measure, not that there was community hostility to this group of American citizens. The evacuation program rested explicitly on the former ground not on the latter as the underlying legislation shows. The authority to detain a citizen or to grant him a conditional release as protection against espionage or sabotage is exhausted at least when his loyalty is conceded. If we held that the authority to detain continued thereafter, we would transform an espionage or sabotage measure into something else. That was not done by Executive Order No. 9066 or by the Act of March 21, 1942, which ratified it. What they did not do we cannot do. Detention which furthered the campaign against espionage and sabotage would be one thing. But detention which has no relationship to that campaign is of a distinct character. Community hostility even to loyal evacuees may have been (and perhaps still is) a serious problem. But if authority \n\n[323 \nU.S. 283, 303]\n\u00a0\n for their custody and supervision is to be sought on that ground, the Act of March 21, 1942, Executive Order No. 9066, and Executive Order No. 9102, offer no support. And none other is advanced. \n24\n To read them that broadly would be to assume that the Congress and the President intended that this discriminatory action should \n\n[323 \nU.S. 283, 304]\n\u00a0\n be taken against these people wholly on account of their ancestry even though the government conceded their loyalty to this country. We cannot make such an assumption. As the President has said of these loyal citizens: 'Americans of Japanese ancestry, like those of many other ancestries, have shown that they can, and want to, accept our institutions and work loyally with the rest of us, making their own valuable contribution to the national wealth and well-being. In vindication of the very ideals for which we are fighting this war it is important to us to maintain a high standard of fair, considerate, and equal treatment for the people of this minority as of all other minorities.' Sen. Doc. No. 96, supra, note 7, p. 2.\n Mitsuye Endo is entitled to an unconditional release by the War Relocation Authority.\n Second. The question remains whether the District Court has jurisdiction to grant the writ of habeas corpus because of the fact that while the case was pending in the Circuit Court of Appeals appellant was moved from the Tule Lake Relocation Center in the Northern District of California where she was originally detained to the Central Utah Relocation Center in a different district and circuit.\n That question is not colored by any purpose to effectuate a removal in evasion of the habeas corpus proceedings. It appears that appellant's removal to Utah was part of a general segregation program involving many of these people and was in no way related to this pending case. Moreover, there is no suggestion that there is no one within the jurisdiction of the District Court who is responsible for the detention of appellant and who would be an appropriate respondent. We are indeed advised by the Acting Secretary of the Interior25 that if the writ \n\n[323 \nU.S. 283, 305]\n\u00a0\n issues and is directed to the Secretary of the Interior or any official of the War Relocation Authority (including an assistant director whose office is at San Francisco, which is in the jurisdiction of the District Court), the corpus of appellant will be produced and the court's order complied with in all respects. Thus it would seem that the case is not moot.\n In United States ex rel. Innes v. Crystal, \n319 \nU.S. 755\n, 63 S.Ct. 1164, the relator challenged a judgment of court martial by habeas corpus. The District Court denied his petition and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that order. After that decision and before his petition for certiorari was filed here, he was removed from the custody of the Army to a federal penitentiary in a different district and circuit. The sole respondent was the commanding officer. Only an order directed to the warden of the penitentiary could effectuate his discharge and the warden as well as the prisoner was outside the territorial jurisdiction of the District Court. We therefore held the cause moot. There is no comparable situation here.\n The fact that no respondent was ever served with process or appeared in the proceedings is not important. The United States resists the issuance of a writ. A cause exists in that state of the proceedings and an appeal lies from denial of a writ without the appearance of a respondent. Ex parte Milligan, supra, 4 Wall. at page 112; Ex parte Quirin, \n317 \nU.S. 1, 24\n, 63 S.Ct. 2, 9.\n Hence, so far as presently appears, the cause is not moot and the District Court has jurisdiction to act unless the physical presence of appellant in that district is essential.\n We need not decide whether the presence of the person detained within the territorial jurisdiction of the District Court is prerequisite to filing a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. See In re Boles, 8 Cir., 48 F. 75; Ex parte Gouyet, D.C., 175 F. 230, 233; United States v. Day, 3 Cir ., 50 F.2d 816, 817; \n\n[323 \nU.S. 283, 306]\n\u00a0\n United States v. Schlotfeldt, 7 Cir., 136 F.2d 935, 940. But see Tippitt v. Wood, 70 U.S.App.D.C. 332, 140 F.2d 689, 693. We only hold that the District Court acquired jurisdiction in this case and that the removal of Mitsuye Endo did not cause it to lose jurisdiction where a person in whose custody she is remains within the district.\n There are expressions in some of the cases which indicate that the place of confinement must be within the court's territorial jurisdiction in order to enable it to issue the writ. See In re Boles, supra, 48 F. at page 76; Ex parte Gouyet, supra; United States v. Day, supra; United States v. Schlotfeldt, supra. But we are of the view that the court may act if there is a respondent within reach of its process who has custody of the petitioner. As Judge Cooley stated in Matter of Jackson, 15 Mich. 417, 439, 440: 'The important fact to be observed in regard to the mode of procedure upon this writ is, that it is directed to, and served upon, not the person confined, but his jailer. It does not reach the former except through the latter. The officer or person who serves it does not unbar the prison doors, and set the prisoner free, but the court relieves him by compelling the oppressor to release his constraint. The whole force of the writ is spent upon the respondent.' And see United States v. Davis, Fed.

The statute upon which the jurisdiction of the District Court in habeas corpus proceedings rests (Rev.Stat.  752, 28 U.S.C.  452, 28 U.S.C.A.  452) gives it power 'to grant writs of habeas corpus for the purpose of \n\n[323 \nU.S. 283, 307]\n\u00a0\n an inquiry into the cause of restraint of liberty.' \n26\n That objective may be in no way impaired or defeated by the removal of the prisoner from the territorial jurisdiction of the District Court. That end may be served and the decree of the court made effective if a respondent who has custody of the prisoner is within reach of the court's process even though the prisoner has been removed from the district since the suit was begun. \n27\n\u00a0\n\n The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to the District Court for proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY, concurring.\n I join in the opinion of the Court, but I am of the view that detention in Relocation Centers of persons of Japanese ancestry regardless of loyalty is not only unauthorized by Congress or the Executive but is another example of the unconstitutional resort to racism inherent in the entire evacuation program. As stated more fully in my \n\n[323 \nU.S. 283, 308]\n\u00a0\n dissenting opinion in Fred Toyosaburo Korematsu v. United States, \n323 \nU.S. 214\n, 65 S.Ct. 193, racial discrimination of this nature bears no reasonable relation to military necessity and is utterly foreign to the ideals and traditions of the American people.\n Moreover, the Court holds that Mitsuye Endo is entitled to an unconditional release by the War Relocation Authority. It appears that Miss Endo desires to return to Sacramento, California, from which Public Proclamations Nos. 7 and 11, as well as Civilian Exclusion Order No. 52, still exclude her. And it would seem to me that the 'unconditional' release to be given Miss Endo necessarily implies 'the right to pass freely from state to state,' including the right to move freely into California. Twining v. New Jersey, \n211 \nU.S. 78, 97\n, 29 S.Ct. 14, 19; Crandall v. Nevada, 6 Wall. 35. If, as I believe, the military orders excluding her from California were invalid at the time they were issued, they are increasingly objectionable at this late date, when the threat of invasion of the Pacific Coast and the fears of sabotage and espionage have greatly diminished. For the Government to suggest under these circumstances that the presence of Japanese blood in a loyal American citizen might be enough to warrant her exclusion from a place where she would otherwise have a right to go is a position I cannot sanction.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS.\n I concur in the result but I cannot agree with the reasons stated in the opinion of the court for reaching that result.\n As in Fred Toyosaburo Korematsu v. United States, \n323 \nU.S. 214\n, 65 S. Ct. 193, the court endeavors to avoid constitutional issues which are necessarily involved. The opinion, at great length, attempts to show that neither the executive nor the legislative arm of the Government authorized the detention of the relator.\n\n 1. \nWith respect to the executive, it is said that none of the executive orders in question specifically referred to detention and the court should not imply any authorization \n\n[323 \nU.S. 283, 309]\n\u00a0\n of it. This seems to me to ignore patent facts. As the opinion discloses, the executive branch of the Government not only was aware of what was being done but in fact that which was done was formulated in regulations and in a so-called handbook open to the public. I had supposed that where thus overtly and avowedly a department of the Government adopts a course of action under a series of official regulations the presumption is that, in this way, the department asserts its belief in the legality and validity of what it is doing. I think it inadmissible to suggest that some inferior public servant exceeded the authority granted by executive order in this case. Such a basis of decision will render easy the evasion of law and the violation of constitutional rights, for when conduct is called in question the obvious response will be that, however much the superior executive officials knew, understood, and approved the conduct of their subordinates, those subordinates in fact lacked a definite mandate so to act. It is to hide one's head in the sand to assert that the detention of relator resulted from an excess of authority by subordinate officials.\n\n 2. \nAs the opinion states, the Act of March 21, 1942, said nothing of detention or imprisonment, nor did Executive Order No. 9066 of date February 19, 1942, but I cannot agree that when Congress made appropriations to the Relocation Authority, having before it the reports, the testimony at committee hearings, and the full details of the procedure of the Relocation Authority was exposed in Government publications, these appropriations were not a ratification and an authorization of what was being done. The cases cited in footnote No. 24 of the opinion do not justify any such conclusion. The decision now adds an element never before thought essential to congressional ratification, namely, that if Congress is to ratify by appropriation any part of the programme of an executive agency the bill must include a specific item referring to that portion of the programme. In other words, the court \n\n[323 \nU.S. 283, 310]\n\u00a0\n will not assume that Congress ratified the procedure of the authorities in this case in the absence of some such item as this in the appropriation bill:-'For the administration of the conditional release and parole programme in force in relocation centers.' In the light of the knowledge Congress had as to the details of the programme, I think the court is unjustified in straining to conclude that Congress did not mean to ratify what was being done.\n\n 3. \nI conclude, therefore, that the court is squarely faced with a serious constitutional question,-whether the relator's detention violated the guarantees of the Bill of Rights of the federal Constitution and especially the guarantee of due process of law. There can be but one answer to that question. An admittedly loyal citizen has been deprived of her liberty for a period of years. Under the Constitution she should be free to come and go as she pleases. Instead, her liberty of motion and other innocent activities have been prohibited and conditioned. She should be discharged. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Civilian Exclusion Orders Nos. 1 to 99 were ratified by General De Witt's Public Proclamation No. 7 of June 8, 1942 (7 Fed.Reg. 4498) and Nos. 100 to 108 were ratified by Public Proclamation No. 11 of August 18, 1942. 7 Fed.Reg. 6703. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] By Public Proclamation No. 4, dated March 27, 1942 (7 Fed.Reg. 2601) General De Witt had ordered that all persons of Japanese ancestry who were within the limits of Military Area No. 1 (which included the City of Sacramento) were prohibited 'from leaving that area for any purpose until and to the extent that a future proclamation or order of this headquarters shall so permit or direct.'\n'Prior to this Proclamation a system of voluntary migration had been in force under which 4,889 persons left the military areas under their own arrangements. Final Report, Japanese Evacuation from the West Coast (1943), p. 109. The following reasons are given for terminating that program: 'Essentially, the objective was twofold. First, it was to alleviate tension and prevent incidents involving violence between Japanese migrants and others. Second, it was to insure an orderly, supervised, and thoroughly controlled evacuation with adequate provision for the protection of the persons of evacuees as well as their property.' Final Report, supra, p. 105. \n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Six War Relocation Centers and Project Areas were established within and four outside the Western Defense Command. See Final Report, supra, note 2, Part VI. Each one which was outside the Western Defense Command was designated as a military area by the Secretary of War in Public Proclamation No. WDI, dated August 13, 1942. That proclamation provided that all persons of Japanese ancestry in those areas were required to remain there unless written authorization to leave was obtained from the Secretary of War or the Director of the War Relocation Authority. 7 Fed.Reg. 6593. It recited that the United States was subject to 'espionage and acts of sabotage, thereby requiring the adoption of military measures necessary to establish safeguards against such enemy operations emanating from within as well as from without the national boundaries.' And it also purported to make any person who was subject to its provisions and who failed to obey it liable to the penalties prescribed by the Act of March 21, 1942. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The letter of August 11, 1942, is printed in the Final Report, supra, note 2, p. 530. It recited that the delegation of authority was made pursuant to provisions of Public Proclamation No. 8, dated June 27, 1942. Later General De Witt described the supervision of Relocation Centers by the War reloction Authority as follows: 'The initial problem was one of security-the security of the Pacific Coast. The problem was met by evacuation to Assembly Centers followed by a transfer to Relocation Centers. The latter phase-construction, supply, equipment of Relocation Centers and the transfer of evacuees from Assembly to Relocation Centers had been accomplished by the Army. (While the Commanding General was made responsible for this latter phase of the program, in so doing, he was accomplishing a mission of the War Relocation Authority rather than strictly an Army mission.) The second problem-national in scope- essentially a social-economic problem, was primarily for solution by the War Relocation Authority, an agency expressly created for that purpose.' Final Report, supra, note 2, p. 246.\n On February 16, 1944, the President by Executive Order No. 9423, 50 U. S.C.A.Appendix,  601 note, transferred the War Relocation Authority to the Department of the Interior. 9 Fed.Reg. 1903. The Secretary of the Interior by Administrative Order No. 1922, dated February 16, 1944, authorized the Director to perform under the Secretary's supervision and direction the functions transferred to the Department by Executive Order No. 9423. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] And see the delegation of authority contained in the Secretary of War's Proclamation WDI of August 13, 1942, supra, note 3, respecting Relocation Centers outside the Western Defense Command. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] The Commanding General retained exclusive jurisdiction over the release of evacuees for the purpose of employment, resettlement, or residence within Military Area No. 1 and the California portion of Military Area No. 2. See Final Report, supra, note 2, p. 242. As to the Relocation Centers situated within the evacuated zone, the Commanding General regulated 'the conditions of travel and movement through the area.' Id.\n'The Commanding General recognized fully that one of the principal responsibilities of War Relocation Authority was properly to control ingress and egress at Relocation Centers. The exercise of such control by Army authorities would have been tantamount to administering the Centers themselves. While the Commanding General retained exclusive control to regulate and prohibit the entry or movement of any Japanese in the evacuated areas, he delegated fully the authority and responsibility to determine entry to and departure from the Center proper.' Id. \n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] The functioning of Relocation Centers is described in the Final Report, supra note 2, Part VI and in Segregation of Loyal and Disloyal Japanese in Relocation Centers, Sen. Doc. No. 96, 78th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 4-25. \n[\nFootnote 8\n] Provision was also made for groupleave (or seasonal-work leave) and short term leave not to exceed 60 days. See Sen. Doc. No. 96, supra, note 7, p. 17. \n[\nFootnote 9\n] The first leave procedure was contained in Administrative Instruction No. 22, dated July 20, 1942. It provided in short that any citizen of Japanese ancestry who had never resided or been educated in Japan could apply for a permit to leave the Relocation Center if he could show that he had a specific job opportunity at a designated place outside the Relocation Center and outside the Western Defense Command. Every permittee was said to remain in the 'constructive custody' of the military commander in whose jurisdiction the Relocation Center was located. The permit could be revoked by the Director and the permittee required to return to the Relocation Center if the Director found that the revocation was necessary 'in the public interest'. The Regulations of September 26, 1942, provided more detailed procedures for obtaining leave. See 7 Fed.Reg. 7656. Administrative Instruction No. 22 was revised November 6, 1942. It was superseded as a supplement to the Regulations by the Handbook of July 20, 1943. The Regulations of September 26, 1942 were revised January 1, 1944. See 9 Fed.Reg. 154. \n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] Handbook,  60.6.6. Nine factors are specified each of which is 'regarded by intelligence agencies as sufficient to warrant a recommendation that leave clearance be denied unless there is an adequate explanation'. Sec. 60.10.2. These include, among others, a failure or refusal to swear unqualified allegience to the United States and to forswear any form of allegiance to the Japanese Emperor or any other foreign government, power, or organization; a request for repatriation or expatriation whether or not subsequently retracted; military training in Japan; employment on Japanese naval vessels; three trips to Japan after the age of six, except in the case of seamen whose trips were confined to ports of call; an organizer, agent, member, or contributor to specified organizations which intelligence agencies consider subversive. \n[\nFootnote 11\n] Handbook,  60.4.3. \n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] Id. \n[\nFootnote 13\n] Id. The War Relocation Authority also recommends communities in which an evacuee will be accepted, renders aid in finding employment opportunities, and provides cash grants, if needed, to assist the evacuee in reaching a specified destination and in becoming established there. The Authority has established eight area offices and twenty-six district offices to help carry out the relocation program. \n[\nFootnote 14\n] Sec. 60 of the Handbook provides: 'Before any indefinite leave permitting any entry into or travel in a prohibited military area may issue, a written pass or authorization shall be procured for the applicant from the appropriate military authorities and an escort shall be provided if required by the military authorities. Such pass or authorization may be procured through the Assistant Director in San Francisco, or in the case of the Manzanar Relocation Center through the commanding officer of the military police at the center to the extent authorized by the Western Defense Command.' \n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] The leave clearance stated that it did not authorize departure from the Relocation Center. It added: 'You are eligible for indefinite leave for the purpose of employment or residence in the Eastern Defense Command as well as in other areas; provided the provisions of Administrative Instruction No. 22, Rev., are otherwise complied with. The Provost Marshal General's Dept. of the War Department has determined that you, Endo Mitsuye are not at this time eligible for employment in plants and facilities vital to the war effort.' \n[\nFootnote 16\n] The form of a citizen's indefinite leave is as follows:\n'This is to certify that ...... a United States citizen, who has submitted to me sufficient proof of such citizenship, residing within ...... Relocation Area, is allowed to leave such area on ...... 19.., and subject to the terms of the regulations of the War Relocation Authority relating to the issuance of leave for departure from a relocation area and subject to restrictions ordered by the United States Army, and subject to any special conditions or restrictions set forth on the reverse side hereof, to enjoy leave of indefinite duration.'\n\n One of the grounds given by the District Court for denial of the petition for writ of habeas corpus was the failure of appellant to exhaust her administrative remedies. The Solicitor General and the War Relocation Authority do not invoke that rule here, since the issue which appellant poses is the validity of the regulations under which the administrative remedy is prescribed. \n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] Cf. the account of the meeting by General De Witt in the Final Report, supra, note 2, pp. 243-244. \n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] And see the Fourth Interim Report of the Tolan Committee, H.R. Rep. No. 2124, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 18. \n[\nFootnote 19\n] There were 108,503 evacuees transferred to Relocation Centers. Final Report, supra, note 2, p. 279. As of July 29, 1944, there were 28, 911 on indefinite leave and 61,002 in the Relocation Centers other than Tule Lake. It was sought to assemble at Tule Lake those whose disloyalty was deemed to be established and those who persisted in a refusal to say they would be willing to serve in the armed forces of the United States on combat duty wherever ordered and to swear unqualified allegiance to the United States and forswear any form of allegiance to the Japanese Emperor or any other foreign government, power or organization. This group, together with minor children, totaled 18,684 on July 29, 1944.

It is pointed out that the regulations and procedures of the Authority were disclosed in reports to the Congress and in Congressional hearings. See, for example, Sen. Doc. No. 96, supra, note 7; Report and Minority Views of the Special Committee on Un-American Activities on Japanese War Relocation Centers, H. Rep. No. 717, 78th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 23-26; Hearings, Subcommittee of the Senate Military Affairs Committee on S. 444, 78th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 45-46; Japanese War Relocation Centers, Subcommittee Report on S. 444 and S. 101 and 111, 78th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 4-5 et seq. And it is shown that the leave program of the Authority was mentioned both in the House and Senate committee hearings on the 1944 Appropriation Act (Hearings, Subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations, National War Agencies Appropriation Bill for 1944, 78th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 698, 699, 710; Hearings of the Senate Subcommittee on Appropriations, National War Agencies Appropriation Bill for 1944, 78th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 382) and on the floor of the House prior to passage of the 1944 Act. 89 Cong. Rec. p. 5983-5985. Congress may of course do by ratification what it might have authorized. Swayne & Hoyt, Ltd., v. United States, \n300 \nU.S. 297, 301\n, 302 S., 57 S.Ct. 478, 479, 480. And ratification may be effected through appropriation acts. Isbrandtsen-Moller Co. v. United States, \n300 \nU.S. 139, 147\n, 57 S.Ct. 407, 411; Brooks v. Dewar, \n313 \nU.S. 354, 361\n, 61 S.Ct. 979, 982. But the appropriation must plainly show a purpose to bestow the precise authority which is claimed. We can hardly deduce such a purpose here where a lump appropriation was made for the overall program of the Authority and no sums were earmarked for the single phase of the total program which is here involved. Congress may support the effort to take care of these evacuees without ratifying every phase of the program. \n\n[\nFootnote 25\n] In a letter dated October 13, 1944 to the Solicitor General and filed here. \n\n[\nFootnote 26\n] The entire section provides: 'The several justices of the Supreme Court and the several judges of the circuit courts of appeal and of the district courts, within their respective jurisdictions, shall have power to grant writs of habeas corpus for the purpose of an inquiry into the cause of restraint of liberty. A circuit judge shall have the same power to grant writs of habeas corpus within his circuit that a district judge has within his district; and the order of the circuit judge shall be entered in the records of the district court of the district wherein the restraint complained of is had.' The last clause was added by  6 of the Act of February 13, 1925, 43 Stat. 940. But we find no indication that it was added to change the scope of jurisdiction in habeas corpus proceedings. On its face it is no more than a recording requirement. \n[\nFootnote 27\n] Cf. Rule 45(1) of this Court, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 354, which provides: 'Pending review of a decision refusing a writ of habeas corpus, the custody of the prisoner shall not be disturbed.' \n\n\n\n\n","42":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFALBO v. UNITED STATES(1944)\nNo. 73\nArgued: November 19, 1943Decided: January 3, 1944\n\n\n\n Rehearing Denied Jan. 31, 1944. See \n321 \nU.S. 802\n, 64 S.Ct. 517.\n Mr. Hayden Covington, of Brooklyn, N.Y., for petitioner.\n Mr. Charles Fahy, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner was indicted on November 12, 1942, in a federal District Court in Pennsylvania for knowingly failing to perform a duty required of him under the Selec- \n\n[320 \nU.S. 549, 550]\n\u00a0\n tive Training and Service Act of 1940.1 The particular charge was that, after his local board had classified him as a conscientious objector, he wilfully failed to obey the board's order to report for assignment to work of national importance. \n2\n Admitting that his refusal to obey the order was wilful, petitioner defended his conduct on the ground that he was entitled to a statutory exemption from all forms of national service, since the facts he had presented to the board showed that he was a 'regular or duly ordained' minister. \n3\n The Act, he argued, does not make it a crime to refuse to obey an order to report for service if that order is based upon an erroneous classification, because there is no 'duty' to comply with a mistaken order. This defense was seasonably urged but the District Court declined to recognize it, expressing the view that, 'the Board has the decision of whether or not this man is to be listed as he claims he should be;' and at the \n\n[320 \nU.S. 549, 551]\n\u00a0\n conclusion of the trial the jury was charged that, 'if you find from the facts that he failed to report-and there is no evidence to the contrary ...-it would be your duty to find him guilty.' The result of the trial was a conviction and sentence to imprisonment for five years.\n On appeal petitioner urged that the District Court had erred in refusing to permit a trial de novo on the merits of his claimed exemption. In the alternative, he argued that at least the Court should have reviewed the classification order to ascertain whether the local board had been 'prejudicial, unfair, and arbitrary' in that it had failed to admit certain evidence which he offered, had acted on the basis of an antipathy to the religious sect of which he is a member, and had refused to classify him as a minister against the overwhelming weight of the evidence. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court per curiam, 135 F.2d 464. We granted certiorari because of the importance of the problems involved relating to administration of the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, upon which problems the Circuit Courts of Appeal have not expressed uniform views. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n When the Selective Service and Training Act was passed in September, 1940, most of the world was at war. The preamble of the Act declared it 'imperative to increase and train the personnel of the armed forces of the United States.' The danger of attack by our present enemies, if not imminent, was real, as subsequent events have grimly demonstrated. The Congress was faced with the urgent necessity of integrating all the nation's people and forces for national defense. That dire consequences might flow from apathy and delay was well understood. Accordingly the Act was passed to mobilize national manpower with \n\n[320 \nU.S. 549, 552]\n\u00a0\n the speed which that necessity and understanding required.\n The mobilization system which Congress established by the Act is designed to operate as one continuous process for the selection of men for national service. Under the system, different agencies are entrusted with different functions but the work of each is integrated with that of the others. Selection of registrants for service, and deferments or exemptions from service, are to be effected within the framework of this machinery as implemented by rules and regulations prescribed by the President. \n5\n The selective service process begins with registration with a local board composed of local citizens. The registrant then supplies certain information on a questionnaire furnished by the board. On the basis of that information and, where appropriate, a physical examination, the board classifies him in accordance with standards contained in the Act and the Selective Service Regulations. It then notifies him of his classification The registrant may contest his classification by a personal appearance before the local board, and if that board refuses to alter the classification, by carrying his case to a board of appeal,6 and thence, in certain circumstances, to the President. \n\n[320 \nU.S. 549, 553]\n\u00a0\n Only after he has exhausted this procedure is a protesting registrant ordered to report for service. If he has been classified for military service, his local board orders him to report for induction into the armed forces. If he has been classified a conscientious objector opposed to noncombatant military service, as was petitioner, he ultimately is ordered by the local board to report for work of national importance. In each case the registrant is under the same obligation to obey the order. But in neither case is the order to report the equivalent of acceptance for service. Completion of the functions of the local boards and appellate agencies, important as are these functions, is not the end of the selective service process. The selectee may still be rejected at the induction center and the conscientious objector who is opposed to noncombatant duty may be rejected at the civilian public service camp. \n7\n The connected series of steps into the national service which begins with registration with the local board does not end until the registrant is accepted by the army, navy, or civilian public service camp. Thus a board order to report is no more than a necessary intermediate step in a united and continuous process designed to raise an army speedily and efficiently.\n In this process the local board is charged in the first instance with the duty to make the classification of registrants which Congress in its complete discretion8 saw fit \n\n[320 \nU.S. 549, 554]\n\u00a0\n to authorize. Even if there were, as the petitioner argues, a constitutional requirement that judicial review must be available to test the validity of the decision of the local board, it is certain that Congress was not required to provide for judicial intervention before final acceptance of an individual for national service. The narrow question therefore presented by this case is whether Congress has authorized judicial review of the propriety of a board's classification in a criminal prosecution for wilful violation of an order directing a registrant to report for the last step in the selective process.\n We think it has not. The Act nowhere explicitly provides for such review and we have found nothing in its legislative history which indicates an intention to afford it. The circumstances under which the Act was adopted lend no support to a view which would allow litigious interruption of the process of selection which Congress created. To meet the need which it felt for mobilizing national manpower in the shortest practicable period, Congress established a machinery which it deemed efficient for inducting great numbers of men into the armed forces. Careful provision was made for fair administration of the Act's policies within the framework of the selective service process. But Congress apparently regarded 'a prompt and unhesitating obedience to orders' issued in that process 'indispensable to the complete attainment of the object' of national defense. Martin v. Mott, 12 Wheat. 19, 30, \n25 \nU.S. 19\n, 30. Surely if Congress had intended to authorize interference with that process by intermediate challenges of orders to report, it would have said so.\n Against this background the complete absence of any provision for such challenges in the very section providing for prosecution of violations in the civil courts permits no \n\n[320 \nU.S. 549, 555]\n\u00a0\n other inference than that Congress did not intend they could be made. The instant case offers a striking example of the consequences of any other view. Petitioner, 25 years of age, unmarried, and apparently in good health, registered with his local board on October 16, 1940. He claimed exemption August 23, 1941. Consideration of his claim by the local board and the board of appeal delayed his classification, so that his final order to report was not issued until September 2, 1942. Today, one year and four months after this order, he is still litigating the question.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice RUTLEDGE, concurring.\n I concur in the result and in the opinion of the Court except in one respect. Petitioner claims the local board's order of classification was invalid because that board refused to classify petitioner as a minister on the basis of an antipathy to the religious sect of which he is a member. And, if the question were open, the record discloses that some evidence tendered to sustain this charge was excluded in the trial court. But petitioner has made no such charge concerning the action of the appeal board which reviewed and affirmed the local board's order. And there is nothing to show that the appeal board acted otherwise than according to law. If therefore the local board's order was invalid originally for the reason claimed, as to which I express no opinion, whatever defect may have existed was cured by the appeal board's action. Apart from some challenge upon constitutional grounds, I have no doubt that Congress could and did exclude judicial review of Selective Service orders like that in question. Accordingly I agree that the conviction must be sustained.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY, dissenting.\n This case presents another aspect of the perplexing problem of reconciling basic principles of justice with mili- \n\n[320 \nU.S. 549, 556]\n\u00a0\n tary needs in wartime. Individual rights have been recognized by our jurisprudence only after long and costly struggles. They should not be struck down by anything less than the gravest necessity. We assent to their temporary suspension only to the extent that they constitute a clear and present danger to the effective prosecution of the war and only as a means of preserving those rights undiminished for ourselves and future generations. Before giving such an assent, therefore, we should be convinced of the existence of a reasonable necessity and be satisfied that the suspension is in accordance with the legislative intention.\n The immediate issue is whether the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 must be interpreted so as to deprive alleged violators of the right to a full hearing and of the right to present every reasonable defense. Petitioner, a member of Jehovah's Witnesses, claimed to be a minister exempt from both military training and civilian work under the Act. After exhausting all the administrative remedies and appeals afforded by the Act, he was classified as a conscientious objector (Class IV-E) rather than as a minister (Class IV-D). Petitioner alleges that this classification was contrary to law and was the result of arbitrary action by his local board. On the assumption that these allegations are true, the subsequent order to report for assignment to work of national importance, which he disobeyed, must therefore be considered invalid. Our problem is simply whether petitioner can introduce evidence to that effect as a defense to a criminal prosecution for failure to obey the order.\n Common sense and justice dictate that a citizen accused of a crime should have the fullest hearing possible, plus the opportunity to present every reasonable defense. Only an unenlightened jurisprudence condemns an individual without according him those rights. Such a denial is especially oppressive where a full hearing might dis- \n\n[320 \nU.S. 549, 557]\n\u00a0\n close that the administrative action underlying the prosecution is the product of excess wartime emotions. Experience demonstrates that in time of war individual liberties cannot always be entrusted safely to uncontrolled administrative discretion. Illustrative of this proposition is the remark attributed to one of the members of petitioner's local board to the effect that 'I do not have any damned use for Jehovah's Witnesses.' The presumption against foreclosing the defense of illegal and arbitrary administrative action is therefore strong. Only the clearest statutory language or an unmistakable threat to the public safety can justify a court in shutting the door to such a defense. Because I am convinced that neither the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 nor the war effort compels the result reached by the majority of this Court, I am forced to dissent.\n It is evident that there is no explicit provision in the Act permitting the raising of this particular defense and that the legislative history is silent on the matter. Suffice it to say, however, that nothing in the statute or in its legislative record proscribes this defense or warrants the conviction of petitioner without benefit of a full hearing. Judicial protection of an individual against arbitrary and illegal administrative action does not depend upon the presence or absence of express statutory authorization. The power to administer complete justice and to consider all reasonable pleas and defenses must be presumed in the absence of legislation to the contrary. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Moreover, the structure of the Act is entirely consistent with judicial review of induction orders in criminal proceedings. As the majority states, the Act is designed 'to \n\n[320 \nU.S. 549, 558]\n\u00a0\n operate as one continuous process for the selection of men for national service,' and it is desirable that this process be free from 'litigious interruption.' But we are faced here with a complete and permanent interruption springing not from any affirmative judicial intervention but from a failure to obey an order. A criminal proceeding before a court is therefore inevitable and the only problem is the availability of a particular defense in that proceeding. Hence judicial review at this stage has none of the elements of a 'litigious interruption' of the administrative process.\n No other barriers to judicial review of the induction order in a criminal proceeding are revealed by the structure of the Act. The 'continuous process' of selection is unique, unlike any ordinary administrative proceeding. Normal concepts of administrative law are foreign to this setting. Thus rules preventing judicial review of interlocutory administrative orders and requiring exhaustion of the administrative process have no application here. Those rules are based upon the unnecessary inconvenience which the administrative agency would suffer if its proceedings were interrupted by premature judicial intervention. But since the administrative process has already come to a final ending, the reason for applying such rules no longer exists. And even if the order in this case were considered interlocutory rather than final, which is highly questionable, judicial review at this point is no less necessary. Criminal punishment for disobedience of an arbitrary and invalid order is objectionable regardless of whether the order be interlocutory or final.\n Nor do familiar doctrines of the exclusiveness of statutory remedies have any relevance here. Had Congress created a statutory judicial review procedure prior to or following induction, the failure to take advantage of such a review or the judicial approval of the induction order upon appeal might bar a collateral attack on the order in \n\n[320 \nU.S. 549, 559]\n\u00a0\n a criminal proceeding. But Congress has erected no such system of judicial review. Courts are left to their own devices in fashioning whatever review they deem just and necessary.\n Thus there is no express or implied barrier to the raising of this defense or to the granting of a full judicial review of induction orders in criminal proceedings. Courts have not hesitated to make such review available in habeas corpus proceedings following induction despite the absence of express statutory authorization. Where, as here, induction will never occur and the habeas corpus procedure is unavailable, judicial review in a criminal proceeding becomes imperative if petitioner is to be given any protection against arbitrary and invalid administrative action. \n2\n It is significant that in analogous situations in the past, although without passing upon the precise issue, we have supplied such a necessary review in criminal proceedings. Cf. Union Bridge Co. v. United States, \n204 \nU.S. 364\n, 27 S.Ct. 367; Monongahela Bridge Co. v. United States, \n216 \nU.S. 177\n, 30 S.Ct. 356; McAllister, 'Statutory Roads to Review of Federal Administrative Orders,' 28 California L.Rev. 129, 165, 166. See, also, Fire Department of City of New York v. Gilmour, 149 N.Y. 453, 44 N.E. 177, 52 Am.St.Rep. 748; People v. McCoy, 125 Ill. 289, 17 N.E. 786.\n Finally, the effective prosecution of the war in no way demands that petitioner be denied a full hearing in this case. We are concerned with a speedy and effective \n\n[320 \nU.S. 549, 560]\n\u00a0\n mobilization of armed forces. But that mobilization is neither impeded nor augmented by the availability of judicial review of local board orders in criminal proceedings. In the rare case where the accused person can prove the arbitrary and illegal nature of the administrative action, the induction order should never have been issued and the armed forces are deprived of no one who should have been inducted. And where the defendant is unable to prove such a defense or where, pursuant to this Court's opinion, he is forbidden even to assert this defense, the prison rather than the Army or Navy is the recipient of his presence. Thus the military strength of this nation gains naught by the denial of judicial review in this instance.\n To say that the availability of such a review would encourage disobedience of induction orders, or that denial of a review would have a deterrent effect, is neither demonstrable nor realistic. There is no evidence that petitioner failed to obey the local board order because of a belief that he could secure a judicial reversal of the order and thus escape the duty to defend his country. Those who seek such a review are invariable those whose conscientious or religious scruples would prevent them from reporting for induction regardless of the availability of this defense. And I am not aware that disobedience has multiplied in the Fourth Circuit, where this defense has been allowed. Baxley v. United States, 134 F.2d 998; Goff v. United States, 135 F.2d 610. Moreover, English court under identical circumstances during the last war, unhesitatingly provided a full hearing and reviewed orders to report for permanent service. Offord v. Hiscock, 86 L.J.K.B. 941; Hawkes v. Moxey, 86 L.J.K.B. 1530. Yet that did not noticeably impede the efficiency or speed of England's mustering of an adequate military force.\n That an individual should languish in prison for five years without being accorded the opportunity of proving \n\n[320 \nU.S. 549, 561]\n\u00a0\n that the prosecution was based upon arbitrary and illegal administrative action is not in keeping with the high standards of our judicial system. Especially is this so where neither public necessity nor rule of law or statute leads inexorably to such a harsh result. The law knows no finer hour than when it cuts through formal concepts and transitory emotions to protect unpopular citizens against discrimination and persecution. I can perceive no other course for the law to take in this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 54 Stat. 885, 50 U.S.C.Appendix  301-318, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix  301-318.

On a petition for review of the order made pursuant to  19(b) of the Act, the \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 594]\n\u00a0\n Circuit Court of Appeals set it aside, one judge dissenting. 4 Cir., 134 F. 2d 287. The cases are here on petitions for writs of certiorari which we granted because of the public importance of the questions presented. City of Cleveland v. Hope Natural Gas Co., \n319 \nU.S. 735\n, 63 S.Ct. 1165\n\n\n Hope is a West Virginia corporation organized in 1898. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Standard Oil Co. (N.J.). Since the date of its organization, it has been in the business of producing, purchasing and marketing natural gas in that state. \n1\n It sells some of that gas to local consumers in West Virginia. But the great bulk of it goes to five customer companies which receive it at the West Virginia line and distribute it in Ohio and in Pennsylvania. \n2\n In July, 1938, the cities of Cleveland and Akron filed complaints with the Commission charging that the rates collected by Hope from East Ohio Gas Co. (an affiliate of Hope which distributes gas in Ohio) were excessive and unreasonable. Later in 1938 the Commission on its own motion instituted an investigation to determine the reasonableness of all of Hope's interstate rates. In March \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 595]\n\u00a0\n 1939 the Public Utility Commission of Pennsylvania filed a complaint with the Commission charging that the rates collected by Hope from Peoples Natural Gas Co. (an affiliate of Hope distributing gas in Pennsylvania) and two non-affiliated companies were unreasonable. The City of Cleveland asked that the challenged rates be declared unlawful and that just and reasonable rates be determined from June 30, 1939 to the date of the Commission's order. The latter finding was requested in aid of state regulation and to afford the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio a proper basic for disposition of a fund collected by East Ohio under bond from Ohio consumers since June 30, 1939. The cases were consolidated and hearings were held.\n On May 26, 1942, the Commission entered its order and made its findings. Its order required Hope to decrease its future interstate rates so as to reflect a reduction, on an annual basis of not less than $3,609, 857 in operating revenues. And it established 'just and reasonable' average rates per m.c.f. for each of the five customer companies. \n3\n In response to the prayer of the City of Cleveland the Commission also made findings as to the lawfulness of past rates, although concededly it had no authority under the Act to fix past rates or to award reparations. 44 P.U. R.,U.S., at page 34. It found that the rates collected by Hope from East Ohio were unjust, unreasonable, excessive and therefore unlawful, by $830, 892 during 1939, $3,219,551 during 1940, and $2,815,789 on an annual basis since 1940. It further found that just, reasonable, and lawful rates for gas sold by Hope to East Ohio for resale for ultimate public consumption were those required \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 596]\n\u00a0\n to produce $11,528,608 for 1939, $11,507,185 for 1940 and $11.910,947 annually since 1940.\n The Commission established an interstate rate base of $33,712,526 which, it found, represented the 'actual legitimate cost' of the company's interstate property less depletion and depreciation and plus unoperated acreage, working capital and future net capital additions. The Commission, beginning with book cost, made certain adjustments not necessary to relate here and found the 'actual legitimate cost' of the plant in interstate service to be $51,957,416, as of December 31, 1940. It deducted accrued depletion and depreciation, which it found to be $22,328,016 on an 'economic-service-life' basis. And it added $1,392,021 for future net capital additions, $566,105 for useful unoperated acreage, and $2,125,000 for working capital. It used 1940 as a test year to estimate future revenues and expenses. It allowed over $16,000,000 as annual operating expenses-about $1,300,000 for taxes, $1,460,000 for depletion and depreciation, $600,000 for exploration and development costs, $8,500,000 for gas purchased. The Commission allowed a net increase of $421,160 over 1940 operating expenses, which amount was to take care of future increase in wages, in West Virginia property taxes, and in exploration and development costs. The total amount of deductions allowed from interstate revenues was $13,495,584.\n Hope introduced evidence from which it estimated reproduction cost of the property at $97,000,000. It also presented a so-called trended 'original cost' estimate which exceeded $105,000,000. The latter was designed 'to indicate what the original cost of the property would have been if 1938 material and labor prices had prevailed throughout the whole period of the piece-meal construction of the company's property since 1898.' 44 P.U.R.,N.S., at pages 8, 9. Hope estimated by the 'percent condition' method accrued depreciation at about 35% of \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 597]\n\u00a0\n reproduction cost new. On that basis Hope contended for a rate base of $66, 000,000. The Commission refused to place any reliance on reproduction cost new, saying that it was 'not predicated upon facts' and was 'too conjectural and illusory to be given any weight in these proceedings.' Id., 44 P.U.R.,U.S., at page 8. It likewise refused to give any 'probative value' to trended 'original cost' since it was 'not founded in fact' but was 'basically erroneous' and produced 'irrational results.' Id., 44 P.U.R., N.S., at page 9. In determining the amount of accrued depletion and depreciation the Commission, following Lindheimer v. Illinois Bell Telephone Co., \n292 \nU.S. 151\n, 167-169, 54 S.Ct. 658, 664-666; Federal Power Commission v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co., \n315 \nU.S. 575, 592\n, 593 S., 62 S.Ct. 736, 745, 746, based its computation on 'actual legitimate cost'. It found that Hope during the years when its business was not under regulation did not observe 'sound depreciation and depletion practices' but 'actually accumulated an excessive reserve'4 of about $46,000,000. Id., 44 P.U.R.,N.S., at page 18. One member of the Commission thought that the entire amount of the reserve should be deducted from 'actual legitimate cost' in determining the rate base. 5 The majority of the \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 598]\n\u00a0\n Commission concluded, however, that where, as here, a business is brought under regulation for the first time and where incorrect depreciation and depletion practices have prevailed, the deduction of the reserve requirement (actual existing depreciation and depletion) rather than the excessive reserve should be made so as to lay 'a sound basis for future regulation and control of rates.' Id., 44 P.U.R.,N.S., at page 18. As we have pointed out, it determined accrued depletion and depreciation to be $ 22,328,016; and it allowed approximately $1,460,000 as the annual operating expense for depletion and depreciation. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n Hope's estimate of original cost was about $69,735,000-approximately $ 17,000,000 more than the amount found by the Commission. The item of $17, 000,000 was made up largely of expenditures which prior to December 31, 1938, were charged to operating expenses. Chief among those expenditures was some $12,600,000 expended \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 599]\n\u00a0\n in well-drilling prior to 1923. Most of that sum was expended by Hope for labor, use of drilling-rigs, hauling, and similar costs of well-drilling. Prior to 1923 Hope followed the general practice of the natural gas industry and charged the cost of drilling wells to operating expenses. Hope continued that practice until the Public Service Commission of West Virginia in 1923 required it to capitalize such expenditures, as does the Commission under its present Uniform System of Accounts. \n7\n The Commission refused to add such items to the rate base stating that 'No greater injustice to consumers could be done than to allow items as operating expenses and at a later date include them in the rate base, thereby placing multiple charges upon the consumers.' Id., 44 P.U.R.,N.S., at page 12. For the same reason the Commission excluded from the rate base about $ 1,600,000 of expenditures on properties which Hope acquired from other utilities, the latter having charged those payments to operating expenses. The Commission disallowed certain other overhead items amounting to over $ 3,000,000 which also had been previously charged to operating expenses. And it refused to add some $632,000 as interest during construction since no interest was in fact paid.\n Hope contended that it should be allowed a return of not less than 8%. The Commission found that an 8% return would be unreasonable but that 6 1\/2% was a fair rate of return. That rate of return, applied to the rate base of $33,712,526, would produce $2,191,314 annually, as compared with the present income of not less than $5,801,171.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals set aside the order of the Commission for the following reasons. (1) It held that the rate base should reflect the 'present fair value' of the \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 600]\n\u00a0\n property, that the Commission in determining the 'value' should have considered reproduction cost and trended original cost, and that 'actual legitimate cost' (prudent investment) was not the proper measure of 'fair value' where price levels had changed since the investment. (2) It concluded that the well-drilling costs and overhead items in the amount of some $17,000,000 should have been included in the rate base. (3) It held that accrued depletion and depreciation and the annual allowance for that expense should be computed on the basis of 'present fair value' of the property not on the basis of 'actual legitimate cost'.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals also held that the Commission had no power to make findings as to past rates in aid of state regulation. But it concluded that those findings were proper as a step in the process of fixing future rates. Viewed in that light, however, the findings were deemed to be invalidated by the same errors which vitiated the findings on which the rate order was based.\n Order Reducing Rates. Congress has provided in  4(a) of the Natural Gas Act that all natural gas rates subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission 'shall be just and reasonable, and any such rate or charge that is not just and reasonable is hereby declared to be unlawful.' Sec. 5(a) gives the Commission the power, after hearing, to determine the 'just and reasonable rate' to be thereafter observed and to fix the rate by order. Sec. 5(a) also empowers the Commission to order a 'decrease where existing rates are unjust ... unlawful, or are not the lowest reasonable rates.' And Congress has provided in  19(b) that on review of these rate orders the 'finding of the Commission as to the facts, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive.' Congress, however, has provided no formula by which the 'just and reasonable' rate is to be determined. It has not filled in the \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 601]\n\u00a0\n details of the general prescription8 of  4(a) and  5(a). It has not expressed in a specific rule the fixed principle of 'just and reasonable'.\n When we sustained the constitutionality of the Natural Gas Act in the Natural Gas Pipeline Co. case, we stated that the 'authority of Congress to regulate the prices of commodities in interstate commerce is at least as great under the Fifth Amendment as is that of the states under the Fourteenth to regulate the prices of commodities in intrastate commerce.' 315 U.S. at page 582, 62 S.Ct. at page 741. Rate-making is indeed but one species of price-fixing. Munn v. Illinois, \n94 \nU.S. 113\n, 134. The fixing of prices, like other applications of the police power, may reduce the value of the property which is being regulated. But the fact that the value is reduced does not mean that the regulation is invalid. Block v. Hirsh, \n256 \nU.S. 135\n, 155-157, 41 S.Ct. 458, 459, 460, 16 A.L.R. 165; Nebbia v. New York, \n291 \nU.S. 502\n, 523-539, 54 S. Ct. 505, 509-517, 89 A.L.R. 1469, and cases cited. It does, however, indicate that 'fair value' is the end product of the process of rate-making not the starting point as the Circuit Court of Appeals held. The heart of the matter is that rates cannot be made to depend upon 'fair value' when the value of the going enterprise depends on earnings under whatever rates may be anticipated. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 602]\n\u00a0\n We held in Federal Power Commission v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co., supra, that the Commission was not bound to the use of any single formula or combination of formulae in determining rates. Its rate-making function, moreover, involves the making of 'pragmatic adjustments.' Id., 315 U.S. at page 586, 62 S.Ct. at page 743. And when the Commission's order is challenged in the courts, the question is whether that order 'viewed in its entirety' meets the requirements of the Act. Id., 315 U.S. at page 586, 62 S.Ct. at page 743. Under the statutory standard of 'just and reasonable' it is the result reached not the method employed which is controlling. Cf. Los Angeles Gas & Electric Corp. v. Railroad Commission, \n289 \nU.S. 287, 304\n, 305 S., 314, 53 S.Ct. 637, 643, 644, 647; West Ohio Gas Co. v. Public Utilities Commission (No. 1), \n294 \nU.S. 63, 70\n, 55 S.Ct. 316, 320; West v. Chesapeake & Potomac Tel. Co., \n295 \nU.S. 662, 692\n, 693 S., 55 S.Ct. 894, 906, 907 (dissenting opinion). It is not theory but the impact of the rate order which counts. If the total effect of the rate order cannot be said to be unjust and unreasonable, judicial inquiry under the Act is at an end. The fact that the method employed to reach that result may contain infirmities is not then important. Moreover, the Commission's order does not become suspect by reason of the fact that it is challenged. It is the product of expert judgment which carries a presumption of validity. And he who would upset the rate order under the Act carries the heavy burden of making a convincing showing that it is invalid because it is unjust and unreasonable in its consequences. Cf. Railroad Commission v. Cumberland Tel. & T. Co., \n212 \nU.S. 414\n, 29 S.Ct. 357; Lindheimer v. Illinois Bell Tel. Co., supra, 292 U.S. at pages 164, 169, 54 S.Ct. at pages 663, 665; Railroad Commission v. Pacific Gas & E. Co., \n302 \nU.S. 388, 401\n, 58 S.Ct. 334, 341. \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 603]\n\u00a0\n The rate-making process under the Act, i.e., the fixing of 'just and reasonable' rates, involves a balancing of the investor and the consumer interests. Thus we stated in the Natural Gas Pipeline Co. case that 'regulation does not insure that the business shall produce net revenues.' 315 U.S. at page 590, 62 S.Ct. at page 745. But such considerations aside, the investor interest has a legitimate concern with the financial integrity of the company whose rates are being regulated. From the investor or company point of view it is important that there be enough revenue not only for operating expenses but also for the capital costs of the business. These include service on the debt and dividends on the stock. Cf. Chicago & Grand Trunk R. Co. v. Wellman, \n143 \nU.S. 339, 345\n, 346 S., 12 S.Ct. 400, 402. By that standard the return to the equity owner should be commensurate with returns on investments in other enterprises having corresponding risks. That return, moreover, should be sufficient to assure confidence in the financial integrity of the enterprise, so as to maintain its credit and to attract capital. See State of Missouri ex rel. South-western Bell Tel. Co. v. Public Service Commission, \n262 \nU.S. 276, 291\n, 43 S.Ct. 544, 547, 31 A.L.R. 807 (Mr. Justice Brandeis concurring). The conditions under which more or less might be allowed are not important here. Nor is it important to this case to determine the various permissible ways in which any rate base on which the return is computed might be arrived at. For we are of the view that the end result in this case cannot be condemned under the Act as unjust and unreasonable from the investor or company viewpoint.\n We have already noted that Hope is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Standard Oil Co. (N.J.). It has no securities outstanding except stock. All of that stock has been owned by Standard since 1908. The par amount presently outstanding is approximately $28,000,000 as compared with the rate base of $33,712,526 established by \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 604]\n\u00a0\n the Commission. Of the total outstanding stock $11,000,000 was issued in stock dividends. The balance, or about $17,000,000, was issued for cash or other assets. During the four decades of its operations Hope has paid over $ 97,000,000 in cash dividends. It had, moreover, accumulated by 1940 an earned surplus of about $8,000,000. It had thus earned the total investment in the company nearly seven times. Down to 1940 it earned over 20% per year on the average annual amount of its capital stock issued for cash or other assets. On an average invested capital of some $23,000,000 Hope's average earnings have been about 12% a year. And during this period it had accumulated in addition reserves for depletion and depreciation of about $46,000,000. Furthermore, during 1939, 1940 and 1941, Hope paid dividends of 10% on its stock. And in the year 1942, during about half of which the lower rates were in effect, it paid dividends of 7 1\/2%. From 1939-1942 its earned surplus increased from $5,250,000 to about $13,700, 000, i.e., to almost half the par value of its outstanding stock.\n As we have noted, the Commission fixed a rate of return which permits Hope to earn $2,191,314 annually. In determining that amount it stressed the importance of maintaining the financial integrity of the company. It considered the financial history of Hope and a vast array of data bearing on the natural gas industry, related businesses, and general economic conditions. It noted that the yields on better issues of bonds of natural gas companies sold in the last few years were 'close to 3 per cent', 44 P. U.R.,N.S., at page 33. It stated that the company was a 'seasoned enterprise whose risks have been minimized' by adequate provisions for depletion and depreciation (past and present) with 'concurrent high profits', by 'protected established markets, through affiliated distribution companies, in populous and industralized areas', and by a supply of gas locally to meet all require- \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 605]\n\u00a0\n ments, 'except on certain peak days in the winter, which it is feasible to supplement in the future with gas from other sources.' Id., 44 P.U.R.,N.S., at page 33. The Commission concluded, 'The company's efficient management, established markets, financial record, affiliations, and its prospective business place it in a strong position to attract capital upon favorable terms when it is required.' Id., 44 P.U.R.,N.S., at page 33.\n In view of these various considerations we cannot say that an annual return of $2,191,314 is not 'just and reasonable' within the meaning of the Act. Rates which enable the company to operate successfully, to maintain its financial integrity, to attract capital, and to compensate its investors for the risks assumed certainly cannot be condemned as invalid, even though they might produce only a meager return on the so- called 'fair value' rate base. In that connection it will be recalled that Hope contended for a rate base of $66,000,000 computed on reproduction cost new. The Commission points out that if that rate base were accepted, Hope's average rate of return for the four-year period from 1937-1940 would amount to 3.27%. During that period Hope earned an annual average return of about 9% on the average investment. It asked for no rate increases. Its properties were well maintained and operated. As the Commission says such a modest rate of 3.27% suggests an 'inflation of the base on which the rate has been computed.' Dayton Power & Light Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, \n292 \nU.S. 290, 312\n, 54 S.Ct. 647, 657. Cf. Lindheimer v. Illinois Bell Tel. Co., supra, 292 U.S. at page 164, 54 S.Ct. at page 663. The incongruity between the actual operations and the return computed on the basis of reproduction cost suggests that the Commission was wholly justified in rejecting the latter as the measure of the rate base.\n In view of this disposition of the controversy we need not stop to inquire whether the failure of the Commission to add the $17,000,000 of well-drilling and other costs to \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 606]\n\u00a0\n the rate base was consistent with the prudent investment theory as developed and applied in particular cases.\n Only a word need be added respecting depletion and depreciation. We held in the Natural Gas Pipeline Co. case that there was no constitutional requirement 'that the owner who embarks in a wasting-asset business of limited life shall receive at the end more than he has put into it.' 315 U. S. at page 593, 62 S.C. at page 746. The Circuit Court of Appeals did not think that that rule was applicable here because Hope was a utility required to continue its service to the public and not scheduled to end its business on a day certain as was stipulated to be true of the Natural Gas Pipeline Co. But that distinction is quite immaterial. The ultimate exhaustion of the supply is inevitable in the case of all natural gas companies. Moreover, this Court recognized in Lindheimer v. Illinois Bell Tel. Co., supra, the propriety of basing annual depreciation on cost. 10 By such a procedure the utility is made whole and the integrity of its investment maintained. \n11\n No more is required. \n12\n We cannot approve the contrary holding \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 607]\n\u00a0\n of United Railways & Electric Co. v. West, \n280 \nU.S. 234, 253\n, 254 S., 50 S.Ct. 123, 126, 127. Since there are no constitutional requirements more exacting than the standards of the Act, a rate order which conforms to the latter does not run afoul of the former.\n The Position of West Virginia. The State of West Virginia, as well as its Public Service Commission, intervened in the proceedings before the Commission and participated in the hearings before it. They have also filed a brief amicus curiae here and have participated in the argument at the bar. Their contention is that the result achieved by the rate order 'brings consequences which are unjust to West Virginia and its citizens' and which 'unfairly depress the value of gas, gas lands and gas leaseholds, unduly restrict development of their natural resources, and arbitrarily transfer their properties to the residents of other states without just compensation therefor.'\n West Virginia points out that the Hope Natural Gas Co. holds a large number of leases on both producing and unoperated properties. The owner or grantor receives from the operator or grantee delay rentals as compensation for postponed drilling. When a producing well is successfully brought in, the gas lease customarily continues indefinitely for the life of the field. In that case the operator pays a stipulated gas-well rental or in some cases a gas royalty equivalent to one-eighth of the gas marketed. \n13\n Both the owner and operator have valuable property interests in the gas which are separately taxable under West Virginia law. The contention is that the reversionary interests in the leaseholds should be represented in the rate proceedings since it is their gas which is being sold in interstate \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 608]\n\u00a0\n commerce. It is argued, moreover, that the owners of the reversionary interests should have the benefit of the 'discovery value' of the gas leaseholds, not the interstate consumers. Furthermore, West Virginia contends that the Commission in fixing a rate for natural gas produced in that State should consider the effect of the rate order on the economy of West Virginia. It is pointed out that gas is a wasting asset with a rapidly diminishing supply. As a result West Virginia's gas deposits are becoming increasingly valuable. Nevertheless the rate fixed by the Commission reduces that value. And that reduction, it is said, has severe repercussions on the economy of the State. It is argued in the first place that as a result of this rate reduction Hope's West Virginia property taxes may be decreased in view of the relevance which earnings have under West Virginia law in the assessment of property for tax purposes. \n14\n Secondly, it is pointed out that West Virginia has a production tax15 on the 'value' of the gas exported from the State. And we are told that for purposes of that tax 'value' becomes under West Virginia law 'practically the substantial equivalent of market value.' Thus West Virginia argues that undervaluation of Hope's gas leaseholds will cost the State many thousands of dollars in taxes. The effect, it is urged, is to impair West Virginia's tax structure for the benefit of Ohio and Pennsylvania consumers. West Virginia emphasizes, moreover, its deep interest in the conservation of its natural resources including its natural gas. It says that a reduction of the value of these leasehold values will jeopardize these conservation policies in three respects: (1) exploratory development of new fields will be discouraged; (2) abandonment of lowyield high-cost marginal wells will be hastened; and (3) secondary recovery of oil will be hampered. \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 609]\n\u00a0\n Furthermore, West Virginia contends that the reduced valuation will harm one of the great industries of the State and that harm to that industry must inevitably affect the welfare of the citizens of the State. It is also pointed out that West Virginia has a large interest in coal and oil as well as in gas and that these forms of fuel are competitive. When the price of gas is materially cheapened, consumers turn to that fuel in preference to the others. As a result this lowering of the price of natural gas will have the effect of depreciating the price of West Virginia coal and oil.\n West Virginia insists that in neglecting this aspect of the problem the Commission failed to perform the function which Congress entrusted to it and that the case should be remanded to the Commission for a modification of its order. \n16\n\u00a0\n\n We have considered these contentions at length in view of the earnestness with which they have been urged upon us. We have searched the legislative history of the Natural Gas Act for any indication that Congress entrusted to the Commission the various considerations which West Virginia has advanced here. And our conclusion is that Congress did not.\n We pointed out in Illinois Natural Gas Co. v. Central Illinois Public Service Co., \n314 \nU.S. 498, 506\n, 62 S.Ct. 384, 387, that the purpose of the Natural Gas Act was to provide, 'through the exercise of the national power over interstate commerce, an agency for regulating the wholesale distribution to public service companies of natural gas moving interstate, which this Court had declared to be interstate commerce not subject to certain types of state regulation.' As stated in the House Report the 'basic purpose' of this legislation was 'to occupy' the field in which such cases as State of Missouri v. \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 610]\n\u00a0\n Kansas Natural Gas Co., \n265 \nU.S. 298\n, 44 S.Ct. 544, and Public Utilities Commission v. Attleboro Steam & Electric Co., \n273 \nU.S. 83\n, 47 S.Ct. 294, had held the States might not act. H.Rep. No. 709, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 2. In accomplishing that purpose the bill was designed to take 'no authority from State commissions' and was 'so drawn as to complement and in no manner usurp State regulatory authority.' Id., p. 2. And the Federal Power Commission was given no authority over the 'production or gathering of natural gas.'  1(b).\n The primary aim of this legislation was to protect consumers against exploitation at the lands of natural gas companies. Due to the hiatus in regulation which resulted from the Kansas Natural Gas Co. case and related decisions state commissions found it difficult or impossible to discover what it cost interstate pipe-line companies to deliver gas within the consuming states; and thus they were thwarted in local regulation. H.Rep., No. 709, supra, p. 3. Moreover, the investigations of the Federal Trade Commission had disclosed that the majority of the pipe-line mileage in the country used to transport natural gas, together with an increasing percentage of the natural gas supply for pipe-line transportation, had been acquired by a handful of holding companies. \n17\n State commissions, independent producers, and communities having or seeking the service were growing quite helpless against these combinations. \n18\n These were the types of problems with which those participating in the hearings were pre- occupied. \n19\n Congress addressed itself to those specific evils. \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 611]\n\u00a0\n The Federal Power Commission was given broad powers of regulation. The fixing of 'just and reasonable' rates ( 4) with the powers attendant thereto20 was the heart of the new regulatory system. Moreover, the Commission was given certain authority by  7(a), on a finding that the action was necessary or desirable 'in the public interest,' to require natural gas companies to extend or improve their transportation facilities and to sell gas to any authorized local distributor. By  7(b) it was given control over the abandonment of facilities or of service. And by  7( c), as originally enacted, no natural gas company could undertake the construction or extension of any facilities for the transportation of natural gas to a market in which natural gas was already being served by another company, or sell any natural gas in such a market, without obtaining a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the Commission. In passing on such applications for certificates of convenience and necessity the Commission was told by  7(c), as originally enacted, that it was 'the intention of Congress that natural gas shall be sold in interstate commerce for resale for ultimate public consumption for domestic, commercial, industrial, or any other use at the lowest possible reasonable rate consistent with the maintenance of adequate service in the public interest.' The latter provision was deleted from  7(c) when that subsection was amended by the Act of February 7, 1942, 56 Stat. 83. By that amendment limited grandfather rights were granted companies desiring to extend their facilities and services over the routes or within the area which they were already serving. Moreover,  7(c) was broadened so as to require certifi- \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 612]\n\u00a0\n cates of public convenience and necessity not only where the extensions were being made to markets in which natural gas was already being sold by another company but in other situations as well.\n These provisions were plainly designed to protect the consumer interests against exploitation at the hands of private natural gas companies. When it comes to cases of abandonment or of extensions of facilities or service, we may assume that, apart from the express exemptions21 contained in  7, considerations of conservation are material to the issuance of certificates of public convenience and necessity. But the Commission was not asked here for a certificate of public convenience and necessity under  7 for any proposed construction or extension. It was faced with a determination of the amount which a private operator should be allowed to earn from the sale of natural gas across state lines through an established distribution system. Secs. 4 and 5, not  7, provide the standards for that determination. We cannot find in the words of the Act or in its history the slightest intimation or suggestion that the exploitation of consumers by private operators through the maintenance of high rates should be allowed to continue provided the producing states obtain indirect benefits from it. That apparently was the Commission's view of the matter, for the same arguments advanced here were presented to the Commission and not adopted by it.\n We do not mean to suggest that Congress was unmindful of the interests of the producing states in their natural gas supplies when it drafted the Natural Gas Act. As we have said, the Act does not intrude on the domain traditionally reserved for control by state commissions; and the Federal Power Commission was given no authority over- \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 613]\n\u00a0\n 'the production or gathering of natural gas.'  1(b). In addition, Congress recognized the legitimate interests of the States in the conservation of natural gas. By  11 Congress instructed the Commission to make reports on compacts between two or more States dealing with the conservation, production and transportation of natural gas. \n22\n The Commission was also directed to recommend further legislation appropriate or necessary to carry out any proposed compact and 'to aid in the conservation of natural-gas resources within the United States and in the orderly, equitable, and economic production, transportation, and distribution of natural gas.'  11(a). Thus Congress was quite aware of the interests of the producing states in their natural gas supplies. \n23\n But it left the protection of \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 614]\n\u00a0\n those interests to measures other than the maintenance of high rates to private companies. If the Commission is to be compelled to let the stockholders of natural gas companies have a feast so that the producing states may receive crumbs from that table, the present Act must be redesigned. Such a project raises questions of policy which go beyond our province.\n It is hardly necessary to add that a limitation on the net earnings of a natural gas company from its interstate business is not a limitation on the power of the producing state either to safeguard its tax revenues from that industry24 or to protect the interests of those who sell their gas to the interstate operator. \n25\n The return which the Com- \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 615]\n\u00a0\n mission allowed was the net return after all such charges.\n It is suggested that the Commission has failed to perform its duty under the Act in that it has not allowed a return for gas production that will be enough to induce private enterprise to perform completely and efficiently its functions for the public. The Commission, however, was not oblivious of those matters. It considered them. It allowed, for example, delay rentals and exploration and development costs in operating expenses. 26 No serious attempt has been made here to show that they are inadequate. We certainly cannot say that they are, unless we are to substitute our opinions for the expert judgment of the administrators to whom Congress entrusted the decision. Moreover, if in light of experience they turn out to be inadequate for development of new sources of supply, the doors of the Commission are open for increased allowances. This is not an order for all time. The Act contains machinery for obtaining rate adjustments.  4.\n But it is said that the Commission placed too low a rate on gas for industrial purposes as compared with gas for domestic purposes and that industrial uses should be discouraged. It should be noted in the first place that the rates which the Commission has fixed are Hope's interstate wholesale rates to distributors not interstate rates to industrial users27 and domestic consumers. We hardly \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 616]\n\u00a0\n can assume, in view of the history of the Act and its provisions, that the resales intrastate by the customer companies which distribute the gas to ultimate consumers in Ohio and Pennsylvania are subject to the rate-making powers of the Commission. \n28\n But in any event those rates are not in issue here. Moreover, we fail to find in the power to fix 'just and reasonable' rates the power to fix rates which will disallow or discourage resales for industrial use. The Committee Report stated that the Act provided 'for regulation along recognized and more or less standardized lines' and that there was 'nothing novel in its provisions'. H.Rep.No.709, supra, p. 3. Yet if we are now to tell the Commission to fix the rates so as to discourage particular uses, we would indeed be injecting into a rate case a 'novel' doctrine which has no express statutory sanction. The same would be true if we were to hold that the wasting-asset nature of the industry required the maintenance of the level of rates so that natural gas companies could make a greater profit on each unit of gas sold. Such theories of rate-making for this industry may or may not be desirable. The difficulty is that  4(a) and  5(a) contain only the conventional standards of rate-making for natural gas companies. \n29\n The \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 617]\n\u00a0\n Act of February 7, 1942, by broadening  7 gave the Commission some additional authority to deal with the conservation aspects of the problem. 30 But  4(a) and  5(a) were not changed. If the standard of 'just and reasonable' is to sanction the maintenance of high rates by a natural gas company because they restrict the use of natural gas for certain purposes, the Act must be further amended.\n It is finally suggested that the rates charged by Hope are discriminatory as against domestic users and in favor of industrial users. That charge is apparently based on  4(b) of the Act which forbids natural gas companies from maintaining 'any unreasonable difference in rates, charges, service, facilities, or in any other respect, either as between localities or as between classes of service.' The power of the Commission to eliminate any such unreasonable differences or discriminations is plain .  5(a). The Commission, however, made no findings under  4(b). Its failure in that regard was not challenged in the petition to review. And it has not been raised or argued here by any party. Hence the problem of discrimination has no proper place in the present decision. It will be time enough to pass on that issue when it is presented to us. Congress has entrusted the administration of the Act to the Commission not to the courts. Apart from the requirements of judicial review it is not \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 618]\n\u00a0\n for us to advise the Commission how to discharge its functions.\n Findings as to the Lawfulness of Past Rates. As we have noted, the Commission made certain findings as to the lawfulness of past rates which Hope had charged its interstate customers. Those findings were made on the complaint of the City of Cleveland and in aid of state regulation. It is conceded that under the Act the Commission has no power to make reparation orders. And its power to fix rates admittedly is limited to those 'to be thereafter observed and in force.'  5(a). But the Commission maintains that it has the power to make findings as to the lawfulness of past rates even though it has no power to fix those rates. \n31\n However that may be, we do not think that these findings were reviewable under  19(b) of the Act. That section gives any party 'aggrieved by an order' of the Commission a review 'of such order' in the circuit court of appeals for the circuit where the natural gas company is located or has its principal place of business or in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. We do not think that the findings in question fall within that category.\n The Court recently summarized the various types of administrative action or determination reviewable as orders under the Urgent Deficiencies Act of October 22, \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 619]\n\u00a0\n 1913, 28 U.S.C.  45, 47a, 28 U.S.C.A.  45, 47a, and kindred statutory provisions. Rochester Tel. Corp. v. United States, \n307 \nU.S. 125\n, 59 S.Ct. 754. It was there pointed out that where 'the order sought to be reviewed does not of itself adversely affect complainant but only affects his rights adversely on the contingency of future administrative action', it is not reviewable. Id., 307 U.S. at page 130, 59 S.Ct. at page 757. The Court said, 'In view of traditional conceptions of federal judicial power, resort to the courts in these situations is either premature or wholly beyond their province.' Id., 307 U.S. at page 130, 59 S.Ct. at page 757. And see United States v. Los Angeles & S. L.R. Co., \n273 \nU.S. 299, 309\n, 310 S., 47 S.Ct. 413, 414, 415; Shannahan v. United States, \n303 \nU.S. 596\n, 58 S.Ct. 732. These considerations are apposite here. The Commission has no authority to enforce these findings. They are 'the exercise solely of the function of investigation.' United States v. Los Angeles & S.L.R. Co., supra, 273 U.S. at page 310, 47 S.Ct. at page 414. They are only a preliminary, interim step towards possible future action-action not by the Commission but by wholly independent agencies. The outcome of those proceedings may turn on factors other than these findings. These findings may never result in the respondent feeling the pinch of administrative action.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Opinion of Mr. Justice BLACK and Mr. Justice MURPHY.\n We agree with the Court's opinion and would add nothing to what has been said but for what is patently a wholly gratuitous assertion as to Constitutional law in the dissent of Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER. We refer to the statement that 'Congressional acquiescence to date in the doctrine of Chicago, etc., R. Co. v. Minnesota, supra (\n134 \nU.S. 418\n, 10 S.Ct. 462, 702), may fairly be claimed.' That was the case in which a majority of this Court was finally induced to expand the meaning \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 620]\n\u00a0\n of 'due process' so as to give courts power to block efforts of the state and national governments to regulate economic affairs. The present case does not afford a proper occasion to discuss the soundness of that doctrine because, as stated in Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER'S dissent, 'That issue is not here in controversy.' The salutary practice whereby courts do not discuss issues in the abstract applies with peculiar force to Constitutional questions. Since, however, the dissent adverts to a highly controversial due process doctrine and implies its acceptance by Congress, we feel compelled to say that we do not understand that Congress voluntarily has acquiesced in a Constitutional principle of government that courts, rather than legislative bodies, possess final authority over regulation of economic affairs. Even this Court has not always fully embraced that principle, and we wish to repeat that we have never acquiesced in it, and do not now. See Federal Power Commission v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co., \n315 \nU.S. 575\n, 599-601, 62 S.Ct. 736, 749, 750.\n\n Mr. Justice REED, dissenting.\n This case involves the problem of rate making under the Natural Gas Act. Added importance arises from the obvious fact that the principles stated are generally applicable to all federal agencies which are entrusted with the determination of rates for utilities. Because my views differ somewhat from those of my brethren, it may be of some value to set them out in a summary form.\n The Congress may fix utility rates in situations subject to federal control without regard to any standard except the constitutional standards of due process and for taking private property for public use without just compensation. Wilson v. New, \n243 \nU.S. 332, 350\n, 37 S.Ct. 298, 302, L.R.A.1917E, 938, Ann.Cas.1918A, 1024. A Commission, however, does not have this freedom of action. Its powers are limited not only by the constitutional standards but also by the standards of the delegation. Here the standard added by the Natural Gas Act is that the rate be 'just \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 621]\n\u00a0\n and reasonable.' \n1\n Section 62 throws additional light on the meaning of these words.\n When the phrase was used by Congress to describe allowable rates, it had relation to something ascertainable. The rates were not left to the whim of the Commission. The rates fixed would produce an annual return and that annual return was to be compared with a theoretical just and reasonable return, all risks considered, on the fair value of the property used and useful in the public service at the time of the determination.\n Such an abstract test is not precise. The agency charged with its determination has a wide range before it could properly be said by a court that the agency had disregarded statutory standards or had confiscated the property of the utility for public use. Cf. Chicago, M. & St. P.R. Co. v. Minnesota, \n134 \nU.S. 418\n, 461-466, 10 S.Ct. 462, 702, 703-705, dissent. This is as Congress intends. Rates are left to an experienced agency particularly competent by training to appraise the amount required.\n The decision as to a reasonable return had not been a source of great difficulty, for borrowers and lenders reached such agreements daily in a multitude of situations; and although the determination of fair value had been troublesome, its essentials had been worked out in fairness to investor and consumer by the time of the en- \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 622]\n\u00a0\n actment of this Act. Cf. Los Angeles G. & E. Corp. v. Railroad Comm., \n289 \nU.S. 287\n, 304 et seq., 53 S.Ct. 637, 643 et seq.. The results were well known to Congress and had that body desired to depart from the traditional concepts of fair value and earnings, it would have stated its intention plainly. Helvering v. Griffiths, \n318 \nU.S. 371\n, 63 S. Ct. 636.\n It was already clear that when rates are in dispute, 'earnings produced by rates do not afford a standard for decision.' 289 U.S. at page 305, 53 S.Ct. at page 644. Historical cost, prudent investment and reproduction cost3 were all relevant factors in determining fair value. Indeed, disregarding the pioneer investor's risk, if prudent investment and reproduction cost were not distorted by changes in price levels or technology, each of them would produce the same result. The realization from the risk of an investment in a speculative field, such as natural gas utilities, should be reflected in the present fair value. \n4\n The amount of evidence to be admitted on any point was of course in the agency's reasonable discretion, and it was free to give its own weight to these or other factors and to determine from all the evidence its own judgment as to the necessary rates. \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 623]\n\u00a0\n I agree with the Court in not imposing a rule of prudent investment alone in determining the rate base. This leaves the Commission free, as I understand it, to use any available evidence for its finding of fair value, including both prudent investment and the cost of installing at the present time an efficient system for furnishing the needed utility service.\n My disagreement with the Court arises primarily from its view that it makes no difference how the Commission reached the rate fixed so long as the result is fair and reasonable. For me the statutory command to the Commission is more explicit. Entirely aside from the constitutional problem of whether the Congress could validly delegate its rate making power to the Commission, in toto and without standards, it did legislate in the light of the relation of fair and reasonable to fair value and reasonable return. The Commission must therefore make its findings in observance of that relationship.\n The Federal Power Commission did not, as I construe their action, disregard its statutory duty. They heard the evidence relating to historical and reproduction cost and to the reasonable rate of return and they appraised its weight. The evidence of reproduction cost was rejected as unpersuasive, but from the other evidence they found a rate base, which is to me a determination of fair value. On that base the earnings allowed seem fair and reasonable. So far as the Commission went in appraising the property employed in the service, I find nothing in the result which indicates confiscation, unfairness or unreasonableness. Good administration of rate making agencies under this method would avoid undue delay and render revaluations unnecessary except after violent fluctuations of price levels. Rate making under this method has been subjected to criticism. But until Congress changes the standards for the agencies, these rate making bodies should continue the conventional theory of rate \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 624]\n\u00a0\n making. It will probably be simpler to improve present methods than to devise new ones.\n But a major error, I think was committed in the disregard by the Commission of the investment in exploratory operations and other recognized capital costs. These were not considered by the Commission because they were charged to operating expenses by the company at a time when it was unregulated. Congress did not direct the Commission in rate making to deduct from the rate base capital investment which had been recovered during the unregulated period through excess earnings. In my view this part of the investment should no more have been disregarded in the rate base than any other capital investment which previously had been recovered and paid out in dividends or placed to surplus. Even if prudent investment throughout the life of the property is accepted as the formula for figuring the rate base, it seems to me illogical to throw out the admittedly prudent cost of part of the property because the earnings in the unregulated period had been sufficient to return the prudent cost to the investors over and above a reasonable return. What would the answer be under the theory of the Commission and the Court, if the only prudent investment in this utility had been the seventeen million capital charges which are now disallowed?\n For the reasons heretofore stated, I should affirm the action of the Circuit Court of Appeals in returning the proceeding to the Commission for further consideration and should direct the Commission to accept the disallowed capital investment in determining the fair value for rate making purposes.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER, dissenting.\n My brother JACKSON has analyzed with particularity the economic and social aspects of natural gas as well as \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 625]\n\u00a0\n the difficulties which led to the enactment of the Natural Gas Act, especially those arising out of the abortive attempts of States to regulate natural gas utilities. The Natural Gas Act of 1938 should receive application in the light of this analysis, and Mr. Justice JACKSON has, I believe, drawn relevant inferences regarding the duty of the Federal Power Commission in fixing natural gas rates. His exposition seems to me unanswered, and I shall say only a few words to emphasize my basic agreement with him.\n For our society the needs that are met by public utilities are as truly public services as the traditional governmental functions of police and justice. They are not less so when these services are rendered by private enterprise under governmental regulation. Who ultimately determines the ways of regulation, is the decisive aspect in the public supervision of privately-owned utilities. Foreshadowed nearly sixty years ago, Railroad Commission Cases (Stone v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co.), \n116 \nU.S. 307, 331\n, 6 S.Ct. 334, 344, 388, 1191, it was decided more than fifty years ago that the final say under the Constitution lies with the judiciary and not the legislature. Chicago, etc., R. Co. v. Minnesota , \n134 \nU.S. 418\n, 10 S.Ct. 462, 702.\n While legal issues touching the proper distribution of governmental powers under the Constitution may always be raised, Congressional acquiescence to date in the doctrine of Chicago, etc., R. Co. v. Minnesota, supra, may fairly be claimed. But in any event that issue is not here in controversy. As pointed out in the opinions of my brethren, Congress has given only limited authority to the Federal Power Commission and made the exercise of that authority subject to judicial review. The Commission is authorized to fix rates chargeable for natural gas. But the rates that it can fix must be 'just and reasonable'.  5 of the Natural Gas Act, 15 U.S. C.  717d, 15 U.S.C.A.  717d. Instead of making the Commission's rate determinations final, Con- \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 626]\n\u00a0\n gress specifically provided for court review of such orders. To be sure, 'the finding of the Commission as to the facts, if supported by substantial evidence' was made 'conclusive',  19 of the Act, 15 U.S.C.  717r; 15 U.S.C.A.  717r. But obedience of the requirement of Congress that rates be 'just and reasonable' is not an issue of fact of which the Commission's own determination is conclusive. Otherwise, there would be nothing for a court to review except questions of compliance with the procedural provisions of the Natural Gas Act. Congress might have seen fit so to cast its legislation. But it has not done so. It has committed to the administration of the Federal Power Commission the duty of applying standards of fair dealing and of reasonableness relevant to the purposes expressed by the Natural Gas Act. The requirement that rates must be 'just and reasonable' means just and reasonable in relation to appropriate standards. Otherwise Congress would have directed the Commission to fix such rates as in the judgment of the Commission are just and reasonable; it would not have also provided that such determinations by the Commission are subject to court review.\n To what sources then are the Commission and the courts to go for ascertaining the standards relevant to the regulation of natural gas rates? It is at this point that Mr. Justice JACKSON'S analysis seems to me pertinent. There appear to be two alternatives. Either the fixing of natural gas rates must be left to the unguided discretion of the Commission so long as the rates it fixes do not reveal a glaringly had prophecy of the ability of a regulated utility to continue its service in the future. Or the Commission's rate orders must be founded on due consideration of all the elements of the public interest which the production and distribution of natural gas involve just because it is natural gas. These elements are reflected in the Natural Gas Act, if that Act be applied as an entirety. See, for \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 627]\n\u00a0\n instance,  4(a)(b)(c)(d), 6, and 11, 15 U.S.C.  717c(a)(b)(c)(d), 717e, and 717j, 15 U.S.C.A.  717c(a-d), 717e, 717j. Of course the statute is not concerned with abstract theories of ratemaking. But its very foundation is the 'public interest', and the public interest is a texture of multiple strands. It includes more than contemporary investors and contemporary consumers. The needs to be served are not restricted to immediacy, and social as well as economic costs must be counted.\n It will not do to say that it must all be left to the skill of experts. Expertise is a rational process and a rational process implies expressed reasons for judgment. It will little advance the public interest to substitute for the hodge-podge of the rule in Smyth v. Ames, \n169 \nU.S. 466\n, 18 S.Ct. 418, an encouragement of conscious obscurity or confusion in reaching a result, on the assumption that so long as the result appears harmless its basis is irrelevant. That may be an appropriate attitude when state action is challenged as unconstitutional. Cf. Driscoll v. Edison Light & Power Co., \n307 \nU.S. 104\n, 59 S.Ct. 715. But it is not to be assumed that it was the design of Congress to make the accommodation of the conflicting interests exposed in Mr. Justice JACKSON'S opinion the occasion for a blind clash of forces or a partial assessment of relevant factors, either before the Commission or here.\n The objection to the Commission's action is not that the rates it granted were too low but that the range of its vision was too narrow. And since the issues before the Commission involved no less than the total public interest, the proceedings before it should not be judged by narrow conceptions of common law pleading. And so I conclude that the case should be returned to the Commission. In order to enable this Court to discharge its duty of reviewing the Commission's order, the Commission should set forth with explicitness the criteria by which it is guided \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 628]\n\u00a0\n in determining that rates are 'just and reasonable', and it should determine the public interest that is in its keeping in the perspective of the considerations set forth by Mr. Justice JACKSON.\n By Mr. Justice JACKSON.\n Certainly the theory of the court below that ties rate-making to the fair-value-reproduction-cost formula should be overruled as in conflict with Federal Power Commission v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co.1 But the case should, I think, be the occasion for reconsideration of our rate-making doctrine as applied to natural gas and should be returned to the Commission for further consideration in the light thereof.\n The Commission appears to have understood the effect of the two opinions in the Pipeline case to be at least authority and perhaps direction to fix natural gas rates by exclusive application of the 'prudent investment' rate base theory. This has no warrant in the opinion of the Chief Justice for the Court, however, which released the Commission from subservience to 'any single formula or combination of formulas' provided its order, 'viewed in its entirety, produces no arbitrary result.' 315 U.S. at page 586, 62 S.Ct. at page 743. The minority opinion I understood to advocate the 'prudent investment' theory as a sufficient guide in a natural gas case. The view was expressed in the court below that since this opinion was not expressly controverted it must have been approved. \n2\n I disclaim this im- \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 629]\n\u00a0\n puted approval with some particularity, because I attach importance at the very beginning of federal regulation of the natural gas industry to approaching it as the performance of economic functions, not as the performance of legalistic rituals.\n\n\n I.\n\n\n Solutions of these cases must consider eccentricities of the industry which gives rise to them and also to the Act of Congress by which they are governed.\n The heart of this problem is the elusive, exhaustible, and irreplaceable nature of natural gas itself. Given sufficient money, we can produce any desired amount of railroad, bus, or steamship transportation, or communications facilities, or capacity for generation of electric energy, or for the manufacture of gas of a kind. In the service of such utilities one customer has little concern with the amount taken by another, one's waste will not deprive another, a volume of service and be created equal to demand, and today's demands will not exhaust or lessen capacity to serve tomorrow. But the wealth of Midas and the wit of man cannot produce or reproduce a natural gas field. We cannot even reproduce the gas, for our manufactured product has only about half the heating value per unit of nature's own. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n Natural gas in some quantity is produced in twenty-four states. It is consumed in only thirty-five states, and is \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 630]\n\u00a0\n available only to about 7,600,000 consumers. \n4\n Its availability has been more localized than that of any other utility service because it has depended more on the caprice of nature.\n The supply of the Hope Company is drawn from that old and rich and vanishing field that flanks the Appalachian mountains. Its center of production is Pennsylvania and West Virginia, with a fringe of lesser production in New York, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, and the north end of Alabama. Oil was discovered in commercial quantities at a depth of only 69 1\/2 feet near Titusville, Pennsylvania, in 1859. Its value then was about $ 16 per barrel. \n5\n The oil branch of the petroleum industry went forward at once, and with unprecedented speed. The area productive of oil and gas was roughed out by the drilling of over 19,000 'wildcat' wells, estimated to have cost over $222,000,000. Of these, over 18,000 or 94.9 per cent, were 'dry holes.' About five per cent, or 990 wells, made discoveries of commercial importance, 767 of them resulting chiefly in oil and 223 in gas only. \n6\n Prospecting for many years was a search for oil, and to strike gas was a misfortune. Waste during this period and even later is appalling. Gas was regarded as having no commercial value until about 1882, in which year the total yield was valued only at about $75,000.7 Since then, contrary to oil, which has become cheaper gas in this field has pretty steadily advanced in price.\n While for many years natural gas had been distributed on a small scale for lighting,8 its acceptance was slow, \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 631]\n\u00a0\n facilities for its utilization were primitive, and not until 1885 did it take on the appearance of a substantial industry. \n9\n Soon monopoly of production or markets developed. \n10\n To get gas from the mountain country, where it was largely found, to centers of population, where it was in demand, required very large investment. By ownership of such facilities a few corporate systems, each including several companies, controlled access to markets. Their purchases became the dominating factor in giving a market value to gas produced by many small operators. Hope is the market for over 300 such operators. By 1928 natural gas in the Appalachian field commanded an average price of 21.1 cents per m.c.f. at points of production and was bringing 45.7 cents at points of consumption. \n11\n The companies which controlled markets, however, did not rely on gas purchases alone. They acquired and held in fee or leasehold great acreage in territory proved by 'wildcat' drilling. These large marketing system companies as well as many small independent owners and operators have carried on the commercial development of proved territory. The development risks appear from the estimate that up to 1928, 312,318 proved area wells had been sunk in the Appalachian field of which 48,962, or 15.7 per cent, failed to produce oil or gas in commercial quantity. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 632]\n\u00a0\n With the source of supply thus tapped to serve centers of large demand, like Pittsburgh, Buffalo, Cleveland, Youngstown, Akron, and other industrial communities, the distribution of natural gas fast became big business. Its advantages as a fuel and its price commended it, and the business yielded a handsome return. All was merry and the goose hung high for consumers and gas companies alike until about the time of the first. World War. Almost unnoticed by the consuming public, the whole Appalachian field passed its peak of production and started to decline. Pennsylvania, which to 1928 had given off about 38 per cent of the natural gas from this field, had its peak in 1905; Ohio, which had produced 14 per cent, had its peak in 1915; and West Virginia, greatest producer of all, with 45 per cent to its credit, reached its peak in 1917.13\n Western New York and Eastern Ohio, on the fringe of the field, had some production but relied heavily on imports from Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Pennsylvania, a producing and exporting state, was a heavy consumer and supplemented her production with imports from West Virginia. West Virginia was a consuming state, but the lion's share of her production was exported. Thus the interest of the states in the North Appalachian supply was in conflict.\n Competition among localities to share in the failing supply and the helplessness of state and local authorities in the presence of state lines and corporate complexities is a part of the background of federal intervention in the industry. \n14\n West Virginia took the boldest measure. It legislated a priority in its entire production in favor of its own inhabitants. That was frustrated by an injunc- \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 633]\n\u00a0\n tion from this Court. \n15\n Throughout the region clashes in the courts and conflicting decisions evidenced public anxiety and confusion. It was held that the New York Public Service Commission did not have power to classify consumers and restrict their use of gas. \n16\n That Commission held that a company could not abandon a part of its territory and still serve the rest. 17 Some courts admonished the companies to take action to protect consumers. \n18\n Several courts held that companies, regardless of failing supply, must continue to take on customers, but such compulsory additions were finally held to be within the Public Service Commission's discretion. 19 There were attempts to throw up franchises and quit the service, and municipalities resorted to the courts with conflicting results. 20 Public service commissions of consuming states were handicapped, for they had no control of the supply. \n21\n\u00a0\n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 634]\n\u00a0\n Shortages during World War I occasioned the first intervention in the natural gas industry by the Federal Government. Under Proclamation of President Wilson the United States Fuel Administrator took control, stopped extensions, classified consumers and established a priority for domestic over industrial use. \n22\n After the war federal control was abandoned. Some cities once served with natural gas became dependent upon mixed gas of reduced heating value and relatively higher price. \n23\n\u00a0\n\n Utilization of natural gas of highest social as well as economic return is domestic use for cooking and water \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 635]\n\u00a0\n heating, followed closely by use for space heating in homes. This is the true public utility aspect of the enterprise, and its preservation should be the first concern of regulation. Gas does the family cooking cheaper than any other fuel. \n24\n But its advantages do not end with dollars and cents cost. It is delivered without interruption at the meter as needed and is paid for after it is used. No money is tied up in a supply, and no space is used for storage. It requires no handling, creates no dust, and leaves no ash. It responds to thermostatic control. It ignites easily and immediately develops its maximum heating capacity. These incidental advantages make domestic life more liveable.\n Industrial use is induced less by these qualities than by low cost in competition with other fuels. Of the gas exported from West Virginia by the Hope Company a very substantial part is used by industries. This wholesale use speeds exhaustion of supply and displaces other fuels. Coal miners and the coal industry, a large part of whose costs are wages, have complained of unfair competition from low-priced industrial gas produced with relatively little labor cost. \n25\n\u00a0\n\n Gas rate structures generally have favored industrial users. In 1932, in Ohio, the average yield on gas for domestic consumption was 62.1 cents per m.c.f. and on in- \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 636]\n\u00a0\n dustrial, 38.7. In Pennsylvania, the figures were 62.9 against 31.7. West Virginia showed the least spread, domestic consumers paying 36.6 cents; and industrial, 27.7.26 Although this spread is less than in other parts of the United States,27 it can hardly be said to be self-justifying. It certainly is a very great factor in hastening decline of the natural gas supply.\n About the time of World War I there were occasional and short-lived efforts by some hard-pressed companies to reverse this discrimination and adopt graduated rates, giving a low rate to quantities adequate for domestic use and graduating it upward to discourage industrial use. \n28\n\u00a0\n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 637]\n\u00a0\n These rates met opposition from industrial sources, of course, and since diminished revenues from industrial sources tended to increase the domestic price, they met little popular or commission favor. The fact is that neither the gas companies nor the consumers nor local regulatory bodies can be depended upon to conserve gas. Unless federal regulation will take account of conservation, its efforts seem, as in this case, actually to constitute a new threat to the life of the Appalachian supply.\n\n\n II.\n\n\n Congress in 1938 decided upon federal regulation of the industry. It did so after an exhaustive investigation of all aspects including failing supply and competition for the use of natural gas intensified by growing scarcity. \n29\n Pipelines from the Appalachian area to markets were in the control of a handful of holding company systems. \n30\n This created a highly concentrated control of the producers' market and of the consumers' supplies. While holding companies dominated both production and distribution they segregated those activities in separate \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 638]\n\u00a0\n subsidiaries,31 the effect of which, if not the purpose, was to isolate some end of the business from the reach of any one state commission. The cost of natural gas to consumers moved steadily upwards over the years, out of proportion to prices of oil, which, except for the element of competition, is produced under somewhat comparable conditions. The public came to feel that the companies were exploiting the growing scarcity of local gas. The problems of this region had much to do with creating the demand for federal regulation.\n The Natural Gas Act declared the natural gas business to be 'affected with a public interest,' and its regulation 'necessary in the public interest.' \n32\n Originally, and at the time this proceeding was commenced and tried, it also declared 'the intention of Congress that natural gas shall be sold in interstate commerce for resale for ultimate public consumption for domestic, commercial, industrial, or any other use at the lowest possible reasonable rate consistent with the maintenance of adequate service in the public interest.' 33 While this was later dropped, there is nothing to indicate that it was not and is not still an accurate statement of purpose of the Act. Extension or improvement of facilities may be ordered when 'necessary or desirable in the public interest,' abandonment of facilities may be ordered when the supply is 'depleted to the extent that the continuance of service is unwarranted, or that the present or future public convenience or necessity \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 639]\n\u00a0\n permit' abandonment and certain extensions can only be made on finding of 'the present or future public convenience and necessity.' \n34\n The Commission is required to take account of the ultimate use of the gas. Thus it is given power to suspend new schedules as to rates, charges, and classification of services except where the schedules are for the sale of gas 'for resale for industrial use only,'35 which gives the companies greater freedom to increase rates on industrial gas than on domestic gas. More particularly, the Act expressly forbids any undue preference or advantage to any person or 'any unreasonable difference in rates ... either as between localities or as between classes of service.' \n36\n And the power of the Commission expressly includes that to determine the 'just and reasonable rate, charge, classification, rule, regulation, practice, or contract to be thereafter observed and in force.' \n37\n\u00a0\n\n In view of the Court's opinion that the Commission in administering the Act may ignore discrimination, it is interesting that in reporting this Bill both the Senate and the House Committees on Interstate Commerce pointed out that in 1934, on a nationwide average the price of natural gas per m.c.f. was 74.6 cents for domestic use, 49.6 cents for commercial use, and 16.9 for industrial use. \n38\n I am not ready to think that supporters of a bill called attention to the striking fact that householders were being charged five times as much for their gas as industrial users only as a situation which the Bill would do nothing to remedy. On the other hand the Act gave to the Commission what the Court aptly describes as 'broad powers of regulation.' \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 640]\n\u00a0\n III.\n This proceeding was initiated by the Cities of Cleveland and Akron. They alleged that the price charged by Hope for natural gas 'for resale to domestic, commercial and small industrial consumers in Cleveland and elsewhere is excessive, unjust, unreasonable, greatly in excess of the price charged by Hope to nonaffiliated companies at wholesale for resale to domestic, commercial and small industrial consumers, and greatly in excess of the price charged by Hope to East Ohio for resale to certain favored industrial consumers in Ohio, and therefore is further unduly discriminatory between consumers and between classes of service' (italics supplied). The company answered admitting differences in prices to affiliated and nonaffiliated companies and justifying them by differences in conditions of delivery. As to the allegation that the contract price is 'greatly in excess of the price charged by Hope to East Ohio for resale to certain favored industrial consumers in Ohio,' Hope did not deny a price differential, but alleged that industrial gas was not sold to 'favored consumers' but was sold under contract and schedules filed with and approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, and that certain conditions of delivery made it not 'unduly discriminatory.'\n The record shows that in 1940 Hope delivered for industrial consumption 36,523,792 m.c.f. and for domestic and commercial consumption, 50,343,652 m.c.f. I find no separate figure for domestic consumption. It served 43,767 domestic consumers directly, 511,521 through the East Ohio Gas Company, and 154,043 through the Peoples Natural Gas Company, both affiliates owned by the same parent. Its special contracts for industrial consumption, so far as appear, are confined to about a dozen big industries. \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 641]\n\u00a0\n Hope is responsible for discrimination as exists in favor of these few industrial consumers. It controls both the resale price and use of industrial gas by virtue of the very interstate sales contracts over which the Commission is exercising its jurisdiction.\n Hope's contract with East Ohio Company is an example. Hope agrees to deliver, and the Ohio Company to take, '(a) all natural gas requisite for the supply of the domestic consumers of the Ohio Company; (b) such amounts of natural gas as may be requisite to fulfill contracts made with the consent and approval of the Hope Company by the Ohio Company, or companies which it supplies with natural gas, for the sale of gas upon special terms and conditions for manufacturing purposes.' The Ohio company is required to read domestic customers' meters once a month and meters of industrial customers daily and to furnish all meter readings to Hope. The Hope Company is to have access to meters of all consumers and to all of the Ohio Company's accounts. The domestic consumers of the Ohio Company are to be fully supplied in preference to consumers purchasing for manufacturing purposes and 'Hope Company can be required to supply gas to be used for manufacturing purposes only where the same is sold under special contracts which have first been submitted to and approved in writing by the Hope Company and which expressly provide that natural gas will be supplied thereunder only in so far as the same is not necessary to meet the requirements of domestic consumers supplied through pipe lines of the Ohio Company.' This basic contract was supplemented from time to time, chiefly as to price. The last amendment was in a letter from Hope to East Ohio in 1937. It contained a special discount on industrial gas and a schedule of special industrial contracts, Hope reserving the right to make eliminations therefrom and agreeing that others might be added from time to \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 642]\n\u00a0\n time with its approval in writing. It said, 'It is believed that the price concessions contained in this letter, while not based on our costs, are under certain conditions, to our mutual advantage in maintaining and building up the volumes of gas sold by us (italics supplied).'39\n The Commission took no note of the charges of discrimination and made no disposition of the issue tendered on this point. It ordered a flat reduction in the price per m.c.f. of all gas delivered by Hope in interstate commerce. It made no limitation, condition, or provision as to what classes of consumers should get the benefit of the reduction. While the cities have accepted and are defending the reduction, it is my view that the discrimination of which they have complained is perpetuated and increased by the order of the Commission and that it violates the Act in so doing.\n The Commission's opinion aptly characterizes its entire objective by saying that 'bona fide investment figures now become all-important in the regulation of rates.' It should be noted that the all-importance of this theory is not the result of any instruction from Congress. When the Bill to regulate gas was first before Congress it con- \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 643]\n\u00a0\n tained the following: 'In determining just and reasonable rates the Commission shall fix such rate as will allow a fair return upon the actual legitimate prudent cost of the property used and useful for the service in question.' H.R. 5423, 74th Cong., 1st Sess. Title III,  312(c). Congress rejected this language. See H.R. 5423,  213 (211(c)), and H.R. Rep. No. 1318, 74th Cong., 1st Sess. 30.\n The Commission contends nevertheless that the 'all important' formula for finding a rate base is that of prudent investment. But it excluded from the investment base an amount actually and admittedly invested of some $17,000,000. It did so because it says that the Company recouped these expenditures from customers before the days of regulation from earnings above a fair return. But it would not apply all of such 'excess earnings' to reduce the rate base as one of the Commissioners suggested. The reason for applying excess earnings to reduce the investment base roughly from $69,000,000 to $52,000,000 but refusing to apply them to reduce it from that to some $18,000,000 is not found in a difference in the character of the earnings or in their reinvestment. The reason assigned is a difference in bookkeeping treatment many years before the Company was subject to regulation. The $17,000,000, reinvested chiefly in well drilling, was treated on the books as expense. (The Commission now requires that drilling costs be carried to capital account.) The allowed rate base thus actually was determined by the Company's bookkeeping, not its investment. This attributes a significance to formal classification in account keeping that seems inconsistent with rational rate regulation. \n40\n Of \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 644]\n\u00a0\n course, the Commission would not and should not allow a rate base to be inflated by bookkeeping which had improperly capitalized expenses. I have doubts about resting public regulation upon any rule that is to be used or not depending on which side it favors. \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 645]\n\u00a0\n The Company on the other hand, has not put its gas fields into its calculations on the present-value basis, although that, it contends, is the only lawful rule for finding a rate base. To do so would result in a rate higher than it has charged or proposes as a matter of good business to charge.\n The case before us demonstrates the lack of rational relationship between conventional rate-base formulas and natural gas production and the extremities to which regulating bodies are brought by the effort to rationalize them. The Commission and the Company each stands on a different theory, and neither ventures to carry its theory to logical conclusion as applied to gas fields.\n\n\n IV.\n\n\n This order is under judicial review not because we interpose constitutional theories between a State and the business it seeks to regulate, but because Congress put upon the federal courts a duty toward administration of a new federal regulatory Act. If we are to hold that a given rate is reasonable just because the Commission has said it was reasonable, review becomes a costly, time-consuming pageant of no practical value to anyone. If on the other hand we are to bring judgment of our own to the task, we should for the guidance of the regulators and the regulated reveal something of the philosophy, be it legal or economic or social, which guides us. We need not be slaves to a formula but unless we can point out a rational way of reaching our conclusions they can only be accepted as resting on intuition or predilection. I must admit that I possess no instinct jby which to know the 'reasonable' from the 'unreasonable' in prices and must seek some conscious design for decision.\n The Court sustains this order as reasonable, but what makes it so or what could possibly make it otherwise, \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 646]\n\u00a0\n I cannot learn. It holds that: 'it is the result reached not the method employed which is controlling'; 'the fact that the method employed to reach that result may contain infirmities is not then important' and it is not 'important to this case to determine the various permissible ways in which any rate base on which the return is computed might be arrived at.' The Court does lean somewhat on considerations of capitalization and dividend history and requirements for dividends on outstanding stock. But I can give no real weight to that for it is generally and I think deservedly in discredit as any guide in rate cases. \n41\n\u00a0\n\n Our books already contain so much talk of methods of rationalizing rates that we must appear ambiguous if we announce results without our working methods. We are confronted with regulation of a unique type of enterprise which I think requires considered rejection of much conventional utility doctrine and adoption of concepts of 'just and reasonable' rates and practices and of the 'public interest' that will take account of the peculiarities of the business.\n The Court rejects the suggestions of this opinion. It says that the Committees in reporting the bill which became the Act said it provided 'for regulation along recognized and more or less standardized lines' and that there was 'nothing novel in its provisions.' So saying it sustains a rate calculated on a novel variation of a rate base theory which itself had at the time of enactment of the legislation been recognized only in dissenting opinions. Our difference seems to be between unconscious innovation,42 and the purposeful and deliberate innovation I \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 647]\n\u00a0\n would make to meet the necessities of regulating the industry before us.\n Hope's business has two components of quite divergent character. One, while not a conventional common-carrier undertaking, is essentially a transportation enterprise consisting of conveying gas from where it is produced to point of delivery to the buyer. This is a relatively routine operation not differing substantially from many other utility operations. The service is produced by an investment in compression and transmission facilities. Its risks are those of investing in a tested means of conveying a discovered supply of gas to a known market. A rate base calculated on the prudent investment formula would seem a reasonably satisfactory measure for fixing a return from that branch of the business whose service is roughly proportionate to the capital invested. But it has other consequences which must not be overlooked. It gives marketability and hence 'value' to gas owned by the company and gives the pipeline company a large power over the marketability and hence 'value' of the production of others.\n The other part of the business-to reduce to possession an adequate supply of natural gas-is of opposite character, being more erratic and irregular and unpredictable in relation to investment than any phase of any other utility business. A thousand feet of gas captured and severed from real estate for delivery to consumers is recognized under our law as property of much the same nature as a ton of coal, a barrel of oil, or a yard of sand. The value to be allowed for it is the real battleground between the investor and consumer. It is from this part of the business that the chief difference between the parties as to a proper rate base arises.\n It is necessary to a 'reasonable' price for gas that it be anchored to a rate base of any kind? Why did courts in the first place begin valuing 'rate bases' in order to 'value' something else? The method came into vogue \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 648]\n\u00a0\n in fixing rates for transportation service which the public obtained from common carriers. The public received none of the carriers' physical property but did make some use of it. The carriage was often a monopoly so there were no open market criteria as to reasonableness. The 'value' or 'cost' of what was put to use in the service by the carrier was not a remote or irrelevant consideration in making such rates. Moreover the difficulty of appraising an intangible service was thought to be simplified if it could be related to physical property which was visible and measurable and the items of which might have market value. The court hoped to reason from the known to the unknown. But gas fields turn this method topsy turvy. Gas itself is tangible, possessible, and does have a market and a price in the field. The value of the rate base is more elusive than that of gas. It consists of intangibles-leaseholds and freeholds-operated and unoperated-of little use in themselves except as rights to reach and capture gas. Their value lies almost wholly in predictions of discovery, and of price of gas when captured, and bears little relation to cost of tools and supplies and labor to develop it. Gas is what Hope sells and it can be directly priced more reasonably and easily and accurately than the components of a rate base can be valued. Hence the reason for resort to a roundabout way of rate base price fixing does not exist in the case of gas in the field.\n But if found, and by whatever method found, a rate base is little help in determining reasonableness of the price of gas. Appraisal of present value of these intangible rights to pursue fugitive gas depends on the value assigned to the gas when captured. The 'present fair value' rate base, generally in ill repute,43 is not even urged by the gas company for valuing its fields. \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 649]\n\u00a0\n The prudent investment theory has relative merits in fixing rates for a utility which creates its service merely by its investment. The amount and quality of service rendered by the usual utility will, at least roughly, be measured by the amount of capital it puts into the enterprise. But it has no rational application where there is no such relationship between investment and capacity to serve. There is no such relationship between investment and amount of gas produced. Let us assume that Doe and Roe each produces in West Virginia for delivery to Cleveland the same quantity of natural gas per day. Doe, however, through luck or foresight or whatever it takes, gets his gas from investing $50,000 in leases and drilling. Roe drilled poorer territory, got smaller wells, and has invested $250,000. Does anybody imagine that Roe can get or ought to get for his gas five times as much as Doe because he has spent five times as much? The service one renders to society in the gas business is measured by what he gets out of the ground, not by what he puts into it, and there is little more relation between the investment and the results than in a game of poker.\n Two-thirds of the gas Hope handles it buys from about 340 independent producers. It is obvious that the principle of rate-making applied to Hope's own gas cannot be applied, and has not been applied, to the bulk of the gas Hope delivers. It is not probable that the investment of any two of these producers will bear the same ratio to their investments. The gas, however, all goes to the same use, has the same utilization value and the same ultimate price.\n To regulate such an enterprise by undiscriminatingly transplanting any body of rate doctrine conceived and \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 650]\n\u00a0\n adapted to the ordinary utility business can serve the 'public interest' as the Natural Gas Act requires, if at all, only by accident. Mr. Justice Brandeis, the pioneer juristic advocate of the prudent investment theory for man-made utilities, never, so far as I am able to discover, proposed its application to a natural gas case. On the other hand, dissenting in Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, he reviewed the problems of gas supply and said, 'In no other field of public service regulation is the controlling body confronted with factors so baffling as in the natural gas industry, and in none is continuous supervision and control required in so high a degree.' \n262 \nU.S. 553, 621\n, 43 S.Ct. 658, 674, 32 A.L.R. 300. If natural gas rates are intelligently to be regulated we must fit our legal principles to the economy of the industry and not try to fit the industry to our books.\n As our decisions stand the Commission was justified in believing that it was required to proceed by the rate base method even as to gas in the field. For this reason the Court may not merely wash its hands of the method and rationale of rate making. The fact is that this Court, with no discussion of its fitness, simply transferred the rate base method to the natural gas industry. It happened in Newark Natural Gas & Fuel Co. v. City of Newark, Ohio, 1917, \n242 \nU.S. 405\n, 37 S.Ct. 156, 157, Ann. Cas.1917B, 1025, in which the company wanted 25 cents per m.c.f., and under the Fourteenth Amendment challenged the reduction to 18 cents by ordinance. This Court sustained the reduction because the court below 'gave careful consideration to the questions of the value of the property ... at the time of the inquiry,' and whether the rate 'would be sufficient to provide a fair return on the value of the property.' The Court said this method was 'based upon principles thoroughly established by repeated secisions of this court,' citing many cases, not one of which involved natural gas or a comparable wasting natural resource. Then came issues as to state power to \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 651]\n\u00a0\n regulate as affected by the commerce clause. Public Utilities Commission v. Landon, 1919, \n249 \nU.S. 236\n, 39 S.Ct. 268; Pennsylvania Gas Co. v. Public Service Commission, 1920, \n252 \nU.S. 23\n, 40 S.Ct. 279. These questions settled, the Court again was called upon in natural gas cases to consider state rate-making claimed to be invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment. United Fuel Gas Co. v. Railroad Commission of Kentucky, 1929, \n278 \nU.S. 300\n, 49 S.Ct. 150; United Fuel Gas Company v. Public Service Commission of West Virginia, 1929, \n278 \nU.S. 322\n, 49 S.Ct. 157. Then, as now, the differences were 'due chiefly to the difference in value ascribed by each to the gas rights and leaseholds.' \n278 \nU.S. 300, 311\n, 49 S.Ct. 150, 153. No one seems to have questioned that the rate base method must be pursued and the controversy was at what rate base must be used. Later the 'value' of gas in the field was questioned in determining the amount a regulated company should be allowed to pay an affiliate therefor-a state determination also reviewed under the Fourteenth Amendment. Dayton Power & Light Co. v. Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, 1934, \n292 \nU.S. 290\n, 54 S.Ct. 647; Columbus Gas & Fuel Co. v. Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, 1934, \n292 \nU.S. 398\n, 54 S.Ct. 763, 91 A.L.R. 1403. In both cases, one of which sustained, and one of which struck down a fixed rate the Court assumed the rate base method, as the legal way of testing reasonableness of natural gas prices fixed by public authority, without examining its real relevancy to the inquiry.\n Under the weight of such precedents we cannot expect the Commission to initiate economically intelligent methods of fixing gas prices. But the Court now faces a new plan of federal regulation based on the power to fix the price at which gas shall be allowed to move in interstate commerce. I should now consider whether these rules devised under the Fourteenth Amendment are the exclusive tests of a just and reasonable rate under the federal statute, inviting reargument directed to that point \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 652]\n\u00a0\n if necessary. As I see it now I would be prepared to hold that these rules do not apply to a natural gas case arising under the Natural Gas Act.\n Such a holding would leave the Commission to fix the price of gas in the field as one would fix maximum prices of oil or milk or coal, or any other commodity. Such a price is not calculated to produce a fair return on the synthetic value of a rate base of any individual producer, and would not undertake to assure a fair return to any producer. The emphasis would shift from the producer to the product, which would be regulated with an eye to average or typical producing conditions in the field.\n Such a price fixing process on economic lines would offer little temptation to the judiciary to become back seat drivers of the price fixing machine. The unfortunate effect of judicial intervention in this field is to divert the attention of those engaged in the process from what is economically wise to what is legally permissible. It is probable that price reductions would reach economically unwise and self-defeating limits before they would reach constitutional ones. Any constitutional problems growing out of price fixing are quite different than those that have heretofore been considered to inhere in rate making. A producer would have difficulty showing the invalidity of such a fixed price so long as he voluntarily continued to sell his product in interstate commerce. Should he withdraw and other authority be invoked to compel him to part with his property, a different problem would be presented.\n Allowance in a rate to compensate for gas removed from gas lands, whether fixed as of point of production or as of point of delivery, probably best can be measured by a functional test applied to the whole industry. For good or ill we depend upon private enterprise to exploit these natural resources for public consumption. The function which an allowance for gas in the field should perform \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 653]\n\u00a0\n for society in such circumstances is to be enough and no more than enough to induce private enterprise completely and efficiently to utilize gas resources, to acquire for public service any available gas or gas rights and to deliver gas at a rate and for uses which will be in the future as well as in the present public interest.\n The Court fears that 'if we are now to tell the Commission to fix the rates so as to discourage particular uses, we would indeed be injecting into a rate case a 'novel' doctrine ....' With due deference I suggest that there is nothing novel in the idea that any change in price of a service or commodity reacts to encourage or discourage its use. The question is not whether such consequences will or will not follow; the question is whether effects must be suffered blindly or may be intelligently selected, whether price control shall have targets at which it deliberately aims or shall be handled like a gun in the hands of one who does not know it is loaded.\n We should recognize 'price' for what it is-a tool, a means, an expedient. In public hands it has much the same economic effects as in private hands. Hope knew that a concession in industrial price would tend to build up its volume of sales. It used price as an expedient to that end. The Commission makes another cut in that same price but the Court thinks we should ignore the effect that it will have on exhaustion of supply. The fact is that in natural gas regulation price must be used to reconcile the private property right society has permitted to vest in an important natural resource with the claims of society upon it-price must draw a balance between wealth and welfare.\n To carry this into techniques of inquiry is the task of the Commissioner rather than of the judge, and it certainly is no task to be solved by mere bookkeeping but requires the best economic talent available. There would doubtless be inquiry into the price gas is bringing in the \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 654]\n\u00a0\n field, how far that price is established by arms' length bargaining and how far it may be influenced by agreements in restraint of trade or monopolistic influences. What must Hope really pay to get and to replace gas it delivers under this order? If it should get more or less than that for its own, how much and why? How far are such prices influenced by pipe line access to markets and if the consumers pay returns on the pipe lines how far should the increment they cause go to gas producers? East Ohio is itself a producer in Ohio.44 What do Ohio authorities require Ohio consumers to pay for gas in the field? Perhaps these are reasons why the Federal Government should put West Virginia gas at lower or at higher rates. If so what are they? Should East Ohio be required to exploit its half million acres of unoperated reserve in Ohio before West Virginia resources shall be supplied on a devalued basis of which that State complains and for which she threatens measures of self keep? What is gas worth in terms of other fuels it displaces?\n A price cannot be fixed without considering its effect on the production of gas. Is it an incentive to continue to exploit vast unoperated reserves? Is it conducive to deep drilling tests the result of which we may know only after trial? Will it induce bringing gas from afar to supplement or even to substitute for Appalachian gas?45 Can it be had from distant fields as cheap or cheaper? If so, that competitive potentiality is certainly a relevant consideration. Wise regulation must also consider, as a private buyer would, what alternatives the producer has \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 655]\n\u00a0\n if the price is not acceptable. Hope has intrastate business and domestic and industrial customers. What can it do by way of diverting its supply to intrastate sales? What can it do by way of disposing of its operated or reserve acreage to industrial concerns or other buyers? What can West Virginia do by way of conservation laws, severance or other taxation, if the regulated rate offends? It must be borne in mind that while West Virginia was prohibited from giving her own inhabitants a priority that discriminated against interstate commerce, we have never yet held that a good faith conservation act, applicable to her own, as well as to others, is not valid. In considering alternatives, it must be noted that federal regulation is very incomplete, expressly excluding regulation of 'production or gathering of natural gas,' and that the only present way to get the gas seems to be to call it forth by price inducements. It is plain that there is a downward economic limit on a safe and wise price.\n But there is nothing in the law which compels a commission to fix a price at that 'value' which a company might give to its product by taking advantage of scarcity, or monopoly of supply. The very purpose of fixing maximum prices is to take away from the seller his opportunity to get all that otherwise the market would award him for his goods. This is a constitutional use of the power to fix maximum prices, Block v. Hirsh, \n256 \nU.S. 135\n, 41 S.Ct. 458, 16 A.L.R. 165; Marcus Brown Holding Co. v. Feldman, \n256 \nU.S. 170\n, 41 S.Ct. 465; International Harvester Co. v. Kentucky, \n234 \nU.S. 216\n, 34 S.Ct. 853; Highland v. Russell Car & Snow Plow Co., \n279 \nU.S. 253\n, 49 S.Ct. 314, just as the fixing of minimum prices of goods in interstate commerce is constitutional although it takes away from the buyer the advantage in bargaining which market conditions would give him. United States v. Darby, \n312 \nU.S. 100, 657\n, 61 S.Ct. 451, 132 A.L.R. 1430; Mulford v. Smith, \n307 \nU.S. 38\n, 59 S.Ct. 648; United States v. Rock Royal Co-operative, Inc., \n307 \nU.S. 533\n, 59 S.Ct. 993; Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins, \n310 \nU.S. 381\n, 60 S.Ct. 907. The Commission has power to fix \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 656]\n\u00a0\n a price that will be both maximum and minimum and it has the incidental right, and I think the duty, to choose the economic consequences it will promote or retard in production and also more importantly in consumption, to which I now turn.\n If we assume that the reduction in company revenues is warranted we then come to the question of translating the allowed return into rates for consumers or classes of consumers. Here the Commission fixed a single rate for all gas delivered irrespective of its use despite the fact that Hope has established what amounts to two rates-a high one for domestic use and a lower one for industrial contracts. \n46\n The Commission can fix two prices for interstate gas as readily as one-a price for resale to domestic users and another for resale to industrial users. This is the pattern Hope itself has established in the very contracts over which the Commission is expressly given jurisdiction. Certainly the Act is broad enough to permit two prices to be fixed instead of one, if the concept of the 'public interest' is not unduly narrowed.\n The Commission's concept of the public interest in natural gas cases which is carried today into the Court's opinion was first announced in the opinion of the minority in the Pipeline case. It enumerated only two 'phases of the public interest: (1) the investor interest; (2) the consumer interest,' which it emphasized to the exclusion of all others. \n315 \nU.S. 575, 606\n, 62 S.Ct. 736, 753. This will do well enough in dealing with railroads or utilities supplying manufactured gas, electric, power, a communications service or transportation, where utilization of facilities does not impair their future usefulness. Limitation of supply, however, brings into a natural gas case another phase of the public interest that to my mind overrides both the owner \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 657]\n\u00a0\n and the consumer of that interest. Both producers and industrial consumers have served their immediate private interests at the expense of the long- range public interest. The public interest, of course, requires stopping unjust enrichment of the owner. But it also requires stopping unjust impoverishment of future generations. The public interest in the use by Hope's half million domestic consumers is quite a different one from the public interest in use by a baker's dozen of industries.\n Prudent price fixing it seems to me must at the very threshold determine whether any part of an allowed return shall be permitted to be realized from sales of gas for resale for industrial use. Such use does tend to level out daily and seasonal peaks of domestic demand and to some extent permits a lower charge for domestic service. But is that a wise way of making gas cheaper when, in comparison with any substitute, gas is already a cheap fuel? The interstate sales contracts provide that at times when demand is so great that there is not enough gas to go around domestic users shall first be served. Should the operation of this preference await the day of actual shortage? Since the propriety of a preference seems conceded, should it not operate to prevent the coming of a shortage as well as to mitigate its effects? Should industrial use jeopardize tomorrow's service to householders any more than today's? If, however, it is decided to cheapen domestic use by resort to industrial sales, should they be limited to the few uses for which gas has special values or extend also to those who use it only because it is cheaper than competitive fuels? 47 And how much cheaper should indus- \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 658]\n\u00a0\n trial gas sell than domestic gas, and how much advantage should it have over competitive fuels? If industrial gas is to contribute at all to lowering domestic rates, should it not be made to contribute the very maximum of which it is capable, that is, should not its price be the highest at which the desired volume of sales can be realized?\n If I were to answer I should say that the household rate should be the lowest that can be fixed under commercial conditions that will conserve the supply for that use. The lowest probable rate for that purpose is not likely to speed exhaustion much, for it still will be high enough to induce economy, and use for that purpose has more nearly reached the saturation point. On the other hand the demand for industrial gas at present rates already appears to be increasing. To lower further the industrial rate is merely further to subsidize industrial consumption and speed depletion. The impact of the flat reduction \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 659]\n\u00a0\n of rates ordered here admittedly will be to increase the industrial advantages of gas over competing fuels and to increase its use. I think this is not, and there is no finding by the Commission that it is, in the public interest.\n There is no justification in this record for the present discrimination against domestic users of gas in favor of industrial users. It is one of the evils against which the Natural Gas Act was aimed by Congress and one of the evils complained of here by Cleveland and Akron. If Hope's revenues should be cut by some $3,600,000 the whole reduction is owing to domestic users. If it be considered wise to raise part of Hope's revenues by industrial purpose sales, the utmost possible revenue should be raised from the least consumption of gas. If competitive relationships to other fuels will permit, the industrial price should be substantially advanced, not for the benefit of the Company, but the increased revenues from the advance should be applied to reduce domestic rates. For in my opinion the 'public interest' requires that the great volume of gas now being put to uneconomic industrial use should either be saved for its more important future domestic use or the present domestic user should have the full benefit of its exchange value in reducing his present rates.\n Of course the Commission's power directly to regulate does not extend to the fixing of rates at which the local company shall sell to consumers. Nor is such power required to accomplish the purpose. As already pointed out, the very contract the Commission is altering classifies the gas according to the purposes for which it is to be resold and provides differentials between the two classifications. It would only be necessary for the Commission to order that all gas supplied under paragraph (a) of Hope's contract with the East Ohio Company shall be \n\n[320 \nU.S. 591, 660]\n\u00a0\n at a stated price fixed to give to domestic service the entire reduction herein and any further reductions that may prove possible by increasing industrial rates. It might further provide that gas delivered under paragraph (b) of the contract for industrial purposes to those industrial customers Hope has approved in writing shall be at such other figure as might be found consistent with the public interest as herein defined. It is too late in the day to contend that the authority of a regulatory commission does not extend to a consideration of public interests which it may not directly regulate and a conditioning of its orders for their protection. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Railway Labor Executives Ass'n, \n315 \nU.S. 373\n, 62 S.Ct. 717; United States v. Lowden, \n308 \nU.S. 225\n, 60 S.Ct. 248.\n Whether the Commission will assert its apparently broad statutory authorization over prices and discriminations is, of course, its own affair, not ours. It is entitled to its own notion of the 'public interest' and its judgment of policy must prevail. However, where there is ground for thinking that views of this Court may have constrained the Commission to accept the rate-base method of decision and a particular single formula as 'all important' for a rate base, it is appropriate to make clear the reasons why I, at least, would not be so understood. The Commission is free to face up realistically to the nature and peculiarity of the resources in its control, to foster their duration in fixing price, and to consider future interests in addition to those of investors and present consumers. If we return this case it may accept or decline the proffered freedom. This problem presents the Commission an unprecedented opportunity if it will boldly make sound economic considerations, instead of legal and accounting theories, the foundation of federal policy. I would return the case to the Commission and thereby be clearly quit of what now may appear to be some responsibility for perpetrating a shortsighted pattern of natural gas regulation. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Hope produces about one-third of its annual gas requirements and purchases the rest under some 300 contracts. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] These five companies are the East Ohio Gas Co., the Peoples Natural Gas Co., the River Gas Co., the Fayette County Gas Co., and the Manufacturers Light & Heat Co. The first three of these companies are, like Hope, subsidiaries of Standard Oil Co. (N.J.). East Ohio and River distribute gas in Ohio, the other three in Pennsylvania. Hope's approximate sales in m.c.f. for 1940 may be classified as follows:\n\n Local West Virginia sales 11,000,000 East Ohio 40,000,000 Peoples 10,000,000 River 400,000 Fayette 860,000 Manufacturers 2,000,000\n Hope's natural gas is processed by Hope Construction & Refining Co., an affiliate, for the extraction of gasoline and butane. Domestic Coke Corp., another affiliate, sells coke-oven gas to Hope for boiler fuel.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] These required minimum reductions of 7\u00f5 per m.c.f. from the 36.5\u00f5 and 35.5\u00f5 rates previously charged East Ohio and Peoples, respectively, and 3\u00f5 per m.c.f. from the 31.5\u00f5 rate previously charged Fayette and Manufacturers. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The book reserve for interstate plant amounted at the end of 1938 to about $18,000,000 more than the amount determined by the Commission as the proper reserve requirement. The Commission also noted that 'twice in the past the company has transferred amounts aggregating $7,500,000 from the depreciation and depletion reserve to surplus. When these latter adjustments are taken into account, the excess becomes $25,500,000, which has been exacted from the ratepayers over and above the amount required to cover the consumption of property in the service rendered and thus to keep the investment unimpaired.' 44 P.U.R.,N.S., at page 22. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] That contention was based on the fact that 'every single dollar in the depreciation and depletion reserves' was taken 'from gross operating revenues whose only source was the amounts charged customers in the past for natural gas. It is, therefore, a fact that the depreciation and depletion reserves have been contributed by the customers and do not represent any investment by Hope.' Id., 44 P.U.R.,N.S., at page 40. And see Railroad Commission v. Cumberland Tel. & T. Co., \n212 \nU.S. 414, 424\n, 425 S., 29 S.Ct. 357, 361, 362; 2 Bonbright, Valuation of Property (1937), p. 1139. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The Commission noted that the case was 'free from the usual complexities involved in the estimate of gas reserves because the geologists for the company and the Commission presented estimates of the remaining recoverable gas reserves which were about one per cent apart.' 44 P.U.R.,N.S., at pages 19, 20.\n The Commission utilized the 'straight-line-basis' for determining the depreciation and depletion reserve requirements. It used estimates of the average service lives of the property by classes based in part on an inspection of the physical condition of the property. And studies were made of Hope's retirement experience and maintenance policies over the years. The average service lives of the various classes of property were converted into depreciation rates and then applied to the cost of the property to ascertain the portion of the cost which had expired in rendering the service.\n The record in the present case shows that Hope is on the lookout for new sources of supply of natural gas and is contemplating an extension of its pipe line into Louisiana for that purpose. The Commission recognized in fixing the rates of depreciation that much material may be used again when various present sources of gas supply are exhausted, thus giving that property more than scrap value at the end of its present use. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] See Uniform System of Accounts prescribed for Natural Gas Companies effective January 1, 1940, Account No. 332.1. \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Sec. 6 of the Act comes the closest to supplying any definite criteria for rate making. It provides in subsection (a) that, 'The Commission may investigate the ascertain the actual legitimate cost of the property of every natural-gas company, the depreciation therein, and, when found necessary for rate-making purposes, other facts which bear on the determination of such cost or depreciation and the fair value of such property.' Subsection (b) provides that every natural-gas company on request shall file with the Commission a statement of the 'original cost' of its property and shall keep the Commission informed regarding the 'cost' of all additions, etc. \n[\nFootnote 9\n] We recently stated that the meaning of the word 'value' is to be gathered 'from the purpose for which a valuation is being made. Thus the question in a valuation for rate making is how much a utility will be allowed to earn. The basic question in a valuation for reorganization purposes is how much the enterprise in all probability can earn.' Institutional Investors v. Chicago, M., St. P. & P.R. Co., \n318 \nU.S. 523, 540\n, 63 S.Ct. 727, 738. \n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] Chief Justice Hughes said in that case (292 U.S. at pages 168, 169, 54 S.Ct. at page 665): 'If the predictions of service life were entirely accurate and retirements were made when and as these predictions were precisely fulfilled, the depreciation reserve would represent the consumption of capital, on a cost basis, according to the method which spreads that loss over the respective service periods. But if the amounts charged to operating expenses and credited to the account for depreciation reserve are excessive, to that extent subscribers for the telephone service are required to provide, in effect, capital contributions, not to make good losses incurred by the utility in the service rendered and thus to keep its investment unimpaired, but to secure additional plant and equipment upon which the utility expects a return.' \n[\nFootnote 11\n] See Mr. Justice Brandeis (dissenting) in United Railways & Electric Co. v. West, \n280 \nU.S. 234\n, 259-288, 50 S.Ct. 123, 128-138, for an extended analysis of the problem. \n[\nFootnote 12\n] It should be noted that the Act provides no specific rule governing depletion and depreciation. Sec. 9(a) merely states that the Commission 'may from time to time ascertain and determine, and by order fix, the proper and adequate rates of depreciation and amortization of the several classes of property of each natural-gas company used or useful in the production, transportation, or sale of natural gas.' \n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] See Simonton, The Nature of the Interest of the Grantee Under an Oil and Gas Lease (1918), 25 W.Va.L.Quar. 295. \n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] West Penn Power Co. v.

Art. 13,  2a, 3a. \n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] West Virginia suggests as a possible solution (1) that a 'going concern value' of the company's tangible assets be included in the rate base and (2) that the fair market value of gas delivered to customers be added to the outlay for operating expenses and taxes. \n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] S.Doc. 92, Pt. 84-A, ch.

Considerations of conservation entered into the proposal to give the Act that broader scope. H.Rep.No. 1290, 77th Cong. 1st Sess., pp. 2, 3. And see Annual Report, Federal Power Commission (1940) pp. 79, 80; Baum, The Federal Power Commission and State Utility Regulation (1942), p. 261.\n The bill amending  7(c) originally contained a subsection (h) reading as follows: 'Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to affect the authority of a State within which natural gas is produced to authorize or require the construction or extension of facilities for the transportation and sale of such gas within such State: Provided, however, That the Commission, after a hearing upon complaint or upon its own motion, may by order forbid any intrastate construction or extension by any natural-gas company which it shall find will prevent such company from rendering adequate service to its customers in interstate or foreign commerce in territory already being served.' See Hearings on H.R. 5249, House Committee on Interstate & Foreign Commerce, 77th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 7, 11, 21, 29, 32, 33. In explanation of its deletion the House Committee Report stated, pp. 4, 5: 'The increasingly important problems raised by the desire of several States to regulate the use of the natural gas produced therein in the interest of consumers within such States, as against the Federal power to regulate interstate commerce in the interest of both interstate and intrastate consumers, are deemed by the committee to warrant further intensive study and probably a more retailed and comprehensive plan for the handling thereof than that which would have been provided by the stricken subsection.' \n\n[\nFootnote 24\n] We have noted that in the annual operating expenses of some $16, 000.000 the Commission included West Virginia and federal taxes. And in the net increase of $421,160 over 1940 operating expenses allowed by the Commission was some $80,000 for increased West Virginia property taxes. The adequacy of these amounts has not been challenged here. \n[\nFootnote 25\n] The Commission included in the aggregate annual operating expenses which it allowed some $8,500,000 for gas purchased. It also allowed about $ 1,400,000 for natural gas production and about $600,000 for exploration and development.\n It is suggested, however, that the Commission in ascertaining the cost of Hope's natural gas production plant proceeded contrary to  1(b) which provides that the Act shall not apply to 'the production or gathering of natural gas'. But such valuation, like the provisions for operating expenses, is essential to the rate-making function as customarily performed in this country. Cf. Smith, The Control of Power Rates in the United States and England (1932), 159 The Annals 101. Indeed  14(b) of the Act gives the Commission the power to 'determine the propriety and reasonableness of the inclusion in operating expenses, capital, or surplus of all delay rentals or other forms of rental or compensation for unoperated lands and leases.' \n\n[\nFootnote 26\n] See note 25, supra. \n[\nFootnote 27\n] The Commission has expressed doubts over its power to fix rates on 'direct sales to industries' from interstate pipelines as distinguished from 'sales for resale to the industrial customers of distributing companies.' Annual Report, Federal Power Commission (1940), p. 11. \n\n[\nFootnote 28\n] Sec. 1(b) of the Act provides: 'The provisions of this Act shall apply to the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, to the sale in interstate commerce of natural gas for resale for ultimate public consumption for domestic, commercial, industrial, or any other use, and to natural-gas companies engaged in such transportation or sale, but shall not apply to any other transportation or sale of natural gas or to the local distribution of natural gas or to the facilities used for such distribution or to the production or gathering of natural gas.' And see  2(6), defining a 'natural-gas company', and H.Rep.No. 709, supra, pp. 2, 3. \n[\nFootnote 29\n] The wasting-asset characteristic of the industry was recognized prior to the Act as requiring the inclusion of a depletion allowance among operating expenses. See Columbus Gas & Fuel Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, \n292 \nU.S. 398, 404\n, 405 S., 54 S.Ct. 763, 766, 767, 91 A.L.R. 1403. But no such theory of rate-making for natural gas companies as is now suggested emerged from the cases arising during the earlier period of regulation. \n\n[\nFootnote 30\n] The Commission has been alert to the problems of conservation in its administration of the Act. It has indeed suggested that it might be wise to restrict the use of natural gas 'by functions rather than by areas.' Annual Report (1940) p. 79.\n The Commission stated in that connection that natural gas was particularly adapted to certain industrial uses. But it added that the general use of such gas 'under boilers for the production of steam' is 'under most circumstances of very questionable social economy.' Ibid. \n\n[\nFootnote 31\n] The argument is that  4(a) makes 'unlawful' the charging of any rate that is not just and reasonable. And  14(a) gives the Commission power to investigate any matter 'which it may find necessary or proper in order to determine whether any person has violated' any provision of the Act. Moreover,  5(b) gives the Commission power to investigate and determine the cost of production or transportation of natural gas in cases where it has 'no authority to establish a rate governing the transportation or sale of such natural gas.' And  17(c) directs the Commission to 'make available to the several State commissions such information and reports as may be of assistance in State regulation of natural-gas companies.' For a discussion of these points by the Commission see 44 P.U.R.,N.S., at pages 34, 35. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Natural Gas Act,  4(a), 52 Stat. 821, 822, 15 U.S.C.  717c(a), 15 U.S.C.A.  717c(a). \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 52 Stat. 821, 824, 15 U.S.C.  717e, 15 U.S.C.A.  717e:\n'(a) The Commission may investigate and ascertain the actual legitimate cost of the property of every natural-gas company, the depreciation therein, and, when found necessary for rate-making purposes, other facts which bear on the determination of such cost or depreciation and the fair value of such property.\n\n'(b) Every natural-gas company upon request shall file with the Commission an inventory of all or any part of its property and a statement of the original cost thereof, and shall keep the Commission informed regarding the cost of all additions, betterments, extensions, and new construction.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 'Reproduction cost' has been variously defined, but for rate making purposes the most useful sense seems to be, the minimum amount necessary to create at the time of the inquiry a modern plant capable of rendering equivalent service. See I Bonbright, Valuation of Property (1937) 152. Reproduction cost as the cost of building a replica of an obsolescent plant is not of real significance.\n'Prudent investment' is not defined by the Court. It may mean the sum originally put in the enterprise, either with or without additional amounts from excess earnings reinvested in the business. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] It is of no more than bookkeeping significance whether the Commission allows a rate of return commensurate with the risk of the original investment or the lower rate based on current risk and a capitalization reflecting the established earning power of a successful company and the probable cost of duplicating its services. Cf. American T . & T. Co. v. United States, \n299 \nU.S. 232\n, 57 S.Ct. 170. But the latter is the traditional method. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \n315 \nU.S. 575\n, 62 S.Ct. 736. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Judge Dobie, dissenting below, pointed out that the majority opinion in the Pipeline case 'contains no express discussion of the Prudent Investment Theory' and that the concurring opinion contained a clear one, and said, 'It is difficult for me to believe that the majority of the Supreme Court, believing otherwise, would leave such a statement unchallenged.' (134 F.2d 287, 312.) The fact that two other Justices had as matter of record in our books long opposed the reproduction cost theory of rate bases and had commented favorably on the prudent investment theory may have influenced that conclusion. See opinion of Mr. Justice Frankfurter in Driscoll v. Edison Light & Power Co., \n307 \nU.S. 104, 122\n, 59 S.Ct. 715, 724, and my brief as Solicitor General in that case. It should be noted, however, that these statements were made, not in a natural gas case, but in an electric power case-a very important distinction, as I shall try to make plain. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Natural gas from the Appalachian field averages about 1050 to 1150 B.T.U. content, while by-product manufactured gas is about 530 to 540.

Indeed, it has expressly excepted it from the operation of the Interstate Commerce Commissions Law ( Interstate Commerce Commissions Law, section 1). It is quite clear, therefore, that this Commission can not require a Pennsylvania corporation producing gas in Pennsylvania to transport it and deliver it in the State of New York, and that the Interstate Commerce Commission is likewise powerless. If there exists such a power, and it seems that there does, it is a power vested in Congress and by it not yet exercised. There is no available source of supply for the Crystal City Company at present except through purchasing from the Porter Gas Company. It is possible that this Commission might fix a price at which the Potter Gas Company should sell if it sold at all, but as the Commission can not require it to supply gas in the State of New York, the exercise of such a power to fix the price, if such power exists, would merely say, sell at this price or keep out of the State.'

The Public Service Commission rejected these rates and fixed a flat rate of 58\u00f5 per m.c.f. Lane v. Crystal City Gas Co., 8 New York Public Service Comm. Reports, Second District, 210.\n The Pennsylvania Gas Company (National Fuel Gas Company group) also attempted a sliding scale rate for New York consumers, net per month as follows: First 5,000 feet, 35\u00f5; second 5,000 feet, 45\u00f5; third 5,000 feet, 50\u00f5; all above 15,000, 55\u00f5. This was eventually abandoned, however. The company's present scale in Pennsylvania appears to be reversed to the following net monthly rate; first 3 m.c.f., 75\u00f5; next 4 m.c.f., 60\u00f5; next 8 m.c.f., 55\u00f5; over 15 m.c.f., 50\u00f5.

Even as a recording of current transactions, bookkeeping is hardly an exact science. As a representation of the condition and trend of a business, it uses symbols of certainty to express values that actually are in constant flux. It may be said that in commercial or investment banking or any business extending credit success depends on knowing what not to believe in accounting. Few concerns go into bankruptcy or reorganization whose books do not show them solvent and often even profitable. If one cannot rely on accountancy accurately to disclose past or current conditions of a business, the fallacy of using it as a sole guide to future price policy ought to be apparent. However, our quest for certitude is so ardent that we pay an irrational reverence to a technique which uses symbols of certainty, even though experience again and again warns us that they are delusive. Few writers have ventured to challenge this American idolatry, but see Hamilton, Cost as a standard for Price, 4 Law and Contemporary Problems 321, 323-25. He observes that 'As the apostle would put it, accountancy is all things to all men. ... Its purpose determines the character of a system of accounts.' He analyzes the hypothetical character of accounting and says 'It was no eternal mold for pecuniary verities handed down from on high. \n It was-like logic or algebra, or the device of analogy in the law-an ingenious contrivance of the human mind to serve a limited and practical purpose.' 'Accountancy is far from being a pecuniary expression of all that is industrial reality. It is an instrument, highly selective in its application, in the service of the institution of money making.'As to capital account he observes 'In an enterprise in lusty competition with others of its kind, survival is the thing and the system of accounts has its focus in solvency. ... Accordingly depreciation, obsolescence, and other factors which carry no immediate threat are matters of lesser concern and the capital account is likely to be regarded as a secondary phenomenon. ... But in an enterprise, such as a public utility, where continued survival seems assured, solvency is likely to be taken for granted. ... A persistent and ingenious attention is likely to be directed not so much to securing the upkeep of the physical property as to making it certain that capitalization fails in not one whit to give full recognition to every item that should go into the account.' \n\n[\nFootnote 41\n] See 2 Bonbright, Valuation of Property (1937) 1112. \n[\nFootnote 42\n] Bonbright says, '... the vice of traditional law lies, not in its adoption of excessively rigid concepts of value and rules of valuation, but rather in its tendency to permit shifts in meaning that are inept, or else that are ill-defined because the judges that make them will not openly admit that they are doing so.' Id., 1170. \n\n[\nFootnote 43\n] 'The attempt to regulate rates by reference to a periodic or occasional reappraisal of the properties has now been tested long enough to confirm the worst fears of its critics. Unless its place is taken by some more promising scheme of rate control, the days of private ownership under government regulation may be numbered.' 2 Bonbright, Valuation of Property (1937) 1190. \n\n[\nFootnote 44\n] East Ohio itself owns natural gas rights in 550,600 acres, 518,526 of which are reserved and 32,074 operated, by 375 wells. Moody's Manual of Public Utilities (1943) 5. \n[\nFootnote 45\n] Hope has asked a certificate of convenience and necessity to lay 1140 miles of 22-inch pipeline from Hugoton gas fields in southwest Kansas to West Virginia to carry 285 million cu. ft. of natural gas per day. The cost was estimated at $51,000,000. Moody's Manual of Public Utilities ( 1943) 1760. \n\n[\nFootnote 46\n] I find little information as to the rates for industries in the record and none at all in such usual sources as Moody's Manual. \n\n[\nFootnote 47\n] The Federal Power Commission has touched upon the problem of conservation in connection with an application for a certificate permitting construction of a 1500-mile pipeline from southern Texas to New York City and says: 'The Natural Gas Act as presently drafted does not enable the Commission to treat fully the serious implications of such a problem. The question should be raised as to whether the proposed use of natural gas would not result in displacing a less valuable fuel and create hardships in the industry already supplying the market, while at the same time rapidly depleting the country's natural-gas reserves. Although, for a period of perhaps 20 years, the natural gas could be so priced as to appear to offer an apparent saving in fuel costs, this would mean simply that social costs which must eventually be paid had been ignored.\n'Careful study of the entire problem may lead to the conclusion that use of natural gas should be restricted by functions rather than by areas. Thus, it is especially adapted to space and water heating in urban homes and other buildings and to the various industrial heat processes which require concentration of heat, flexibility of control, and uniformity of results. Industrial uses to which it appears particularly adapted include the treating and annealing of metals, the operation of kilns in the ceramic, cement, and lime industries, the manufacture of glass in its various forms, and use as a raw material in the chemical industry. General use of natural gas under boilers for the production of steam is, however, under most circumstances of very questionable social economy.'

UNITED STATES(1944)\nNo. 193\nArgued: December 17, 1943Decided: May 29, 1944\n\n\n\n Rehearing Denied Oct. 9, 1944\n\n\n See 65 S.Ct. 26.\n Mr. Seymour M. Klein, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. Chester T. Lane, of Washington, D. C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an indictment under Section 215 of the Criminal Code, 18 U.S. C.  338, 18 U.S.C.A.  338, for using the mails to further a fraudulent scheme. Petitioner's conviction was affirmed \n\n[322 \nU.S. 487, 488]\n\u00a0\n by the Circuit Court of Appeals, one judge dissenting. 136 F.2d 394. We brought the case here, \n320 \nU.S. 724\n, 64 S.Ct. 55, to consider the single question whether the admission of testimony previously given by petitioner in supplementary proceedings in a state court deprived him of the protection of the Fifth Amendment against being 'compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.'\n In accordance with New York procedure, known as supplementary proceedings, designed to aid in the discovery of assets of a debtor, N.Y. Civil Practice Act, art. 45, Feldman, a judgment debtor, was called as a witness in such proceedings on several occasions between March 31, 1936, and September 29, 1939. Up to March 14, 1938, the New York immunity statute merely provided that a debtor might not be excused from testifying because of self-crimination but that his testimony could not be used in evidence in a subsequent criminal proceeding against him. N.Y. Laws, 1935, c. 630,  789. By an Act of March 14, 1938, New York broadened the debtor's immunity so as to free him from prosecution on account of any matter revealed in his testimony. N.Y. Laws 1938, c. 108,  17, N.Y. Civil Practice Act,  789. While the earlier provision was in effect, Feldman testified that he was unemployed, paid rent of $250 a month from funds supplied by his family, owed about $340,000 and contemplated immediate bankruptcy. He further testified that about once a month his father sent him a book of signed checks, he sent large sums of money to his father by Western Union and destroyed whatever evidence the receipts might offer-in short, that he was 'kiting' his father's checks by sending the proceeds of the later checks to cover those cashed earlier. After March 14, 1938, and down through September, 1939, Feldman again testified in New York supplementary proceedings, giving further details of his bizarre 'kiting' practices. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 487, 489]\n\u00a0\n The federal charge was the use of the mails in a scheme to defraud executed by 'kiting' checks. In the trial, the Government introduced Feldman's testimony in the New York supplementary proceedings. He did not take the stand. The Government contends that it is unnecessary to decide whether the claim of privilege duly made bars the admission of this testimony. It suggests that testimony given prior to the Act of March 14, 1938, was not compellable and therefore Feldman waived any privilege, in that the New York statute prior to March 14, 1938, did not grant an immunity coextensive with the privilege available under New York law. People ex rel. Lewisohn v. O'Brien, 176 N.Y. 253, 68 N.E. 353. As to testimony under the later New York statute, the Government suggests that it either was not incriminating or was merely repetitive of the earlier voluntary testimony, making its admission in any event not prejudicial.\n We put to one side all these subtler issues because we think they cannot dispose of the case. And so we come directly to the main question, namely whether the Fifth Amendment prohibited the admission against Feldman upon his trial in a federal court of the earlier testimony given by him in the state courts. While the point has not been formally decided, we deem the answer to be controlled by a long series of decisions expressing basic principles of our federation.\n The effective enforcement of a well designed penal code is of course indispensable for social security. But the Bill of Rights was added to the original Constitution in the conviction that too high a price may be paid even for the unhampered enforcement of the criminal law and that, in its attainment, other social objects of a free society should not be sacrificed. We are immediately concerned with the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, intertwined as they are, and expressing as they do supplementing phases of the \n\n[322 \nU.S. 487, 490]\n\u00a0\n same constitutional purpose-to maintain inviolate large areas of personal privacy. See Boyd v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 616, 630\n, 6 S.Ct. 524, 532. 'The efforts of the courts and their officials to bring the guilty to punishment, praiseworthy as they are, are not to be aided by the sacrifice of those great principles (of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments) established by years of endeavor and suffering which have resulted in their embodiment in the fundamental law of the land.' Weeks v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 383, 393\n, 34 S.Ct. 341, 344, L.R.A.1915B, 834, Ann.Cas.1915C, 1177. 'We have already noticed the intimate relation between the two amendments. They throw great light on each other. For the 'unreasonable searches and seizures' condemned in the fourth amendment are almost always made for the purpose of compelling a man to give evidence against himself, which in criminal cases is condemned in the fifth amendment; and compelling a man 'in a criminal case to be a witness against himself,' which is condemned in the fifth amendment, throws light on the question as to what is an 'unreasonable search and seizure' within the meaning of the fourth amendment. And we have been unable to perceive that the seizure of a man's private books and papers to be used in evidence against him is substantially different from compelling him to be a witness against himself.' Boyd v. United States, supra, \n116 \nU.S. 633\n, 6 S.Ct. 534.\n But for more than one hundred years, ever since Barron v. Baltimore, 7 Pet. 243, one of the settled principles of our Constitution has been that these Amendments protect only against invasion of civil liberties by the Government whose conduct they alone limit. Brown v. Walker, \n161 \nU.S. 591, 606\n, 16 S.Ct. 644, 650; Jack v. Kansas, \n199 \nU.S. 372, 380\n, 26 S.Ct. 73, 75, 4 Ann.Cas. 689; Twining v. New Jersey, \n211 \nU.S. 78\n, 29 S.Ct. 14. Conversely, a State cannot by operating within its constitutional powers restrict the operations of the National Government within its sphere. The distinctive operations of the two governments within their respective spheres is basic to our federal constitutional system, howsoever complicated and \n\n[322 \nU.S. 487, 491]\n\u00a0\n difficult the practical accommodations to it may be. The matter was put in classic terms in what Chief Justice Taft called 'the great judgment', Ponzi v. Fessenden, \n258 \nU.S. 254, 261\n, 42 S.Ct. 309, 311, 22 A.L.R. 879, of Chief Justice Taney in Ableman v. Booth, 21 How. 506, 516: 'the powers of the General Government, and of the State, although both exist and are exercised within the same territorial limits, are yet separate and distinct sovereignties, acting separately and independently of each other, within their respective spheres. And the sphere of action appropriated to the United States is as far beyond the reach of the judicial process issued by a State judge or a State court, as if the line of division was traced by landmarks and monuments visible to the eye.'\n This principle has governed a series of decisions which for all practical purposes rule the present case. When this Court for the first time sustained an immunity statute as adequate, it rejected the argument that because federal immunity could not bar use in a state prosecution of testimony compelled in a federal court, the immunity falls short of the constitutional requirement. Brown v. Walker, supra, 161 U.S. at page 606, 16 S.Ct. at page 650. And when the reverse claim was made as to a state immunity statute, that a disclosure compelled in a state court could not assure immunity in a federal court, the argument was again rejected because 'The state (anti-trust) statute could not, of course, prevent a prosecution of the same party under the United States (anti- trust) statute, and it could not prevent the testimony given by the party in the state proceeding from being used against the same person in a Federal court for a violation of the Federal statute, if it could be imagined that such prosecution would be instituted under such circumstances.' Jack v. Kansas, supra 199 U.S. at page 380, 26 S.Ct. at page 75, 4 Ann.Cas. 689. When the matter was here last it was thus summarized: 'This court has held that immunity against state prosecution is not essential to the validity of federal statutes declaring that a witness shall not be excused from giving evidence on the \n\n[322 \nU.S. 487, 492]\n\u00a0\n ground that it will incriminate him, and also that the lack of state power to give witnesses protection against federal prosecution does not defeat a state immunity statute. The principle established is that full and complete immunity against prosecution by the government compelling the witness to answer is equivalent to the protection furnished by the rule against compulsory self-incrimination.' United States v. Murdock, \n284 \nU.S. 141, 149\n, 52 S.Ct. 63, 65, 82 A.L.R. 1376.\n And so while evidence secured through unreasonable search and seizure by federal officials is inadmissible in a federal prosecution, Weeks v. United States, supra; Gouled v. United States, \n255 \nU.S. 298\n, 41 S.Ct. 261; Agnello v. United States, \n269 \nU.S. 20\n, 46 S.Ct. 4, incriminating documents so secured by state officials without participation by federal officials but turned over for their use are admissible in a federal prosecution. Burdeau v. McDowell, \n256 \nU.S. 465\n, 41 S.Ct. 574, 13 A.L.R. 1159. Relevant testimony is not barred from use in a criminal trial in a federal court unless wrongfully acquired by federal officials. 'If knowledge of them (the facts) is gained from an independent source they may be proved like any others, but the knowledge gained by the Government's own wrong cannot be used by it ....' Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, \n251 \nU.S. 385, 392\n, 40 S.Ct. 182, 183. This Court has refused to draw nice distinctions as to when wrongful acquisition of evidence by state agencies was also a federal enterprise. When a representative of the United States is a participant in the extortion of evidence or in its illicit acquisition, he is charged with exercising the authority of the United States. Evidence so secured may be regained, Go-Bart Co. v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 344\n, 51 S.Ct. 153, and its admission, after timely motion for its suppression, vitiates a conviction. Byars v. United States, \n273 \nU.S. 28\n, 47 S.Ct. 248.\n The Constitution prohibits an invasion of privacy only in proceedings over which the Government has control. There is no suggestion of complicity between Feldman's creditors and federal law-enforcing officers. The Govern- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 487, 493]\n\u00a0\n ment here is not seeking to benefit by evidence which it extorted. It had no power either to compel testimony in the state court or to forestall such disclosure as a means of avoiding possible interference with the enforcement of the federal penal code. Whether testimony in a New York court should be compelled in exchange for immunity from prosecution under the penal laws of New York is for New York to say. For what purposes the United States may deem the disclosure of testimony more important than prosecution for federal crimes is for Congress to say. It has seen fit to make the exchange very sparingly. See United States v. Monia, \n317 \nU.S. 424\n, 63 S.Ct. 409. Certainly it is not for New York to determine when, because it suits its local policy to employ testimonial compulsion, it will relieve from federal prosecution 'for or on account of any transaction, matter or thing concerning which' a New York court may have seen fit to require testimony. Such would be the practical result of sustaining petitioner's claim. The immunity from prosecution, like the privilege against testifying which it supplants, pertains to a prosecution in the same jurisdiction. Otherwise the criminal law of the United States would be at the hazard of carelessness or connivance in some petty civil litigation in any state court, quite beyond the reach even of the most alert watchfulness by law officers of the Government. See Nardone v. United States, \n308 \nU.S. 338\n, 60 S.Ct. 266.\n Only a word need be said about the phrase of scepticism in Jack v. Kansas, supra 199 U.S. at page 380, 26 S.Ct. at page 75, 4 Ann.Cas. 689, that it could hardly be imagined 'that such prosecution would be instituted under such circumstances.' The 'prosecution' and the 'circumstances' there referred to were a prosecution on the same facts for violation of the state and the federal anti-trust laws. But see Fox v. State of Ohio, 5 How. 410, 435; United States v. Lanza, \n260 \nU.S. 377\n, 43 S.Ct. 141. The cautionary words in Jack v. Kansas in nowise qualified the principle of that and later cases as to the separateness in the operation of state and \n\n[322 \nU.S. 487, 494]\n\u00a0\n federal criminal laws and state and federal immunity provisions. There are, as we have already seen, ample safeguards. If a federal agency were to use a state court as an instrument for compelling disclosures for federal purposes, the doctrine of the Byars case, supra, as well as that of McNabb v. United States, \n318 \nU.S. 332\n, 63 S.Ct. 608, afford adequate resources against such an evasive disregard of the privilege against self-crimination. See United States v. Saline Bank, 1 Pet. 100; United States v. McRae, L.R. 3 Ch.App. 79. Nothing in this record brings either doctrine into play.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice MURPHY and Mr. Justice JACKSON took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK, dissenting.\n In Boyd v. United States, this Court said that 'any compulsory discovery by extorting the party's oath ... is contrary to the principles of a free government. It is abhorrent ... to the instincts of an American. It may suit the purposes of despotic power, but it cannot abide the pure atmosphere of political liberty and personal freedom.' \n116 \nU.S. 616, 631\n, 632 S., 6 S.Ct. 524, 532, 533.1 Unless the Court now is disavowing this belief, the use of testimony obtained by compulsory discovery to convict an accused must be con- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 487, 495]\n\u00a0\n sidered 'shocking to the universal sense of justice' and 'offensive to the common and fundamental ideas of fairness and right', and therefore, under past decisions of the Court, incompatible with Constitutional due process of law. Betts v. Brady, \n316 \nU.S. 455, 462\n, 473 S., 62 S.Ct. 1252, 1256, 1262. Or at least, even if the use of testimony extracted by compulsory discovery be held consistent with due process, adherence to the belief expressed by the Boyd case should require the Court to hold that, absent a conflicting Act of Congress, 'a decent regard for the duty of courts as agencies of justice and custodians of liberty forbids that men should be convicted upon evidence' so obtained. McNabb v. United States, \n318 \nU.S. 332, 347\n, 63 S.Ct. 608, 616. But I do not base my dissent upon judicially defined concepts of procedural due process or upon judge-made rules of evidence. The Bill of Rights, proposed in 1789 by the First Congress convened under our Constitution, and quickly ratified by the States in 1791, declares in part that, 'No person ... shall be compelled in any Criminal Case to be a witness against himself.' Amend. V, Constitution of the United States. Never since the Bill of Rights was adopted, until today, has this Court sustained a single conviction for a federal offense which rested on self-incriminatory testimony forced from the accused. I cannot agree to do so now.\n Feldman was compelled to testify under oath in a creditors' compulsory discovery proceeding in a New York court conducted pursuant to a state statute which granted him immunity from state prosecution for any state crime he might be forced to confess. Had he refused to testify he could have been imprisoned. Over his objection, a transcript of his compelled testimony was used in the United States District Court to convict him of a federal crime. As the Fifth Amendment heretofore has been interpreted, Feldman's testimony could not have been used for this purpose had it been compelled by a federal \n\n[322 \nU.S. 487, 496]\n\u00a0\n court rather than the state court. \n2\n This would have been true whether the federal court proceeding had been non-criminal or criminal,3 and whether Feldman had testified as a mere witness or as a defendant. \n4\n Nor could his forced testimony have been used had it been compelled by federal officers outside of a court room;5 by foreign detectives in a foreign country inquiring into commission of an offense against the United States committed on the high seas; 6 or by state officers interrogating a suspect for the purpose of enforcing a federal law. \n7\n There is, then, no sanction in the precedents of this Court for viewing the Fifth Amendment's prohibition against compelled testimony with grudging eyes and reducing its scopt to the narrowest plausible limits. As the decisions reflect, the previously declared attitude of the Court toward this prohibition has been that it 'must have a broad construction in favor of the right which it was intended to secure.' Counselman v. Hitchcock, \n142 \nU.S. 547, 562\n, 12 S.Ct. 195, 198; McCarthy v. Arndstein, \n266 \nU.S. 34\n, 45 S.Ct. 16.\n Today, however, the Court adopts a different approach to the task of construing the Fifth Amendment. We are now told that under certain circumstances compelled testimony is purged of the fatal taint which the Fifth Amendment places upon it, and that an accused can be convicted \n\n[322 \nU.S. 487, 497]\n\u00a0\n in a federal court on words he was forced to speak. The circumstances under which it is now held that men can be forced to convict themselves by their own testimony are, (1) that the testimony was compelled by state officers, and (2) that the state officers were not acting to enforce federal law. These slight variations in the techniques of compulsion are considered a sufficient excuse to escape the Fifth Amendment's command against the use of compelled testimony by federal courts. Surely such a holding is not to be justified by the language of that Amendment. Within its sweeping prohibition are found no exceptions based upon the persons who compel, their purpose in compelling, or their method of compelling, whether by threats of imprisonment, physical torture, or other means. Testimony is no less compelled because a state rather than a federal officer compels it, or because the state officer appears to be primarily interested at the moment in enforcing a state rather than a federal law.\n Nor is the holding in this case to be defended as one which our federal system requires. This case presents no conflict between federal and state spheres of power such as that presented by cases involving the validity of federal and state immunity statutes, wherein it has been contended, unsuccessfully, that neither the United States nor a State can compel a witness to testify against himself unless it grant him complete immunity from prosecution in both jurisdictions. \n8\n Feldman's objection to the use of \n\n[322 \nU.S. 487, 498]\n\u00a0\n his compelled testimony is not based on a claim that New York must grant him, or has granted him, immunity from prosecution for the federal crime it has forced him to confess. He does not question the power of the United States to prosecute him for that crime on proper evidence. Nor, for that matter, does he contend that the Fifth Amendment prevented New York from compelling him to confess a federal crime. 9 He claims only that the Fifth Amendment's prohibition against self-incrimination prevents the use of his compelled testimony against him in the present proceeding. The very narrow problem thus presented, and upon which this Court never before has passed, is whether federal courts can convict a defendant of a federal crime by use of self-incriminatory testimony which someone in some manner has extracted from him against his will. The Court's holding that a defendant can be so convicted cuts into the very substance of the Fifth Amendment. And it justifies this result not by the language or history of the Constitution itself, but by a process of syllogistic reasoning based upon broad premises of 'dual sovereignty' stated in previous opinions of the Court relating to immunity statutes. Even were there here a 'dual \n\n[322 \nU.S. 487, 499]\n\u00a0\n sovereignty' problem, which there is not, such a method of decision would be questionable. Constitutional interpretation should involve more than dialectics. The great principles of liberty written in the Bill of Rights cannot safely be treated as imprisoned in walls of formal logic built upon vague abstractions found in the United States Reports. 'The ultimate touchstone of constitutionality is the Constitution itself and not what we have said about it.' Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe, \n306 \nU.S. 466\n, concurring opinion, 487, 491, 59 S.Ct. 595, 601, 603, 604, 120 A.L.R. 1466. 10\n Putting aside the Court's dialectical method of interpretation and examining the history and purpose of the Fifth Amendment, there appears to be no justification for reducing its scope as the Court is now doing. Compulsion of self-incriminatory testimony by court oaths and by the less refined methods of torture were equally detested by the Fifth Amendment's liberty-loving advocates and their forbears. \n11\n Their abhorrence of these practices did not spring alone from a predilection for personal privacy. They had other reasons to despise and fear them. They still remembered the hated practices of the Court of Star Chamber, the Court of High Commission, and other inquisitorial agencies which had brought religious and political nonconformists within the penalties of the law by means of their own testimony. And history supports no argument that the framers of the Fifth Amendment were interested only in forbidding the extraction of an accused's testimony, as distinguished from the use of his extracted testimony. The extraction of testimony is, of course, but a means to the end of its use to punish. Few persons \n\n[322 \nU.S. 487, 500]\n\u00a0\n would seriously object to testifying unless their testimony would subject them to future punishment. The real evil aimed at by the Fifth Amendment's flat prohibition against the compulsion of self-incriminatory testimony was that thought to inhere in using a man's compelled testimony to punish him. By broadly outlawing the practice of compelling such testimony the Fifth Amendment struck at this evil at its source, seeking to eliminate the possibility that compelled testimony would ever be available for use to punish a defendant. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n Perhaps, as some have argued, the men who framed this Amendment were mistaken or their fears have lost foundation and the unqualified prohibition against the extraction and use of compelled testimony which they put into the Fifth Amendment should be repealed or modified. \n13\n This view of the desirability of constricting the Fifth Amendment I am not ready to accept, but were it otherwise I would not consider such a view should play any part in the process of interpretation. I am unwilling to see any constriction of the liberties and the procedural safeguards of these liberties specifically enumerated in the Bill of Rights unless it be by Constitutional amendment. \n14\n\u00a0\n\n The prohibition against compelled testimony which the Court today has seen fit to restrict cannot cannot be dissociated \n\n[322 \nU.S. 487, 501]\n\u00a0\n from the other specific protections afforded the individual by the Bill of Rights. The founders of our federal government were too close to oppressions and persecutions of the unorthodox, the unpopular, and the less influential, to trust even elected representatives with unlimited powers of control over the individual. From their distrust were derived the first ten amendments, designed as a whole to 'limit and qualify the powers of Government', to define 'cases in which the Government ought not to act, or to act only in a particular mode', and to protect unpopular minorities from oppressive majorities. 1 Annals 437. The first of the ten amendments erected a Constitutional shelter for the people's liberties of religion, speech, press, and assembly. This amendment reflects the faith that a good society is not static but advancing, and that the fullest possible interchange of ideas and beliefs is essential to attainment of this goal. The proponents of the First Amendment, committed to this faith, were determined that every American should possess an unrestrained freedom to express his views, however odious they might be to vested interests whose power they might challenge.\n But these men were not satisfied that the First Amendment would make this right sufficiently secure. As they well knew, history teaches that attempted exercises of the freedoms of religion, speech, press, and assembly have been the commonest occasions for oppression and persecution. Inevitably such persecutions have involved secret arrests, unlawful detentions, forced confessions, secret trials, and arbitrary punishments under oppressive laws. Therefore it is not surprising that the men behind the First Amendment also insisted upon the Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Amendments, designed to protect all individuals against arbitrary punishment by definite procedural provisions guaranteeing fair public trials by juries. They sought by these provisions to assure that no individual could be punished except according to 'due process', by \n\n[322 \nU.S. 487, 502]\n\u00a0\n which they certainly intended that no person could be punished except for a violation of definite and validly enacted laws of the land, and after a trial conducted in accordance with the specific procedural safeguards written in the Bill of Rights. \n15\n If occasionally these safeguards worked to the advantage of an ordinary criminal, that was a price they were willing to pay for the freedom they cherished. And one of the specific procedural safeguards which they inserted to shield the individual was the prohibition against compulsion of self-incriminatory testimony.\n It is impossible for me to reconcile today's restrictive interpretation of the prohibition against compelled self-incrimination with the principle of broad construction which this Court heretofore has deemed essential to full preservation of the basic safeguards of liberty specifically enumerated in the Bill of Rights. The protections explicitly afforded the individual by the Bill of Rights represent a large part of the characteristics which distinguish free from totalitarian government. Under our Constitutional system the privileges it embodies and the rights it secures were intended to be above and beyond the power of any branch of government to mutilate or destroy. We have no assurance that the fears of those who drafted and adopted our Bill of Rights were groundless, nor that the reasons for those fears no longer exist. Ancient evils historically associated with the possession of unqualified power to impose criminal punishment on individuals have a dangerous habit of reappearing when tried safeguards are removed.\n This case involves the Fifth, not the Fourth, Amendment. Decisions which have read the Fourth and Fifth Amendments together for the purpose of broadening the Fourth Amendment should not now be employed to narrow the Fifth Amendment. To do so ignores the particu- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 487, 503]\n\u00a0\n lar reasoning of these decisions as well as the separate language and history of the two Amendments. See Boyd v. United States, supra; Counselman v. Hitchcock, supra; Brown v. Walker, \n161 \nU.S. 591\n, 16 S.Ct. 644; VIII Wigmore on Evidence, Third Ed. pp. 276-304, 368. Nothing this Court has said with regard to the Fourth Amendment requires that we now open the door which the Fifth Amendment in 1791 closed to compelled self-incrimination.\n I would reverse the judgment.\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice RUTLEDGE join in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] And see Jack v.

Had the Court in the Murdock case, supra, accepted the contention that the federal government must grant an immunity from state as well as federal prosecution, it would inevitably have been faced with the problem of the federal power to interfere with enforcement of state laws through the device of granting immunity from state prosecution to witnesses in federal proceedings-a problem replete with both practical and legal difficulties.

WIENER(1944)\nNo. 252\nArgued: Decided: February 28, 1944\n\n\n\n As Amended on Denial of Rehearing Mar. 27, 1944\n\n\n Appeal from the Supreme Court of the State of Louisiana. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 253, 254]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Leonard L. Lockard, of Shreveport, La., for appellant.\n Mr. Sidney L. Herold, of Shreveport, La., for appellees.\n Mr. Samuel O. Clark, Jr., Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States, as amicus curiae.\n Mr. Max Radin, of Berkeley, Cal., for the State of California, et al., as amici curiae.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case comes here on appeal under  237(a) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  344(a), 28 U.S.C.A.  344(a), from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Louisiana, appellant assigning as error that that court had held invalid, as in violation of the Fifth Amendment,  402(b)(2) of the Revenue Act of 1942, 56 Stat. 942, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code,  811(e)(2). On considering the jurisdictional statement filed by appellant pursuant to Rule 12 of the Rules of this Court, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 354, we postponed decision of the jurisdictional questions to the argument on the merits.\n Section 237(a) of the Judicial Code authorizes an appeal to this Court from a judgment of the highest court of the state 'where is drawn in question' the validity of a statute of the United States and the decision is against its validity. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 253, 255]\n\u00a0\n The error assigned is therefore one cognizable on appeal. The question for our decision is whether, the state court having rested its decision and judgment upon two independent grounds, each adequate to support the decision but only of which appellant has assigned as error on appeal to this Court, we have jurisdiction to decide either.\n Appellees, children and sole legatees of Wiener, who had died a resident of Louisiana, leaving his widow surviving, brought the present proceeding in the District Court for the First Judicial District of Louisiana to establish the amount of the state inheritance tax on the interest acquired by them under the will of decedent. Under state law they cannot be placed in possession of the property inherited by them until they have paid the tax. Act No. 127 of the Extra Session of 1921, as amended by Act No. 44 of 1922; see  3 of Act No. 119 of 1932. So far as material here, the amount of their liability for the tax depends upon the meaning and application of Act No. 119 of the Louisiana Acts of 1932, Louisiana Code of Practice, Arts. 996.89-996.97, and of  402(b)(2) of the Revenue Act of 1942. Act No. 119 directs the levy, in addition to existing inheritance taxes, of 'an estate transfer tax upon all estates which are subject to taxation under the Federal Revenue Act of 1926'. The Act provides that whenever the aggregate amount of all inheritance, succession, legacy and estate taxes actually paid to the several states of the United States in respect to any property owned by the decedent shall be less than 80% of the estate tax payable to the United States under the provisions of the Revenue Act of 1926, the difference between that amount and 80% shall be paid to Louisiana. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[321 \nU.S. 253, 256]\n\u00a0\n Section 402(b)(2) of the Revenue Act of 1942 amends  811(e) of the Internal Revenue Code, which was derived from  302(e) of the Revenue Act of 1926, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 230, so as to include in the gross estate of decedent for purposes of the federal estate tax, property 'to the extent of the interest therein held as community property by the decedent and surviving spouse under the law of any State, Territory, or possession of the United States, or any foreign country, except such part thereof as may be shown to have been received as compensation for personal services actually rendered by the surviving spouse or derived originally from such compensation or from separate property of the surviving spouse.'\n Relying on these statutory provisions appellant, who is charged by state law with the duty of collecting the state inheritance tax, set up by his answer that the State of Louisiana is entitled to recover an inheritance tax equal to 80% of the basic federal estate tax, which by  402(b)(2) of the Revenue Act of 1942, is to be computed upon the entire community, and prayed judgment against appellees for an inheritance tax so computed.\n To this answer appellees interposed pleas that the inheritance tax demanded of them, insofar as it is measured by the interest of the widow in the community, is unconstitutional for want of the uniformity prescribed by  8 of Article I of the Constitution, and is a denial of due process, in contravention of the Fifth Amendment, in that it taxes property not belonging to decedent and not acquired by appellees under the will. The District Court sustained these pleas on the grounds assigned and gave judgment accordingly.\n It will be observed that although the federal estate tax, laid on all the property included in the taxable estate \n\n[321 \nU.S. 253, 257]\n\u00a0\n of the decedent, is payable by the estate,2 the effect of appellant's contention in both state courts was that Act No. 119 had, by virtue of  402(b)(2) of the Revenue Act of 1942, imposed an inheritance tax measured by the entire community property and had authorized collection of that entire tax from the decedent's legatees. The case thus presented not only the question whether a tax could constitutionally be imposed on the entire community property on the death of the husband, but also the further question, not necessarily governed by the federal Act, cf. Riggs v. Del Drago, \n317 \nU.S. 95\n, 63 S.Ct. 109, 142 A.L.R. 1131, whether the entire tax could be collected from those who inherit from the decedent, although they took no interest in the share of the community property retained by the surviving spouse.\n On appeal to the state Supreme Court the Attorney General of the United States was allowed to intervene; on the argument there he urged that the validity of  402(b)(2) of the Revenue Act of 1942 was not in question, but that the only issue before the court was the validity of Act No. 119 under the Fourteenth Amendment, if construed and applied in the manner contended for by appellant. Appellees accordingly were allowed to amend their plea of unconstitutionality so as to plead in the alternative that if Act No. 119 were construed so as to impose on them an inheritance tax measured by the entire community property it would violate the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The Supreme Court of Louisiana affirmed the judgment of the District Court but for different reasons. Succession of Wiener, 203 La. 649, 14 So. 2d 475, 478. It held that 'the construction sought to be placed on Act No. 119 of 1932 by the tax collector ... would render it violative of the due process guaran- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 253, 258]\n\u00a0\n teed by the 14th amendment to the Constitution of the United States, since such interpretation would result in the imposition of a tax upon those succeeding to the estate of a decedent measured in part by the property comprising the estate of another, to which the estate of the decedent is in no way related.' For this conclusion it relied upon Hoeper v. Tax Commission, \n284 \nU.S. 206\n, 52 S.Ct. 120, 78 A.L.R. 246, holding that a state graduated income tax measured by the joint income of husband and wife violated the Fourteenth Amendment. It said that the tax was there held invalid because 'any attempt by a state to measure the tax on one person's property or income by reference to the property or income of another is contrary to due process of law as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.'\n The Court thus made an alternative decision that either Act No. 119 did not impose on appellees a tax on property not bequeathed to them or that if it did it violated the Fourteenth Amendment. But it also went on to hold that 'the limitation placed upon the states by the Fourteenth Amendment is likewise placed on the Federal Government by the Fifth Amendment' and that  402(b) of the Revenue Act of 1942, which appellant, by interpretation of Act No. 119, had contended was the measure of the tax to be imposed on appellees, is likewise a violation of the Fifth Amendment if interpreted so as to tax the entire community property here.\n Appellant, in his assignments of error here, made no mention of the ruling of the state Supreme Court that Act No. 119, as construed and sought to be applied by him, violates the Fourteenth Amendment. He assigned as error the Supreme Court's decision that  402(b)(2) of the Revenue Act of 1942 violates the Fifth Amendment. He also asserted that it had erred 'in denying legal efficacy' to that provision of the Revenue Act which required the valuation of all the community property of decedent and his surviving spouse in the computation of the fed- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 253, 259]\n\u00a0\n eral estate tax. But in his 'Statement of the points on which he intends to rely', filed pursuant to paragraph 9 of Rule 13 of this Court, he stated, 'the only issue before the Court, and the point on which he intends to rely is that the Act of Congress held by the Supreme Court of Louisiana to be unconstitutional, to-wit Section 402(b)(2) of the Revenue Act of 1942, approved October 21, 1942, is constitutional and that the Supreme Court of Louisiana erred in holding said statute to be violative of the Fifth Amendment to the Federal Constitution.'\n Rule 9 of this Court's Rules requires the appellant in all cases to file assignments of error 'which shall set out separately and particularly each error asserted', and paragraph 9 of Rule 13, requiring the statement of points to be relied upon, provides that 'The court will consider nothing but the points of law so stated'. See also Rule 27, par. 6. It is a familiar rule, consistently followed, that upon appeal from a state court this Court will not pass upon or consider federal questions not assigned as error or designated in the points to be relied upon even though properly presented to and passed upon by the state court.

Gallagher, \n306 \nU.S. 167, 172\n, 59 S.Ct. 389, 391; Jones v. Opelika, \n316 \nU.S. 584, 592\n, 62 S.Ct. 1231, 1236, 141 A.L.R. 514. The rule is the same in the case of applications for certiorari. Rule 38, par. 2; General Talking Pictures Co. v. Western Electric Co., \n304 \nU.S. 175, 179\n, 546 S., 58 S.Ct. 849, 851; National Licorice Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, \n309 \nU.S. 350, 357\n, 60 S.Ct. 569, 574.\n There is a special reason why this practice should be followed here. Doubtless because of appellant's disclaimer, in his points to be relied upon, of a purpose to present any but the Fifth Amendment question, appellees have proceeded on argument and in briefs in this Court on the assumption that only the Fifth Amendment ques- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 253, 260]\n\u00a0\n tion was before us. Appellant's only mention of the impact of the tax on appellees is to say that 'they have been victimized by the state law not the federal law'. And he has made no effect to sustain the constitutionality of the imposition by the state of the entire burden of the tax on appellees. This is important because on the present record the two questions as to the constitutionality of the state and federal statutes are materially different in point of substance and in kind. The Fifth Amendment is relevant only because the federal tax on community property is made the measure of the tax which Louisiana, not the federal government, imposes upon appellees. If the federal tax on community property infringes the Fifth Amendment then obviously that property is not 'subject to taxation under the Federal Revenue Act' as the Louisiana Act requires, and there is wanting the taxable subject matter upon which the Louisiana statute purports to impose the tax, namely community property which is subject to a federal tax.\n It is not the federal but the state statute which imposes the tax on appellees, and the Fourteenth Amendment question in this case is not merely that the state statute, like the federal statute, imposes the tax on a subject matter which is not constitutionally taxable, but that the state statute does something which, as we have seen, the federal statute does not do, namely imposes on appellees an inheritance tax which includes in its measure some of the community property which they do not receive. As already pointed out, this was the question raised by appellees' supplemental plea of unconstitutionality, allowed and decided by the Supreme Court of Louisiana. By it they challenged, as a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, the imposition on them of an 'inheritance tax' 'based or measured upon the value of the entire community'. Even though it were decided that the federal statute validly imposes the tax on decedent's estate with \n\n[321 \nU.S. 253, 261]\n\u00a0\n its burden distributed among all those entitled to share in the estate as the state law may provide, see Riggs v. Del Drago, supra, the question would remain for decision whether the Fourteenth Amendment permits the particular distribution for which appellant contends, requiring appellees to bear all the tax although they share in only part of the estate on which it is laid.\n But this question is not before us because appellant, by his statement of points to be relied on, has affirmatively excluded it from consideration on this appeal and has limited himself to the different question arising under the Fifth Amendment. In any case we ought not to consider it here because in reliance upon this declaration neither party has briefed or argued it in this Court. Rule 27, paragraph 6 declares that errors not urged in the briefs will be disregarded. And, independently of 'technical' rules it is not the habit of this Court to decide important constitutional questions which the parties have not presented, briefed or argued.\n It is apparent that the decision of the single question arising under the Fifth Amendment, cannot, in the present state of the record, be dispositive of the case. The only tax here sought to be imposed is the state inheritance tax authorized by Act No. 119. The state court having held that that Act is either inapplicable or, if applicable, is an infringement of the Fourteenth Amendment, any ruling we could make as to the validity of  402(b)(2) could afford no basis for affirming, modifying or setting aside the decision of the state court that by reason of the invalidity or inapplicability of Act No. 119, the tax demanded cannot be imposed.\n Any determination which we might make of the Fifth Amendment question would thus leave unaffected the state court's judgment brought here for revire. Our opinion on that subject would be advisory only, since there is nothing before us on which we could render a decision \n\n[321 \nU.S. 253, 262]\n\u00a0\n that would have any controlling effect on the rights of the parties. Hence the case stands in the same posture as those in which we have repeatedly held that where the judgment of a state court rests in part on a non- federal ground adequate to support it, this Court will not consider the correctness of the decision which the state court also made of a federal question otherwise reviewable here. Berea College v. Kentucky, \n211 \nU.S. 45, 53\n, 29 S.Ct. 33, 34; Enterprise Irr. Dist. v. Farmers' Mut. Canal Co., \n243 \nU.S. 157, 163\n, 164 S., 37 S.Ct. 318, 320, 321; Lynch v. New York, \n293 \nU.S. 52, 54\n, 55 S., 55 S.Ct. 16, 17; Fox Film Corp. v. Muller, \n296 \nU.S. 207, 210\n, 211 S., 56 S.Ct. 183, 184. In such a case this Court has said that it will not enter 'a useless and profitless reversal' 'where the same judgment will be rendered by the court below, after they have corrected the error in the Federal question.' Murdock v. City of Memphis, 20 Wall. 590, 634, 635. Compare Pugh v. McCormick, 14 Wall. 361, 374. For like reasons we have refused to answer questions certified to us by a lower federal court where it appears that the answer cannot affect the result, United States v. Buzzo, 18 Wall. 125, 129; United States v. Britton, \n108 \nU.S. 199, 207\n, 2 S.Ct. 531, 536; Lederer v. McGarvey, \n271 \nU.S. 342, 344\n, 46 S.Ct. 534, 535. See also the rules stated in City of New Orleans v. Emsheimer, \n181 \nU.S. 153\n, 21 S.Ct. 584; New York Tel. Co. v. Maltbie, \n291 \nU.S. 645\n, 54 S.Ct. 443; Lindheimer v. Illinois Bell Tel. Co., \n292 \nU.S. 151, 176\n, 54 S.Ct. 658, 668; and in Hirabayashi v. United States, \n320 \nU.S. 81, 85\n, 63 S. Ct. 1375, 1378, and cases cited.\n The cause is accordingly dismissed for want of jurisdiction. In the view we take of the case we do not reach the question whether the appeal should not also be dismissed because of doubt whether the decision of the Louisiana Supreme Court as to Act No. 119 rests on a holding that the Act violates the Fourteenth Amendment, or merely that it is inapplicable as a matter of construction of a state statute not reviewable here. With that left in doubt, we could not say that the decision of the state Supreme Court does not rest on a non-federal ground adequate to support \n\n[321 \nU.S. 253, 263]\n\u00a0\n it. Compare Lynch v. New York, supra, \n293 \nU.S. 55\n, 55 S.Ct. 17; Honeyman v. Hanan, \n300 \nU.S. 14\n, 57 S.Ct. 350; Bakery & Pastry Drivers & Helpers Local v.

Columbus & Greenville Ry. Co. v. Miller, \n283 \nU.S. 96, 98\n, 51 S.Ct. 392, 393. But since he failed to raise or brief in this Court any question as to the validity of the Louisiana statute under the Fourteenth Amendment, we have no jurisdiction of the case either on certiorari on on appeal, and there is no occasion for the application of Judicial Code,  237(c), 28 U.S.C.  344(c), 28 U.S.C.A.  344(c). See Robertson and Kirkham, jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the United States, page 40, and cases cited.\n Dismissed.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER, with whom Mr. Justice ROBERTS and Mr. Justice JACKSON concur, dissenting.\n If this appeal were dismissed summarily I should remain silent. But opinions on the jurisdiction of this Court must serve as guides for the bar as well as for all other courts. Therefore the reasons for my inability to concur in the Court's views, involving as they do general considerations, call for somewhat detailed expression.\n\n 1. \nThe law of the jurisdiction of this Court raises problems of a highly technical nature. But underlying their solution are matters of substance in the practical working \n\n[321 \nU.S. 253, 264]\n\u00a0\n of our dual system and in the effective conduct of the business of this Court. While therefore the disposition of jurisdictional questions involves specialized knowledge, we are not dealing with problems the answers to which depend on the use of talismanic words or on the observance of rigid forms. On no one I venture to believe has the conviction stronger hold than on me that it is important to postpone constitutional adjudications and therefore constitutional conflicts until they are judicially unavoidable, or to keep them, when unavoidable, within the strict confines of a specific case. That is why we should be uncompromising in observing the limits of our authority and should avoid laxity in assuming jurisdiction. See 49 Harv.L.Rev. 68, 90-107. But the duties of this Court do not hang on the thread of mere verbalism.\n\n 2. \nWe do not review a case from a state court which can be supported on a non-federal ground because federal authority ought not to intrude upon the domain of the States. This far-reaching political consideration was decisive even after the Civil War in settling the rule that not only do we not review a case from a state court that can rest on a purely state ground, but we do not even review state questions in a case that is properly here from a state court on a federal ground. Murdock v. City of Memphis, 20 Wall. 590.\n\n 3. \nThe requirement of assignment of errors in order to invoke our reviewing power rests on a wholly different consideration. 'The purpose is to enable the court, as well as opposing counsel, readily to perceive what points are relied on.' Seaboard Air Line R. v. Watson, \n287 \nU.S. 86, 91\n, 53 S.Ct. 32, 34, 86 A.L.R. 174. Of course, when the error complained of is a rejection of a claim of the invalidity of a state statute under the United States Constitution, the claim must have been effectively pressed before the state court and rejected by it. But the requirement is not for some abra- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 253, 265]\n\u00a0\n cadabra. The nub of the matter is found in People of State of New York ex rel. Bryant v. Zimmerman, \n278 \nU.S. 63, 67\n, 49 S.Ct. 61, 63, 62 A.L.R. 785:\n'There are various ways in which the validity of a state statute may be drawn in question on the ground that it is repugnant to the Constitution of the United States. No particular form of words or phrases is essential, but only that the claim of invalidity and the ground therefor be brought to the attention of the state court with fair precision and in due time. And if the record as a whole shows either expressly or by clear intendment that this was done, the claim is to be regarded as having been adequately presented.'\n\n\n 4. \nThese general considerations bring us to the particular case. Its reviewability here is questioned on numerous grounds. Any one of them would be conclusive. Apparently, however, a cloud of unreviewability is compounded by intermingling doubts on several scores. If the judgment of the Supreme Court of Louisiana can rest on a non-federal ground there is an end of the matter. If that court went off on the constitutionality of a federal statute when that statute was not drawn into question again there is an end to the matter. If the judgment in fact rested on the validity of a state statute urged to be repugnant to the United States Constitution, the case could come here but only if the claim of invalidity was properly presented and duly rejected by the state court. And even then such error could be urged here only if brought before this Court by revealing assignment of errors. If that requirement were not met, again the appeal would call for dismissal.\n\n 5. \nThis controversy 'concerns the constitutional validity of an act of Congress'-s 402(b)(2) of the Revenue Act of 1942, 56 Stat. 798, 942- 'which is directly drawn in question. The decision depends upon the determination of this issue.' Smith v. Kansas City Title & Trust Co., 255 \n\n[321 \nU.S. 253, 266]\n\u00a0\n U.S. 180, 201, 41 S.Ct. 243, 245, 246. This is so, that is, unless we wish to overrule the Kansas City Title case as well as the recent unanimous decision in Standard Oil Co. v. Johnson, \n316 \nU.S. 481\n, 62 S.Ct. 1168, and adopt the dissenting views of Mr. Justice Holmes in the Kansas City Title case, supra, 255 U.S. at page 213, 41 S.Ct. at page 250. In any event, however, the decision of the Louisiana Supreme Court cannot be supported on a non-federal ground and does involve the validity of a state statute under the United States Constitution. Finally the assignment of errors, the order allowing appeal and the statement of points on which appellant relied satisfy the reasons for our Rules 9 and 13(9). All three considerations are intertwined in the distinctive circumstances of this case and they establish our jurisdiction, once the cause of this litigation is kept in mind and our jurisdictional requirements are not turned into formalism 'run riot'.\n\n 6. \nWhat then was in issue in this litigation and what issue was determined in the judgment that was brought here? The tax collector claimed that 'the heirs of Sam Wiener, Jr., owe an inheritance tax on the entire community estate rather than upon the one-half interest in the community inherited by them' for the reason that 'by virtue of Act No. 119 of the Legislature of Louisiana for the year 1932, the State of Louisiana is ultimately entitled to recover an inheritance tax against this estate which is equal to eighty per cent of the basic Federal tax as fixed by the Federal Revenue Act of 1926', and that 'Congress, in the Revenue Act of 1942, (Title IV, Sec. 402(a), 56 Statutes 941, Title 26, Sec. 811, U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code) provides that the basic Federal Estate Tax is computed upon the entire community and accordingly, the State of Louisiana is entitled to an amount equal to eighty per cent of the basic Federal Estate Tax so calculated.' (R. 8) The claim of the State for an inheritance tax in a sum equal to 80% of the tax due to the Federal Government as \n\n[321 \nU.S. 253, 267]\n\u00a0\n computed in part under  402(b)(2) was thus based on the interdependence between the Louisiana Act No. 119 and  402(b)(2) of the Revenue Act of 1942. The latter was incorporated by reference into the former. The two became inseparable for purposes of construction-in a case like the present a decision involving Act No. 119 inescapably depended upon the determination of the validity of  402(b)(2).1 Such was the issue tendered by the State, and issue was joined by the appellees' plea of unconstitutionality: 'notwithstanding anything to the contrary that may be contained in the Federal Revenue Act of 1942, approved on October 21, 1942, there may not be included in the estate of the decedent, subject to the Federal Estate Tax (and consequently subject to the provisions of the State Inheritance Tax under Act 119 of 1932) any property except that which was owned by the decedent at the instant of his death, and by his death transmitted to his heirs.' (R. 9) \n\n[321 \nU.S. 253, 268]\n\u00a0\n In this plea the constitutional invalidity of the federal act was challenged as follows: 'Such statutory provision is in contravention of and violative of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, in that its application would deprive these appearers of their property without due process of law by its imposition of taxes upon them, based both upon an arbitrary inclusion in the estate of the decedent of property which did not belong to him and upon the application thereto of graduated rates based upon values arrived at by reference to such other property.' (R. 10)\n\n 7. \nPutting to one side the claim of unconstitutionality of  402(b)(2) for want of uniformity, this is the issue which persists throughout the litigation-the issue arising from the claim of constitutional invalidity under the Fifth Amendment of the method of computing the federal estate tax according to the Amendment of 1942 inasmuch as the state inheritance tax is concededly ascertained through the ascertainment of the federal estate tax. This was the issue raised by the pleadings in the First Judicial District Court of Louisiana; this was the issue tendered by the agreed statement of facts before that court (R. 11, particularly par. 4); this was the issue which that court decided against the State because it found a statute of Congress 'violative of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States in that its application here would deprive the heirs of the decedent of their property without due process of law' (R. 13); this was the issue formulated by both parties in their appeal to the Supreme Court of Louisiana (R. 14, 16); on the basis of this issue that court invited the Attorney General of the United States to appear as amicus curiae. After the Attorney General, so appearing, suggested for the first time that 'the tax liability here in issue is only that imposed by the state statute', appellees \n\n[321 \nU.S. 253, 269]\n\u00a0\n 'Without in any manner conceding the correctness of that position, but on the contrary expressly reaffirming that this cause involves and depends upon the constitutionality of the Federal Statute,' amended their plea of unconstitutionality, with the State's consent, by adding also an attack upon the validity of the state statutes 'either alone or in conjunction with the Federal Statute' (R. 18).\n By this process the case reached the Supreme Court of Louisiana. No one can read that court's opinion and be left in any doubt that Louisiana Act No. 119 of 1932 and  402(b)(2) of the Revenue Act of 1942 were treated inseparably and the validity of the former made to depend on the fate of the latter. Two passages give the pith of the opinion:\n'Now, because of the Congressional adoption of Section 402(b)(2) of the Revenue Act, amending Section 811(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code,  811(e), the tax collector of Caddo parish is contending inheritance and estate taxes in this state, under Act No. 119 of 1932, must be computed on the basis established in that section . ...\n\n'We are asked to place an interpretation on Act No. 119 of 1932 and Section 402(b)(2) of the Revenue Act of 1942 that would result in the inclusion in the estate of the managing partner of an interest in the community partnership to which he never had any claim and which was, in fact, during his lifetime and is now, owned by his wife.' 203 La. 649, 656, 669, 670, 14 So.2d 475, 477.\n\n On this showing the lower court concluded that  402(b)(2) offends the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and therefore the reliance of the State upon  402(b)(2) as read into Act No. 119 made the latter Act offensive to the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 253, 270]\n\u00a0\n 8. The invalidity, because wanting in due process, of  402(b)(2) infused into Act No. 119, is the issue that runs like a silver thread unbroken and unalloyed through this litigation as it took its course from the First Judicial District Court of Louisiana to the State Supreme Court and from there to this Court. This makes it abundantly clear why the errors were assigned as they were-claims of error in holding that  402(b)( 2) is unconstitutional and in denying 'legal efficacy to the provisions of Section 402(b)(2) of the Federal Revenue Act of 1942 as requiring the valuation of all of the community property standing in the name of the decedent, Sam Wiener, Jr. in the computation of the Federal basic estate tax; and, consequently, in the computation of the inheritance tax due to the State of Louisiana which, under the statute of the state, is required to be eighty percent of the amount of the Federal basic estate tax.' (R. 32, Assignment of Errors, 2.) Because such was the issue and because the judgment of the Supreme Court of Louisiana determined that issue, the order allowing appeal recites that 'there was drawn in question the validity of  402(b)(2) of the Federal Revenue Act of 1942', (R. 33). Such having been the issue and such its determination, appellant naturally set it forth in his statement of the points on which he intended to rely. (R. 35.)\n\n 9. \nIf a federal claim was drawn in question in Smith v. Kansas City Title & Trust Co., supra, and Standard Oil Co. v. Johnson, supra, it was not less drawn in question in this case. If the earlier two decisions are to continue to stand, I am unable to make a differentiation between them and the record before us. \n2\n Much is to be said for the reasoning \n\n[321 \nU.S. 253, 271]\n\u00a0\n of Mr. Justice Holmes in the Kansas City Title case in urging that the incorporation of a federal act into a state law nevertheless makes the suit, for purposes of our jurisdiction, one arising under the state and not under the federal law. But his view was rejected. In the recent Standard Oil case we had an opportunity to adopt his view and reject that of the Court in the Kansas City Title case. Instead, we unanimously applied the reasoning of \n\n[321 \nU.S. 253, 272]\n\u00a0\n the Kansas City Title case that where a decision under state law necessarily involves the construction or validity of federal law the determination of such federal law in the application of state law gives rise to a federal question for review here.\n 10. In any event the decision below did not go off on a non-federal ground. It cannot be said of this case as was true of a case like For Film Corp. v. Muller, \n296 \nU.S. 207, 211\n, 56 S.Ct. 183, 184, that the case 'in effect, was disposed of before the federal question said to be involved was reached. Chouteau v. Gibson, \n111 \nU.S. 200\n, 4 S.Ct. 340; Chapman v. Goodnow's Adm'r, \n123 \nU.S. 540, 548\n, 8 S.Ct. 211 (215 ). A decision of that question then became unnecessary; and whether it was decided or not, our want of jurisdiction is clear.' We have seen that the issue that was framed after the tax collector's return to the rule was exclusively a question of constitutionality under the United States Constitution, and the judgment of the two State Courts was a determination of that issue. There never was any suggestion that the controversy involved merely a construction of the state law except a construction that necessarily raised a federal constitutional question. It was deemed to be a question under the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution until the Attorney General of the United States suggested that the Fourteenth Amendment was at stake. But even on that assumption, the case was decided on a federal and not on a non-federal ground, namely, the invalidity of the State's claim because of want of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. Since, however, the claim of invalidity was sustained we can take the case only on certiorari.  237(b) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.A.  344(b).\n 11. The question then is whether the federal ground was adequately assigned to satisfy our Rules 9 and 13(9).3 \n\n[321 \nU.S. 253, 273]\n\u00a0\n This brings us again to the rationale of these rules. 'The purpose is to enable the court, as well as opposing counsel, readily to perceive what points are relied on.' Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v. Watson, \n287 \nU.S. 86, 91\n, 53 S.Ct. 32, 34, 86 A.L.R. 174. Is there any doubt that everybody knew what was the issue on which the Supreme Court of Louisiana passed and what was the issue on which the State of Louisiana and the Government desire us to reverse that decision? Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v. Watson, supra, illustrates the true functions of assignment of errors and affords an example of the kind of situations in which the rule comes into operation. It is not fair to the administration of justice-to the work of this Court and counsel taking part in its business-that appeal papers here should not enable us to know clearly and quickly what it is that is complained of and that we are asked to undo: 'The substitution of vague and general statement for the prescribed particularity sets the rule at naught. ... And, as the rule makes for convenience and certainty in the consideration of cases, the court may, and generally it will, disregard a specification that is so uncertain or otherwise deficient as not substantially to comply with the rule, even if the opposing party raises no question and treats it as adequate. The quoted assignment amounts merely to a complaint that the Supreme Court erred in not re- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 253, 274]\n\u00a0\n versing the judgment of the trial court because 'in the trial of this case' the 'scope and effect' of the section deprived appellant of its property in violation of both the due process and equal protection clauses. An allegation of error could scarcely be more indefinite. It does not identify any ruling at the trial or specify any basis for the assertion of deprivation of constitutional right. It presents no question for our consideration.' Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v. Watson, supra, 287 U.S. at page 91, 53 S.Ct. at page 34, 86 A.L.R. 174. In this case unlike the Watson case there was not a 'vague and general statement', an 'indefinite' allegation of error. From beginning to end all concerned knew the precise issue that this litigation raises-whether  402(b)(2) meets the guaranty of due process, in view of the dependence of the state act upon that federal provision. Surely we would have to take this case if Louisiana had specifically assigned as error the view that the Supreme Court of Louisiana took of the Fourteenth Amendment in relation to taxing community property. But since, as the Louisiana Supreme Court said, the issue under the Fourteenth Amendment is precisely the same in this situation as that under the Fifth Amendment, to throw out the case because 'Fourteenth Amendment' was not written is to make our jurisdiction the slave of words.\n 12. If the decision below can really be said to rest on a non-federal ground, no assignment of errors could cure the defect. But it does not rest on a non-federal ground. It rests on a federal ground-the federal ground that is written on almost every page of the record.\n 13. Nor should we avoid jurisdiction by creating an issue which 'the parties have not presented, briefed or argued' for the very good reason that it is not in the case. In brief, it is suggested that even assuming the tax on the whole community is valid, the question remains whether the appellees as legatees of half the community can be made to bear the whole tax. That issue is excluded from \n\n[321 \nU.S. 253, 275]\n\u00a0\n the case. The amended plea of unconstitutionality did not raise a new issue but merely gave a new label-the Fourteenth Amendment-to the issue they tendered under the Fifth Amendment, dependence on which they reaffirmed. For the appellees, in the petition to prove the will, have assumed the full liability for whatever taxes are constitutionally due from the estate. We ought not to create a constitutional grievance which the parties themselves have never entertained in order to avoid adjudication of the only question which has been in the case from the beginning. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The purpose of the Act, declared by  4, was to secure for the state the benefit of the credit allowed by  301(b) of the Revenue Act of 1926, 26 U.S.C.  813(b), 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 226, which allowed the taxpayer a credit against the estate tax imposed by that Act for estate, inheritance or legacy taxes actually paid to a state or territory or the District of Columbia, and provided that the total credit for such taxes should not exceed 80% of the federal estate tax payable. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The tax is made a lien on the gross estate, which includes the entire community property here, Internal Revenue Code  827(a), 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code,  827(a), and is a personal liability of the wife to the extent of the interest acquired by her, Revenue Act of 1942,  411, 26 U.S. C.A. Int.Rev.Code,  827(b), 900(e). \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 2 of Act No. 119 of the Louisiana Acts of 1932 provides that 'Whenever the aggregate amount of all inheritance, succession, legacy and estate taxes actually paid to the several states of the United States in respect to any property owned by such decedent shall be less than eighty per cent (80%) of the estate tax payable to the United States under the provisions of the said Federal Revenue Act of 1926, but not otherwise, the difference between said amount and said eighty per cent (80%) shall be paid to the State of Louisiana.'\n Section 302 of the Revenue Act of 1926, as amended by  402(b)(2) of the Revenue Act of 1942, includes in the gross estate property, 'To the extent of the interest therein held as community property by the decedent and surviving spouse under the law of any State, Territory, or possession of the United States, or any foreign country, except such part thereof as may be shown to have been received as compensation for personal services actually rendered by the surviving spouse or derived originally from such compensation or from separate property of the surviving spouse. In no case shall such interest included in the gross estate of the decedent be less than the value of such part of the community property as was subject to the decedent's power of testamentary disposition.' 44 Stat. (part 2) 9, 70; 56 Stat. 798, 942, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code,  811(e)(2). \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The Kansas City Title case was a suit by a Missouri shareholder of a Missouri trust company to enjoin the directors from buying bonds of Federal Land Banks and Joint Stock Land Banks on the theory that the statutes authorizing the banks and bonds being unconstitutional, the bonds were not lawful securities for investment purposes. The Court held that this was a statement of a cause of action arising under the laws of the United States. The meaning of the Court's holding is clearly indicated by the view which was rejected. 'The defendant is a Missouri corporation and the right claimed is that of a stockholder to prevent the directors from doing an act, that is, making an investment, alleged to be contrary to their duty. But the scope of their duty depends upon the charter of their corporation and other laws of Missouri. If those laws had authorized the investment in terms the plaintiff would have had no case, and this seems to me to make manifest what I am unable to deem even debatable, that, as I have said, the cause of action arises wholly under Missouri law. If the Missouri law authorizes or forbids the investment according to the determination of this Court upon a point under the Constitution or Acts of Congress, still that point is material only because the Missouri law saw fit to make it so.' 255 U.S. at page 214, 41 S.Ct. at page 250. \n In the Standard Oil case, a ruling by a state court that United States Army Post Exchanges were not federal agencies in deciding the applicability of a state sales tax which did not apply to sales to Government agencies, was held to be a decision of a federal question reviewable here. 'For post exchanges operate under regulations of the Secretary of War pursuant to federal authority. These regulations and the practices under them establish the relationship between the post exchange and the United States Government, and together with the relevant statutory and constitutional provisions from which they derive, afford the data upon which the legal status of the post exchange may be determined. It was upon a determination of a federal question, therefore, that the Supreme Court of California rested its conclusion that, by Section 10, sales to post exchanges were not exempted from the tax.' 316 U.S. at page 483, 62 S.Ct. at page 1169. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Rule 9: 'Where an appeal is taken to this court from any court, the appellant shall file with the clerk of the court below, with his petition for appeal, an assignment of errors, which shall set out separately and particularly each error asserted. No appeal shall be allowed unless such an assignment of errors shall accompany the petition.'\n Rule 13(9): 'When the record is filed, or within fifteen days thereafter, the appellant shall file with the clerk a definite statement of the points on which he intends to rely and a designation of the parts of the record which he thinks necessary for the consideration thereof or a designation of those parts considered unnecessary, whichever is more convenient, with proof of service of the same on the adverse party. ... The statement of points intended to be relied upon and the designations of the parts of the record to be printed shall be printed by the clerk with the record. ... The court will consider nothing but the points of law so stated. ...' \n\n\n\n\n","46":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFOLLETT v. TOWN OF MCCORMICK, S.C.(1944)\nNo. 486\nArgued: February 11, 1944Decided: March 27, 1944\n\n\n\n Appeal from the Supreme Court of the State of South Carolina.\n Mr. Hayden, C. Covington, of Brooklyn, N.Y., for appellant.\n Messrs. J. Fred Buzhardt, of McCormick, S.C., and Jeff D. Griffith, of Saluda, S.C., for appellee. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 573, 574]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellant was convicted of violating an ordinance of the town of McCormick, South Carolina which provided: '... the following license on business, occupation and professions to be paid by the person or persons carrying on or engaged in such business, occupation or professions within the corporate limits of the Town of McCormick, South Carolina: Agents selling books, per day $1.00, per year $15.00.' Appellant is a Jehovah's Witness and has been certified by the Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society as 'an ordained minister of Jehovah God to preach the gospel of God's kingdom under Christ Jesus.' He is a resident of McCormick, South Carolina, where he went from house to house distributing certain books. He obtained his living from the money received; he had no other source of income. He claimed that he merely offered the books for a 'contribution'. But there was evidence that he 'offered to and did sell the books'. Admittedly he had no license from the town and refused to obtain one. He moved for a directed verdict of not guilty at the close of the evidence, claiming that the ordinance restricted freedom of worship in violation of the First Amendment which the Fourteenth Amendment makes applicable to the States. The motion was overruled and appellant was found guilty by the jury in the Mayor's Court. That judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of General Sessions for McCormick County and then by the Supreme Court of South Carolina. 29 S.E.2d 539. The case is here on appeal. Judicial Code,  237( a), 28 U.S.C.  344(a), 28 U.S.C.A.  344(a).\n The ordinance in this case is in all material respects the same as the ones involved in Jones v. Opelika, 319 \n\n[321 \nU.S. 573, 575]\n\u00a0\n U.S. 103, 63 S.Ct. 890, and Murdock v. Pennsylvania, \n319 \nU.S. 105\n, 63 S.Ct. 870, 891, 146 A.L.R. 81. In those cases, the tax imposed was also a license tax-'a flat tax imposed on the exercise of a privilege granted by the Bill of Rights' and therefore an unconstitutional exaction. Murdock v. Pennsylvania, supra, 319 U.S. page 113, 63 S.Ct page 875, 146 A.L.R. 81. In those cases members of Jehovah's Witnesses had also been found guilty of 'peddling' or 'selling' literature within the meaning of the local ordinances. But since they were engaged in a 'religious' rather than a 'commercial' venture, we held that the constitutionality of the ordinances might not be measured by the standards governing the sales of wares and merchandise by hucksters and other merchants. 'Freedom of press, freedom of speech, freedom of religion are in a preferred position.' Murdock v. Pennsylvania, supra, 319 U.S. page 115, 63 S.Ct. page 876, 146 A.L.R. 81. We emphasized that the 'inherent vice and evil' of the flat license tax is that 'it restrains in advance those constitutional liberties' and 'inevitably tends to suppress their exercise.' 319 U.S. page 114, 63 S.Ct. page 875, 146 A.L.R. 81.\n The Supreme Court of South Carolina recognized those principles but distinguished the present case from the Murdock and Opelika decisions. It pointed out that the appellant was not an itinerant but was a resident of the town where the canvassing took place, and that the principle of the Murdock decision was applicable only to itinerant preachers. It stated, moreover, that appellant earned his living 'by the sale of books', that his 'occupation was that of selling books and not that of colporteur', that 'the sales proven were more commercial than religious.' It concluded that the 'license was required for the selling of books, not for the spreading of religion.' \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[321 \nU.S. 573, 576]\n\u00a0\n We pointed out in the Murdock case that the distinction between 'religious' activity and 'purely commercial' activity would at times be 'vital' in determining the constitutionality of flat license taxes such as these. 319 U.S. page 110, 63 S.Ct. page 873, 146 A.L.R. 81. But we need not determine here by what tests the existence of a 'religion' or the 'free exercise' thereof in the constitutional sense may be ascertained or measured. For the Supreme Court of South Carolina conceded that 'the book in question2 is a religious book'; and it concluded 'without difficulty' that 'its publication and distribution come within the words, 'exercise of religion', as they are used in the Constitution.' We must accordingly accepts as bona fide appellant's assertion that he was 'preaching the gospel' by going 'from house to house presenting the gospel of the kingdom in printed form.' Thus we have quite a different case from that of a merchant who sells books at a stand or on the road.\n The question is therefore a narrow one. It is whether a flat license tax as applied to one who earns his livelihood as an evangelist or preacher in his home town is constitutional. It was not clear from the records in the Opelika and Murdock cases to what extent, if any, the Jehovah's Witnesses there involved were dependent on 'sales' or 'contributions' for a livelihood. But we did state that an 'itinerant evangelist' did not become 'a mere book agent by selling the Bible or religious tracts to help defray his expenses or to sustain him.' 319 U.S. page 111, 63 S.Ct. page 874, 146 A.L.R. 81. Freedom of religion is not merely reserved for those with a long purse. Preachers of the more orthodox faiths are not engaged in commercial undertakings because they are dependent on their calling for a living. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 573, 577]\n\u00a0\n Whether needy or affluent, they avail themselves of the constitutional privilege of a 'free exercise' of their religion when they enter the pulpit to proclaim their faith. The priest or preacher is as fully protected in his function as the parishioners are in their worship. A flat license tax on that constitutional privilege would be as odious as the early 'taxes on knowledge' which the framers of the First Amendment sought to outlaw. Grosjean v. American Press Co., \n297 \nU.S. 233\n, 245-248, 56 S.Ct. 444, 447, 448. A preacher has no less a claim to that privilege when he is not an itinerant. We referred to the itinerant nature of the activity in the Murdock case merely in emphasis of the prohibitive character of the license tax as so applied. Its unconstitutionality was not dependent on that circumstance. The exaction of a tax as a condition to the exercise of the great liberties guaranteed by the First Amendments is as obnoxious (Grosjean v. American Press Co., supra; Murdock v. Pennsylvania, supra) as the imposition of a censorship or a previous restraint. Near v. Minnesota, 28o U.S. 697, 51 S.Ct. 625. For, to repeat, 'the power to tax the exercise of a privilege is the power to control or suppress its enjoyment.' Murdock v. Pennsylvania, supra, 319 U.S. page 112, 63 S.Ct. page 874, 146 A.L.R. 81.\n But if this license tax would be invalid as applied to one who preaches the Gospel from the pulpit, the judgment below must be reversed. For we fail to see how such a tax loses its constitutional infirmity when exacted from those who confine themselves to their own village or town and spread their religious beliefs from door to door or on the street. The protection of the First Amendment is not restricted to orthodox religious practices any more than it is to the expression of orthodox economic views. He who makes a profession of evangelism is not in a less preferred position than the casual worker.\n This does not mean that religious undertakings must be subsidized. The exemption from a license tax of a preacher who preaches or a parishioner who listens does \n\n[321 \nU.S. 573, 578]\n\u00a0\n not mean that either is free from all financial burdens of government, including taxes on income or property. We said as much in the Murdock case, 319 U.S. page 112, 63 S.Ct. page 874, 146 A.L.R. 81. But to say that they like other citizens may be subject to general taxation does not mean that they can be required to pay a tax for the exercise of that which the First Amendment has made a high constitutional privilege.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice REED, concurring.\n My views on the constitutionality of ordinances of this type are set out at length in Jones v. Opelika, \n316 \nU.S. 584\n, 62 S.Ct. 1231, 141 A.L.R. 514, and in a dissent on the rehearing of the same case, \n319 \nU.S. 117\n, 63 S.Ct. 891. These views remain unchanged but they are not in accord with those announced by the Court.\n My understanding of this Court's opinions in Murdock v. Pennsylvania, \n319 \nU.S. 105\n, 63 S.Ct. 870, 891, 146 A.L.R. 81, and Jones v. Opelika, \n319 \nU.S. 103\n, 63 S.Ct. 890, is that distribution of religious literature in return for money when done as a method of spreading the distributor's religious beliefs is an exercise of religion within the First Amendment and therefore immune from interference by the requirement of a license. These opinions are now the law of the land.\n As I see no difference in respect to the exercise of religion between an itinerant distributor and one who remains in one general neighborhood or between one who is active part time and another who is active all of his time, there is no occasion for me to state again views already rejected by a majority of the Court. Consequently, I concur in the conclusion reached in the present case.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY, concurring.\n While I am in complete accord with the opinion of the Court, I desire to add a brief word in light of certain statements made in the dissenting opinion. It is claimed \n\n[321 \nU.S. 573, 579]\n\u00a0\n that the effect of our decision is to subsidize religion. But this is merely a harsh way of saying that to prohibit the taxation of religious activities is to give substance to the constitutional right of religious freedom.\n It is suggested that we have opened the door to exemption of wealthy religious institutions, like Trinity Church in New York City, from the payment of taxes on property investments from which support is derived for religious activities. It is also charged that the decision contains startling implications with respect to freedom of speech and the press. I am neither disturbed nor impressed by these allegations. We are not called upon in this case to deal with the taxability of income arising out of extensive holdings of commercial property and business activities related thereto. There is an obvious difference between taxing commercial property and investments undertaken for profit, whatever use is made of the income, and laying a tax directly on an activity that is essentially religious in purpose and character or on an exercise of the privilege of free speech and free publication.\n It is wise to remember that the taxing and licensing power is a dangerous and potent weapon which, in the hands of unscrupulous or bigoted men, could be used to suppress freedoms and destroy religion unless it is kept within appropriate bounds.\n\n Separate opinion of Mr. Justice ROBERTS, Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER and Mr. Justice JACKSON.\n The present decision extends the rule announced in Jones v. Opelika, \n319 \nU.S. 103\n, 63 S.Ct. 890, and Murdock v. Pennsylvania, \n319 \nU.S. 105\n, 63 S.Ct. 870, 891, 146 A.L.R. 81.\n The ordinance in question is not, in the words of the First Amendment, a law 'prohibiting the free exercise' of religion. At the outset it should be observed that the ordinance is not discriminatory. It lays a tax on the pursuit of occupations by which persons earn their living in \n\n[321 \nU.S. 573, 580]\n\u00a0\n the Town of McCormick. It does not single out persons pursuing any given occupation and exempt others. If it were attacked as a denial of the equal protection of the laws the contention would be frivolous. \n1\n There is no suggestion that the purpose is other than to raise revenue necessary for the support of government from all who enjoy the service and protection of government, and to adjust the tax laid on the appellant in the light of the aid he derives from such service and protection.\n Secondly, the ordinance lays no onerous burden on the occupation of the appellant or any other citizen. The tax in question is wholly unlike that considered in Grosjean v. American Press Co., \n297 \nU.S. 233\n, 56 S.Ct. 444, which had the unmistakable purpose of hitting at one out of many occupations and hitting so hard as to discourage or suppress the pursuit of that calling. The court there said: (p. 250 of 297 U.S., page 449 of 56 S.Ct.)\n'It is not intended by anything we have said to suggest that the owners of newspapers are immune from any of the ordinary forms of taxation for support of the government. But this is not an ordinary form of tax, but one single in kind, with a long history of hostile misuse against the freedom of the press.'\n\n What then is the law under attack? It is a revenue measure applying generally to those earning their living in the community. It is a monetary exaction reasonably related to the cost of maintaining society by governmental protection, which alone renders civil liberty attainable.\n Follett is not made to pay a tax for the exercise of that which the First Amendment has relieved from taxation. He is made to pay for that for which all others similarly situated must pay,-an excise for the occupation of street vending. Follett asks exemption because street vending \n\n[321 \nU.S. 573, 581]\n\u00a0\n is, for him, also part of his religion. As a result, Follett will enjoy a subsidy for his religion. He will save the contribution for the cost of government which everyone else will have to pay.\n The present decision extends and reaches beyond what was decided in Murdock v. Pennsylvania, supra. There the community asserted the right to subject transient preachers of religion to taxation; there the court emphasized the 'itinerant' aspect of the activities sought to be subjected to the exaction. The emphasis there was upon the casual missionary appearances of Jehovah's Witnesses in the town and the injustice of subjecting them to a general license tax. Here, a citizen of the community, earning his living in the community by a religious activity, claims immunity from contributing to the cost of the government under which he lives. The record shows appellant 'testified that he obtained his living from the money received from those with whom he placed books, that he had no other source of income.'\n Unless the phrase 'free exercise', embodied in the First Amendment, means that government must render service free to those who earn their living in a religious calling, no reason is apparent why the appellant, like every other earner in the community, should not contribute his share of the community's common burden of expense. In effect the decision grants not free exercise of religion, in the sense that such exercise shall not be hindered or limited, but, on the other hand, requires that the exercise of religion be subsidized. Trinity Church, owning great property in New York City, devotes the income to religious ends. Must it, therefore, be exempt from paying its fair share of the cost of government's protection of its property?\n We cannot ignore what this decision involves. If the First Amendment grants immunity from taxation to the exercise of religion it must equally grant a similar exemp- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 573, 582]\n\u00a0\n tion to those who speak and to the press. It will not do to say that the Amendment, in the clause relating to religion, is couched in the imperative and, in the clause relating to freedom of speech and of press, is couched in the comparative. The Amendment's prohibitions are equally sweeping. 2 If exactions on the business or occupation of selling cannot be enforced against Jehovah's Witnesses they can no more be enforced against publishers or vendors of books, whether dealing with religion or other matters of information. The decision now rendered must mean that the guarantee of freedom of the press creates an immunity equal to that here upheld as to teaching or preaching religious doctrine. Thus the decision precludes nonoppressive, nondiscriminatory licensing or occupation taxes on publishers, and on news vendors as well, since, without the latter, the dissemination of views would be impossible. This court disavowed any such doctrine with respect to freedom of the press in Grosjean v. American Press Co., supra, and it is unthinkable that those who publish and distribute for profit newspapers and periodicals should suggest that they are in a class apart, untouchable by taxation upon their enterprises for the support of the government which makes their activities possible.\n Not only must the court, if it is to be consistent, accord to dissemination of all opinion, religious or other, the same immunity, but, even in the field of religion alone, the implications of the present decision are startling. Multiple activities by which citizens earn their bread may, with equal propriety, be denominated an exercise of religion as may preaching or selling religious tracts. Certainly this court cannot say that one activity is the exercise of religion and the other is not. The materials for judicial \n\n[321 \nU.S. 573, 583]\n\u00a0\n distinction do not exist. It would be difficult to deny the claims of those who devote their lives to the healing of the sick, to the nursing of the disabled, to the betterment of social and economic conditions, and to a myriad other worthy objects, that their respective callings, albeit they earn their living by pursuing them, are, for them, the exercise of religion. Such a belief, however earnestly and honestly held, does not entitle the believers to be free of contribution to the cost of government, which itself guarantees them the privilege of pursuing their callings without governmental prohibition or interference.\n We should affirm the judgment. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The court also distinguished State v.

CO. v. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD(1944)\nNo. 521\nArgued: March 27, 1944Decided: April 10, 1944\n\n\n\n Mr. Benjamin E. Gordon, of Boston, Mass., for petitioner.\n Mr. Alvin J. Rockwell, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The single question presented is whether the National Labor Relations Board acted within its statutory authority in ordering petitioner to bargain collectively with a union which had lost its majority after petitioner wrongfully had refused to bargain with it.\n In June 1941 forty-five of the eighty production and maintenance employees in petitioner's clothing factory designated the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America as their bargaining representative. Attempts of the Union to negotiate with petitioner proved unsuccessful because of the latter's refusal to bargain, and the Union \n\n[321 \nU.S. 702, 703]\n\u00a0\n filed with the Board a petition for an investigation and certification of representatives. A consent election was scheduled for July 25, and notices posted. Before the election was held, petitioner conducted an aggressive campaign against the Union, even to the extent of threatening to close its factory if the Union won the election. Thereupon the Union withdrew its petition for an election, and filed charges with the Board alleging that petitioner had engaged in unfair labor practices.\n In the following months various conferences were held and correspondence exchanged between petitioner and the Board in an unsuccessful effort to persuade the petitioner to cease opposition to the Union. Finally on March 2, 1942, the Board issued a complaint against petitioner. Hearings on the complaint were conducted at length, and in October 1942 a final order was entered. The finding of the Board, not here challenged, was that the foregoing conduct of petitioner, together with related conduct unnecessary to be detailed, constituted unfair labor practices within the meaning of Section 8(1) and (5) of the National Labor Relations Act, 49 Stat. 449, 452, 453, 29 U.S.C.  158(1) and (5), 29 U.S. C.A.  158(1, 5).\n In reaching its conclusion as to the appropriate remedy for these unfair practices, the Board considered petitioner's contention that during the seven month interval between the filing of the charges and the issuance of the complaint, thirteen of the Union's original members had been replaced by new employees in the normal course of business. This left the Union with only thirty-two of the eighty-five employees then in the unit which it represented, or less than a majority. But the Board found that the Union's lack of a majority was 'not determinative of the remedy to be ordered.' Citing many of its previous decisions involving similar situations, the Board concluded that 'the only means by which a refusal to bargain can be remedied is an affirmative order requiring the employer \n\n[321 \nU.S. 702, 704]\n\u00a0\n to bargain with the Union which represented a majority at the time the unfair labor practice was committed.' 44 N.L.R.B. 898, 917. Accordingly, because it deemed such a provision 'necessary to effectuate the policies of the Act', the Board included in its order a requirement that petitioner bargain collectively with the Union. The Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the Board, and directed enforcement of the order. 137 F.2d 989. To consider an alleged inconsistency between the Circuit Court's decision and our decision in National Labor Relations Board v. Fansteel Metallurgical Corp., \n306 \nU.S. 240, 261\n, 262 S., 59 S.Ct. 490, 498, 123 A.L.R. 599, we brought the case here for review. \n320 \nU.S. 734\n, 64 S.Ct. 436.\n We think the decision of the Circuit Court correct under the Act and consistent with past decisions of this Court. Little need be added to what has been said on this subject in other cases. Out of its wide experience, the Board many times has expressed the view that the unlawful refusal of an employer to bargain collectively with its employees' chosen representatives disrupts the employees' morale, deters their organizational activities, and discourages their membership in unions. The Board's study of this problem has led it to conclude that, for these reasons, a requirement that union membership be kept intact during delays incident to hearings would result in permitting employers to profit from their own wrongful refusal to bargain. See, e.g., Matter of Inland Steel Co., 9 N.L.R.B. 783, 815, 816; Matter of P. Lorillard Company, 16 N.L.R.B. 684, 699-701. One of the chief responsibilities of the Board is to direct such action as will dissipate the unwholesome effects of violations of the Act. See 29 U.S.C.  160(a) and (c) 29 U.S.C.A.  160(a, c). And, 'It is for the Board not the courts to determine how the effect of prior unfair labor practices may be expunged.' International Association of Machinists v. National Labor Relations Board, \n311 \nU.S. 72, 82\n, 61 S.Ct. 83, 89.\n That determination the Board has made in this case and in similar cases by adopting a form of remedy which \n\n[321 \nU.S. 702, 705]\n\u00a0\n requires that an employer bargain exclusively with the particular union which represented a majority of the employees at the time of the wrongful refusal to bargain despite that union's subsequent failure to retain its majority. The Board might well think that, were it not to adopt this type of remedy, but instead order elections upon every claim that a shift in union membership had occurred during proceedings occasioned by an employer's wrongful refusal to bargain, recalcitrant employers might be able by continued opposition to union membership indefinitely to postpone performance of their statutory obligation. In the Board's view, procedural delays necessary fairly to determine charges of unfair labor practices might in this way be made the occasion for further procedural delays in connection with repeated requests for elections, thus providing employers a chance to profit from a stubborn refusal to abide by the law. That the Board was within its statutory authority in adopting the remedy which it has adopted to foreclose the probability of such frustrations of the Act seems too plain for anything but statement. See 29 U.S.C.  160(a) and (c), 29 U.S.C.A.  160(a, c).\n Contrary to petitioner's suggestion, this remedy, as embodied in a Board order, does not involve any injustice to employees who may wish to substitute for the particular union some other bargaining agent or arrangement. For a Board order which requires an employer to bargain with a designated union is not intended to fix a permanent bargaining relationship without regard to new situations that may develop. See Great Southern Trucking Company v. National Labor Relations Board, 4 Cir., 139 F. 2d 984, 987. But, as the remedy here in question recognizes, a bargaining relationship once rightfully established must be permitted to exist and function for a reasonable period in which it can be given a fair chance to succeed. See National Labor Relations Board v. Appalachian Electric Power Co., 4 Cir., 140 F.2d 217, 220-222; National Labor Relations Board v. Botany Worsted Mills, 3 Cir., 133 F.2d 876, 881, 882. After such a rea- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 702, 706]\n\u00a0\n sonable period the Board may, in a proper proceeding and upon a proper showing, take steps in recognition of changed situations which might make appropriate changed bargaining relationships. Id.; see 29 U.S.C.  159(c), 29 U.S.C.A.  159(c).\n That issuance of the order challenged by petitioner lay within the Board's discretion is settled by our holding in National Labor Relations Board v. P. Lorillard Co., \n314 \nU.S. 512, 513\n, 62 S.Ct. 397. The Lorillard case, argues petitioner, is distinguishable because in that case the Court pointed to the fact that, 'The Board had considered the effect of a possible shift in membership ....' \n314 \nU.S. 513\n, 62 S.Ct. 397. But in this case also the Board considered the change in membership, and in addition relied in part upon the Lorillard decision to support its order. We find no possible valid distinction between this and the Lorillard case.\n Nor is the Lorillard decision inconsistent with the earlier holding in National Labor Relations Board v. Fansteel Metallurgical Corp., \n306 \nU.S. 240\n, 59 S.Ct. 490, 123 A.L.R. 599. In the latter case the Board's order to bargain with the union rested in part on its finding that the company should reinstate ninety-three discharged union members. The Board had not determined in that proceeding, nor did it argue in this Court, that the company should be compelled to bargain with the union if these ninety-three employees were denied reinstatement. After this Court, contrary to the Board's conclusion, held that these employees properly were denied reinstatement, the situation was the same as if the Board had not considered the effect of the change in union membership. Cf. N.L.R.B. v. P. Lorillard Co., supra.\nAFFIRMED.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","48":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGENERAL TRADING CO. v. STATE TAX COMMISSION OF IOWA(1944)\nNo. 441\nArgued: February 4, 1944Decided: May 15, 1944\n\n\n\n\n[322 \nU.S. 335, 336]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Edward S. Stringer, of St. Paul, Minn., for petitioner.\n Mr. Jens Grothe, of Des Moines, Iowa, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The State Tax Commission of Iowa brought this suit under the authority of the Iowa Use Tax Law which was recently here in Nelson v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., \n312 \nU.S. 359\n, 61 S.Ct. 586, 132 A.L.R. 475, and Nelson v. Montgomery Ward, \n312 \nU.S. 373\n, 61 S.Ct. 593. The question now presented is, in short, whether Iowa may collect, in the circumstances of this case, such a use tax from General Trading Company, a Minnesota corporation, on the basis of property bought from Trading Company and sent by it from Minnesota to purchasers in Iowa for use and enjoyment there.\n By the Iowa Use Tax Law a tax is 'imposed on the use in this state of tangible personal property purchased ... for use in this state, at the rate of two percent of the purchase price of such property. Said tax is ... imposed upon every person using such property within this state until such tax has been paid directly to the county treasurer, to a retailer, or to the commission ....'  6943.103, Code of Iowa 1939. The use of property the sale of which is subject to Iowa's sales tax is exempted from the use tax ( 6943.104(1), but the sales tax can be laid only on sales at retail within the State.  6943.075. The use tax constitutes a debt owed by the retailer to the State.  6943.112. But 'Every retailer maintaining a place of business' in Iowa must collect this tax from the purchaser ( 6943.109), and may not advertise that he will himself absorb the tax.  6943.111. Finally an offsetting credit \n\n[322 \nU.S. 335, 337]\n\u00a0\n (see Henneford v. Silas Mason Co., \n300 \nU.S. 577, 584\n, 586 S., 587, 57 S.Ct. 524, 527, 528, 529) if another use or sales tax has been paid for the same thing elsewhere is allowed, and if the tax 'imposed in such other state is two percent or more, then no tax shall be due on such articles.'  6943.125.\n A judgment in favor of the Tax Commission by one of the lower courts was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Iowa, -- Iowa --, 10 N.W.2d 659. The application by that Court of its local laws and the facts on which it founded its judgment are of course controlling here. From these it appears that General Trading Company had never qualified to do business as a foreign corporation in Iowa nor does it maintain there any office, branch or warehouse. The property on which the use tax was laid was sent to Iowa as a result of orders solicited by traveling salesmen sent into Iowa from their Minnesota headquarters. The orders were always subject to acceptance in Minnesota whence the goods were shipped into Iowa by common carriers or the post. Upon these facts and its holding that Trading Company was a 'retailer maintaining a place of business in this state' within the meaning of the Iowa Statute, the Iowa Supreme Court held that Iowa had not exceeded its powers in the imposition of this use tax on Iowa purchasers, and that collection could validly be made through the Trading Company.\n We brought the case here, \n320 \nU.S. 731\n, 64 S.Ct. 206, to meet the claim that there was need for further precision regarding the scope of our previous rulings on the power of States to levy use taxes. In view however of the clear understanding by the court below that the facts we have summarized bring the transaction within the taxing power of Iowa, there is little need for elaboration. We agree with the Iowa Supreme Court that Felt & Tarrant Mfg. Co. v. Gallagher, \n306 \nU.S. 62\n, 59 S.Ct. 376; Nelson v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., supra; and Nelson v. Montgomery Ward, supra, are \n\n[322 \nU.S. 335, 338]\n\u00a0\n controlling. The Gallagher case is indistinguishable-certainly nothing can turn on the more elaborate arrangements for soliciting orders for an intricate machine for shipment from without a State as in the Gallagher case, compared with the apparently simpler needs for soliciting business in this case. And the fact that in the Sears Roebuck and Montgomery Ward cases the interstate vendor also had retail stores in Iowa, whose sales were appropriately subjected to the sales tax, is constitutionally irrelevant to the right of Iowa sustained in those cases to exact a use tax from purchasers on mail order goods forwarded into Iowa from without the State. All these differentiations are without constitutional significance. Of course, no State can tax the privilege of doing interstate business. See Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, \n303 \nU.S. 250\n, 58 S.Ct. 546, 115 A.L.R. 944. That is within the protection of the Commerce Clause and subject to the power of Congress. On the other hand, the mere fact that property is used for interstate commerce or has come into an owner's possession as a result of interstate commerce does not diminish the protection which he may draw from a State to the upkeep of which he may be asked to bear his fair share. But a fair share precludes legislation obviously hostile or practically discriminatory toward interstate commerce. See Best & Co. v. Maxwell, \n311 \nU.S. 454\n, 61 S.Ct. 334.\n Mone of these infirmities affects the tax in this case any more than it did in the other cases with which it forms a group. The tax is what it professes to be-a non-discriminatory excise laid on all personal property consumed in Iowa. The property is enjoyed by an Iowa resident partly because the opportunity is given by Iowa to enjoy property no matter whence acquired. The exaction is made against the ultimate consumer-the Iowa resident who is paying taxes to sustain his own state government. To make the distributor the tax collector for the State is a familiar and sanctioned device. Monamotor Oil Co. v. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 335, 339]\n\u00a0\n Johnson, \n292 \nU.S. 86, 93\n, 94 S., 54 S.Ct. 575, 578; Felt & Tarrant Mfg. Co. v. Gallagher, supra.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice JACKSON, dissenting.\n This decision authorizes in my opinion an unwarranted extension of the power of a state to subject persons to its taxing power who are not within its jurisdiction and have not in any manner submitted themselves to it. The General Trading Company is, in the language of the opinion, made 'the tax collector for the tax.' We have heretofore held, and I think properly, that the state may make tax collectors of those who come in and do business within its jurisdiction, for thereby they submit themselves to its power. Such was the situation in both Monamotor Oil Co. v. Johnson, \n292 \nU.S. 86\n, 54 S.Ct. 575, and Felt & Tarrant Mfg. Co. v. Gallagher, \n306 \nU.S. 62\n, 59 S.Ct. 376. These are the only authorities cited by the Court on this point, and they clearly are not precedents to support this decision.\n In this case, as the opinion points out, the General Trading Company never qualified in Iowa and has no office, branch, warehouse, or general agent in the State. From Minnesota it ships goods ordered from salesmen by purchasers in Iowa. Orders are accepted only in Minnesota. The transaction of sale is not taxed and, being clearly interstate commerce, is not taxable. McLeod v. Dilworth Co., \n322 \nU.S. 327\n, 64 S.Ct. 1023. So we are holding that a state has power to make a tax collector of one whom it has no power to tax. Certainly no state has a constitutional warrant for making a tax collector of one as the price of the privilege of doing interstate commerce. He does not get the right from the state, and the state cannot qualify it. I can imagine no principle of states' rights or state comity which can justify what is done here. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 335, 340]\n\u00a0\n Nor does the practice seem conducive to good order in the federal system. The power of Iowa to enforce collection in other states is certainly very limited and the effort to do so on any wide scale is unlikely either to be systematically pursued or successfully executed.\n I recognize the pressure to uphold all manner of efforts to collect tax moneys. But this decision, by which one may not ship goods from anywhere in the United States to a purchaser in Iowa without becoming a nonresident tax collector, exceeds everything so far done by this Court. In my opinion the statute is an effort to exert extraterritorial control beyond any which a state could exert if there were no Constitution at all. I can think of nothing in or out of the Constitution which warrants this effort to reach beyond the State's own border to make out-of-state merchants tax collectors because they engage in interstate commerce with the State's citizens.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS joins in this opinion. \n\n\n\n","49":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER CO. v. RAY-O-VAC CO.(1944)\nNo. 262\nArgued: February 2, 1944Decided: February 28, 1944\n\n\n\n Messrs. William E. Chilton and Albert R. Golrick, both of Cleveland, Ohio, for petitioners.\n Messrs. Bernard A. Schroeder, of Chicago, Ill., and Gerhard A. Gesell, of Washington, D.C., for respondent. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 275, 276]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case involves the validity and alleged infringement of the Anthony Patent No. 2,198,413, issued April 23, 1940. The District Court held the patent valid and infringed1 and its judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The patent, a very narrow one in a crowded art, is for a leakproof dry cell for a flash light battery. The conventional dry cell embodies a cup-like zinc electrode acting as a container for a central carbon electrode, electrolyte, and depolarizing mix. The bottom enclosure is the terminal for one electrode, the top enclosure for the other. The electrolyte is a viscous liquid composed of ammonium chloride, zinc chloride, water and starch. Use of the battery causes erosion of the zinc and eventually the mixture leaks through the container. A short circuit, or long continuous use, causes the formation of solids as the zinc is eaten away. The resultant expansion of the cell contents, due to the weakness of the zinc walls, causes bulging, breaking, and seepage. The escaping liquid tends to injure the metal walls of the flash light casing.\n Dry cells have been used in flash lights for many years. The tendency of the cells to damage flash light containers by leakage, bulging, and freezing in the container had long plagued the industry. So much so that most manufacturers attached warning notices to their flash light batteries advising users not to allow them to remain in the flash light for extended periods of non-use and to remove a celll promptly upon ascertaining that it was dead.\n No patent in the prior art addressed itself to the problem of preventing both leakage and swelling in a dry cell. At the time of the Anthony application flash light cells were commonly encased in a paper coating which might \n\n[321 \nU.S. 275, 277]\n\u00a0\n or might not be waterproofed, or in some other similar casing for purposes of insulation from the case. In the patent in suit Anthony calls attention to the existing difficulties and states that his invention is for an improved protective casing which will prevent fluids from leaking out of the cell and causing injury to the case or other dry cells within it. He also adverts to the tendency of the cells to swell after a certain time and associates this swelling with the leaking. He states that the object of his invention is to protect the side walls of the zinc cup by providing a strong metal sheath which will closely and rigidly confine the cell to a given length and diameter and, while providing such a sheath, to insulate it from both terminals so as to render unnecessary the use of an insulating over or label to prevent the cell from short circuiting by contact with the side walls of the case. To accomplish his objects Anthony used the ordinary type of dry cell having circuit terminals at opposite ends, one electrode being a cylindrical zinc cup, the other a centrally placed carbon electrode, in electrolyte and depolarizing mix, the bottom closure affording a terminal for one electrode and the top for the other. Around this conventional combination he placed an insulating material and an outside protecting metal sheath which would enclose the insulated side walls of the zinc cup and tightly embrace both upper and lower closures to prevent leakage.\n The claims in suit are Nos. 1, 2, and 3. If 1 is good, 2 and 3 are also. We, therefore, quote 1:\n'A leak-immunized flash light dry-cell provided with circuit terminals at opposite ends, comprising: a hollow cylindrical zinc metal electrode containing electrolyte; a centrally disposed carbon electrode and depolarizing-mix in said electrolyte; a bottom closure for the cell affording a terminal for one of the electrodes; a top closure for the cell provided with a terminal for the other electrode, \n\n[321 \nU.S. 275, 278]\n\u00a0\n electrically insulated from the first mentioned terminal; and a protecting sheet-metal sheath insulated from both of said electrodes and enclosing the side walls of said metal electrode and tightly embracing said closures so as to prevent leakage of the electrolyte from the unit.'\n\n The District Judge made findings, which have support in the evidence, to the following effect: That the problem presented was old and no solution was attained prior to Anthony's invention; that the respondent began marketing the patented cell in 1939 and was the first to guarantee its product against sticking in the flash light case; that the cell met with immediate commercial success due to the advantages of its construction and not to extensive advertising; that its advantages were recognized by the Army and other governmental agencies and were demonstrated by reliable tests. In his opinion he examined the prior art and showed that none of the workers in the art had met the problems of leakage and swelling in the way suggested by Anthony and that most of the cited patents had not in fact been addressed to these problems.\n With respect to the charge of infringement, the court found, on sufficient evidence: That the petitioners consciously copied the respondent's commercial cell, which was made in accordance with the claims of the patent; that the petitioners' cell infringed the claims in suit, since the petitioners' substitutions of structure and material were no more than the choice of mechanical alternatives and did not avoid the practice of the principle disclosed by the patent.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals reexamined the findings in the light of the evidence and accepted them. It must be a strong case in which this court will set aside these concurrent findings of two courts. \n3\n We think this is not such a case. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 275, 279]\n\u00a0\n Viewed after the event, the means Anthony adopted seem simple and such as should have been obvious to those who worked in the field, but this is not enough to negative invention. \n4\n During a period of half a century, in which the use of flash light batteries increased enormously, and the manufacturers of flash light cells were conscious of the defects in them, no one devised a method of curing such defects. Once the method was discovered it commended itself to the public as evidenced by marked commercial success. These factors were entitled to weight in determining whether the improvement amounted to invention and should, in a close case, tip the scales in favor of patentability. \n5\n Accepting, as we do, the findings below, we hold the patent valid and infringed.\n The petitioners renew here contentions, based on asserted insufficiency of description of the invention and on alleged file-wrapper estoppel, which the courts below overruled. We have considered these defenses but conclude that the proofs do not sustain them.\n Decree affirmed.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK, dissenting.\n Those who strive to produce and distribute goods in a system of free competitive enterprise should not be handicapped by patents based on a 'shadow of a shade of an idea.' Atlantic Works v. Brady, \n107 \nU.S. 192, 200\n, 2 S.Ct. 225, 231. The practice of granting patents for microscopic structural or \n\n[321 \nU.S. 275, 280]\n\u00a0\n mechanical improvements inevitably must reduce the United States Patent Office to a mass production factory for unearned special privileges which serve no purpose except unfairly to harass the honest pursuit of business. If the patentee here has 'discovered' anything, it is that the creamy substance in a dry cell will not leak through a steel jacket which covers and is securely fastened to the ends of the cell. For that alleged discovery this patent is today upheld. I do not deny that someone, somewhere, sometime, made the discovery that liquids would not leak through leak-proof solids. My trouble is that, despite findings to the contrary,1 I cannot agree that this patentee is that discoverer. My disagreement is not based solely on the narrow ground that the record shows previous patents have been issued to others who put jackets of metal and other substances around dry cells. Antiquarians tell us that the use of solid containers to hold liquids predated the dawn of written history. That the problem of the quality and strength of the walls of such containers was one to which ancient people turned their attention appears from the widespread currency at an early age of the maxim that 'new wine should not be put in old bottles.' It is impossible for me to believe that Congress intended to grant monopoly privileges to persons who do no more than apply knowledge which has for centuries been the universal possession of all the earth's people-even those of the most primitive civilizations.\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice MURPHY concur in this opinion.\n Mr. Justice JACKSON is of opinion the judgment below should be reversed for the reason that, invention being \n\n[321 \nU.S. 275, 281]\n\u00a0\n doubtful, the Court of Appeals relied upon commercial success of the product without adequate findings or evidence as to whether such alleged success was due to the product or to the phenomenal increase in demand due to the war and to the advantages of marketing contracts with mail-order houses. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 45 F.Supp. 927. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 7 Cir., 136 F.2d 159. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Williams Co. v.

READ(1944)\nNo. 235\nArgued: January 31, 1944Decided: April 24, 1944\n\n\n\n Messrs. Charles R. Holton, of Chicago, Ill., and John A. Johnson, of Oklahoma City, Okl., for petitioner. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 47, 48]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Fred Hansen, of Oklahoma City, Okl., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice REED, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This writ brings here for review the action of petitioner, a foreign insurance company, to recover taxes paid to respondent, the Insurance Commissioner of Oklahoma, which were levied by Section 10478, Oklahoma Statutes 1931, as amended by Chapter 1(a), Title 36, Session Laws of Oklahoma 1941, 36 O.S.1941  104. This was an annual four per cent tax on premiums received by foreign insurance companies in Oklahoma, and it, together with certain specified fees, was in lieu of all other taxes and fees in Oklahoma. Petitioner paid the tax under protest and, alleging diversity of citizenship, 28 U.S.C.  41, 28 U.S.C.A.  41, brought suit against the Insurance Commissioner in the District Court of the United States. The procedure for recovery is laid down by Section 12665, Oklahoma Statutes 1931, 68 O.S.A.  15.50.1 \n\n[322 \nU.S. 47, 49]\n\u00a0\n The percentage of premiums due was increased from two to four per cent by the amendment of 1941, effective April 25th of that year. The District Court refused recovery. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. Great Northern Life Insurance Co. v. Read, 10 Cir., 136 F.2d 44. Certiorari was granted on petitioner's assertion of error in requiring it to pay a tax allegedly discriminatory under the Fourteenth Amendment as compared with the taxation of domestic insurance companies, and also unconstitutional as levied after the company's admission to the state and on premiums collected during the business year for which a license was already in force. A conflict in principle was suggested with Hanover Fire Insurance Company v. Harding, \n272 \nU.S. 494\n, 47 S.Ct. 179, 49 A.L.R. 713. We granted certiorari, \n320 \nU.S. 726\n, 64 S.Ct. 62, and asked discussion of the right of petitioner to maintain its suit in a Federal court. As we conclude that this suit could not be maintained in the Federal court, we do not reach the merits of the issue as to the validity of the tax.\n The right of petitioner to maintain this suit in a Federal court depends, first, upon whether the action is against an individual or against the State of Oklahoma. Secondly, if the action is determined to be against the state, the question arises as to whether or not the state has consented to suit against itself in the Federal court.\n Respondent challenged the right of petitioner to seek relief in the District Court by the defense in its answer that the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. R.C.P. 12(b) and (e), 28 U. S.C.A. following section 723c. \n2\n This challenge, \n\n[322 \nU.S. 47, 50]\n\u00a0\n on the ground that the state had not consented to be sued, was sustained by the District Court. The contention is available here to sustain the judgment on appeal. LeTulle v. Scofield, \n308 \nU.S. 415\n, 60 S.Ct. 313.\n In Smith v. Reeves, \n178 \nU.S. 436\n, 20 S.Ct. 919, an action was instituted in the Federal trial court by railroad receivers against the defendant 'as treasurer of the state of California' to recover taxes assessed against the paid by the railroad. The proceeding was brought under Section 3669 of the California Political Code, as amended by California Statutes, 1891, p. 442, which authorized a suit against the State Treasurer for the recovery of taxes which were illegally exacted. The defendant could demand trial of the action in the Superior Court of the County of Sacramento, California. If the final judgment was against the Treasurer, the Comptroller of the state was directed to draw his warrant on state funds for its satisfaction.\n As the suit was against a state official as such, through proceedings which were authorized by statute, to compel him to carry out with the state's funds the state's agreement to reimburse moneys illegally exacted under color of the tax power, this Court held, page 439 of 178 U.S., page 920 of 20 S.Ct., it was a suit against the state. The state would be required to pay. \n3\n The case therefore is plainly distinguishable from those to recover personally from a tax collector money wrongfully exacted by him under color of state law, Atchison, etc., Ry. Co. v. O'Connor, \n223 \nU.S. 280\n, 32 S.Ct. 216, Ann.Cas.1913C, 1050; cf. Matthews v.

Reeves was the action authorized by statute against the officer in his official capacity. In the other instances relief was sought under general law from wrongful acts of officials. In such cases the immunity of the sovereign does not extend to wrongful individual action and the citizen is allowed a remedy against the wrongdoer personally.\n This ruling that a state could not be controlled by courts in the performance of its political duties through suits against its officials has been consistently followed. Chandler v. Dix, \n194 \nU.S. 590\n, 24 S.Ct. 766; Fitts v. McGhee, \n172 \nU.S. 516, 529\n, 19 S.Ct. 269, 274; Murray v.

Efforts to force, through suits against officials, performance of promises by a state collide directly with the necessity that a sovereign must be free from judicial compulsion in the carrying out of its policies within the limits of the Constitution. Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi, \n292 \nU.S. 313, 320\n, 54 S.Ct. 745, 746; State of Louisiana v. Jumel, \n107 \nU.S. 711, 720\n, 2 S.Ct. 128, 135. A state's freedom from litigation was established as a constitutional right through the Eleventh Amendment. The inherent nature of sovereignty prevents actions against a state by its own citizens without its consent. Hans v. Louisiana, \n134 \nU.S. 1, 10\n, 16 S., 10 S.Ct. 504, 505, 507.\n Oklahoma provides for recovery of unlawful exactions paid to its collectors under protest. Section 12665 Oklahoma Statutes 1931. Note 1, supra. In our view of this case it \n\n[322 \nU.S. 47, 52]\n\u00a0\n is unnecessary for us to pass upon whether this method of protecting taxpayers was intended to be exclusive of all other remedies, including actions against an individual who happened to be a tax collector, or whether if it were so intended it would surmount all constitutional objections. Compare Burrill v. Locomobile Co., \n258 \nU.S. 34\n, 42 S.Ct. 256, and Anniston Mfg. Co. v. Davis, \n301 \nU.S. 337, 341\n, 343 S., 57 S. Ct. 816-819. See also Antrim Lumber Co. v. Sneed, 175 Okl. 47, 49-51, 52 P.2d 1040, 1043-1045.\n A suit against a state official under Section 12665 to recover taxes is held to be a suit against the state by Oklahoma and the remedy exclusive of other state remedies. Antrim Lumber Co. v. Sneed, supra, 175 Okl. at page 51, 52 P.2d at page 1045. This interpretation of an Oklahoma statute by the Supreme Court of the state accords with our view, as set out above, of the meaning of a suit against a state. Petitioner brought this action against the collector, the Insurance Commissioner, in strict accord with the requirements of Section 12665. It alleged that there was no appeal provided by Oklahoma laws from defendant's action in collecting and gave notice of protest and suit to defendant at the time of payment in the language of the Section. By so doing petitioner was relieved of the necessity of establishing that the payment was not voluntary4 and obtained the advantage of a statutory lien lis pendens on the tax payment.\n By Section 12665, Oklahoma creates a judicial procedure for the prompt recovery by the citizen of money wrongfully collected as taxes. It is the sovereign's method of tax administration. Oklahoma designates the official to be sued, orders him to hold the tax, empowers its courts to \n\n[322 \nU.S. 47, 53]\n\u00a0\n do complete justice by determining the amount properly due and directs its collector to pay back any excess received to the taxpayer. The state provides this procedure in lieu of the common law right to claim reimbursement from the collector. The issue of coercion and duress was eliminated at the pre-trial conference without objection by the petitioner. The section makes sure the taxpayer's recovery of illegal payments. The section is like the California statute involved in Smith v. Reeves, supra, except for the immaterial difference that the money collected is directed to be held separate and apart by the collector instead of being held in the general funds of the State Treasurer. See  3669, California Political Code, as amended by California Statutes 1891 p. 442. In the Reeves case, as here, the suit was against the official, not the individual. The Oklahoma section differs from the Colorado law, Section 6, Chapter 211, Session Laws of Colorado 1907, considered in Atchison, etc., Ry. Co. v. O'Connor, supra, in that the Colorado statute left the taxpayer to his remedy against the collector and merely directed the refund of the tax by the Treasurer in accordance with any judgment or decree which might be obtained. In the O'Connor case, in accordance with the statute, the suit, as this Court's opinion shows, was against the individual, not the official. We are of the view that the present proceeding under  12665 is like Smith v. Reeves, a suit against the state.\n But it is urged that if this is a suit against the state, Oklahoma has consented to this action in the Federal court. Cf. Reagan v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., \n154 \nU.S. 362, 391\n, 14 S.Ct. 1047, 1052\n\n\n The principle of immunity from litigation assures the states and the nation from unanticipated intervention in the processes of government, while its rigors are mitigated by a sense of justice which has continually expanded by consent the suability of the sovereign. The history of \n\n[322 \nU.S. 47, 54]\n\u00a0\n sovereign immunity and the practical necessity of unfettered freedom for government from crippling interferences require a restriction of suability to the terms of the consent, as to persons, courts and procedure. Antrim Lumber Co. v. Sneed, 175 Okl. 47, 52 P.2d 1040; Patterson v. City of Checotah, 187 Okl. 587, 103 P.2d 97; Beers v. State of Arkansas, 20 How. 527; Kawananakoa v. Polyblank, \n205 \nU.S. 349\n, 27 S.Ct. 526; State of Minnesota v. United States, \n305 \nU.S. 382, 388\n, 59 S. Ct. 292, 295; United States v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., \n309 \nU.S. 506, 512\n, 60 S.Ct. 653, 656. 5 The immunity may, of course, be waived. Clark v. Barnard, \n108 \nU.S. 436, 447\n, 29 S.Ct. 878, 882. When a state authorizes a suit against itself to do justice to taxpayers who deem themselves injured by any exaction, it is not consonant with our dual system for the Federal courts o be astute to read the consent to embrace Federal as well as state courts. Federal courts, sitting within states, are for many purposes courts of that state, Madisonville Traction Company v. Mining Company, \n196 \nU.S. 239, 255\n, 25 S.Ct. 251, 257, but when we are dealing with the sovereign exemption from judicial interference in the vital field of financial administration a clear declaration of the state's intention to submit its fiscal problems to other courts than those of its own creation must be found. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n The Oklahoma section in question, 12665, was enacted in 1915 as a part of a general amendment to then existing tax laws. Session Laws 1915, p. 149, Chap. 107, Art. 1, subdivision B. sec. 7.7 This subdivision of the act of 1915 is \n\n[322 \nU.S. 47, 55]\n\u00a0\n concerned with administrative review of boards of equalization and provides a complete procedure including review by the district and Supreme Court of Oklahoma, as the case may be, which are given authority to affirm, modify or annul the action of the boards. Sections 2 and 3. Section 6 requires the payment of the taxes which fall due, pending administrative review, and provides for recovery of such taxes in accordance with the ultimate finding on review in language practically identical with that of Section 7 ( 12665) here involved. Furthermore, section 12665 gives directions to the Oklahoma officer as to his obligations, requires the court to give precedence to these cases and directs the kind of judgment to be returned, see note 1, supra, which is quite different in language, if not in effect, from the judgment a Federal court would render. It is clear to us that the legislature of Oklahoma was consenting to suit in its own courts only. Chandler v. Dix, \n194 \nU.S. 590\n, 24 S.Ct. 766.\n Smith v. Reeves, supra, 178 U.S. page 445, 20 S.Ct. page 922, holds that an act of a state is valid which limits to its own courts suits against it to recover taxes. There California's intention to so limit was made manifest by authorizing the state officer to demand trial in the Superior Court of Sacramento County. Atchison etc., Ry. Co. v. O'Connor, considered above (64 S.Ct. 876), is not applicable since it was not a suit against the state.\n Petitioner urges that Smyth v. Ames, \n169 \nU.S. 466, 517\n, 18 S.Ct. 418, 422, and Reagan v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., \n154 \nU.S. 362, 391\n, 392 S., 14 S.Ct. 1047, 1052, are precedents which lead to a contrary conclusion on this issue of the suability of Oklahoma in the District Court of the United States. The former is clearly inapposite. That case involved proceedings to enjoin enforcement of an allegedly unconstitutional state statute providing for intrastate railroad rates. Since the state act provided a remedy, the state took the position \n\n[322 \nU.S. 47, 56]\n\u00a0\n that Federal equity jurisdiction was ousted. This Court held the Federal equity jurisdiction continued to restrain unconstitutional acts by state officers which threatened irreparable damage. Pages 474, 477, 515-519 of 169 U.S., pages 420-423 of 18 S.Ct..\n In the Reagan case, a proceeding for injunction to restrain the members of the Texas Railroad Commission from enforcing rates which were alleged to be unconstitutional was allowed to be maintained in equity in a Federal court. This Court said it was maintainable against the defendants both under the general equity jurisdiction of the Federal courts and under the provisions of the state statute which allowed review 'in a court of competent jurisdiction in Travis county, Texas ....' (\n154 \nU.S. 362\n, 14 S. Ct. 1052.) It was thought that the United States Circuit Court, sitting in Travis County, was covered by this language. As it was concluded, however, that this was not a suit against the state, page 392 of 154 U.S., page 1052 of 14 S.Ct., we do not feel impelled to extend the ruling of the Reagan case on this alternative basis of jurisdiction to a suit, such as this, against a state for recovery of taxes.\n Gunter v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., \n200 \nU.S. 273\n, 26 S.Ct. 252, is also distinguishable. There the Attorney General of South Carolina appeared in a Federal court to answer for the state in an injunction suit under the authority of a statute which read as follows:\n'if the state be interested in the revenue in said action, the county auditor shall immediately, upon the commencement of said action, inform the auditor of state of its commencement, of the alleged cause thereof, and the auditor of state shall submit the same to the attorney general, who shall defend said action for and on behalf of the state.' Page 286 of 200 U.S., page 257 of 26 S.Ct..\n\n This Court construed this to consent to an appearance in the Federal court and held its decision res judicata against the state and added at page 287 of 200 U.S., page 257 of 26 S.Ct.: \n\n[322 \nU.S. 47, 57]\n\u00a0\n 'If there were doubt-which we think there is not-as to the construction which we give to the act of 1868, that doubt is entirely dispelled by a consideration of the contemporaneous interpretation given to the act by the officials charged with its execution, by the view which this court took as to the real party in interest on the record in the Pegues case, and by the action as well as nonaction which followed the decision of that case by the state government in all its departments through a long period of years.'\n The administrative construction by a state of these statutes of consent have influence in determining our conclusions. Cf. Farish v. State Banking Board, \n235 \nU.S. 498, 512\n, 35 S.Ct. 185, 189; Richardson v. Fajardo Sugar Co., \n241 \nU.S. 44, 47\n, 36 S.Ct. 476, 477; State of Missouri v. Fiske, \n290 \nU.S. 18, 24\n, 54 S.Ct. 18, 20.\n It may be well to add that the construction given the Oklahoma statute leaves open the road to review in this Court on constitutional grounds after the issues have been passed upon by the state courts. Chandler v. Dix, \n194 \nU.S. 590, 592\n, 24 S.Ct. 766; Smith v. Reeves, \n178 \nU.S. 436, 445\n, 20 S.Ct. 919, 922.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is vacated and the cause is remanded to the District Court with directions to dismiss the complaint for want of jurisdiction.\n Vacated and remanded.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER, with whom the CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice ROBERTS concur, dissenting.\n To avoid the imposition of penalties and other serious hazards, the plaintiff paid money under claim of a tax which Oklahoma, we must assume, had no power to exact. Concededly, he could sue to recover the moneys so paid to the defendant, a tax collector, in a state court in Oklahoma. But to allow the suit to be brought in a federal court sitting in Oklahoma would derogate, this Court now holds, from the sovereignty of Oklahoma. Such a result, I believe, derives from an excessive regard for formalism \n\n[322 \nU.S. 47, 58]\n\u00a0\n and from a disregard of the whole trend of legislation, adjudication and legal thought in subjecting the collective responsibility of society to those rules of law which govern as between man and man.\n To repeat, this is a simple suit to get back money from a collector who for present purposes had no right to demand it. So far as the federal fiscal system is concerned, this common law remedy has been enforced throughout our history, barring only a brief interruption. \n1\n See United States v. Nunnally Investment Co., \n316 \nU.S. 258\n, 62 S.Ct. 1064, 140 A.L.R. 792. And if, instead of avoiding the serious consequences of not paying this state tax, the plaintiff had resisted payment and sought an injunction against the tax collector for seeking to enforce the unconstitutional tax, under appropriate circumstances the federal courts would not have been without jurisdiction. See, e.g., Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Trapp, 8 Cir., 186 F. 114; Ward v. Love County Com'rs, \n253 \nU.S. 17\n, 40 S.Ct. 419; Carpenter v. Shaw, \n280 \nU.S. 363\n, 50 S.Ct. 121. Finally, as I read the opinion of the Court, even a suit of this very nature for the recovery of money paid for a disputed tax will lie against the collector in what is called his individual capacity; that is, a suit against the same person on the same cause of action for the same remedy can be brought, if only differently entitled. In view of the history of such a suit as this and of the incongruous consequences of dis- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 47, 59]\n\u00a0\n allowing it in the form in which it was a case in the federal court in Oklahoma, the claims of sovereignty which are sought to be respected must surely be attenuated and capricious.\n The Eleventh Amendment has put state immunity from suit into the Constitution. Therefore, it is not in the power of individuals to bring any State into court-the State's or that of the United States-except with its consent. But consent does not depend on some ritualistic formula. Nor are any words needed to indicate submission to the law of the land. The readiness or reluctance with which courts find such consent has naturally been influenced by prevailing views regarding the moral sanction to be attributed to a State's freedom from suability. Whether this immunity is an absolute survival of the monarchial privilege, or is a manifestation merely of power, or rests on abstract logical grounds, see Kawananakoa v. Polyblank, \n205 \nU.S. 349\n, 27 S.Ct. 526, it undoubtedly runs counter to modern democratic notions of the moral responsibility of the State. Accordingly, courts reflect a strong legislative momentum in their tendency to extend the legal responsibility of Government and to confirm Maitland's belief, expressed nearly fifty years ago, that 'it is a wholesome sight to see 'the Crown' sued and answering for its torts.' 3 Maitland, Collected Papers, 263.2\n Assuming that the proceeding in this case to recover from the individual moneys demanded by him in defiance of the Constitution is a suit against the State, compare Ex parte Young, \n209 \nU.S. 123, 155\n, 28 S.Ct. 441, 452, 13 L.R.A.,N.S., 932, 14 Ann.Cas. 764; Atchison, etc., \n\n[322 \nU.S. 47, 60]\n\u00a0\n Ry. Co. v. O'Connor, \n223 \nU.S. 280\n, 32 S.Ct. 216, Ann.Cas. 1913C, 1050, Oklahoma has consented that he be sued. The only question therefore is as to the scope of the consent. Has she confined the right to sue to her own courts and excluded the federal courts within her boundaries? She has not said so. Is such restriction indicated by practical considerations in the administration of state affairs? If it makes any difference to Oklahoma whether this suit against a tax collector is pressed in an Oklahoma state court rather than in a federal court sitting in Oklahoma, the difference has not been revealed. There is here an entire absence of the considerations that led to the decision in Burford v. Sun Oil Co., \n319 \nU.S. 315\n, 63 S.Ct. 1098. There it was deemed desirable, as a matter of discretion, that a federal equity court should step aside and leave a specialized system of state administration to function. Here the suit in a federal court would not supplant a specially adaptable state scheme of administration nor bring into play the expert knowledge of a state court regarding local conditions. The subject matter and the course of the litigation in the federal court would be precisely the same as in the state court. The case would merely be argued in a different building and before a different judge. Language restrictive of suit in a federal court is lacking, and intrinsic policy does not suggest restrictive interpretation to withdraw from a federal court questions of federal constitutional law.\n Legislation giving consent to sue is not to be treated in the spirit in which seventeenth century criminal pleading was construed. Only by such overstrained rendering of the Oklahoma Statute does the court finally achieve exclusion of the right of the plaintiff to go to a federal court. To the language of that Statute I now turn. By  12665, Oklahoma Statutes 1931, the State authorized an action to recover moneys illegally exacted as a tax, in a situation like the present, where the exaction is one 'from which the laws provide no appeal'. The relevant juris- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 47, 61]\n\u00a0\n dictional provision is as follows: 'All such suits shall be brought in the court having jurisdiction thereof, and they shall have precedence therein ....' The part that the federal courts play in the grant of such jurisdiction by the States is not a new problem. With his customary hard- headedness Chief Justice Waite, for this Court, stated the guiding consideration in ascertaining the relation of the federal court within a State to the judicial process recognized by that State: 'While the Circuit Court may not be technically a court of the Commonwealth, it is a court within it; and that, as we think, is all the legislature intended to provide for.' Ex parte Schollenberger, \n96 \nU.S. 369\n, 377. This conception of a federal court as a court within the State of its location has ever since dominated our decisions. See, e.g., Madisonville Traction Company v. Mining Company, \n196 \nU.S. 239, 255\n, 256 S., 25 S.Ct. 251, 257, 258; Neirbo Co. v. Bethlehem Corp., \n308 \nU.S. 165, 171\n, 60 S.Ct. 153, 156, 128 A.L.R. 1437. It is a conception which has been acted upon by state legislatures. For jurisdictional purposes federal courts have been assimilated to the courts of the States in which they may sit. When we are dealing with jurisdictional matters, legislation should be interpreted in the light of such professional history. Even if an ambiguity could be squeezed out of a grant of jurisdiction which applies so aptly to a federal court in Oklahoma as to an Oklahoma state court-'suits shall be brought in the court having jurisdiction thereof'- neither logic nor history nor reason counsels an interpretation that attributes to the State hostility against a suit in a federal court on an exclusively federal right as to which the last say in any event belongs to a federal court. 3 \n\n[322 \nU.S. 47, 62]\n\u00a0\n In the past, even when the jurisdictional grant has been couched in language giving substantial ground for the argument of restriction of jurisdiction to the state court, this Court has not found denial by a State of the right to go to a federal court within that State when it in fact opened the door of its own courts. Thus, in Madisonville Traction Company v. Mining Company, supra, a Kentucky statute required, among other things, appointment of commissioners in a condemnation proceeding by the county court, examination of the report at its first regular term, issuance of orders in conformity with the Kentucky Civil Code of Practice and allowance of appeals from the county courts. And yet this Court held, as a matter of construction, that it was 'not to be implied from the statute in question that the state intended to exclude ... the Federal courts'. 196 U.S. at page 256, 25 S.Ct. at page 258. The Section now under consideration is only one of several statutory provisions for challenging like tax assessments in courts. In all the other provisions, the jurisdiction is explicitly given only to state courts. See e.g.,  12651, 12660, 12661. If in  12665 Oklahoma has seen fit to allow suits to be brought 'in the court having jurisdiction thereof', which as a matter of federal jurisdictional law certainly includes the federal court in Oklahoma, and has not seen fit to designate the state courts for such jurisdiction, why should this Court interpolate a restriction which the Oklahoma Legislature has omitted? The fact that the Legislature has also provided that such suits 'shall have precedence' is no more embarrassment to federal jurisdiction than to state jurisdiction. That is merely an admonition to courts of the importance of disposing of litigation affecting revenue with all convenient dispatch. Nor is there any other provision of the Statute giving this right of action that remotely requires a procedure to be followed or relief to be given peculiar to state courts or different from established procedure and relief in the fed- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 47, 63]\n\u00a0\n eral courts. Only on the assumption that federal courts are alien courts is there anything in  12665 that is not as suited to a proceeding in a federal court as it is to one in a state court.\n The situation thus presented by the Oklahoma lesiglation is very different from that which was here in Chandler v. Dix, \n194 \nU.S. 590\n, 24 S. Ct. 766. There a suit was brought against state officials to remove a cloud on title to lands claimed by the State. The relief that was sought and the procedure for pursuing it plainly indicated 'that the legislature had in mind only proceedings in the courts of the state. A copy of the complaint is to be served upon the prosecuting attorney, who is to send a copy therefo within five days to the auditor general, and this is to be in lieu of service of process. It then is left to the discretion of the auditor general to cause the attorney general to represent him, and it is provided that in such suits no costs shall be taxed. These provisions with regard to procedure and costs show that the statute is dealing with a matter supposed to remain under state control . ... (The) statute does not warrant the beginning of a suit in the Federal court to set aside the title of the state.' 194 U.S. at pages 591, 592, 24 S.Ct. at page 766. The marked difference between the Michigan Statute and this Oklahoma Statute is further evidenced by the fact that  12665 gives an action to recover not merely illegal state taxes but also taxes of the 'county or subdivision of the county' that have been illegally collected. But counties or their sub-divisions do not enjoy immunity from suit. Lincoln County v. Luning, \n133 \nU.S. 529\n, 10 S.Ct. 363; Port of Seattle v. Oregon & W.R.R., \n255 \nU.S. 56, 71\n, 41 S.Ct. 237, 242. If the other jurisdictional requirements are present, they can be sued in a federal court without the leave of Oklahoma. It is not, I submit, a rational way to construe the Oklahoma Statute, dealing with a particular type of illegal exaction raising the same kind of issue and involving the same procedure, \n\n[322 \nU.S. 47, 64]\n\u00a0\n so as to recognize jurisdiction of federal courts over suits against the county and its sub-division but to find a purpose to exclude suits as to illegal state exactions.\n I have proceeded on the assumption that the action below was under  12665, and as such an action against the State. But the suit was not brought under  12665. It was brought as an ordinary common law action for the recovery of money against an officer acting under an unconstitutional statute. The defendant answered the suit, but did not claim the State's immunity from suit and the court's resulting lack of jurisdiction. What is even more significant is that he did allege lack of jurisdiction on another ground not now relevant. In a word, the defendant did not claim, on behalf of the State, the immunity which this Court now affords him. He did not even make this claim at the pre-trial conference and the claim did not emerge as one of the issues defined by the pre-trial conference under Rule 16. In disposing of the case, the Judge interpreted the action as having been brought under  12665, although the pleadings gave no warrant for such conclusion, and on such interpretation, he found that the defendant could claim and had not waived Oklahoma's immunity. Evidently, however, the District Court was not content with its own finding of want of 'jurisdiction' for it proceeded to dispose of the constitutional issues on their merits. I think that the claim of the state's immunity was not in the case under Illinois Central Railroad Co. v. Adams, \n180 \nU.S. 28\n, 21 S. Ct. 251, which held that in a suit nominally against an individual sovereign immunity is a defense that must be raised by appropriate pleading. Doubtless for this reason, the jurisdictional question on which the case is now made to turn was not even discussed by the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n That court, I believe, properly passed on the constitutional merits, but since the case here goes off on jurisdiction, I intimate no views upon them. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] '12665. Payment Under Protest Where Relief by Appeal Not Provided- Action to Recover.\n'In all cases where the illegality of the tax is alleged to arise by reason of some action from which the laws provide no appeal, the aggrieved person shall pay the full amount of the taxes at the time and in the manner provided by law, and shall give notice to the officer collecting the taxes showing the grounds of complaint and that suit will be brought against the officer for recovery of them. It shall be the duty of such collecting officer to hold such taxes separate and apart from all other taxes collected by him, for a period of thirty days and if within such time summons shall be served upon such officer in a suit for recovery of such taxes, the officer shall further hold such taxes until the final determination of such suit. All such suits shall be brought in the court having jurisdiction thereof, and they shall have precedence therein; if, upon final determination of any such suit, the court shall determine that the taxes were illegally collected, as not being due the state, county or subdivision of the county, the court shall render judgment showing the correct and legal amount of taxes due by such person, and shall issue such order in accordance with the court's findings, and if such order shows that the taxes so paid are in excess of the legal and correct amount due, the collecting officer shall pay to such person the excess and shall take his receipt therefor.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] There is here no want of jurisdiction of the parties or subject matter. We are not passing upon a certification of an issue as to jurisdiction such as arose under the Act of March 3, 1891,  5, 26 Stat. 827, in Illinois Central Railroad Co. v. Adams, \n180 \nU.S. 28, 37\n, 21 S.Ct. 251, 254. If this is a suit against the state, a failure to show the state's consent to be sued in the face of this answer would be fatal. Cf.

See Brown, A Dissenting Opinion of Mr. Justice Story (1940) 26 Va.L.Rev. 759. Again, in view of the complicated administrative problems raised by the invalidation of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, 7 U.S.C.A.  601 et seq., Congress devised a special scheme for the recovery of the illegal exactions made under the Act. 49 Stat. 1747, 7 U.S.C.  644 et seq., 7 U.S.C.A.  644 et seq.; Anniston Mfg.

Doubtless this statement of Dicey's, Law of the Constitution, 8th Ed. at page 189, 9th Ed. at page 193, was an idealization of actuality. But in the perspective of our time its validity as an ideal has gained and not lost. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Of course the State can at any time withdraw its consent to be sued. See Beers v.

It was alleged that in time of war they published and disseminated three pamphlets to numerous persons and organizations, among whom were individuals available and eligible for recruitment and enlistment in the military and naval forces of the United States as well as individuals already members of the armed forces. Counts 1, 3 and 5 charged that by these actions they willfully obstructed the recruiting and enlistment service of the United States in violation of the third clause of Section 3. Counts 2, 4 and 6 charged that these activities constituted a willful attempt to cause insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny and refusal \n\n[322 \nU.S. 680, 682]\n\u00a0\n of duty in the military and naval forces of the United States in violation of the second clause of Section 3.

The importance of the issues involved led us to grant certiorari. \n320 \nU.S. 734\n, 64 S.Ct. 437.\n Petitioner, an American citizen, was born 52 years ago in Pennsylvania. His ancestors, of Scotch, Irish and German descent, came to this country over 120 years ago. He enlisted in the armed forces in 1917 and served overseas. After his honorable discharge in 1919, he was employed in the city health department at Akron, Ohio, while earning a degree in science at Akron University. He then took courses in economics and political economy at the University of Chicago and became a financial analyst and statistician for various banks, investment brokers and investment companies in Chicago. After 1938 he was employed as an auditor and statistician, first by the state of Illinois and then by the federal government in corporations in Detroit and Chicago producing material for the United States Army Air Corps. During all this time he had constantly engaged in economic research on his own behalf and several articles by him were \n\n[322 \nU.S. 680, 683]\n\u00a0\n published in reputable business and financial periodicals. There was no evidence of his having been associated in any way with any foreign or subversive organization.\n Prior to the entry of the United States into the present war, petitioner wrote several short articles containing scurrilous and vitriolic attacks on the English, the Jews and the President of the United States. Americans were urged not to ally themselves with the English. Only a German victory, it was said, would bring 'increased stability and safety for the West.' Petitioner had certain of these articles mimeographed by various individuals in Chicago, including one Elmer Soller, who was later indicted as a co-defendant with petitioner. Several hundred copies of the mimeographed articles were mailed by petitioner to individuals and organizations appearing on his mailing list.\n Petitioner then wrote three articles in 1942 which formed the basis for his conviction under the Espionage Act of 1917. These articles repeated the same themes and were marked by the same calumny and invective; they are set out at length in the opinion of the court below, 138 F.2d at pages 170-172, and need not be repeated here. In substance, they depict the war as a gross betrayal of America, denounce our English allies and the Jews and assail in reckless terms the integrity and patriotism of the President of the United States. They call for an abandonment of our allies and a conversion of the war into a racial conflict. They further urge an 'internal war of race against race' and 'occupation (of America) by foreign troops until we are able to stand alone.'\n After writing these articles, petitioner had them mimeographed by his co-defendant Soller and mailed about six hundred copies of them, anonymously, to persons and organizations on his mailing list. In order to avoid detection, he deposited the envelopes in several different mail \n\n[322 \nU.S. 680, 684]\n\u00a0\n boxes and endeavored to leave no finger-prints. \n4\n He had compiled this mailing list from several sources: (1) The World Almanac, which gave him the names of various prominent people, associations, fraternities, sororities, etc.; (2) a government publication containing a list of labor unions; (3) daily newspapers which mentioned the names of people actively engaged in the America First Committee; and (4) telephone directories at the public library which gave him the names of various state and district commanders of the American Legion. Included in his list were such persons as United States senators, representatives, bishops and other church officials; such organizations as the Daughters of the American Revolution and We the Mothers Mobilize were also included.\n The Government proved that two of these pamphlets were mailed to and read by the Commanding General of the United States Army Air Forces and a colonel attached to the General Staff. All three pamphlets were mailed to the United States Infantry Association, which publishes the Infantry Journal, a service publication, and were read at its headquarters by two Army officers in the course of their duties. The evidence also showed that \n\n[322 \nU.S. 680, 685]\n\u00a0\n one or more of the pamphlets were received in the mail by the president of Northwestern University, the American Newspaper Publishers Association, the Kiwanis International, the Lions International, the Air Line Pilots Association and the American Legion, Department of Illinois. Individuals registered under the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 and employed by these various organizations read the pamphlets in the ordinary course of their work, including one 20-year old clerk whose duty it was to open the incoming mail at the office of the Lions International. In addition, envelopes addressed to at least eighteen high ranking Army officers were found secreted under a bathtub in petitioner's home, together with several of the pamphlets.\n Shortly after being taken into custody, petitioner signed a statement in which he claimed that 'the prime motive which impelled me in writing and distributing the articles discussed above, was the hope that they might tend to create sentiment against war amongst the white races and in diverting the war from them, to unite the white races against what I consider to be the more dangerous enemies, the yellow races.' At the trial he testified that 'I thought there was a trend toward Communism, and I thought it was quite a dangerous position because of warfare between the white races, it would be the cause of war between the white and yellow races, and rather than have it beat into us, we might as well face the facts and know what we are facing, a certain group of Communists discussing methods, their viewpoints. I wanted to help minimize that so we could again have public standpoint established in this country.' He said he thought his articles might improve the morale of persons available and eligible for recruiting and enlistment in the armed forces, though he retracted this statement on cross-examination. His efforts, he thought, 'were political in character' and 'the effect on the troops of saying that America was betrayed would be \n\n[322 \nU.S. 680, 686]\n\u00a0\n for them to consider whether it was or not and if so, to fight for Americans.'\n On the basis of these facts, petitioner was found guilty of violating the second and third clauses of Section 3 of the Act. These clauses are directed at those who, in time of war, 'willfully cause or attempt to cause insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny, or refusal of duty, in the military or naval forces of the United States,' or who, in time of war, 'willfully obstruct the recruiting or enlistment service of the United States, to the injury of the service of the United States.' Thus these clauses punish the making and dissemination of statements and writings which are intended to have the evil effects set forth by Congress. No question is here raised as to the constitutionality of these provisions or as to the sufficiency of the indictment returned thereunder. But such legislation, being penal in nature and restricting the right to speak and write freely, must be construed narrowly and 'must be taken to use its words in a strict and accurate sense.' Mr. Justice Holmes, dissenting in Abrams v. United States, \n250 \nU.S. 616\n at page 627, 40 S.Ct. 17, at page 21\n\n\n The language of the second and third clauses of Section 3 makes clear that two major elements are necessary to constitute an offense under these clauses. The first element is a subjective one, consisting of a specific intent or evil purpose at the time of the alleged overt acts to cause insubordination or disloyalty in the armed forces or to obstruct the recruiting and enlistment service. This requirement of a specific intent springs from the statutory use of the word 'willfully.' That word, when viewed in the context of a highly penal statute restricting freedom of expression, must be taken to mean deliberately and with a specific purpose to do the acts proscribed by Congress. Cf. United States v. Murdock, \n290 \nU.S. 389\n at page 394, 54 S.Ct. 223, at page 225; United States v. Illinois Cent. R. Co., \n303 \nU.S. 239\n, at page 242, 58 S.Ct. 533, at page 534; Browder v. United States, \n312 \nU.S. 335\n at page 341, 61 S.Ct. 599, at page 602; \n\n[322 \nU.S. 680, 687]\n\u00a0\n Spies v. United States, \n317 \nU.S. 492\n at page 497, 63 S.Ct. 364, at page 367. The second element is an objective one, consisting of a clear and present danger that the activities in question will bring about the substantive evils which Congress has a right to prevent. Schenck v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 47\n, 39 S.Ct. 247. Both elements must be proved by the Government beyond a reasonable doubt.\n The requisite specific intent in such a case as this may be proved not only by the language actually used in the statements or writings themselves but also by the circumstances surrounding their preparation and dissemination. But, so far as the record in this case is concerned, neither of these sources is productive of evidence from which a jury could properly find beyond a reasonable doubt that petitioner had such an intent at the time he composed and mailed the three pamphlets. For that reason alone the conviction must be reversed.\n There is nothing on the face of the three pamphlets in question to indicate that petitioner intended specifically to cause insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny or refusal of duty in the military forces or to obstruct the recruiting and enlistment service. No direct or affirmative appeals are made to that effect and no mention is made of military personnel or of persons registered under the Selective Training and Service Act. They contain, instead, vicious and unreasoning attacks on one of our military allies, flagrant appeals to false and sinister racial theories and gross libels of the President. Few ideas are more odious to the majority of the American people or more destructive of national unity in time of war. But while such iniquitous doctrines may be used under certain circumstances as vehicles for the purposeful undermining of the morale and loyalty of the armed forces and those persons of draft age, they cannot by themselves be taken as proof beyond a reasonable doubt that petitioner had the narrow intent requisite to a violation of this statute. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 680, 688]\n\u00a0\n Nor do the circumstances of the distribution of the three pamphlets, supplemented by petitioner's pretrial statement, his testimony and the similar articles written and disseminated by him before the war, supply sufficient evidence of the necessary intent. There was no evidence that petitioner intended to influence military personnel or individuals of draft age in the manner forbidden by the statute in composing his mailing list or in sending his pamphlets to those listed therein. His purpose, rather, appears to have been to obtain the names of prominent individuals and organizations and to propagate his ideas among them. The fact that some of these individuals and some of the representatives of these organizations were of draft age was not shown to have been dominant, or even present, in petitioner's mind or to have motivated him in any degree. And the fact that he mailed his pamphlets to at least four high ranking Army officers and addressed envelopes to at least eighteen others is not evidence from which the jury could infer beyond a reasonable doubt that he intended to cause insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny or refusal of duty among them. Their inclusion in a mailing list of six hundred persons and organizations is quite consistent with a mere intent to influence public opinion and to circulate malicious political propaganda among outstanding personages, whether they be in the armed forces or not.\n His prewar writings, if they should be taken into account at all, are no more indicative of the necessary intent than are the three pamphlets in issue. His statements and testimony concerning his motive in preparing and distributing the three pamphlets are likewise indecisive. Proof that he intended, in his words, to 'create sentiment against war amongst the white races' and to 'unite the white races against what I consider to be the more dangerous enemies, the yellow races' does not satisfy the burden which rests on the Government to prove beyond a \n\n[322 \nU.S. 680, 689]\n\u00a0\n reasonable doubt that petitioner had the purpose or intent to do what is outlawed by Section 3 of this Act. Thoughtlessness, carelessness and even recklessness are not substitutes for the more specific state of mind which the statute makes an essential ingredient of the crime.\n We are not unmindful of the fact that the United States is now engaged in a total war for national survival and that total war of the modern variety cannot be won by a doubtful, disunited nation in which any appreciable sector is disloyal. For that reason our enemies have developed psychological warfare to a high degree in an effort to cause unrest and disloyalty. Much of this type of warfare takes the form of insidious propaganda in the manner and tenor displayed by petitioner's three pamphlets. Crude appeals to overthrow the government or to discard our arms in open mutiny are seldom made. Emphasis is laid, rather, on such matters as the futility of our war aims, the vices of our allies and the inadequacy of our leadership. But the mere fact that such ideas are enunciated by a citizen is not enough by itself to warrant a finding of a criminal intent to violate Section 3 of the Espionage Act. Unless there is sufficient evidence from which a jury could infer beyond a reasonable doubt that he intended to bring about the specific consequences prohibited by the Act, an American citizen has the right to discuss these matters either by temperate reasoning or by immoderate and vicious invective without running afoul of the Espionage Act of 1917. Such evidence was not present in this case.\n The judgment of the court below is\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS.\n Without discussing the evidence in detail or characterizing the petitioner's conduct, I deem it sufficient to say that I concur in the view that there was not sufficient evi- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 680, 690]\n\u00a0\n dence in the case to warrant submission to the jury. The conviction of violation of the statute should, therefore, be reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice REED, with whom Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER, Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice JACKSON concur, dissenting.\n The First Amendment to the Constitution preserves freedom of speech and of the press in war as well as in peace. The right to criticize the Government and the handling of the war is not questioned. Congress has not sought, directly or indirectly, to abridge the right of anyone to present his views on the conduct of the war or the making of the peace. The legislation under which Hartzel was tried and convicted was aimed at those who, in time of war, 'shall willfully cause or attempt to cause insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny or refusal of duty, in the military or naval forces of the United States.' It is only when the requisite intent to produce those results is present that criticism may cross over the line of prohibited conduct. The constitutional power of Congress so to protect the national interest is beyond question. Schenck v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 47\n, 39 S.Ct. 247.\n If the petitioner committed acts from which a properly instructed jury could reasonably conclude that the requisite intention existed to cause the evils against which the statute is directed, the sentence was proper. As the verdict was general, we need only to examine the proceedings under the count of the indictment which charged violation of the law in the words quoted in the preceding paragraph. Hirabayashi v. United States, \n320 \nU.S. 81, 105\n, 63 S.Ct. 1375, 1387.\n Petitioner urges that these articles, which contain on their face no explicit call upon the military to disobey orders, act in a disloyal manner, mutiny or disregard their duty, cannot be a violation of the statute because they offer no proof of the necessary intent and none is offered \n\n[322 \nU.S. 680, 691]\n\u00a0\n outside of the papers themselves. We think that this argument fails. Congress has made it an offense willfully to attempt to cause insubordination and likewise willfully to obstruct the recruiting and enlistment service of the Nation. It does not commend itself to us to hold that thereby Congress was merely concerned with crude attempts to undermine the war effort but gave free play to less obvious and more skillful ways of bringing about the same mischievous results. Papers or speeches may contain incitements for the military to be insubordinate or to mutiny without a specific call upon the armed forces so to act. If circulated for the purpose of undermining military discipline, scurrilous articles, attacking an ally, a minority of our citizens and the President, may contain, without words of solicitation, indications of purpose sufficient, if accepted as true, from which to draw an intent to accomplish the unlawful results.\n Moreover, when the other evidence is added to the articles themselves, we think that enough facts revealing the requisite intent were presented to justify the verdict. Other similar articles circulated prior to the declaration of war tended to show a continuing intention. The articles which were the basis of the indictment were sent to military officers including those of the highest rank. This circumstance is brought forward by petitioner as indicative of a lack of intention to undermine the military forces. This was doubtless weighed by the jury, but certainly it cannot be said that circulation of propaganda among officers shows less intention to proselyte than to circulate among the enlisted personnel. Copies were sent to the Infantry Journal, a publication circulating largely in the armed forces. Nothing appears as to any motive, other than interference with discipline, that the petitioner might have in distributing this type of pamphlet to professional military officers. The jury was entitled to weigh the fact that the articles were sent anonymously. The \n\n[322 \nU.S. 680, 692]\n\u00a0\n jury was also entitled to weigh the fact that those to whom the articles were sent were hand-picked and composed a select group. These actions speak as loud as words.\n Hartzel himself, moreover, made a statement which was introduced at the trial. In it he told of the preparation of the pamphlets, the selection of the mailing list from among prominent personages and associations and his reason for his acts. His intent appears in these words:\n'Finally, the prime motive which impelled me in writing and distributing the articles discussed above, was the hope that they might tend to create sentiment against war amongst the white races and in diverting the war from them, to unite the white races against what I consider to be the more dangerous enemies, the yellow races.'\n\n The jury might well infer from the quoted paragraph that Hartzel, by placing these pamphlets in military hands, was attempting to cause insubordination among the troops. He sought to develop sentiment 'against war among the white races.' Germans are a 'white race.'\n These pamphlets were distributed in 1942. The military situation was then nothing like so strong as now nor confidence in our strategy so uniform. A large segment of public opinion desired to concentrate against Japan, rather than Germany and Italy, a viewpoint which doubtless had advocates among the members of the armed forces. It was an opportune time from the viewpoint of the German enemy to put pamphlets such as these in circulation which taught suspicion of Britain, vilified Jews and promoted lack of confidence in the President. On the question of intention, the circumstances under which the pamphlets were distributed were important and entitled to weight. Petitioner played precisely upon those prejudices from which at that time insubordination or disloyalty was most likely to develop.\n We are not a jury passing on Hartzel's state of mind. Our sole and very limited duty is to decide whether there \n\n[322 \nU.S. 680, 693]\n\u00a0\n was evidence enough warranting the trial judge letting the case go to the jury, whether 12 jurymen had warrant for their finding that Hartzel's very purpose was to undermine the will of our soldiers to fight our Nazi enemy, and whether the Circuit Court of Appeals was warranted in sustaining such a finding. We are at a loss to know what other intent is to be attributed to the dissemination of these documents to our soldiery. To adapt the language of Mr. Justice Holmes speaking for a unanimous Court in Schenck v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 47, 51\n, 39 S.Ct. 247, of course the documents would not have been sent unless they had been intended to have some effect, and we do not see what effect they could be expected to have upon persons in the military service except to influence them to obstruct the carrying on of the war against Germany when petitioner deemed that a betrayal of our country.\n As the trial judge aptly stated:\n'All of the circumstances of the case, it seems to me, the very language of the pamphlets composed and distributed by Hartzell show such intent. For what purpose other than hindering the carrying on of the war in any way did he have or could he have had in mind? He appeared on the stand to be an unusually shrewd person. The story he tells of his education and his activities indicate that whatever he does is deliberate and with a definite purpose. He is not a fanatic attached to a cause, having political and economic theories for the liberation of oppressed peoples as were the defendants in Pierce v. United States, \n252 \nU.S. 239\n, 40 S.Ct. 205, and Abrams v. United States, \n250 \nU.S. 616\n, 40 S.Ct. 17, where Justices Holmes and Brandeis in dissenting opinions found that the literature distributed by the defendants had as its purpose propagating certain economic ideas rather than interfering with enlistment or recruiting or insubordination or disloyalty to the army. In this case the jury were warranted in presuming from the preparation and circulation of the literature that Hartzell intended \n\n[322 \nU.S. 680, 694]\n\u00a0\n to obstruct enlistment and recruiting and to cause insubordination and disloyalty in the military service of the United States.'\n\n On these facts we would intrude on the historic function of the jury in criminal trials to say that the requisite intent 'to cause insubordination, disloyalty, or refusal of duty, in the military or naval forces' was lacking. The right of free speech is vital. But the necessity of finding beyond a reasonable doubt the intent to produce the prohibited result affords abundant protection to those whose criticism is directed to legitimate ends. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Espionage Act of June 15, 1917, c. 30, 40 Stat. 217, 50 U.S.C.  31 et seq., 50 U.S.C.A.  31 et seq. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The second and third clauses of Section 3 of the Act provide as follows: 'Whoever, when the United States is at war, ... shall willfully cause or attempt to cause insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny, or refusal of duty, in the military or naval forces of the United States, or shall willfully obstruct the recruiting or enlistment service of the United States, to the injury of the service of the United States, shall be punished by a fine of not more than $10,000 or imprisonment for not more than twenty years, or both.' 40 Stat. 217, 219, 41 Stat. 1359, 50 U.S.C.  33, 50 U.S.C.A.  33. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Petitioner's co-defendants-Mecartney, an attorney, and Soller, the mimeographer-were found guilty on counts 5, 6 and 7. But the trial judge set aside Mecartney's conviction on a motion for a new trial on the ground that there was no evidence that he had any active part in the distribution of the pamphlets produced by petitioner. Soller's conviction was set aside by the court below on the ground that there was no proof that he knew what use petitioner made of the pamphlets. Mecartney and Soller were the only co-conspirators of petitioner named in the indictment and the setting aside of their convictions makes it impossible to sustain petitioner's conviction upon the basis of count 7, the conspiracy count. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Petitioner testified that 'I sent the documents out anonymously because I almost lost my job several times and I knew I had to be careful and also because of a great deal of espionage in the community. I did not sign my name to the documents I sent out for the same reason. ... I took them out and dropped them in several boxes. I did that because with such a large quantity of them, I thought someone might throw them out. I mailed them all at once, but I dropped one hundred in one box and another hundred in each of four or five boxes. I didn't put them all in one box simply because, if someone would throw one out they would throw them all out. I had a suspicion that someone in authority might well find these articles and throw them out for the reasons I gave you. I had heard that fingerprints would be identified so I put my hand over it like that ( indicating). I was suspicious of it for the same reasons I gave you.' There was no evidence contradicting any of this testimony. \n\n\n\n\n","52":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHAZEL-ATLAS GLASS CO. v. HARTFORD-EMPIRE CO.(1944)\nNo. 398\nArgued: Decided: May 15, 1944\n\n\n\n\n[322 \nU.S. 238, 239]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Stephen H. Philbin, of Boston, Mass., for petitioner.\n Mr. Francis W. Cole, of Hartford, Conn., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case involves the power of a Circuit Court of Appeals, upon proof that fraud was perpetrated on it by a successful litigant, to vacate its own judgment entered at a prior term and direct vacation of a District Court's decree entered pursuant to the Circuit Court of Appeals' mandate.\n Hazel-Atlas commenced the present suit in November, 1941, by filing in the Third Circuit Court of Appeals a petition for leave to file a bill of review in the District Court to set aside a judgment entered by that Court against Hazel in 1932 pursuant to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals' mandate. Hazel contended that the Circuit Court of Appeals' judgment had been obtained by fraud and supported this charge with affidavits and exhibits. Hartford-Empire, in whose favor the challenged judgment had been entered, did not question the appellate court's power to consider the petition, but filed counter affidavits and exhibits. After a hearing the Circuit Court concluded that, since the alleged fraud had been practiced on it rather than the District Court, it would pass on the \n\n[322 \nU.S. 238, 240]\n\u00a0\n issues of fraud itself instead of sending the case to the District Court. An order was thereupon entered denying the petition as framed but granting Hazel leave to amend the prayer of the petition to ask that the Circuit Court itself hear and determine the issue of fraud. Hazel accordingly amended, praying that the 1932 judgments against it be vacated and for such other relief as might be just. Hartford then replied and filed additional exhibits and affidavits. The following facts were shown by the record without dispute.\n In 1926 Hartford had pending an application for a patent on a machine which utilized a method of pouring glass into molds known as 'gob feeding.' The application, according to the Circuit Court, 'was confronted with apparently insurmountable Patent Office opposition.' To help along the application, certain officials and attorneys of Hartford determined to have published in a trade journal an article signed by an ostensibly disinterested expert which would describe the 'gob feeding' device as a remarkable advance in the art of fashioning glass by machine. Accordingly these officials prepared an article entitled 'Introduction of Automatic Glass Working Machinery; How Received by Organized Labor', which referred to 'gob feeding' as one of the two 'revolutionary devices' with which workmen skilled in bottle-blowing had been confronted since they had organized. After unsuccessfully attempting to persuade the President of the Bottle Blowers' Association to sign this article, the Hartford officials, together with other persons called to their aid, procured the signature of one William P. Clarke, widely known as National President of the Flint Glass Workers' Union. Subsequently, in July 1926, the article was published in the National Glass Budget, and in October 1926 it was introduced as part of the record in support of the pending application in the Patent Office. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 238, 241]\n\u00a0\n January 38 1928, the Patent Office granted the application as Patent No. 1, 655,391.\n On June 6, 1928, Hartford brought suit in the District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania charging that Hazel was infringing this 'gob feeding' patent, and praying for an injunction against further infringement and for an accounting for profits and damages. Without referring to the Clarke article, which was in the record only as part of the 'file-wrapper' history, and which apparently was not then emphasized by counsel, the District Court dismissed the bill on the ground that no infringement had been proved. D.C., 39 F.2d 111. Hartford appealed. In their brief filed with the Circuit Court of Appeals, the attorneys for Hartford, one of whom had played a part in getting the spurious article prepared for publication, directed the Court's attention to 'The article by Mr. William Clarke, former President of the Glass Workers' Union.' The reference was not without effect. Quoting copiously from the article to show that 'labor organizations of practical workmen recognized' the 'new and differentiating elements' of the 'gob feeding' patent owned by Hartford, the Circuit Court on May 5, 1932, held the patent valid and infringed, reversed the District Court's judgment, and directed that court to enter a decree accordingly. 3 Cir., 59 F.2d 399, 403, 404.\n At the time of the trial in the District Court in 1929, where the article seemingly played no important part, the attorneys of Hazel received information that both Clarke and one of Hartford's lawyers had several years previously admitted that the Hartford lawyer was the true author of the spurious publication. Hazel's attorneys did not at that time attempt to verify the truth of the hearsay story of the article's authorship, but relied upon other defenses which proved successful. After the opinion of the Circuit Court came down on May 5, 1932, quoting the spurious \n\n[322 \nU.S. 238, 242]\n\u00a0\n article and reversing the decree of the District Court, Hazel hired investigators for the purpose of verifying the hearsay by admissible evidence. One of these investigators interviewed Clarke in Toledo, Ohio, on May 13 and again on May 24. In each interview Clarke insisted that he wrote the article and would so swear if summoned. In the second interview the investigator asked Clarke to sign a statement telling in detail how the article was prepared, and further asked to see Clarke's files. Clarke replied that he would not 'stultify' himself by signing any 'statement or affidavit'; and that he would show the records to no one unless compelled by a subpoena. At the same time he reinforced his claim of authorship by asserting that he had spent seven weeks in preparing the article.\n But unknown to Hazel's investigator, a representative of Hartford, secretly informed of the investigator's view that Hazel's only chance of reopening the case 'was to get an affidavit from someone, to the effect that this article was written' by Hartford's attorney, also had traveled to Toledo. Hartford's representative first went to Toledo and talked to Clarke on May 10, three days before Hazel's investigator first interviewed Clarke; and he returned to Toledo again on May 22 for a five day stay. Thus at the time of the investigator's second interview with Clarke on May 24, representatives of both companies were in touch with Clarke in Toledo. But though Hartford's representative knew the investigator was there, the latter was unaware of the presence of the Hartford representative. On May 24, Hazel's investigator reported failure; the same day, Hartford's man reported 'very successful results.' Four days later, on May 28, Hartford's representative reported his 'success' more fully. Clarke, he said, had been of 'great assistance' and Hartford was in a 'most satisfactory position'; it did not 'seem wise to distribute copies of all the papers' the representative then had or \n\n[322 \nU.S. 238, 243]\n\u00a0\n to 'go into much detail in correspondence'; and Hartford was 'quite indebted to Mr. Clarke' who 'might easily have caused us a lot of trouble. This should not be forgotten ....' Among the 'papers' which the representative had procured from Clarke was an affidavit signed by Clarke stating that he, Clarke, had 'signed the article and released it for publication.' The affidavit was dated May 24-the very day that Clarke had told Hazel's investigator he would not 'stultify' himself by signing any affidavit and would produce his papers for no one except upon subpoena.\n Shortly afterward, Hazel capitulated. It paid Hartford $1,000,000 and entered into certain licensing agreements. The day following the settlement, Hartford's representative traveled back to Toledo and talked to Clarke. At this meeting Clarke asked for $10,000. Hartford's representative told him that he wanted too much money and that Hartford would communicate with him further. A few days later the representative paid Clarke $500 in cash; and about a month later delivered to Clarke, at some place in Pittsburgh which he has sworn he cannot remember, an additional $7,500 in cash. The reason given for paying these sums was that Hartford felt a certain moral obligation to do so, although Hartford's affidavits deny any prior agreement to pay Clarke for his services in connection with the article.\n Indisputable proof of the foregoing facts was, for the first time, fully brought to light in 1941 by correspondence files, expense accounts and testimony introduced at the trial of the United States v. Hartford- Empire Company et al., D.C., 46 F.Supp. 541, an anti-trust prosecution begun December 11, 1939. On the basis of the disclosures at this trial Hazel commenced the present suit.\n Upon consideration of what it properly termed this 'sordid story' the Circuit Court, one Judge dissenting, held first, that the fraud was not newly-discovered; sec- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 238, 244]\n\u00a0\n ond, that the spurious publication, though quoted in the 1932 opinion, was not the primary basis of the 1932 decision; and third, that in any event it lacked the power to set aside the decree of the District Court because of the expiration of the term during which the 1932 decision had been rendered. Accordingly the Court refused to grant the relief prayed by Hazel.\n Federal courts, both trial and appellate, long ago established the general rule that they would not alter or set aside their judgments after the expiration of the term at which the judgments were finally entered.

This salutary general rule springs from the belief that in most instances society is best served by putting an end to litigation after a case has been tried and judgment entered. This has not meant, however, that a judgment finally entered has ever been regarded as completely immune from impeachment after the term. From the beginning there has existed along side the term rule a rule of equity to the effect that under certain circumstances, one of which is after-discovered fraud, relief will be granted against judgments regardless of the term of their entry. Marine Insurance Company v. Hodgson, 7 Cranch 332; Marshall v. Holmes, \n141 \nU.S. 589\n, 12 S.Ct. 62. This equity rule, which was firmly established in English practice long before the foundation of our Republic, the courts have developed and fashioned to fulfill a universally recognized need for correcting injustices which, in certain instances, are deemed sufficiently gross to demand a departure from rigid adherence to the term rule. Out of deference to the deep rooted policy in favor of the repose of judgments entered during past terms, courts of equity have been cautious in exercising their power over such judgments. United States v. Throckmorton, \n98 \nU.S. 61\n. But where the occasion has demanded, where enforcement of the judgment is 'mani- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 238, 245]\n\u00a0\n festly unconscionable', Pickford v. Talbott, \n225 \nU.S. 651, 657\n, 32 S.Ct. 687, 689, they have wielded the power without hesitation. \n1\n Litigants who have sought to invoke this equity power customarily have done so by bills of review or bills in the nature of bills of review, or by original proceedings to enjoin enforcement of a judgment. \n2\n And in cases where courts have exercised the power the relief granted has taken several forms: setting aside the judgment to permit a new trial, altering the terms of the judgment, or restraining the beneficiaries of the judgment from taking any benefit whatever from it. \n3\n But whatever form the relief has taken in particular cases, the net result in every case has been the same: where the situation has required the court has, in some manner, devitalized the judgment even though the term at which it was entered had long since passed away.\n Every element of the fraud here disclosed demands the exercise of the historic power of equity to set aside fraudulently begotten judgments. This is not simply a case of a judgment obtained with the aid of a witness who, on the basis of after-discovered evidence, is believed possibly to have been guilty of perjury. Here, even if we consider nothing but Hartford's sworn admissions, we find a deliberately planned and carefully executed scheme to defraud not only the Patent Office but the Circuit Court of Ap- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 238, 246]\n\u00a0\n peals. Cf. Marshall v. Holmes, supra. Proof of the scheme, and of its complete success up to date, is conclusive. Cf. United States v. Throckmorton, supra. And no equities have intervened through transfer of the fraudulently procured patent or judgment to an innocent purchaser. Cf. Ibid; Hopkins v. Hebard, \n235 \nU.S. 287\n, 35 S.Ct. 26.\n The Circuit Court did not hold that Hartford's fraud fell short of that which prompts equitable intervention, but thought Hazel had not exercised proper diligence in uncovering the fraud and that this should stand in the way of its obtaining relief. We cannot easily understand how, under the admitted facts, Hazel should have been expected to do more than it did to uncover the fraud. But even if Hazel did not exercise the highest degree of diligence Hartford's fraud cannot be condoned for that reason alone. This matter does not concern only private parties. There are issues of great moment to the public in a patent suit. The Mercoid Corporation v. Mid-Continent Investment Company, \n320 \nU.S. 661\n, 64 S.Ct. 268; Morton Salt Co. v. G. S. Suppiger Co., \n314 \nU.S. 488\n, 62 S.Ct. 402. Furthermore, tampering with the administration of justice in the manner indisputably shown here involves far more than an injury to a single litigant. It is a wrong against the institutions set up to protect and safeguard the public, institutions in which fraud cannot complacently be tolerated consistently with the good order of society. Surely it cannot be that preservation of the integrity of the judicial process must always wait upon the diligence of litigants. The public welfare demands that the agencies of public justice be not so impotent that they must always be mute and helpless victims of deception and fraud.\n The Circuit Court also rested denial of relief upon the conclusion that the Clarke article was not 'basic' to the Court's 1932 decision. Whether or not it was the primary basis for that ruling, the article did impress the Court, as \n\n[322 \nU.S. 238, 247]\n\u00a0\n shown by the Court's opinion. Doubtless it is wholly impossible accurately to appraise the influence that the article exerted on the judges. But we do not think the circumstances call for such an attempted appraisal. Hartford's officials and lawyers thought the article material. They conceived it in an effort to persuade a hostile Patent Office to grant their patent application, and went to considerable trouble and expense to get it published. Having lost their infringement suit based on the patent in the District Court wherein they did not specifically emphasize the article, they urged the article upon the Circuit Court and prevailed. They are in no position now to dispute its effectiveness. Neither should they now be permitted to escape the consequences of Hartford's deceptive attribution of authorship to Clarke on the ground that what the article stated was true. Truth needs no disguise. The article, even if true, should have stood or fallen under the only title it could honestly have been given-that of a brief in behalf of Hartford, prepared by Hartford's agents, attorneys, and collaborators.\n We have, then, a case in which undisputed evidence filed with the Circuit Court of Appeals in a bill of review proceeding reveals such fraud on that Court as demands, under settled equitable principles, the interposition of equity to devitalize the 1932 judgment despite the expiration of the term at which that judgment was finally entered. Did the Circuit Court have the power to set aside its own 1932 judgment and to direct the District Court likewise to vacate the 1932 decree which it entered pursuant to the mandate based upon the Circuit Court's judgment? Counsel for Hartford contend not. They concede that the District Court has the power upon proper proof of fraud to set aside its 1932 decree in a bill of review proceeding, but nevertheless deny that the Circuit Court possesses a similar power for the reason that the term during \n\n[322 \nU.S. 238, 248]\n\u00a0\n which its 1932 judgment was entered had expired. The question, then, is not whether relief can be granted, but which court can grant it.\n Equitable relief against fraudulent judgments is not of statutory creation. It is a judicially devised remedy fashioned to relieve hardships which, from time to time, arise from a hard and fast adherence to another court-made rule, the general rule that judgments should not be disturbed after the term of their entry has expired. Created to avert the evils of archaic rigidity, this equitable procedure has always been characterized by flexibility which enables it to meet new situations which demand equitable intervention, and to accord all the relief necessary to correct the particular injustices involved in these situations. It was this flexibility which enabled courts to meet the problem raised when leave to file a bill of review was sought in a court of original jurisdiction for the purpose of impeaching a judgment which had been acted upon by an appellate court. Such a judgment, it was said, was not subject to impeachment in such a proceeding because a trial court lacks the power to deviate from the mandate of an appellate court. The solution evolved by the courts is a procedure whereby permission to file the bill is sought in the appellate court. The hearing conducted by the appellate court on the petition, which may be filed many years after the entry of the challenged judgment, is not just a ceremonial gesture. The petition must contain the necessary averments, supported by affidavits or other acceptable evidence; and the appellate court may in the exercise of a proper discretion reject the petition, in which case a bill of review cannot be filed in the lower court. National Brake Co. v. Christensen, \n254 \nU.S. 425\n, 430-433, 41 S.Ct. 154, 156, 157.\n We think that when this Court, a century ago, approved this practice and held that federal appellate courts have the power to pass upon, and hence to grant or deny, peti- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 238, 249]\n\u00a0\n tions for bills of review even though the petitions be presented long after the term of the challenged judgment has expired, it settled the procedural question here involved. Southard v. Russell, 16 How. 547.4 To reason otherwise would be to say that although the Circuit Court has the power to act after the term finally to deny relief, it has not the power to act after the term finally to grant relief. It would, moreover, be to say that even in a case where the alleged fraud was on the Circuit Court itself, the relevant facts as to the fraud were agreed upon by the litigants, and the Circuit Court concluded relief must be granted, that Court nevertheless must send the case to the District Court for decision. Nothing in reason or precedent requires such a cumbersome and dilatory procedure. Indeed the whole history of equitable procedure, with the traditional flexibility which has enabled the courts to grant all the relief against judgments which the equities require, argues against it. We hold, therefore, that the Circuit Court on the record here presented5 had \n\n[322 \nU.S. 238, 250]\n\u00a0\n both the duty and the power to vacate its own judgment and to give the District Court appropriate directions.\n The question remains as to what disposition should be made of this case. Hartford's fraud, hidden for years but now admitted, had its genesis in the plan to publish an article for the deliberate purpose of deceiving the Patent Office. The plan was executed, and the article was put to fraudulent use in the Patent Office, contrary to law. U.S.C., Title 35,  69, 35 U.S.C.A.  69; United States v. American Bell Telephone Company, \n128 \nU.S. 315\n, 9 S.Ct. 90. From there the trail of fraud continued without break through the District Court and up to the Circuit Court of Appeals. Had the District Court learned of the fraud on the Patent Office at the original infringement trial, it would have been warranted in dismissing Hartford's case. In a patent case where the fraud certainly was not more flagrant than here, this Court said: 'Had the corruption of Clutter been disclosed at the trial ..., the court undoubtedly would have been warranted in holding it sufficient to require dismissal of the cause of action there alleged for the infringement of the Downie patent.' Keystone Co. v. General Excavator Co., \n290 \nU.S. 240, 246\n, 54 S.Ct. 146, 148; cf. Morton Salt Co. v. G. S. Suppiger Co., supra, 314 U.S. at pages 493, 494, 62 S.Ct. at pages 405, 406. So, also, could the Circuit Court of Appeals have dismissed the appeal had it been aware of Hartford's corrupt activities in suppressing the truth concerning the authorship of the article. The total effect of all this fraud, practiced both on the Patent Office and the courts, calls for nothing less than a complete denial of relief to Hartford for the claimed infringement of the patent thereby procured and enforced.\n Since the judgments of 1932 therefore must be vacated, the case now stands in the same position as though Hartford's corruption had been exposed at the original trial. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 238, 251]\n\u00a0\n In this situation the doctrine of the Keystone case, supra, requires that Hartford be denied relief.\n To grant full protection to the public against a patent obtained by fraud, that patent must be vacated. It has previously been decided that such a remedy is not available in infringement proceedings, but can only be accomplished in a direct proceeding brought by the government. United States v. American Bell Telephone Company, supra.\n The judgment is reversed with directions to set aside the 1932 judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals, recall the 1932 mandate, dismiss Hartford's appeal, and issue mandate to the District Court directing it to set aside its judgment entered pursuant to the Circuit Court of Appeals' mandate, to reinstate its original judgment denying relief to Hartford, and to take such additional action as may be necessary and appropriate.\n It is so ordered.\n Reversed with directions.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS.\n No fraud is more odious than an attempt to subvert the administration of justice. The court is unanimous in condemning the transaction disclosed by this record. Our problem is how best the wrong should be righted and the wrongdoers pursued. Respect for orderly methods of procedure is especially important in a case of this sort. In simple terms, the situation is this. Some twelve years ago a fraud perpetrated in the Patent Office was relied on by Hartford in the Circuit Court of Appeals. The court reversed a judgment in favor of Hazel, decided that Hartford was the holder of a valid patent which Hazel had infringed and, by its mandate, directed the District Court to enter a judgment in favor of Hartford. This was done and, on the strength of the judgment, Hartford and Hazel entered into an agreement of which more hereafter. So long as that judgment stands unmodified, the agreement of the parties will be unaffected by anything involved in the suit under discussion. Hazel concedely now \n\n[322 \nU.S. 238, 252]\n\u00a0\n desires to be in a position to disregard the agreement to its profit.\n The resources of the law are ample to undo the wrong and to pursue the wrongdoer and to do both effectively with due regard to the established modes of procedure. Ever since this fraud was exposed, the United States has had standing to seek nullification of Hartford's patent. 1 The Government filed a brief as amicus below and one in this court. It has elected not to proceed for cancellation of the patent. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n It is complained that members of the bar have knowingly participated in the fraud. Remedies are available to purge recreant officers from the tribunals on whom the fraud was practiced.\n Finally, as to the immediate aim of this proceeding, namely, to nullify the judgment if the fraud procured it, and if Hazel is equitably entitled to relief, an effective and orderly remedy is at hand. This is a suit in equity in the District Court to set aside or amend the judgment. Such a proceeding is required by settled federal law and would be tried, as it should be, in open court with living witnesses instead of through the unsatisfactory method of affidavits. We should not resort to a disorderly remedy, by disregarding the law as applied in federal courts ever since they were established, in order to reach one inequity at the risk of perpetrating another.\n In a suit brought by Hartford against Hazel in the Western District of Pennsylvania charging infringement of Hartford's patent No. 1,655,391, a decree was entered against Hartford March 31, 1930, on the ground that Hazel had not infringed. On appeal, the Circuit Court \n\n[322 \nU.S. 238, 253]\n\u00a0\n of Appeals filed an opinion, May 5, 1932, reversing the judgment of the District Court and holding the patent valid and infringed. On Hazel's application, the time for filing a petition for rehearing was extended five times. On July 21, 1932, Hazel entered into a general settlement and license agreement with Hartford respecting the patent in suit and other patents, which agreement was to be effective as of July 1, 1932. Hazel filed no petition for rehearing and, on July 30, 1932, the mandate of the Circuit Court of Appeals went to the District Court. Pursuant to the mandate, that court entered its final judgment against Hazel for an injunction and an accounting. No such accounting was ever had because Hazel and Hartford had settled their differences.\n November 19, 1941, Hazel presented to the Circuit Court of Appeals its petition for leave to file in the District Court a bill of review. Attached was the proposed bill. Affidavits were filed by Hazel and Hartford. The Circuit Court of Appeals heard the matter and made an order denying the petition for leave to file, holding that any fraud practiced had been practiced on the Circuit Court of Appeals and, therefore, that court should itself pass upon the question whether the mandate should be recalled and the case reopened. Leave was granted to Hazel to amend its petition to seek relief from the Circuit Court of Appeals. The order provided for an answer by Hartford and for a hearing and determination by the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals, on the basis of the amended petition, the answer, and the affidavits, denied relief on the grounds: (1) That the fraud had not been effective to influence its earlier decision; (2) that the court was without power to deal with the case as its mandate had gone down and the term had long since expired; (3) that Hazel had been negligent and guilty of inexcusable delay in presenting the matter to the court; and \n\n[322 \nU.S. 238, 254]\n\u00a0\n (4) that the only permissible procedure was in the District Court, where the judgment rested, by bill in equity in the nature of a bill of review. One judge dissented, holding that the court had power (1) to recall the cause; (2) to enter upon a trial of the issues made by the petition and answer, and (3) itself to review and revise its earlier decision, enter a new judgment in the case on the corrected record and send a new mandate to the District Court.\n As I understand the opinion of this court, while it reverses the decision below, it only partially adopts the view of the dissenting judge, for the holding is: (1) That the court below has power at this date to deal with the matter either as a new suit or as a continuation of the old one; (2) that it can recall the case from the District Court; (3) that it can grant relief; (4) that it can hear evidence and act as a court of first instance or a trial court; (5) that such a trial as it affords need not be according to the ordinary course of trial of facts in open court, by examination and cross-examination of witnesses, but that the proofs may consist merely of ex parte affidavits; and (6) that such a trial has already been afforded and it remains only, in effect, to cancel Hartford's patent.\n I think the decision overrules principles settled by scores of decisions of this court which are vital to the equitable and orderly disposition of causes-principles which, upon the soundest considerations of fairness and policy, have stood unquestioned since the federal judicial system was established. I shall first briefly state these principles. I shall then as briefly summarize the reasons for their adoption and enforcement and, finally, I shall show why it would not be in the interest of justice to abandon them in this case.\n\n 1. \nThe final and only extant judgment in the litigation is that of the District Court entered pursuant to the mandate of the Circuit Court of Appeals. The term of the \n\n[322 \nU.S. 238, 255]\n\u00a0\n District Court long ago expired and, with that expiration, all power of that court to re-examine the judgment or to alter it ceased, except for the correction of clerical errors. The principle is of universal application to judgments at law,3 decrees in equity,4 and convictions of crime, though, as respects the latter, its result may be great individual hardship. \n5\n The rule might, for that reason, have been relaxed in criminal cases, if it ever is to be, for there, in contrast to civil cases, no other judicial relief is available.\n In the promulgation of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C. A. following section 723c, this court took notice of the fact that terms of the district court vary in length and that the expiration of \n\n[322 \nU.S. 238, 256]\n\u00a0\n the term might occur very soon, or quite a long time, after the entry of a judgment. In order to make the practice uniform Rule 60(b) provides: 'On motion the court, upon such terms as are just, may relieve a party or his legal representative from a judgment, order, or proceeding taken against him through his mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The motion shall be made within a reasonable time, but in no case exceeding six months after such judgment, order, or proceeding was taken. ... This rule does not limit the power of a court (1) to entertain an action to relieve a party from a judgment, order, or proceeding. ...' Thus there has been substituted for the term rule a definite time limitation within which a district court may correct or modify its judgments. But the salutary rule as to finality is retained and, after the expiration of six months, the party must apply, as heretofore, by bill of review-now designated a civil action-to obtain relief from a judgment which itself is final so far as any further steps in the original action are concerned.\n The term rule applies with equal force to an appellate court. Over the whole course of its history, this court has uniformly held that it was without power, after the going down of the mandate, and the expiration of the term, to rehear a case or to modify its decision on the merits. \n6\n And this is equally true of the circuit courts of appeal. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n[322 \nU.S. 238, 257]\n\u00a0\n The court below, unless we are to overthrow a century and a half of precedents, lacks power now to revise its judgment and lacks power also to send its process to the District Court and call up for review the judgment entered on its mandate twelve years ago.8 No such power is inherent in an appellate court; none such is conferred by any statute.\n\n 2. \nThe Circuit Court of Appeals is without authority either to try the issues posed by the petition and answer on the affidavits on file, or, to do as the dissenting judge below suggests, hold a full dress trial.\n The federal courts have only such powers as are expressly conferred on them. Certain original jurisdiction is vested in this court by the Constitution. Its powers as an appellate court are those only which are given by statute. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n The circuit courts of appeal are creatures of statute. No original jurisdiction has been conferred on them. They exercise only such appellate functions as Congress has granted. The grant is plain. 'The circuit courts of appeal shall have appellate jurisdiction to review by appeal final decisions ... in the district courts ....'10 Nowhere is there any grant of jurisdiction to try cases, to \n\n[322 \nU.S. 238, 258]\n\u00a0\n enter judgments, or to issue executions or other final process.\n'... courts created by statute must look to the statute as the warrant for their authority; certainly they cannot go beyond the statute, and assert an authority with which they may not be invested by it, or which may be clearly denied to them.'11\n\n This court has never departed from the view that circuit courts of appeal are statutory courts having no original jurisdiction but only appellate jurisdiction. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n Neither this court13 nor a circuit court14 of appeals may hear new evidence in a cause appealable from a lower court. No suggestion seems ever before to have been made that they may constitute themselves trial courts, embark on the trial of what is essentially an independent cause and enter a judgment of first instance on the facts and the law. But this is what the opinion sanctions.\n\n 3. \nThe temptation might be strong to break new ground in this case if Hazel were otherwise remediless. Such is \n\n[322 \nU.S. 238, 259]\n\u00a0\n not the fact. The reports abound in decisions pointing the way to relief if, in equity, Hazel is entitled to any.\n Since Lord Bacon's day a decree in equity may be reversed or revised for error of law,15 for new matter subsequently occurring, or for after discovered evidence. And this head of equity jurisdiction has been exercised by the federal courts from the foundation of the nation. \n16\n Such a bill is an original bill in the nature of a bill of review. Equity also, on original bills, exercises a like jurisdiction to prevent unconscionable retention or enforcement of a judgment at law procured by fraud, or mistake unmixed with negligence attributable to the losing party, or rendered because he was precluded from making a defense which he had. Such a bill may be filed in the federal court which rendered the judgment or in a federal court other than the court, federal or state, which rendered it. 17 \n\n[322 \nU.S. 238, 260]\n\u00a0\n Whether the suit concern a decree in equity or a judgment at law, it is for relief granted by equity against an unjust and inequitable result, and is subject to all the customary doctrines governing the award if equitable relief.\n New proof to justify a bill of review must be such as has come to light after judgment and such as could not have been obtained when the judgment was entered. The proffered evidence must not only have been unknown prior to judgment, but must be such as could not have been discovered by the exercise of reasonable diligence in time to permit its use in the trial. Unreasonable delay, or lack of diligence in timely searching for the evidence, are fatal to the right to a bill of review, and a party may not elect to forego inquiry and let the cause go to judgment in the hope of a favorable result and then change his position and attempt, by means of a bill of review, to get the benefit of evidence he neglected to produce. These principles are established by many of the cases cited in notes 16 and 17, and specific citation is unnecessary. The principles are well settled. And, in this class of cases as in others, although equity does not condone wrongdoing, it will not extend its aid to a wrongdoer; in \n\n[322 \nU.S. 238, 261]\n\u00a0\n other words, the complainant must come into court with clean hands.\n\n 4. \nConfessedly the opinion repudiates the unbroken rule of decision with respect to the finality of a judgment at the expiration of the term; that with respect to jurisdiction of an appellate court to try issues of fact upon evidence, and that with respect to the necessity for resorting to a bill of review to modify or set aside a judgment once it has become final. Perusal of the authorities cited will sufficiently expose the reasons for these doctrines. It is obvious that parties ought not to be permitted indefinitely to litigate issues once tried and adjudicated. \n18\n There must be an end to litigation. If courts of first instance, or appellate courts, were at liberty, on application of a party, at any time to institute a summary inquiry for the purpose of modifying or nullifying \n\n[322 \nU.S. 238, 262]\n\u00a0\n a considered judgment, no reliance could be placed on that which has been adjudicated and citizens could not, with any confidence, act in the light of what has apparently been finally decided.\n If relief on equitable grounds is to be obtained it is right that it should be sought by a formal suit upon adequate pleadings and should be granted only after a trial of issues according to the usual course of the trial of questions of fact. A court of first instance is the appropriate tribunal, and the only tribunal, equipped for such a trial. Appellate courts have neither the power nor the means to that end.\n On the strongest grounds of public policy bills of review are disfavored, since to facilitate them would tend to encourage fraudulent practices, resort to perjury, and the building of fictitious reasons for setting aside judgments.\n\n 5. \nI think the facts in the instant case speak loudly for the observance, and against the repudiation, of all the rules to which I have referred. The court's opinion implies that the disposition here made is justified by uncontradicted facts, but the record demonstrates beyond question that serious controverted issues ought to be resolved before Hazel may have relief.\n In 1926 Hartford brought a suit for infringement of the Peiler Patent against Nivison-Weiskopf Company in the Southern District of Ohio. Counsel for the defendants in that case were Messrs. William R. and Edmund P. Wood of Cincinnati. About the same time Hartford brought a similar suit for infringement against Kearns-Gorsuch Bottle Company, a subsidiary of Hazel. Counsel for Kearns were the same who have represented Hazel throughout this case.\n In 1928 Hartford brought suit against Hazel in the Western District of Pennsylvania for a like infringement. The same counsel represented Hazel. The Ohio suits \n\n[322 \nU.S. 238, 263]\n\u00a0\n came to trial first. In them a decision was rendered adverse to Hartford. Appeals were taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit, were consolidated, and counsel for the defendants appeared together in that court, which decided adversely to Hartford (Hartford-Empire Co. v. Nivison-Weiskopf Co., 58 F.2d 701).\n In the preparation for the defense of the Nivison suit, William R. Wood called upon Clarke and interviewed him in the presence of a witness. Clarke admitted that Hatch of Hartford had prepared the article published under Clarke's name. In the light of this fact the Messrs. Wood notified Hartford that they would require the presence of Hatch at the trial of the suit and Hatch was in attendance during that trial. Repeatedly during the trial Hatch admitted to the Messrs. Wood that he was in fact the author of the article. It was well understood that the defendant wanted him present so that if any reference to or reliance upon the article developed they could call Hatch and prove the facts. There was no such reference or reliance.\n As counsel for the various defendants opposed to Hartford were acting in close cooperation, Messrs. Wood attended the trial of the Hartford- Hazel suit in Pittsburgh, which must have occurred in 1929 or early 1930. ( See 39 F.2d 111.) One or other of the Messrs. Wood was present throughout that trial and Edmund P. Wood was in frequent consultation with the Hazel representatives and counsel. Hazel's counsel was the same at that trial as in the present case. The Messrs. Wood told Hazel's counsel and representatives that Clarke had admitted Hatch was the author of the article and that Hatch had also freely admitted the same thing. Hazel's counsel and representatives discussed at length, in the presence of Mr. Wood, the advisability of attacking the authenticity of the article. Counsel for Hazel, in these conferences, took the position that 'an attack on the article might be a \n\n[322 \nU.S. 238, 264]\n\u00a0\n boomerang in that it might emphasize the truth of the only statements in the article' which he regarded as of any possible pertinence. Mr. Wood's affidavit giving in detail the discussions and the conclusion of Hazel's counsel is uncontradicted, and demonstrates that Hazel's counsel knew the facts with regard to the Clarke article and knew the names of witnesses who could prove those facts. After due deliberation, it was decided not to offer proof on the subject.\n The District Court found in favor of Hazel, holding that Hazel had not infringed. Hartford appealed to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. In that court Hartford's counsel referred in argument to the Clarke article and the court, in its decision, referred to the article as persuasive of certain facts in connection with the development of glass machinery. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit rendered its decision in the Nivison and Kearns cases on May 12, 1932, and the Third Circuit Court of Appeals rendered its decision in the Hartford-Hazel case on May 6, 1932.\n Counsel for Hazel was then, nearly ten years prior to the filing of the instant petition, confronted with the fact that, in its opinion, the Circuit Court of Appeals had accredited the article. Naturally counsel was faced with the question whether he should bring to the court's attention the facts respecting that article. As I have said, he asked and was granted five extensions of time for filing a petition for rehearing. Meantime negotiations were begun with Hartford for a general settlement and for Hazel's joining in the combination and patent pool of which Hartford was the head and front. At the same time, however, evidently as a precaution against the breakdown of the negotiations, Hazel's counsel obtained affidavits to be signed by the Messrs. Wood setting forth the facts which they had gleaned concerning the author- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 238, 265]\n\u00a0\n ship of the Clarke article. These affidavits were intended for use in the Third Circuit Court of Appeals case for they were captioned in that case. Being made by reputable counsel who are accredited by both parties to this proceeding they were sufficient basis for a petition for rehearing while the case was still in the bosom of the Circuit Court of Appeals. It is idle to suggest that counsel would not have been justified in applying to the court on the strength of them.\n Had counsel filed a petition and attached to it the affidavits of the Messrs. Wood, without more, he would have done his duty to the court in timely calling its attention to the fraud which had been perpetrated. But more, the court would undoubtedly have reopened the case, granted rehearing, and remanded the case to the District Court with permission to Hazel to summon and examine witnesses. It is to ignore realities to suggest, as the opinion does, that counsel for Hazel was helpless at that time and in the then existing situation.\n But counsel did not rest there. He commissioned an investigator who interviewed a labor leader named Maloney in Philadelphia. This man refused to talk but the investigator's report would make it clear to anyone of average sense that he knew about the origin of the article, and any lawyer of experience would not have hesitated to summon him as a witness and put him under examination. Moreover, the investigator interviewed Clarke and his report of the evasive manner and answers of Clarke convince me, and I believe would convince any lawyer of normal perception, that the Woods' affidavits were true and that Clarke would have so admitted if called to the witness stand. Most extraordinary is the omission of Hazel's counsel, although then in negotiation with Hartford for a settlement, to make any inquiry concerning Hatch or to interview Hatch, or to have him interviewed \n\n[322 \nU.S. 238, 266]\n\u00a0\n when counsel had been assured that Hatch had no inclination to prevaricate concerning his part in the preparation of the article.\n The customary modes of eliciting truth in court may well establish that in the circumstances Hazel's counsel deliberately elected to forego any disclosure concerning the Clarke article and to procure instead the favorable settlement he obtained from Hartford.\n In any event, we know that, on July 21, 1932, Hartford and Hazel entered into an agreement, which is now before this court in the record in Nos. 7-11 of the present term, on appeal from the District Court for Northern Ohio. Under the agreement Hazel paid Hartford $1,000,000. Hartford granted Hazel a license on all machines and methods embodying patented inventions for the manufacture of glass containers at Hartford's lowest royalty rates. Hartford agreed to pay Hazel one-third of its net royalty income to and including January 3, 1945, over and above $850,000 per annum. At the same time, Hazel entered into an agreement with the Owens-Illinois Glass Company, another party to the Hartford patent pool and the conspiracy to monopolize the glass manufacturing industry found by the District Court.\n In the autumn of 1933 counsel for Shawkee Company, defendant in another suit by Hartford, obtained documents indicating Hatch's responsibility for the Clarke article, and wrote counsel for Hazel inquiring what he knew about the matter. Hazel's counsel, evidently reluctant to disturb the existing status, replied that, while he suspected Hartford might have been responsible for the article, he did not at the time at trial, know of the papers which counsel for Shawkee had unearthed, and added that his recollection was then 'too indefinite to be positive and I would have to go through the voluminous mass of papers relating to the various Hartford-Empire \n\n[322 \nU.S. 238, 267]\n\u00a0\n litigations, including correspondence, before I could be more definite.'\n The District Court for Northern Ohio has found that the 1932 agreement and coincident arrangements placed Hazel in a preferred position in the glass container industry and drove nearly everyone else in that field into taking licenses from Hartford, stifled competition, and gave Hazel, as a result of rebates paid to it, a great advantage over all competitors in the cost of its product. It is uncontested that, as a result of the agreement, Hazel has been repaid the $1,000,000 it paid Hartford and has received upwards of $800,000 additional.\n In 1941 the United States instituted an equity suit in Northern Ohio against Hartford, Hazel, Owens Illinois, and other corporations and individuals to restrain violation of the antitrust statutes. That court found that the defendants conspired to violate the antitrust laws and entered an injunction on October 8, 1942. (46 F.Supp. 541.) Hazel and other defendants appealed to this court. The same counsel represented Hazel in that suit, and in the appeal to this court, as represented the company in the District Court and in the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in this case. In its brief in this court Hazel strenuously contended that the license agreement executed in 1932, and still in force, was not violative of the antitrust laws and should be sustained.\n Of course, in 1941 counsel for Hazel faced the possibility that the District Court in Ohio might find against Hazel, and that this court might affirm its decision. Considerations of prudence apparently dictated that Hazel should cast an anchor to windward. Accordingly, November 19, 1941, it presented its petition for leave to file a bill of review in the District Court for Western Pennsylvania and attached a copy of the proposed bill. In answer to questions at our bar as to the ultimate purpose of this proceed- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 238, 268]\n\u00a0\n ing, counsel admitted that, if successful in it, Hazel proposed to obtain every resultant benefit it could.\n In the light of the circumstances recited it becomes highly important closely to scrutinize Hazel's allegations. It refers to the use by the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Clarke article in the opinion and then avers:\n'That although prior to the decision of this Court your petitioner suspected and believed that the article had been written by one of plaintiff's employees, instead of by Clarke, and had been caused by plaintiff to be published in the National Glass Budget, petitioner did not know then or until this year material and pertinent facts which, if petitioner had then known and been able to present to this Court, should have resulted in a decision for petitioner. (Italics added)\n\n'That such facts were disclosed to petitioner for the first time in suit of United States of America v. Hartford et al., in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, and are specified in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of the annexed bill of review, which is made a part hereof.\n\n'That your petitioner could not have ascertained by the use of proper and reasonable diligence the newly discovered facts prior to the said suit, and that the newly discovered evidence is true and material and should cause a decree in this cause different from that heretofore made.'\n\n In the proposed bill of review these allegations are repeated and it is added that the new facts ascertained consist of the testimony of Hatch in the antitrust suit and five letters written by various parties connected with the conspiracy and a memorandum prepared by Hatch which were in evidence in that suit. The bill then adds:\n'The new matter specified in the preceding paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 is material, it only recently became known to plaintiff, which could not have previously obtained it with due diligence, and such new evidence if it had been previously known to this Court and to the Circuit Court \n\n[322 \nU.S. 238, 269]\n\u00a0\n of Appeals would have caused a decision different from that reached.'\n\n Neither the petition nor the bill is under oath but there is attached an affidavit of counsel for Hazel in which he states that in or before 1929 Hazel 'had suspected, and I believed,' that the Clarke article had been written by Hatch and that Hartford had caused the article to be published, adding: 'having been so told by the firm of Messrs. Wood and Wood, Cincinnati lawyers, who said they had so been told by Clarke and also by Hatch.' The affidavit also attaches the reports of the investigator above referred to and refers to the exhibits and testimony in the antitrust suit in Northern Ohio.\n In the light of the facts I have recited, it seems clear that if Hazel's conduct be weighed merely in the aspect of negligent failure to investigate, the decision of this court in Toledo Scale Co. v. Computing Scale Co., \n261 \nU.S. 399\n, 43 S.Ct. 458, may well justify a holding, on all available evidence, that, at least, Hazel was guilty of inexcusable negligence in not seeking the evidence to support an attack upon the decree. But it is highly possible that, upon a full trial, it will be found that Hazel held back what it knew and, if so, is not entitled now to attack the original decree. In Scotten v. Littlefield, \n235 \nU.S. 407\n, 35 S.Ct. 125, in affirming the denial of a bill of review, this court said that if the claim now made was 'not presented to the court of appeals when there on appeal it could not be held back and made the subject of a bill of review, as is now attempted to be done.' Repeatedly this court has held that one will not be permitted to litigate by bill of review a question which it had the opportunity to litigate in the main suit, whether the litigant purposely abstained from bringing forward the defense or negligently omitted to prosecute inquiries which would have made it available. \n19\n\u00a0\n\n[322 \nU.S. 238, 270]\n\u00a0\n And certainly an issue of such importance affecting the validity of a judgment, should never be tried on affidavits. \n20\n\u00a0\n\n As I read the opinion of the court, it disregards the contents of many of the affidavits filed in the cause and holds that solely because of the fraud which was practiced on the Patent Office and in litigation on the patent, the owner of the patent is to be amerced and in effect fined for the benefit of the other party to the suit, although that other comes with unclean hands21 and stands adjudged a party to a conspiracy to benefit over a period of twelve years under the aegis of the very patent it now attacks for fraud. To disregard these considerations, to preclude inquiry concerning these matters, is recklessly to punish one wrongdoer for the benefit of another, although punishment has no place in this proceeding.\n Hazel well understood the course of decision in federal courts. It came into the Circuit Court of Appeals with a petition for leave to file a bill of review, a procedure required by long settled principles. Inasmuch as the judgment it attacked had been entered as a result of the action of the Circuit Court of Appeals, Hazel properly applied to that court for leave to file its bill in the District Court. \n22\n The respondent did not object on procedural grounds to the Circuit Court of Appeals considering and acting on the petition. That court of its own motion denied the petition and permitted amendment to pray relief there. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 238, 271]\n\u00a0\n On the question what amounts to a sufficient showing to move an appellate court to grant leave to file a bill of review in the trial court, the authorities are not uniform. Where the lack of merit is obvious, appellate courts have refused leave,23 but where the facts are complicated it is often the better course to grant leave and to allow available defenses to be made in answer to the bill. \n24\n In the present instance, I think it would have been proper for the court to permit the filing of the bill in the District Court where the rights of the parties to summon, to examine, and to cross examine witnesses, and to have a deliberate and orderly trial of the issues according to the established standards would be preserved.\n I should reverse the order of the Circuit Court of Appeals with directions to permit the filing of the bill in the District Court.\n Mr. Justice REED and Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER join in this opinion.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE agrees with the result suggested in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See, e.g., Art Metal Works, Inc., v.

(Italics supplied.) \n[\nFootnote 5\n] We do not hold, and would not hold, that the material questions of fact raised by the charges of fraud against Hartford could, if in dispute, be finally determined on ex parte affidavits without examination and cross examination of witnesses. It should again be emphasized that Hartford has never questioned the accuracy of the various documents which indisputably show fraud on the Patent Office and the Circuit Court, and has not claimed, either here or below, that a trial might bring forth evidence to disprove the facts as shown by these documents. And insofar as a trial would serve to bring forth additional evidence showing that Hazel was not diligent in uncovering these facts, we already have pointed out that such evidence would not in this case change the result.\n Moreover, we need not decide whether, if the facts relating to the fraud were in dispute and difficult of ascertainment, the Circuit Court here should have held hearings and decided the case or should have sent it to the District Court for decision.

After he had taken an appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals he filed, after the term had expired, a motion to set aside the judgment on the ground that a juror wilfully concealed bias against the defendant when examined on his voir dire. After hearing this motion the District judge found as a fact that the juror had been guilty of misconduct and that the defendant and his counsel neither had knowledge of the wrong nor could have discovered it earlier by due diligence. The District judge was in doubt whether, after the expiration of the term, he had power to deal with the judgment of conviction. The Circuit Court of Appeals certified the question to this court which, in a unanimous opinion, rendered after full argument by able counsel, held in accordance with all earlier precedents that, even in a case of such hardship, the District Court had no such power. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Hudson v.

See United States v. Throckmorton, \n98 \nU.S. 61\n. The distinction between extrinsic and intrinsic fraud is not technical but substantial. The statement that only extrinsic fraud may be the basis of a bill of review is merely a corollary of the rule that review will not be granted to permit relitigation of matters which were in issue in the cause and are, therefore, concluded by the judgment or decree. The classical example of intrinsic as contrasted with extrinsic fraud is the commission of perjury by a witness. While perjury is a fraud upon the court, the credibility of witnesses is in issue, for it is one of the matters on which the trier of fact must pass in order to reach a final judgment. An allegation that a witness perjured himself is insufficient because the materiality of the testimony, and opportunity to attack it, was open at the trial. Where the authenticity of a document relied on as part of a litigant's case is material to adjudication, as was the grant in the Throckmorton case, and there was opportunity to investigate this matter, fraud in the preparation of the document is not extrinsic but intrinsic and will not support review. Any fraud connected with the preparation of the Clarke article in this case was extrinsic, and, subject to other relevant rules, would support a bill of review. \n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] Hendrickson v.

Horsky, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Chester T. Lane, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Sec. 205(a) of the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942, 56 Stat. 23, 50 U.S.C.App.Supp. II,  901 et seq., 925, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix,  901 et seq., 925, provides: 'Whenever in the judgment of the Administrator any person has engaged or is about to engage in any \n\n[321 \nU.S. 321, 322]\n\u00a0\n acts or practices which constitute or will constitute a violation of any provision of section 4 of this Act, ... he may make application to the appropriate court for an order enjoining such acts or practices, or for an order enforcing compliance with such provisions, and upon a showing by the Administrator that such person has engaged or is about to engage in any such acts or practices a permanent or temporary injunction, restraining order, or other order shall be granted without bond.' The question in this case is whether the Administrator, having established that a defendant has engaged in acts or practices violative of  4 of the Act is entitled as of right to an injunction restraining the defendant from engaging in such acts or practices or whether the court has some discretion to grant or withhold such relief.\n Sec. 4(a) of the Act makes it unlawful for a person to sell or deliver any commodity in violation of specified orders or regulations of the Administrator. A regulation issued under  2 of the Act and effective in May, 1942 (7 Fed.Reg. 3153) provided that no person should sell or deliver any commodity at a price higher than the authorized maximum price ( 1499.1) as fixed or determined by the regulation. \n1\n Since maximum prices were fixed with \n\n[321 \nU.S. 321, 323]\n\u00a0\n reference to earlier base periods, the regulation also provided for the preservation and examination of existing records. \n2\n And provision was likewise made for the keeping of current records reflecting sales made under the regulation3 and for the filing of maximum prices with the Administrator. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n[321 \nU.S. 321, 324]\n\u00a0\n There is no substantial controversy over the facts. Petitioner operates a large department store in Washington, D.C. and did a business of about $20,000,000 in 1942. There are 107 departments in the store and each sells a separate line of merchandise. In the fall of 1942 the Administrator started an investigation to determine whether petitioner was complying with the Act and the regulation. The investigation was a 'spot check', confined to seven departments. In each of the seven departments violations were disclosed. As a result this suit was brought. The complaint charged violations of the maximum price provisions of the regulation and violations of the regulations governing the keeping of records and reporting to the Administrator. The Administrator payed for an injunction enjoining petitioner from selling, delivering or offering for sale or delivery any commodity in violation of the regulation and from failing to keep complete and accurate records as required by the regulation. In its answer petitioner pleaded among other things that any failure or neglect to comply with the regulation was involuntary and was corrected as soon as discovered.\n Numerous violations both as respects prices and records were discovered. Thus in six of the seven departments investigated there had occurred between May and October, \n\n[321 \nU.S. 321, 325]\n\u00a0\n 1942 some 3700 sales in excess of the maximum prices with overcharges of some $4600. The statements filed with the Administrator were deficient, some 400 items of merchandise being omitted. And there were over 300 items with respect to which no records were kept showing how the maximum prices had been determined.\n There is no doubt, however, of petitioner's good faith and diligence. The District Court found that the manager of the store had offered it as a laboratory in which the Administrator might experiment with any regulation which might be issued. Prior to the promulgation of the regulation the petitioner had created a new section known as the price control office. That office undertook to bring petitioner into compliance with the requirements of the regulation in advance of its effective date. The head of that office together with seven assistants devoted full time to that endeavor. But the store had about 2,000 employees and over one million two hundred thousand articles of merchandise. In the furniture departments alone there were over fifty-four thousand transactions in the first ten months of 1942. Difficulties were encountered in interpreting the regulation, in determining the exact nature of an article and whether it had been previously sold and at what price, etc. The absence of adequate records made it difficult to ascertain prices during the earlier base- period. Misunderstanding of the regulation, confusion on the part of employees not trained in such problems of interpretation and administration, the complexity of the problem, and the fallibility of humans all combined to produce numerous errors. But the District Court concluded that the 'mistakes in pricing and listing were all made in good faith and without intent to violate the regulations.'\n The District Court also found that the mistakes brought to light 'were at once corrected, and vigorous steps were taken by The Hecht Company to prevent recurrence of \n\n[321 \nU.S. 321, 326]\n\u00a0\n these mistakes or further mistakes in the future.' The company increased its price control office to twenty-eight employees. New methods of internal control were instituted early in November, 1942 with the view of avoiding future violations. That new system of control 'greatly improved' the situation. Petitioner undertook to make repayment of all overcharges brought to light by the investigation in case of customers who could be identified. It proposed to contribute the remaining amount of such overcharges to some local charity. The District Court concluded that the issuance of an injunction would have 'no effect by way of insuring better compliance in the future' and would be 'unjust' to petitioner and not 'in the public interest'. It accordingly dismissed the complaint. Brown v. Hecht Co., 49 F.Supp. 528. On appeal the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia reversed that judgment, one judge dissenting. 137 F.2d 689. That court held that the findings of the District Court were supported by substantial evidence, except that it did not consider whether the evidence supported the findings that an injunction would not insure better compliance in the future and would be unjust to petitioner. In its view the latter findings were immaterial. For it construed  205(a) of the Act to require the issuance of an injunction or other order as a matter of course, once violations were found.\n The case is here on a question for a writ of certiorari which we granted because of the importance of the problem in the administration of the Act.\n Respondent insists that the mandatory character of  205(a) is clear from its language, history and purpose. He argues that 'shall be granted' is not permissive, that since the same section provides that the Administrator 'may' apply for an injunction and that, if so, the injunction 'shall' be granted, 'may' and 'shall' are each used in the ordinary sense. It is pointed out that when the bill (for which the Act in its final form was substituted) \n\n[321 \nU.S. 321, 327]\n\u00a0\n passed the House,  205(a) provided that 'upon a proper showing' an injunction or other order 'shall be granted without bond.' \n5\n The words 'upon a proper showing' were stricken in the Senate and were replaced by the words 'upon a showing by the Administrator that such person has engaged or is about to engage in any such acts or practices.' And the Senate Report in its analysis of  205(a) stated that 'upon a showing by the Administrator that such person has engaged or is about to engage in any such acts or practices, a temporary or permanent injunction, restraining order or other order is to be granted without bond.' S.Rep. No. 931, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 25. Further support for the view that the issuance of an injunction is mandatory once violations are shown is sought in the pattern of federal legislation which provides relief by injunction in aid of law enforcement. Some of those statutes6 contain provisions quite close to the language of  205(a). Others provide that an injunction or restraining order shall be granted 'upon a proper showing'7 or that federal district courts shall have jurisdiction to restrain violations 'for cause shown'.8 The argument is that when Congress desired to give the district courts discretion to grant or withhold relief by injunction it chose apt words to make its desire plain.\n We agree that the cessation of violations, whether before or after the institution of a suit by the Administrator, is no bar to the issuance of an injunction under  205(a). \n\n[321 \nU.S. 321, 328]\n\u00a0\n But we do not think that under all circumstances the court must issue the injunction or other order which the Administrator seeks.\n It seems apparent on the face of  205(a) that there is some room for the exercise of discretion on the part of the court. For the requirement is that a 'permanent or temporary injunction, restraining order, or other order' be granted. Though the Administrator asks for an injunction, some 'other order' might be more appropriate, or at least so appear to the court. Thus in the present case one judge in the Court of Appeals felt that the District Court should not have dismissed the complaint but should have entered an order retaining the case on the docket with the right of the Administrator, on notice, to renew his application for injunctive relief if violations recurred. It is indeed not difficult to imagine that in some situations that might be the fairest course to follow and one which would be as practically effective as the issuance of an injunction. Such an order, moreover, would seem to by a type of 'other order' which a faithful reading of  205(a) would permit a court to issue in a compliance proceeding. However that may be, it would seem clear that the court might deem some 'other order' more appropriate for the evil at hand than the one which was sought. We cannot say that it lacks the power to make that choice. Thus it seems that  205(a) falls short of making mandatory the issuance of an injunction merely because the Administrator asks it.\n There is, moreover, support in the legislative history of  205(a) for the view that 'shall be granted' is less mandatory than a literal reading might suggest. We have already referred to a portion of the Senate Report which lends some support to the position of the Administrator. But in another portion of that Report there is the following reference to suits to enjoin violations of the Act: 'In common with substantially all regulatory statutes, the \n\n[321 \nU.S. 321, 329]\n\u00a0\n bill authorizes the official charged with the duty of administering the act to apply to any appropriate court, State or Federal, for an order enjoining any person who has engaged or is about to engage in any acts or practices which constitute or will constitute a violation of any provision of the bill. Such courts are given jurisdiction to issue whatever order to enforce compliance is proper in the circumstances of each particular case.' S.Rep. No. 931, supra, p. 10. A grant of jurisdiction to issue compliance orders hardly suggests an absolute duty to do so under any and all circumstances. We cannot but think that if Congress had intended to make such a drastic departure from the traditions of equity practice, an unequivocal statement of its purpose would have been made.\n We do not stop to compare the provisions of  205(a) with the requirements of other federal statutes governing administrative agencies which, it is said, make it mandatory that those agencies take action when certain facts are shown to exist. \n9\n We are dealing here with the requirements of equity practice with a background of several hundred years of history. Only the other day we stated that 'An appeal to the equity jurisdiction conferred on federal district courts is an appeal to the sound discretion which guides the determinations of courts of equity.' Meredith v. City of Winter Haven, \n320 \nU.S. 228, 235\n, 64 S.Ct. 7, 11. The historic injunctive process was designed to deter, not to punish. The essence of equity jurisdiction has been the power of the Chancellor to do equity and to mould each decree to the necessities of the particular case. Flexibility rather than rigidity has distinguished it. The qualities of mercy and practicality have made equity the instrument for nice adjustment and reconciliation between the public interest and private needs as well as between competing private \n\n[321 \nU.S. 321, 330]\n\u00a0\n claims. We do not believe that such a major departure from that long tradition as is here proposed should be lightly implied. We do not think the history or language of  206(a) compel it. It should be noted, moreover, that  205(a) governs the procedure in both federal and state courts. For  205(c) gives the state courts concurrent jurisdiction with federal district courts of civil enforcement proceedings. It is therefore even more compelling to conclude that, if Congress desired to make such an abrupt departure from traditional equity practice as is suggested, it would have made its desire plain. Hence we resolve the ambiguities of  205(a) in favor of that interpretation which affords a full opportunity for equity courts to treat enforcement proceedings under this emergency legislation in accordance with their traditional practices, as conditioned by the necessities of the public interest which Congress has sought to protect. United States v. Morgan, \n307 \nU.S. 183, 194\n, 59 S.Ct. 795, 801, and cases cited.\n We do not mean to imply that courts should administer  205(a) grudgingly. We repeat what we stated in United States v. Morgan, supra, 307 U.S. page 191, 59 S.Ct. page 799, respecting judicial review of administrative action: '... court and agency are not to be regarded as wholly independent and unrelated instrumentalities of justice, each acting in the performance of its prescribed statutory duty without regard to the appropriate function of the other in securing the plainly indicated objects of the statute. Court and agency are the means adopted to attain the prescribed end, and so far as their duties are defined by the words of the statute, those words should be construed so as to attain that end through co-ordinated action. Neither body should repeat in this day the mistake made by the courts of law when equity was struggling for recognition as an ameliorating system of justice; neither can rightly be regarded by the other as an alien intruder, to be tolerated if must be, but never to be encouraged or aided by the other in \n\n[321 \nU.S. 321, 331]\n\u00a0\n the attainment of the common aim.' The Administrator does not carry the sole burden of the war against inflation. The courts also have been entrusted with a share of that responsibility. And their discretion under  205(a) must be exercised in light of the large objectives of the Act. For the standards of the public interest not the requirements of private litigation measure the propriety and need for injunctive relief in these cases. That discretion should reflect an acute awareness of the Congressional admonition that 'of all the consequences of war, except human slaughter, inflation is the most destructive' (S.Rep. No. 931, supra, p. 2) and that delay or indifference may be fatal. Whether the District Court abused its discretion in dismissing the complaint is a question which we do not reach. The judgment must be reversed and the cause remanded to the Court of Appeals for that determination.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER agrees that  205(a) of the Emergency Price Control Act, apart from dispensing with any requirement for a bond, does not change the historic conditions for the exercise by courts of equity of their power to issue injunctions, according to which the Court of Appeals should now dispose of this cause.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS is of opinion that the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be reversed and that of the District Court affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 1499.2 provided in part: 'Except as otherwise provided in this General Maximum Price Regulation, the seller's maximum price for any commodity or service shall be: (a) In those cases in which the seller dealt in the same or similar commodities or services during March 1942: The highest price charged by the seller during such month-(1) For the same commodity or service; or (2) If no charge was made for the same commodity or service, for the similar commodity or service, most nearly like it; or ( b) In those cases in which the seller did not deal in the same or similar commodities or services during March 1942: The highest price charged during such month by the most closely competitive seller of the same class-( 1) For the same commodity or service; or (2) If no charge was made for the same commodity or service, for the similar commodity or service most nearly like it.

Texas Co., 1940, \n308 \nU.S. 463\n, 60 S.Ct. 349)'. In this, as in the companion case, DeCastro v. Board of Com'rs of San Juan, \n322 \nU.S. 451\n, 64 S.Ct. 1121, decided this day, we granted certiorari \n321 \nU.S. 758\n, 64 S.Ct. 615, on a petition raising important questions concerning the appellate review by federal courts of decisions of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico in matters of local concern. The petition here presents for decision the question (1) whether the application of Rule 39(b) involves an abdication of the duty of the Court of Appeals to hear and decide such appeals on the merits, on brief and argument, as are other appeals; and (2) whether the decision of the Insular Supreme Court of Puerto Rico is so maniestly correct as to make any appeal from it necessarily frivolous and thus warrant dismissal of the appeal without a hearing, on mere inspection of the face of the record.\n Petitioner, an agricultural partnership, by petition in the insular District Court of Ponce, P.R., sought rescission of a sale of a plantation known as 'Indios', made by respondent Commins to others of the respondents, as in violation and in fraud of an option to purchase the property given by respondent Commins to petitioner. After a trial, the District Court made findings of fact on the basis of which it gave judgment for respondents. The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico confirmed the findings of \n\n[322 \nU.S. 465, 467]\n\u00a0\n the District Court and affirmed the judgment. 60 D.P.R. 877 (Spanish edition). On appeal to the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, under 28 U.S.C.  225(a), 28 U.S.C.A.  225(a), that court, on consideration of the typewritten record and appellant's statement on appeal, and without hearing argument and without an opinion, affirmed under its Rule 39(b).\n The District Court and the Supreme Court both found the facts as follows: In 1922 respondent procured a loan from petitioner of more than $ 40,000, for which respondent Commins gave petitioner four promissory notes payable to 'the holder by endorsement', secured by a mortgage, not specifically naming any mortgagee, on respondent Commins' undivided interest in two plantations, 'Indios' and 'Juanita', then owned jointly by her and her sister. At that time petitioner was a tenant of both plantations under lease, that of 'Indios' expiring in 1937, that of 'Juanita' in 1938. The mortgage contract stipulated that Mrs. Commins upon three months written notice might at any time before maturity pay the mortgage credits. It also provided that 'the debtor, as a part of the consideration of this contract, agrees with the partnership Mario Mercado e Hijos, so long as the mortgage credit herein constituted is not paid, to grant it priority to purchase and sell or lease her undivided joint interest in the estates 'Indios' and 'Juanita' upon the same price and terms' as those on which she should be willing to sell or lease to any other purchaser or lessee. It further provided 'to this effect, the debtor shall advise, unless such mortgage credit is paid ... of any offer of sale or lease made to her'.\n The following year, 1933, petitioner sold the promissory notes to the heirs of Jose Tous Soto, the transfer being effected by delivery of the notes and by a deed executed by petitioner which purported to assign to the heirs the 'mortgage credits' and guaranteed payment in monthly \n\n[322 \nU.S. 465, 468]\n\u00a0\n installments of the stipulated interest of 9% due on the notes less 3\/4 of 1%, which it was agreed petitioner should retain for itself. No mention was made in the deed of the option secured to petitioner by the mortgage contract but both of the insular courts made findings which petitioner contends establish that the option was not intended to be assigned, but that the rights under it were to be retained by petitioner. Three years later, in 1936, the interests of the owners in the two estates were partitioned between Mrs. Commins and her sister, Mrs. Commins receiving the plantation 'Indios' by the partition deed in which petitioner joined for the purpose of consenting to the partition. The trial court made findings which can be interpreted as meaning that all the respondents were in fact aware that it was the understanding of petitioner and the transferees of the mortgage creditors that the option was to remain the property of petitioner.\n In February, 1937, Mrs. Commins gave a new short term mortgage for $ 45,000 on 'Indios' plantation to respondent Mannel Francisco Lluberas Passarell. The proceeds, to the extent of $41,000, were by her direction used to pay her mortgage indebtedness, with three months interest in advance, to the heirs of Jose Tous Soto, the transferees of the mortgage credits, who, on receipt of the payment, cancelled the mortgage. Immediately following the cancellation Mrs. Commins sold and conveyed by deed the estate 'Indios' to respondent Lluberas Passarell and his sisters, who are also respondents. It is this deed which petitioner seeks to cancel as in violation of the option.\n In affirming the judgment of the Ponce District Court which denied the petition for cancellation of the conveyance, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico rested its decision on two independent grounds, either one of which, if supportable, is sufficient to sustain it. Construing and applying the relevant provisions of Art. 152 of the Puerto \n\n[322 \nU.S. 465, 469]\n\u00a0\n Rico mortgage law and  1418 and 1759 of the Civil Code of Puerto Rico, 1931 edition,1 it concluded that the transfer by petitioner of the mortgage credits to the heirs of Jose Tous Soto without reservation of the option to purchase, 'conveyed' to the heirs, petitioner's rights under the option as an inseparable incident of the credits so that after the transfer petitioner was not entitled to exercise the option. It also concluded that since the option was for 'so long as the mortgage credit here constituted is not paid' it became 'extinguished' by virtue of the payment of the mortgage and could not thereafter be exercised. It further held that petitioner had failed to prove that the sale of 'Indios' by respondent Commins, after the assignment by petitioner of the mortgage credits, and after the payment of the mortgage and the expiration of the option, was in fraud of petitioner's rights under the option. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 465, 470]\n\u00a0\n The court did not pass upon the contention that the option to purchase was void as an agreement 'enabling the mortgagee to adjudicate to itself the mortgage property' comparable to agreements for collateral advantage 'clogging' the equity of redemption deemed unlawful in Anglo- American mortgage law. Jennings v. Ward, 2 Vern. 520; Samuel v. Jarrah Timber and Wood Paving Corp., Ltd., L.R. (1904) A.C. 323; 21 Harv.L.Rev. 459. But assuming the validity of the option, as did the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, its view that rights acquired by a mortgagee as an incident to the mortgage debt passes to the transferee of the debt by assignment, whether mentioned in the assignment or not, is not unknown to our law. Cf. Sheldon v. Sill, 8 How. 441, 450; Batesville Institute v. Kauffman, 18 Wall. 151, 154; Jones on Mortgages,  1033; and see North British & Mercantile Ins. Co. v. Rose, 3 Cir., 228 F. 290, 292. And it is a familiar rule of our law that save in exceptional circumstances not present here an option can only be exercised in conformity to its terms and never after the time fixed for its expiration. Waterman v. Banks, \n144 \nU.S. 394\n, 401-403, 12 S.Ct. 646-648; Kelsey v. Crowther, \n162 \nU.S. 404, 409\n, 16 S.Ct. 808, 810; Lord Ranelagh v. Melton, 2 Drewry and Smale, 278.\n Petitioner has furnished us with no persuasive evidence that the law is otherwise in Puerto Rico. On the contrary the Puerto Rican Supreme Court's decision that the option was nececessarily assigned with the mortgage is not without support in the statutory provisions which it cited, and to which we have referred. \n2\n Whether the option was so transferred or not it is difficult to see upon what legal theory any system of law could in the circumstances of this case read into an option to purchase, a term prolong- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 465, 471]\n\u00a0\n ing the period specified for its exercise. Petitioner has advanced no such theory and cites no authority which would support it.\n As we have said in the De Castro case, the duty of the Court of Appeals and of this Court to examine and appraise local law in cases brought for review from the insular courts cannot ordinarily be discharged summarily. But full argument in this case has not developed any issue of Puerto Rican law, or any question of the deference rightly to be paid to the decisions of the highest court of Puerto Rico, so substantial as to preclude the summary disposition made of this case by the Court of Appeals.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Article 152 of the Puerto Rico Mortgage Law, Rev.St. and Codes 1913 ,  6836, provides:\n'A mortgage credit may be conveyed or assigned to a third person in whole or in part, provided it be effected by means of a public instrument, notice of which is given to the debtor, and that it be recorded in the registry.\n\n'The debtor shall not be bound by said contract to any further extent than he was by his own.\n\n The assignee shall be subrogated to all the rights of the assignor.'\n Section 1418 of the Civil Code of Puerto Rico provides:\n'The sale or assignment of a credit includes that of all the accessory rights, such as the security, mortgage, pledge, or privilege.'\n\n Section 1759 of the Civil Code of Puerto Rico provides in part:\n'The pledge and the mortgage are indivisible, even if the debt should be divided among the legal representatives of the debtor or of the creditor.\n\n'Therefore, an heir of the debtor who may have paid a part of the debt can not request that the pledge or mortgage be proportionately extinguished as long as the debt has not been pain in full.\n\n'Neither can the heir of the creditor, who received his part of the debt, return the pledge nor cancel the mortgage to the prejudice of the other heirs who have not been paid.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] As the Puerto Rican Supreme Court pointed out, the option here could properly be regarded as 'an accessory right' or 'privilege', within the meaning of  1418 of the Civil Code, quoted supra note 1.

HAWES(1944)\n\nArgued: December 6, 1943Decided: January 3, 1944\n\n\n\n Rehearing Denied Jan. 31, 1944. See \n321 \nU.S. 801\n, 64 S.Ct. 515.\n Mr. Henry L. Johnson, Jr., of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. John B. Gunion, of Washington, D.C., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case presents important questions respecting the rule making power of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia touching appeals to that court and the powers of the District Court of the United \n\n[320 \nU.S. 520, 521]\n\u00a0\n States for the District of Columbia to vacate its judgments.\n Rule 10 of the Rules of the Court of Appeals, as it stood when applied in this case, was:\n'No ... judgment ... of the District Court of the United States for the District of Columbia, or of any justice thereof, shall be reviewed by the Court of Appeals, unless the appeal shall be taken within 20 days after the ... judgment ... complained of shall have been made or pronounced. ...'1\n\n In the instant case a judge of the District Court, after a hearing on a complaint and answer, on May 7, 1940, signed a judgment dismissing the complaint. The clerk noted the judgment in the docket. This entry pursuant to Rule 79(a) of the Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c, made the judgment effective at the date of entry. (See Rule 58.)\n The twenty day period for appeal expired May 27 but no notice of appeal was filed until June 3. Rule 77(d) of the Rules of Civil Procedure imposed on the clerk the duty, immediately upon the entry of the judgment, to send notice of such entry, in the way specified by Rule 5, but it is agreed that no such notice was sent.\n June 6 the petitioner filed a motion to enter judgment and to direct the clerk to notify the parties. The reasons stated in support of the motion were that the clerk had failed to enter the day or the month of the judgment as required by the rules of court and had failed to notify the parties. The motion was not acted on until June 24, when the court denied it.\n In the meantime, on June 13, the trial judge ordered the judgment of May 7 vacated 'for the reason that the clerk failed under Rule 77(d) of the Rules of Civil Procedure to serve a notice of the entry of judgment by mail on the plaintiff ... and to make a note in the docket of the \n\n[320 \nU.S. 520, 522]\n\u00a0\n mailing.' The same day the judge signed and filed a second judgment in the same terms as that of May 7, which was duly noted in the docket. The petitioner filed a notice of appeal from this judgment on June 14. The respondent moved to dismiss the appeal as taken out of time. The court below granted the motion and dismissed the appeal. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The petitioner urges that the rule of the court below fixing 20 days as the period within which appeal may be taken is contrary to law and that, even though the rule is valid, the appeal was timely because taken within 20 days of the judgment finally entered.\n First. We hold that Rule 10 of the Court of Appeals is within the competence of that court. The court was established by the Act of February 9, 1893,3 which, in  6, empowered it to 'make such rules and regulations as may be necessary and proper for the transaction of the business to be brought before it and for the tiem and method of the entry of appeals.' The Act of July 30, 1894,4 amended  6 to read that the court might make 'such rules and regulations as may be necessary and proper for the transaction of its business and the taking of appeals to said court.' Both of these statutes were later than the Act of March 3, 1891,5 which created circuit courts of appeals and provided for appeals to such courts within six months after the entry of judgment. The Judicial Code adopted March 3, 1911,6 did not alter or enlarge the provisions of the Act of March 3, 1891, supra.\n In Ex parte Dante, \n228 \nU.S. 429\n, 33 S.Ct. 579, decided April 28, 1913, this court affirmed the validity of Rule 10. This decision necessarily imports that the statute conferring power on \n\n[320 \nU.S. 520, 523]\n\u00a0\n the Court of Appeals to set the time for appeal was not superseded by the legislation creating and defining the jurisdiction of circuit courts of appeals. No reference is made to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in Sec. 8(c) of the Act of February 13, 1925, which reduced to three months the time within which to take appeals to the circuit courts of appeals. \n7\n The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure have not altered statutory provisions respecting the time for taking appeals from district courts. It follows that te court below possesses the statutory power to set the time within which an appeal from the District Court must be taken.\n Second. It goes without saying that the District Court could not extend the period fixed by Rule 10. The respondent urges that the vacation of the judgment of May 7, and the entry of a new judgment on June 13, amounted merely to an attempted extension of the time for appeal; that judgment was duly entered and became final on May 7; that the clerk's neglect to comply with Rule 77(d) in the matter of notice does not affect its validity or its finality, and that the notice of appeal of June 14 was consequently out of time and the court below properly dismissed the appeal on that ground. We cannot agree.\n It is true that Rule 77(d) does not purport to attach any consequence to the failure of the clerk to give the prescribed notice; but we can think of no reason for requiring the notice if counsel in the cause are not entitled to rely upon the requirement that it be given. It may well be that the effect to be given to the rule is that, although the judgment is final for other purposes, it does not become final for the purpose of starting the running of the period for appeal until notice is sent in accordance with the rule. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure permit the amendment or vacation of a judgment for clerical mistakes or \n\n[320 \nU.S. 520, 524]\n\u00a0\n errors arising from oversight or omission and authorize the court to relieve a party from a judgment or order taken against him through his mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect. See Rule 60(a)(b). These rules do not in terms apply to the situation here present, as the court below held. But we think it was competent for the trial judge, in the view that the petitioner relied upon the provisions of Rule 77(d) with respect to notice, and in the exercise of a sound discretion, to vacate the former judgment and to enter a new judgment of which notice was sent in compliance with the rules. The term had not expired and the judgment was still within control of the trial judge for such action as was in the interest of justice to a party to the cause.\n The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to the court below for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n Reversed and remanded.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE dissenting.\n I do not understand that the Court rests its decision on the ground that Rule 77(d) of the Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c, makes notice of entry prerequisite to the finality of the judgment for purposes of appeal. If it does, most else that is said is unnecessary to the decision. In any case what is said seems to me to be untenable in principle and without support in authority.\n To say that a district court can rightly extend the prescribed time for taking an appeal by the reentry, pro forma, of a final judgment after the time to appeal from it has expired, is to disregard considerations of certainty and stability which have hitherto been considered of first importance in the appellate practice of the federal courts. It is to sanction the regulation of the time for appeal by courts, contrary to the appeal statute, and without support in law or any rule of court. Rule 60, which permits \n\n[320 \nU.S. 520, 525]\n\u00a0\n amendment of the judgment or relief of a party from it, in circumstances not here present, gives no warrant for enlarging the time for appeal by reentry of a judgment which is not amended and from no part of which any party has been relieved.\n In the federal courts there is no right to appeal save as it is granted by Congress or a rule of court which is authorized by Congress and has the force of law. See Heike v. United States, \n217 \nU.S. 423, 428\n, 30 S. Ct. 539, 540; Ex parte Dante, \n228 \nU.S. 429, 432\n, 33 S.Ct. 579, 580. It is in the public interest, and it is the very purpose of limiting the period for appeal, to set a definite and ascertainable point of time when litigation shall be at an end unless within that time application for appeal has been made; and if it has not, to advise prospective appellees that they are freed of the appellant's demands. Matton Steamboat Company v. Murphy, \n319 \nU.S. 412, 415\n, 63 S.Ct. 1126, 1128\n\n\n That purpose is defeated if judges may enlarge the time for appeal beyond the period prescribed by law, whether by an order purporting directly to extend it or by reentry, without change, of a judgment which has already become final. It is for that reason that this Court has consistently ruled that no federal judge or court possesses the power to extend the time for appeal beyond the statutory period by any form of judicial action which falls short of a reconsideration of the provisions of the judgment in point of substance so as to postpone its finality.\n The decisions are numerous and diligence of court and counsel has revealed no exceptions. Credit Company v. Arkansas Central R. Co., \n128 \nU.S. 258\n, 9 S.Ct. 107, is representative of the unbroken current of authority. There, in dismissing an appeal as untimely the Court, speaking by Mr. Justice Bradley, said at page 261 of 128 U.S., at page 108 of 9 S.Ct.: 'The attempt made, in this case, to anticipate the actual time of presenting and filing the appeal, by entering an order nunc pro tunc, does not help the case. When the time for taking an \n\n[320 \nU.S. 520, 526]\n\u00a0\n appeal has expired it cannot be arrested or called back by simple order of court. If it could be, the law which limits the time within which an appeal can be taken would be a dead letter.'\n At the last term of Court we held that the reentry of its final judgment by a state appellate court, with only formal changes not affecting any matter adjudicated, did not enlarge the time to appeal to this Court. Department of Banking v. Pink, \n317 \nU.S. 264\n, 63 S.Ct. 233. And at the same term we held that a motion to amend a final judgment would not toll the time for appeal unless the amendments proposed were of substance rather than form, Leishman v. Associated Wholesale Electric Co., \n318 \nU.S. 203, 205\n, 206 S., 63 S.Ct. 543, 544,-an inquiry which presupposed that reentry of the judgment without formal change could not enlarge the time. To the same effect are Pfister v. Northern Illinois Finance Corp., \n317 \nU.S. 144\n, 149-151, 63 S.Ct. 133, 137, 138; Zimmern v. United States, \n298 \nU.S. 167\n, 56 S.Ct. 706. And in Wayne United Gas Co. v. Owens- Illinois Glass Co., \n300 \nU.S. 131, 137\n, 57 S.Ct. 382, 385, this Court, citing In re Stearns & White Co., 7 Cir., 295 F. 833; Bonner v. Potterf, 10 Cir., 47 F.2d 852, 855; United States v. East, 8 Cir., 80 F.2d 134, 135, declared that where it appears that a rehearing has been granted only for the purpose of extending the time of appeal the appeal must be dismissed-a statement equally applicable to the reentry of the judgment solely for that purpose.\n Petitioner, by the exercise of the diligence required by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure could have learned of the entry of the judgment against him and have taken a timely appeal. His case is not hard enough to afford even the proverbial apology for our saying that federal judges, by the reentry of a judgment for no other purpose, are free to make a dead letter of the statutory limit of the period for appeal.\n Mr. Justice MURPHY concurs. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] February 1, 1941, the rule was amended to substitute a period of 30 days for the 20 days theretofore provided. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 76 U.S.App.D.C. 308, 132 F.2d 569. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] C. 74, 27 Stat. 434. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] C. 172, 28 Stat. 160, D.C.Code 1940,  11-205. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] C. 517,  11, 26 Stat. 826, 829, 28 U.S.C.A.  230 note. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] 36 Stat. 1087, 28 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] C. 229, 43 Stat. 936, 940, 28 U.S.C.A.  230. \n\n\n\n\n","56":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHUDDLESTON v. DWYER(1944)\nNo. 628\nArgued: Decided: May 15, 1944\n\n\n\n\n[322 \nU.S. 232, 233]\n\u00a0\n Mr. William E. Davis, of Kansas City, Mo., for petitioners.\n Mr. William L. Curtis, of Fort Smith, Ark., for respondents.\n\n PER CURIAM.\n Respondents are owners of defaulted paving bonds issued by the City of Poteau in LeFlore County, Oklahoma, the bonds being secured by assessments for benefits, payable in ten annual installments, upon the property in two improvement districts established by the city, including certain lots owned by the county, and others belonging to the city, which it later conveyed to the county. Respondents brought suit in 1937 in the District Court for Eastern Oklahoma, against the county, its Board of Commissioners and other officers of the county and city, alleging diversity of citizenship, and seeking a judgment fixing the county's liability under state law for the assessments and asking mandamus to compel a tax levy by the county officials for the payment of the overdue assessments, and other relief.\n The District Court dismissed the complaint. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed and remanded the cause to the District Court with directions to determine the amounts due on the respective assessments against the lots in question, and in the event of failure to provide funds for the payment of the judgment, then to entertain jurisdiction in an ancillary proceeding in mandamus to compel the necessary tax levies. Dwyer v. LeFlore County, 97 F.2d 823. The District Court entered judgment accordingly, retaining jurisdiction for such action as might be necessary to effectuate the judgment. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 232, 234]\n\u00a0\n No funds having been provided for payment of the overdue assessments, respondents brought the present proceeding in the District Court for mandamus, to compel petitioners, County Commissioners and other county officers, to make the tax levies necessary for payment of the amounts adjudged to be due. The District Court gave judgment for mandamus, in effect directing petitioners, beginning with the fiscal year 1942-3, to make ten annual levies in connection with the county general fund levies, sufficient to pay successively the ten assessment instalments which became due and payable in the years 1925 to 1934 inclusive, with interest at 12% from the due date of the annual instalments until August 13, 1937, the date when the complaint was filed, and thereafter with interest at the rate of 6% per annum upon the aggregate of such instalments and interest already accrued.\n One of the defenses to the petition for mandamus in the District Court was that under Oklahoma law a county is without authority to levy and collect a tax in one year to pay improvement assessments which became due in an earlier year. This defense was urged on appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals which overruled it and affirmed the judgment of the District Court, 10 Cir., 137 F.2d 383, after an examination of the Oklahoma authorities, including Independent School District No. 39 v. Exchange National Co., 164 Okl. 176, 23 P.2d 210, 95 A.L.R. 685; First National Bank in Wichita v. Board of Education, 174 Okl. 164, 49 P.2d 1077; Board of Education v. Johnston, 189 Okl. 172, 115 P.2d 132, and Wilson v. City of Hollis, decided by the Oklahoma Supreme Court on October 6, 1942 and not officially reported. The Court of Appeals found none of these cases to be precisely in point but concluded that the Supreme Court of Oklahoma had consistently and pointedly avoided the announcement of the rule contended for. It accordingly held that the District Court had correctly directed tax levies to provide for payment, from the \n\n[322 \nU.S. 232, 235]\n\u00a0\n general tax fund, of the overdue instalments of the improvement assessments, with interest as prescribed.\n Petitioners filed a timely petition for rehearing which was denied on September 1, 1943. On December 17, 1943, petitioners moved for leave to file a second petition for rehearing which the Circuit Court of Appeals denied. In their second petition, petitioners brought to the attention of the court and relied upon an opinion of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma in Wilson v. City of Hollis, of October 23, 1943, 142 P.2d 633, which had superseded its earlier opinion on which the Circuit Court of Appeals had relied in its opinion in this case. Petitioners contended that by its later opinion the Supreme Court of Oklahoma had determined that Oklahoma law did not authorize the levy of a general fund tax to pay assessment instalments which fell due in prior years, but that such instalments could be paid only from a sinking fund levy, and that no statutory penalties or additional interest for delinquency could be collected.\n In its second opinion the Supreme Court of Oklahoma reexamined in detail the mode of enforcing past due installments of improvement assessments against the property of municipalities and counties in Oklahoma. It differentiated between the liability of municipally owned and privately owned property located within improvement districts, and it appears to have held, with respect to the former, that under the applicable provisions of the Oklahoma statutes mandamus to enforce the levy of a general fund tax will lie only in the year in which the assessment installment falls due, that money from the general fund cannot be applied to the payment of obligations of a prior fiscal year, and that 'no delinquency that will carry with it additional interest or penalty can accrue against public property'. It said that judgment could be rendered against a county or municipality for past due installments which could be paid as are other judgments against a \n\n[322 \nU.S. 232, 236]\n\u00a0\n county or municipality under Okla.Const. Art. 10,  28 and 62 O.S.1941  431 et seq., i.e., in three annual installments out of sinking fund levies. In announcing these conclusions the Supreme Court of Oklahoma stated that it found confusion arising out of its decisions on this subject, and that it was forced to reexamine its earlier decisions, including some of those on which the Circuit Court of Appeals had relied in deciding this case, to differentiate some, and to bring others into conformity with its conclusions announced in the Wilson case. In particular it declared that Independent School District No. 39 v. Exchange National Co., supra, and First National Bank in Wichita v. Board of Education, supra, were in part overruled.\n State law is the controlling rule of decision in this case as to both substantive and procedural rights of the parties. Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, \n304 \nU.S. 64\n, 58 S.Ct. 817, 114 A.L.R. 1487; Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, rules 69(a), 81(b), 28 U.S.C. following  723c, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c. It is the duty of the federal appellate courts, as well as the trial court, to ascertain and apply the state law where, as in this case, it controls decision. Meredith v. Winter Haven, \n320 \nU.S. 228\n, 64 S.Ct. 7. And a judgment of a federal court ruled by state law and correctly applying that law as authoritatively declared by the state courts when the judgment was rendered, must be reversed on appellate review if in the meantime the state courts have disapproved of their former rulings and adopted different ones. 'Until such time as the case is no longer sub judice, the duty rests upon federal courts to apply state law under the Rules of Decision statute in accordance with the then controlling decision of the highest state court.' Vandenbark v. Owens- Illinois Co., \n311 \nU.S. 538, 543\n, 61 S.Ct. 347, 350.\n The second opinion of the Oklahoma Supreme Court in the Wilson case has at least raised such doubt as to the applicable Oklahoma law as to require its reexamination \n\n[322 \nU.S. 232, 237]\n\u00a0\n in the light of that opinion and of later decisions of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma on which respondents rely, before pronouncement of a final judgment in the case by the federal courts. That doubt is not to be resolved in the first instance by this Court. We have often had occasion to point out the importance to the orderly judicial administration of state laws in the federal courts that questions of state law required to be decided here should first be considered and decided by the state or federal court from which the case is brought to this Court for review. Dorchy v. Kansas, \n264 \nU.S. 286, 290\n, 291 S., 44 S.Ct. 323, 324, 325; State of Missouri ex rel. Wabash R. Co. v. Public Service Com., \n273 \nU.S. 126, 131\n, 47 S.Ct. 311, 313; Ruhlin v. New York Life Ins. Co., \n304 \nU.S. 202, 206\n, 207 S., 58 S.Ct. 860, 861; New York ex rel. Whitman v. Wilson, \n318 \nU.S. 688, 690\n, 691 S., 63 S.Ct. 840, 841. The decision of the highest court of a state on matters of state law are in general conclusive upon us, and ordinarily we accept and therefore do not review, save in exceptional cases, the considered determination of questions of state law by the intermediate federal appellate courts, cf. Ruhlin v. New York Life Ins. Co., supra. When we are called upon to decide them, the expression of the views of the judges of those courts, who are familiar with the intricacies and trends of local law and practice, if not indispensable, is at least a highly desirable and important aid to our determination of state law questions. This Court will not ordinarily decide them without that aid where they may conveniently first be decided by the court whose judgment we are called upon to review. See, e.g., Ruhlin v. New York Life Ins. Co., supra; Rosenthal v. New York Life Ins. Co., \n304 \nU.S. 263, 264\n, 58 S.Ct. 874, 875; West v. A.T. & T.

Winter Haven, supra.\n Accordingly, without passing on any of the other contentions of the parties, we vacate the judgment below and remand the cause to the Circuit Court of Appeals so that it may reconsider its decision in the light of the decisions \n\n[322 \nU.S. 232, 238]\n\u00a0\n and opinions of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma in the Wilson and later cases.\n So ordered.\n Vacated and remanded. \n\n\n\n","57":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nILLINOIS STEEL CO. v.

The shipments were from Gary, Indiana, to Baltimore, Maryland, over the lines of connecting railroads, of which respondent was the terminal carrier. Each bill of lading1 contained a clause, inserted by petitioner, the consignor, in conformity to instructions appearing on the bill, and providing that freight was 'to be prepaid'; and also the so-called non-recourse clause which petitioner signed and which read: 'If this shipment is to be delivered to the consignee without recourse on the consignor, the consignor shall sign the following statement: The carrier shall not make delivery of this shipment without payment of freight and all other lawful charges. (See Section 7 of conditions.)'2 Petitioner at shipment paid the freight charges specified in the bills of lading, which were computed at the export freight rate. The bills of lading included a receipt for specified sums paid \n\n[320 \nU.S. 508, 510]\n\u00a0\n to the carrier 'to apply in prepayment of the charges'. The record does not disclose who was the owner of the sulphate, or what further relations existed between consignor and consignee.\n The parties concede that upon delivery of the shipments at Baltimore, the consignee did not handle the sulphate as required by the provisions of the export tariff, and that the delivery or the method of handling subjected the shipments to the higher domestic freight rate. The parties have also stipulated that respondent is entitled to recover from petitioner, additional freight charges to the extent of the difference between the export rate and the higher domestic rate, unless recovery is barred by the clauses of the bills of lading to which we have referred.\n Respondent brought the present suit in the Illinois Superior Court to recover the additional freight due upon the shipments. The Superior Court gave judgment for petitioner, which the Illinois Appellate Court reversed, 316 Ill.App. 516, 46 N.E.2d 144, and the Illinois Supreme Court denied leave to appeal. We granted certiorari, \n320 \nU.S. 721\n, 64 S.Ct. 38, the interpretation of the uniform bill of lading in the circumstances of this case being a question of public importance.\n Pursuant to Congressional authority, the Interstate Commerce Commission has prescribed uniform forms of bills of lading, including that involved in this case.

It has found that the prescribed forms are just and reasonable, 52 I.C.C. 671, 740, and that any other would be unreasonable, 64 I.C.C. 357, 360, 361, 364.\n The construction of the clauses of a bill of lading, adopted by the Commission and prescribed by Congress for interstate rail shipments, presents a federal question. \n\n[320 \nU.S. 508, 511]\n\u00a0\n Georgia, Florida & Alabama Ry. Co. v. Blish Milling Co., \n241 \nU.S. 190, 194\n, 195 S., 36 S.Ct. 541, 543; Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co. v. Martin, \n283 \nU.S. 209, 212\n, 213 S., 51 S.Ct. 453, 455. Such has been the consistent ruling of this Court where the question presented concerned the conditions in bills of lading affecting the liability of the carrier such as are required by the Carmack Amendment, as amended, 49 U.S.C.  20(11), 49 U.S.C.A.  20(11). Georgia, Florida & Alabama Ry. Co. v. Blish Milling Co., supra; Atchison, Topeka & S.F. Ry. Co. v. Harold, \n241 \nU.S. 371\n, 36 S. Ct. 665; St. Louis, Iron Mt. & S. Ry. Co. v. Starbird, \n243 \nU.S. 592\n, 37 S.Ct. 462; Gulf, Colo. & S.F. Ry. Co. v. Texas Packing Co., \n244 \nU.S. 31, 34\n, 37 S.Ct. 487, 488; American Ry. Exp. Co. v.

Railway Express Agency, \n316 \nU.S. 350\n, 62 S.Ct. 1171\n\n\n Since the clauses of the uniform bill of lading govern the rights of the parties to an interstate shipment and are prescribed by Congress and the Commission in the exercise of the commerce power, they have the force of federal law and questions as to their meaning arise under the laws and Constitution of the United States. Hence we have jurisdiction to review their determination by the state courts, in a suit by the carrier to recover freight charges. Judicial Code  237(b), 28 U.S.C.  344(b), 28 U. S.C.A.  344(b); Pittsburgh, Cinc., C. & St. L. Ry. Co. v. Fink, \n250 \nU.S. 577\n, 581-583, 40 S.Ct. 27, 28; New York Central & H.R.R. Co. v. York & Whitney Co., \n256 \nU.S. 406, 408\n, 41 S.Ct. 509, 510; cf. Sola Electric Co. v. Jefferson Co., \n317 \nU.S. 173, 176\n, 177 S., 63 S.Ct. 172, 173, 174; Peyton v. Railway Express Agency, supra; Southern Ry. Co. v. Prescott, \n240 \nU.S. 632, 639\n, 640 S., 36 S.Ct. 469, 472.\n The shipments by petitioner being in interstate commerce, the rail freight rates are those stated in the tariffs filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission. They cannot be lawfully released by the carrier or altered by others who have assumed the duty to pay them. See Midstate Horticultural Co., Inc. v. Pennsylvania R.R. Co., \n320 \nU.S. 356\n, 64 S.Ct. 128, decided November 22, 1943; Pittsburgh, Cinc., c. & St. L. Ry. Co. v. Fink, supra, 250 U.S. \n\n[320 \nU.S. 508, 512]\n\u00a0\n 581-583, 40 S.Ct. 27, 28. The tariffs do not prescribe who is to pay the freight charges, but subject to the prohibition against unlawful discrimination. and the limitations imposed by the uniform bill of lading, the parties to the shipment, as between themselves, are free to stipulate who shall pay them. See Louisville & N.R.R. Co. v. Central Iron Co., \n265 \nU.S. 59\n, 65-67, 44 S.Ct. 441, 442.\n Section 7 of the conditions of the uniform bill of lading provides that the owner or consignee shall pay the freight and all other lawful charges upon the transported property, and except in those instances where it may be lawfully authorized to do so, that no railroad carrier shall deliver or relinquish, at destination, possession of the property covered by the bill of lading until all tariff rates and charges have been paid. Cf.  3(2) of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended, 49 U.S.C.  3(2), 49 U.S.C.A.  3(2). But it further provides that 'The consignor shall be liable for the freight and all other lawful charges, except that if the consignor stipulates, by signature, in the space provided for that purpose on the face of this bill of lading that the carrier shall not make delivery without requiring payment of such charges and the carrier, contrary to such stipulation, shall make delivery without requiring such payment, the consignor (except as hereinafter provided3) shall not be liable for such charges. ... Nothing herein shall limit the right of the carrier to require at time of shipment the prepayment or guarantee of the charges. ...' \n\n[320 \nU.S. 508, 513]\n\u00a0\n Under these provisions, if the non-recourse clause is not signed by the consignor, he remains liable to the carrier for all lawful charges. The carrier is free to demand payment in advance by the consignor, or it may decline to make delivery to the consignee until the freight charges are paid or guaranteed, or if delivery is amde to the consignee without payment, the consignee is also liable for all freight charges. But if the non-recourse clause is signed by the consignor and no provision is made for prepayment of freight, delivery of the shipment to the consignee relieves the consignor of liability, see Louisville & N.R.R. Co. v. Central Iron Co., supra, \n265 \nU.S. 66\n, note 3, 44 S.Ct. 442, and acceptance of the delivery establishes the liability of the consignee to pay all freight charges. Pittsburgh, Cinc., C. & St. L. Ry. Co. v. Fink, supra; New York Central & H.R.R. Co. v. York & Whitney Co., supra.\n In the light of these long-established rules of liability the facts of the present case raise only a single question, whether the stipulation in the bills of lading for the prepayment of freight restricts the operation of the non-recourse clause so that, despite its presence in the bills of lading, recourse may be had to petitioner for charges in addition to those which it prepaid at shipment, the additional charges arising only by reason of events which occurred on or after the delivery of the shipments to the consignee.\n The Illinois Appellate Court thought, and respondent argues here, that this liability was imposed on the consignor only because the prepayment clause was so in conflict with the non-recourse clause as to nullify the latter and thus revive the obligation which, in the absence of that clause, rests on the consignor to pay all lawful charges on his shipments. The question is whether there is such a conflict as to require this result. For we must assume that both clauses were intended by the parties to have some effect, and hence, unless unavoidably in conflict, they \n\n[320 \nU.S. 508, 514]\n\u00a0\n must, so far as they reasonably may, be reconciled so that each will have some scope for operation.\n The obvious purpose and effect of the non-recourse clause is to relieve the shipper from liability for freight charges, upon delivery to the consignee. Such a purpose is consistent with an intention that in case of prepayment of a portion of the freight charge, the carrier should, after delivery, look solely to the consignee for the remainder of the charge. Since, by the uniform bill of lading, the parties to a rail shipment are left free to relieve the consignor from liability by their contract, such an arrangement would be within their competence and would release the consignor from liability to the extent of the unpaid freight charges.\n It could not be said that by agreeing to pay a part of the charges in advance, the consignor has agreed to pay more, or that the non-recourse clause would cease to be effective as to the unpaid charges because the consignor had paid or undertaken to pay some of them. The words of  7 of the conditions of the bill of lading are to the effect that if the consignor stipulates that the carrier shall not deliver 'without requiring payment of such charges' and the carrier makes delivery, the consignor 'shall not be liable for such charges'. In this context, 'such charges' are the lawful charges which the consignor has not paid or stipulated to pay in advance.\n We discern no policy underlying the uniform bill of lading or in the provisions of  7 which would deny the application of the non-recourse clause where the consignor has stipulated for advance payment of some but less than all of the lawful charges. And no plausible reason is advanced why an agreement by the consignor to pay a part of the lawful charges should be deemed to deprive him of the benefit of the non-recourse clause beyond the amount he has undertaken to pay. \n\n[320 \nU.S. 508, 515]\n\u00a0\n We think that the same considerations point here to the reconciliation of the conflict which the Illinois court thought to exist in this case. For in the present circumstances we cannot say that the prepayment clause contemplated payment by the consignor of the additional charges demanded at the domestic tariff rate and hence we find no irreconcilable conflict between the prepayment and non-recourse clauses.\n Petitioner's stipulation was that the freight charges were 'to be prepaid' and the bill of lading acknowledged receipt of specified sums 'to apply in prepayment of the charges'. Hence the stipulation was for an obligation to be performed in advance of the transportation or at the most in advance of delivery to the consignee. This obligation could not have contemplated payment of more than all the lawful charges upon the consignor's shipment as tendered and transported in conformity to the billing. No more could prepayment be made, before either shipment or delivery, of a charge which might never be incurred, and which could be, only after the transportation was completed and delivery made to the consignee.\n It is familiar experience, as in this case, that under-charges may occur which could not be subject to prepayment either because they are not lawful charges on the shipment as tendered and billed, or because they depend upon events occurring after the transportation has been completed. In either case we conclude that the reasonable construction of the prepayment clause is that, with respect to these charges, it did not, either by its design or by the intention of the parties, curtail the operation of the non-recourse clause, so as to deprive petitioner, the consignor, of the immunity from liability for which it was entitled to stipulate by the non-recourse clause. See Chicago Great Western Ry. Co. v. Hopkins, D.C., 48 F.Supp. 60. This construction does not leave the carrier unprotected with respect to the collection of unanticipated \n\n[320 \nU.S. 508, 516]\n\u00a0\n freight charges, for it may always insure their collection by demanding the consignor's guarantee of all charges, pursuant to  7 of the conditions of the uniform bill of lading, a provision which presupposes that the prepayment of freight clause is not as broad as the authorized guarantee.\n In the special circumstances of this case we have no occasion to consider the broader contention of petitioner that the prepayment clause contemplated an undertaking upon its part to pay only the amount of freight charges specified on the face of the bill of lading, whether or not they were computed at the lawful rate on the shipments as tendered and billed.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS concurs in the result. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Specimen forms of the uniform bills of lading, prescribed for interstate rail shipments during the period when the shipments concerned in this action were made, may be found in Consolidated Freight Classification No. 7 (1932) pp. 52-56. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section 7 of the conditions of the bill of lading, so far as relevant, is set out at 64 S.Ct. page 512, infra. The parties have stipulated that the non-recourse clause contained in the bills of lading in this case were in the form quoted in the text. The form approved by the Commission varies slightly in details immaterial here. See Consolidated Freight Classification No. 7, supra, p. 52. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The exception, inapplicable here, is in the case where a consignee, other than the consignor, is an agent with no beneficial title in the goods, and has notified the carrier of these facts. In such a case the consignee is not 'liable for transportation charges ... (beyond those billed against him at the time of delivery for which he is otherwise liable) which may be found to be due after the property has been delivered to him', but the consignor is liable for such charges.

DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY(1944)\nNo. 355\nArgued: February 29, 1944Decided: May 15, 1944\n\n\n\n\n[322 \nU.S. 340, 341]\n\u00a0\n Appeal from the Supreme Court of the State of Indiana.\n Messrs. Edward R. Lewis, of Chicago, Ill., and Joseph J. Daniels, of Indianapolis, Ind., for appellants.\n Messrs. Winslow Van Horne and John J. McShane, both of Indianapolis, Ind., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case raises questions concerning the constitutionality of the Indiana Gross Income Tax Act of 1933 (L.1933, p. 388, Burns' Ind.Stats.Ann .  64-2601 et seq.) as construed and applied to certain business transactions of appellant companies. The suit was brought by appellants to recover gross income taxes paid to Indiana during the years 1935 and 1936. The Indiana Supreme Court sustained objections to the imposition of the tax on certain sales but allowed the tax to be imposed on other types of transactions. 221 Ind. 416, 47 N.E.2d 150. The correctness of the latter ruling is challenged by the appeal which brings the case here. Judicial Code  237(a), 28 U.S.C.  344(a), 28 U.S.C.A.  344(a), 28 U.S.C.  861a, 28 U.S.C.A.  861a.\n Appellants are corporations authorized to do business in Indiana but incorporated under the laws of other States. They manufacture farm implements and motor trucks and sell those articles both at wholesale and retail. During the period here in question they maintained manu- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 340, 342]\n\u00a0\n facturing plants at Richmond and Fort Wayne, Indiana and selling branches at Indianapolis, Terre Haute, Fort Wayne, and Evansville, Indiana. They also had manufacturing plants and sales branches in adjoining States and elsewhere. Each branch had an assigned territory. In some instances parts of Indiana were within the exclusive jurisdiction of branch offices which were located outside the State. The transactions which Indiana says may be taxed without infringement of the federal Constitution are described by the Indiana Supreme Court as follows:\n'Class C: Sales by branches located outside Indiana to dealers and users residing in Indiana. The orders were solicited in Indiana and the customers took delivery to themselves at the factories in Indiana to save time and expense of shipping.1\n\n'Class D: Sales by branches located in Indiana to dealers and users residing outside of Indiana, in which the customers came to Indiana and accepted delivery to themselves in this state.2\n\n'Class E: Sales by branches located in Indiana to dealers and users residing in Indiana, in which the \n\n[322 \nU.S. 340, 343]\n\u00a0\n goods were shipped from points outside Indiana to customers in Indiana, pursuant to contracts so providing.3\n\n The gross income tax4 collected on those transactions is the same one which was before this Court in Depart- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 340, 344]\n\u00a0\n ment of Treasury v. Wood Preserving Corp., \n313 \nU.S. 62\n, 61 S.Ct. 885, and J. D. Adams Mfg. Co. v. Storen, \n304 \nU.S. 307\n, 58 S.Ct. 913, 117 A.L.R. 429. The tax was described in the Storen case as 'a privilege tax upon the receipt of gross income.' 304 U.S. at page 311, 58 S.Ct. at page 915, 117 A.L.R. 429. In that case an Indiana corporation which manufactured products and maintained its home office, principal place of business, and factory in Indiana sold those products to customers in other States and foreign countries upon orders taken subject to approval at the home office. It was held that the Commerce Clause (Art. I, Sec. 8 of the Constitution) was a barrier to the imposition of the tax on the gross receipts from such sales. But as we held in the Wood Preserving Corp. case, neither the Commerce Clause nor the Fourteenth Amendment prevent the imposition of the tax on receipts from an intrastate transaction even though the total activities from which the local transaction derives may have incidental interstate attributes.\n The objections under the Commerce Clause and the Fourteenth Amendment to the tax on the receipts from the three classes of sales involved here are equally without merit.\n In the Wood Preserving Corp. case contracts were made outside Indiana for the sale of railroad ties. The respondent-seller, a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Pennsylvania, obtained the ties from producers in Indiana and delivered them to the buyer ( Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co.) in Indiana who immediately loaded them on cars and shipped them out of the State. Payments for the ties were made to the seller in Pennsylvania. We held that Indiana did not exceed its constitutional authority when it laid the tax on the receipts from those sales.\n We see no difference between the sales in the Wood Preserving Corp. case and the Class C sales in the present one which is translatable into a difference in Indiana's \n\n[322 \nU.S. 340, 345]\n\u00a0\n power to tax. The fact that the sales in Class C are made by an out-of- state seller and that the contracts were made outside the State is not controlling. Here as in the Wood Preserving Corp. case, delivery of the goods in Indiana is an adequate taxable event. When Indiana lays hold of that transaction and levies a tax on the receipts which accrue from it, Indiana is asserting authority over the fruits of a transaction consummated within its borders. These sales, moreover, are sales of Indiana goods to Indiana purchasers. While the contracts were made outside the State, the goods were neither just completing nor just starting an interstate journey. It could hardly be maintained that Indiana could not impose a sales tax or a use tax on these transactions. But, as we shall see, if that is the case, there is no constitutional objection to the imposition of a gross receipts tax by the State of the buyer.\n The Class D sales are sales by an Indiana seller of Indiana goods to an out-of-state buyer who comes to Indiana, takes delivery there and transports the goods to another State. The Wood Preserving Corp. case indicates that it is immaterial to the present issue that the goods are to be transported out of Indiana immediately on delivery. Moreover, both the agreement to sell and the delivery took place in Indiana. Those events would be adequate to sustain a sales tax by Indiana. In McGoldrick v. Berwind-White Coal Co., \n309 \nU.S. 33\n, 60 S.Ct. 388, 128 A.L.R. 876, we had before us a question of the constitutionality of a New York City sales tax as applied to purchases from out-of-state sellers. The tax was 'laid upon the buyer, for consumption, of tangible personal property, and measured by the sales price.' Id., 309 U.S. at page 43, 60 S.Ct. at page 391, 128 A.L.R. 876. And it was 'conditioned upon events occurring' within New York, i.e., the 'transfer of title or possession of the purchased property.' Id., 309 U.S. at pages 43, 44, 60 S. Ct. at page 391, 128 A.L.R. 876. Under the principle of that case, a buyer who accepted delivery in New York would not be exempt from the sales tax because he came from without the State and intended to return to \n\n[322 \nU.S. 340, 346]\n\u00a0\n his home with the goods. The present tax, to be sure, is on the seller. But in each a local transaction is made the taxable event and that event is separate and distinct from the transportation or intercourse which is interstate commerce. In neither does the tax aim at or discriminate against interstate commerce. The operation of the tax and its effect on interstate commerce seem no more severe in the one case than in the other. Indeed, if we are to remain concerned with the practical operation of these states taxes rather than with their descriptive labels (Nelson v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., \n312 \nU.S. 359, 363\n, 61 S.Ct. 586, 588, 132 A.L.R. 475), we must acknowledge that the sales tax sustained in the Berwind-White case 'was, in form, imposed upon the gross receipts from an interstate sale.' Lockhart, Gross Receipts Taxes on Interstate Transportation and Communication, 57 Harv.L.Rev. 40, 87. But that case did no more than to hold that those in interstate trade could not complain if interstate commerce carried its share of the burdens of local government which helped sustain it. And there was no showing that more than that was being exacted.\n The sales in Class E embrace those by an Indiana seller to an Indiana buyer where the goods are shipped from points outside the State to the buyer. The validity of the tax on receipts from such sales woiuld seem to follow a fortiori from our recent affirmance per curiam (\n318 \nU.S. 740\n, 63 S.Ct. 666) of Department of Treasury v. Allied Mills, Inc., 220 Ind. 340, 42 N.E.2d 34. In that case an Indiana corporation had one factory in Indiana and two in Illinois. Each factory was given a specified part of Indiana to service-a method of distribution adopted to take advantage of favorable freight rates, not to evade taxes. The issue in the case was whether the Indiana gross income tax could be applied to receipts from sales to resident customers in Indiana to whom deliveries were made from the plants in Illinois pursuant to orders taken in Indiana and accepted in Illinois. The Indiana Supreme Court sustained the \n\n[322 \nU.S. 340, 347]\n\u00a0\n imposition of the tax. We affirmed that judgment on the authority of Felt & Tarrant Mfg. Co. v. Gallagher, \n306 \nU.S. 62\n, 59 S.Ct. 376, and McGoldrick v. Felt & Tarrant Mfg. Co., \n309 \nU.S. 70\n, 60 S.Ct. 404.\n In the latter cases the Felt & Tarrant Co. was an Illinois seller who had agents soliciting orders in California and New York. All orders were forwarded to the Illinois office for approval. If accepted, the orders were filled by shipping the products to the local agent who delivered to the purchaser. At times shipments would be made direct to the buyers. Remittances were made by the customers direct to the Illinois office. In the first of these cases the Court sustained the collection from the seller of the California use tax. In the second we upheld on the authority of McGoldrick v. Berwind-White Coal Co., supra, the imposition by New York City of its sales tax on those purchases.\n We do not see how these cases can stand if the Class E sales are to be exempt on constitutional grounds from the present tax. Indeed the transactions in Class E have fewer interstate attributes than those in the Felt & Tarrant Mfg. Co. cases since the agreements to sell were made in Indiana, both buyer and seller were in Indiana, and payments were made in Indiana. It is of course true that in the Felt & Tarrant Mfg. Co. cases taxes of different names were involved. But we are dealing in this field with matters of substance not with dialectics. Nelson v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., supra. In this case as in the foregoing sales tax cases the taxable transaction is at the final stage of an interstate movement and the tax is on the gross receipts from an interstate transaction. In form the use tax is different since it is levied on intrastate use after the completion of an interstate sale. But we recognized in the Berwind-White case that in that setting the New York sales tax and the California use tax had 'no different effect upon interstate commerce.' 309 U.S. at page 49, 60 S.Ct. at page 394, 128 A.L.R. 876. And \n\n[322 \nU.S. 340, 348]\n\u00a0\n see Nelson v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., supra. The same is true of this Indiana tax as applied to the Class E sales. There is the same practical equivalence whether the tax is on the selling or the buying phase of the transaction. See Powell, New Light On Gross Receipts Taxes, 53 Harv.L.Rev. 909, 929. Each is in substance an imposition of a tax on the transfer of property. In light of our recent decisions it could hardly be held that Indiana lacked constitutional authority to impose a sales tax or a use tax on these transactions. But if that is true, a constitutional difference is not apparent when a 'gross receipts' tax is utilized instead.\n Here as in case of the other classes of sales there is no discrimination against interstate commerce. The consummation of the transaction was an event within the borders of Indiana which gave it authority to levy the tax on the gross receipts from the sales. And that event was distinct from the interstate movement of the goods and took place after the interstate journey ended.\n Much is said, however, of double taxation, particularly with reference to the Class D sales. It is argued that appellants will in all probability be subjected to the Illinois Retailers' Occupation Tax for some of those sales, since that tax is said to be exacted from those doing a retail business in Illinois even though orders for the sales are accepted outside of Illinois and the property is transferred in another State. \n5\n But it will be time to cross that bridge when we come to it. For example, in the Wood Preserving Corp. case the State to which the purchaser took the ties might also have sought to tax the transaction by levying a use tax. But we did not withhold the hand of Indiana's tax collector on that account. Nor is the problem like that of an attempted tax on the gross proceeds of an interstate sale by both the State of the buyer and the State of the seller. Cf. J. D. Adams Mfg. Co. v. Storen, supra. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 340, 349]\n\u00a0\n We only hold that where a State seeks to tax gross receipts from interstate transactions consummated within its borders its power to do so cannot be withheld on constitutional grounds where it treats wholly local transactions the same way. Such 'local activities or privileges' ( McGoldrick v. Berwind-White Coal Co., supra, 309 U.S. at page 58, 60 S.Ct. at page 398, 128 A.L.R. 876) are as adequate to support this tax as they would be to support a sales tax. To deny Indiana this power would be to make local industry suffer a competitive disadvantage.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice JACKSON dissents.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The stipulation states that the 'orders and contracts were accepted by branches outside Indiana' and payments 'were received by branches outside Indiana.' The Class C sales were principally sales of motor trucks manufactured at Fort Wayne and a small amount of goods manufactured at Richmond. In case of wholesale sales it is the custom for the dealer to notify the company at the time he desires delivery that he wants to take delivery of the goods himself at Fort Wayne or Richmond. In the case of retail sales in Class C, 'if the user desires to undertake transportation of the goods to their destination and for that purpose to take delivery at the factory in Indiana, it is the business practice for the contract or order so to state.' \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The stipulation states that the 'orders or contracts were accepted and the sales proceeds were received by the Branch Managers at the branches located within Indiana.' The business custom or practice respecting deliveries in the State to dealers or retail purchasers was the same as in case of the Class C sales. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The stipulation states that the goods in this class were shipped by the company from outside the State, the order or contract specifying that 'shipment should be made from a point outside Indiana to the purchaser in Indiana.' In these cases, moreover, the orders were 'solicited from purchasers residing in Indiana by representatives of Indiana branches, or the orders or contracts were received by mail by Indiana branches. The orders and contracts were accepted by the Branch Manager at branches located within Indiana. Payments of the sales proceeds were received by branches in Indiana. The sales in this class were of goods manufactured outside the State of Indiana.'\n There was no showing, moreover, that goods in this class were of kind that could be obtained only outside Indiana. It seems to be admitted that Class E sales arose when an Indiana branch received orders for goods in quantities which could not be economically carried in stock or where a cheaper freight rate could be obtained by direct shipments from outside Indiana. Cf. Bowman v. Continental Oil Co., \n256 \nU.S. 642\n, 41 S.Ct. 606; Sonneborn Bros. v. Cureton, \n262 \nU.S. 506\n, 43 S.Ct. 643. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] Sec. 2 of the Act provided in part: 'There is hereby imposed a tax, measured by the amount or volume of gross income, and in the amount to be determined by the application of rates on such gross income as hereinafter provided. Such tax shall be levied upon the entire gross income of all residents of the State of Indiana, and upon the gross income derived from sources within the State of Indiana, of all persons and\/or companies, including banks, who are not residents of the State of Indiana, but are engaged in business in this state, or who derive gross income from sources within this state, and shall be in addition to all other taxes now or hereafter imposed with respect to particular occupations and\/or activities.'

Ray M. Stroud, of Madison, Wis., and Edward R. Lewis, of Chicago, Ill., for appellant International Harvester Co.\n Mr. G. Burgess Ela, of Madison, Wis., for appellant Minnesota Mining & Mfg. Co.\n Mr. Harold H. Persons, of Madison, Wis., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These cases come here on appeal under  237(a) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  344(a), 28 U.S.C.A.  344(a), from judgments of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, reviewing and sustaining assessments by appellee, the Wisconsin Department of Taxation, of the Wisconsin Privilege Dividend Tax imposed with respect to appellants, which are foreign corporations doing business in Wisconsin. 243 Wis. 198, 11 N.W.2d 95; 243 Wis. 211, 10 N.W.2d 174. The appellants present again, but in a new aspect, the substance of the question decided in State of Wisconsin v. J. C. Penney Co., \n311 \nU.S. 435\n, 61 S.Ct. 246, 130 A.L.R. 1229. In that case we sustained the constitutionality, under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, of the Wisconsin Privilege Dividend Tax,  3 of Ch. 505 of Wisconsin Laws of 1935, as amended by Ch. 552, Wisconsin Laws of 1935.1 The tax is imposed with respect to both foreign and domestic corporations doing business within the state 'for the privilege of declaring and receiving dividends' out of income derived from property located and business transacted in the state. The payor corporation is required to deduct the tax from the dividends payable to both resident and non-resident stockholders. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 435, 438]\n\u00a0\n Appellants are respectively a New Jersey and a Delaware corporation doing business in Wisconsin. Appellee has assessed the Privilege Dividend Tax with respect to dividends declared and paid by appellant Harvester Company to its stockholders, including non-residents, between December 2, 1935 and October 15, 1937, inclusive, and on dividends similarly declared and paid by appellant Minnesota Mining Company in the years 1936 to 1940, inclusive. In the case of each appellant the tax as assessed was measured by so much of the dividends as were derived from the portion of the corporate surplus attributed by the tax authorities to income earned by the corporation in Wisconsin. The dividends were declared at directors' meetings held outside the state, and the dividend checks were drawn on bank accounts outside the state.\n In the Penney case we sustained the tax in the case of a Delaware corporation doing business in Wisconsin, but having its principal office in New York, holding its meetings and voting its dividends there, and drawing its dividend checks on New York bank accounts. In considering the incidence of the tax in Wisconsin, which could afford a basis for the taxation there although the declaration and payment of the dividend took place outside the state, this Court pointed out that the practical operation of the tax is to impose an additional tax on corporate earnings within Wisconsin, but to postpone the liability for payment of the tax until such earnings are paid out in dividends, and we added, 311 U.S. at page 442, 61 S.Ct. at page 248, 130 A.L.R. 1229: 'In a word, by its general income tax Wisconsin taxes corporate income that is taken in; by the Privilege Dividend Tax of 1935 Wisconsin superimposed upon this income tax a tax on corporate income that is paid out.'\n Since our decision in the Penney case, the Wisconsin Supreme Court has said, in both the Penney case on remand, J. C. Penney Co. v. Tax Comm., 238 Wis. 69, 72, 73, 298 N.W. 186, 134 A.L.R. 908, and in the International Harvester case below, 243 Wis. 198, 204-206, 10 N.W.2d 169, 11 N.W.2d 95, that under the \n\n[322 \nU.S. 435, 439]\n\u00a0\n Wisconsin constitution, the state has no power to lay an income tax on citizens of other states, who are not doing business in Wisconsin, and that the tax is not on the income of the corporation. And in Wisconsin Gas Co. v. Wisconsin Dept. of Taxation, 243 Wis. 216, 10 N.W.2d 140, 146 A.L.R. 1212; cf. Blied v. Wisconsin Foundry Company, 243 Wis. 221, 10 N.W.2d 142, the Court held that the burden of the tax is imposed upon the stockholders so that the corporation is not entitled to deduct the privilege tax from gross income as a business expense, in arriving at net taxable income under the state's income tax law. In the Wisconsin Gas Company case, supra, the Court said, at page 220, 221 of 243 Wis., at page 141 of 10 N.W.2d:\n'We are certain of three things: (1) that the burden of the tax is specifically laid upon the stockholder; (2) that the corporation declaring the dividend must deduct the tax from the dividend and may not under any circumstances treat the tax as a necessary expense of doing business (for state income tax purposes); (3) that the power to levy the tax so construed was authoritatively established in the Penney case.'\n\n From this, appellants argue that the state court has now conclusively declared that the tax is not on income of the corporation, but only on the stockholders' privilege of receiving dividends, and that it must be deducted from the dividends before their payment to the stockholders. Appellants renew the contentions urged in the Penney case that since the declarations of the dividends here in question were made outside the state and the non-resident stockholders received their dividends outside the state, the taxing statute as applied in these cases infringes due process by imposing the tax on stockholders, and on activities and objects outside the territory of the State of Wisconsin, and consequently outside its legislative jurisdiction. Compare Connecticut General Ins. Co. v. Johnson, \n303 \nU.S. 77\n, 58 S.Ct. 436. To this is added the further argument, not presented in the Penney case, that the tax violates the Four- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 435, 440]\n\u00a0\n teenth Amendment because retroactively applied to and measured by Wisconsin income which was earned and carried to appellants' surplus accounts before the enactment of the statute.\n For present purposes we assume that the statute, by directing deduction of the tax from declared dividends, distributes the tax burden among the stockholders differently than if the corporation had merely paid the tax from its treasury and that the tax is thus, in point of substance, laid upon and paid by the stockholders, some of whom might not bear the burden on the tax at all if, without more, it were paid out of the corporate treasury. This is obviously the case here with respect to the deductions from dividends on appellant Harvester's preferred stock, since normally the economic weight of taxes paid by the corporation would be borne by its common stockholders.\n If such is the nature of the tax, a question preliminary to determining its validity is whether appellants have standing to urge here the constitutional objections of their stockholders, who are not parties to the present suits and who alone may be affected adversely by the tax. For appellants are permitted to reimburse themselves for the amounts, which they must pay to the state, by appropriate deductions from the dividends belonging to the stockholders. Appellants' failure in these cases to make the deductions was by their own choice and not by compulsion of the statute. But as the only way by which appellants can avoid the payment of the tax from their own funds is by collecting it from their stockholders' dividends and as appellants would remain liable to the stockholders, certainly to the preferred stockholders, for the amounts to the deductions if not lawfully taken, they are, in either aspect, adversely affected by obedience to the statute, if it is unconstitutional. We therefore conclude that appellants have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute. Cf. Anderson National Bank v. Luckett, \n321 \nU.S. 233, 242\n, 243 S., 64 S.Ct. 599. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 435, 441]\n\u00a0\n For the reasons stated in the Penney case we do not doubt that a state has constitutional power to make a levy upon a corporation, measured by so much of its earnings from within the state as it distributes in dividends, and to make the taxable event the corporation's relinquishment of the earnings to its stockholders. That power is not diminished or altered by the fact that the state courts, for purposes of their own, denominate the levy a tax on the privilege of declaring and receiving dividends, or that they decline to call it an income tax. In determining whether a tax is within the state's constitutional power, we look to the incidence of the tax and its practical operation, and not its characterization by state courts. Shaffer v. Carter, \n252 \nU.S. 37, 55\n, 40 S. Ct. 221, 226, and cases cited; Lawrence v. State Tax Commission, \n286 \nU.S. 276, 280\n, 52 S.Ct. 556, 557, 87 A.L.R. 374, and cases cited.\n Nor do we perceive any constitutional obstacle either to the state's distributing the burden of the tax ratably among the stockholders, as the ultimate beneficiaries of the corporation's activities within the state, and of the state's relinquishment of control over the Wisconsin earnings, so as to render the tax pro tanto one on the stockholders' income, or to the state's imposing on the corporation the duty of acting as its agent for the collection of the tax, by requiring deduction of the tax from earnings distributed as dividends.\n The power to tax the corporation's earnings includes the power to postpone the tax until the distribution of those earnings, and to measure it by the amounts distributed. Compare Curry v. McCanless, \n307 \nU.S. 357, 370\n, 59 S.Ct. 900, 907, 123 A.L.R. 162. In taxing such distributions, Wisconsin may impose the burden of the tax either upon the corporation or upon the stockholders who derive the ultimate benefit from the corporation's Wisconsin activities. Personal presence within the state of the stockholder-taxpayers is not essential to the constitutional levy of a tax taken out of so much of the corporation's Wisconsin earnings as is distributed to them. A state may tax such part of the income \n\n[322 \nU.S. 435, 442]\n\u00a0\n of a non-resident as is fairly attributable either to property located in the state or to events or transactions which, occurring there, are subject to state regulation and which are within the protection of the state and entitled to the numerous other benefits which it confers. Compare Shaffer v. Carter, supra, and Travis v. Yale & Towne Mfg. Co., \n252 \nU.S. 60\n, 40 S. Ct. 228, with Lawrence v. State Tax Commission, supra, and People of State of New York ex rel. Cohn v. Graves, \n300 \nU.S. 308\n, 57 S.Ct. 466, 108 A.L.R. 721. And the privilege of receiving dividends derived from corporate activities within the state can have no greater immunity than the privilege of receiving any other income from sources located there.\n We think that Wisconsin may constitutionally tax the Wisconsin earnings distributed as dividends to the stockholders. It has afforded protection and benefits to appellant's corporate activities and transactions within the state. These activities have given rise to the dividend income of appellants' stockholders and this income fairly measures the benefits they have derived from these Wisconsin activities. There is no contention here that the formula of apportionment does not fairly reflect the proper proportion of appellants' earnings attributable to their Wisconsin activities and transactions. Wisconsin may impose a measure of control upon the corporation there with respect to its withdrawal of its earnings from the state, and also may, for the protection of the interests of the state and of its citizens, regulate to some extent the declaration and distribution of dividends by a foreign corporation, certainly with respect to its Wisconsin earnings. See, e.g., Judge Cardozo in German-American Coffee Co. v. Diehl, 216 N.Y. 57, 109 N.E. 875; New York Stock Corporation Law, Consol.Laws, c. 59,  114. The earnings in Wisconsin, their withdrawal from Wisconsin and their distribution in the form of dividends have resulted in the receipt of income by the stockholder-taxpayers and it is Wisconsin's relation to all which permits it to levy the tax. It may \n\n[322 \nU.S. 435, 443]\n\u00a0\n condition the privilege of earning and disposing of the Wisconsin earnings upon the payment of a tax measured by and collected from the earnings to be distributed as dividends. State of Wisconsin v. J. C. Penney Co., supra.\n The facts that Wisconsin cannot prevent the withdrawal of the earnings from the state or the declaration of the dividends, if they be the facts, have no bearing on its right to measure, in terms of taxes, both the benefits which it has conferred on the stockholders in their relations with the state, and the activities or transactions which are within the reach of its regulatory power. Equitable Life Assur. Society v. Pennsylvania, \n238 \nU.S. 143, 147\n, 35 S.Ct. 829, 830; cf. Mr. Justice Holmes dissenting in Compania General de Tabacos v. Collector, \n275 \nU.S. 87, 99\n, 100 S., 48 S.Ct. 100, 104, 105.\n That the distribution of Wisconsin earnings was effected by the exercise outside Wisconsin of the power to declare dividends does not deprive it of its power to take toll from the income earned there upon its distribution to the stockholders. See Bullen v. Wisconsin, \n240 \nU.S. 625\n, 36 S.Ct. 473; Curry v. McCanless, supra, 307 U.S. pages 366- 370, 59 S.Ct. pages 905- 907, 123 A.L.R. 162, and cases cited; Graves v. Elliott, \n307 \nU.S. 383\n, 59 S.Ct. 913; State Tax Commission v. Aldrich, \n316 \nU.S. 174, 180\n, 62 S.Ct. 1008, 1011, 139 A.L.R. 1436. And the fact that the stockholder-taxpayers never enter Wisconsin and are not represented in the Wisconsin legislature2 cannot deprive it of its jurisdiction to tax. It has never been thought that residence within a state or country is a sine qua non of the power to tax. Cf. Cook v. Tait, \n265 \nU.S. 47\n, 44 S.Ct. 444. So long as the earnings actually arise there, and their withdrawal from the state and ultimate distribution, in whole or in part, to stockholders are \n\n[322 \nU.S. 435, 444]\n\u00a0\n subject to some state control, the conditions of state power to tax are satisfied, see Shaffer v. Carter, supra, 252 U.S. page 55, 40 S.Ct. page 226; State Tax Commission v. Aldrich, supra; compare McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 429, even though some practically effective device be necessary in order to enable the state to collect its tax-here by imposing on the corporation the duty to withhold the tax on so much of the earnings withdrawn from the state as may be distributed in dividends. Imposition of this requirement on the corporation transgresses no constitutional limitations. Nelson v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., \n312 \nU.S. 359, 364\n, 61 S.Ct. 586, 588, 132 A.L. R. 475; Nelson v. Montgomery Ward & Co., \n312 \nU.S. 373\n, 61 S.Ct. 593.\n Appellants press with vigor, as controlling decision here, the denial of the state's power to tax in Connecticut General Ins. Co. v. Johnson, supra. In that case California sought to levy a tax on gross receipts derived from contracts made and to be performed in Connecticut by a Connecticut corporation doing other business in California. But as we said of the Johnson case in the Penney case, supra, \n311 \nU.S. 446\n, 61 S.Ct. 250, 130 A.L.R. 1229: 'In the precise circumstances presented by the record it was found that the tax neither in its measure nor in its incidence was related to California transactions. Here, on the contrary, the incidence of the tax as well as its measure is tied to the earnings which the State of Wisconsin has made possible, ...' and both the earnings and their disposition are subject to state control and hence its power to tax.\n It should be emphasized once again that the Fourteenth Amendment does not in terms or in effect prohibit unwise taxes, merely because they are unwise, or unfair or burdensome taxes, merely because they are unfair or burdensome. The wisdom or fairness of the tax before us are not matters subject to our control or revision. We are only concerned with the power of the state to lay the tax. The power to tax 'is an incident of sovereignty, and is co-extensive with that to which it is an incident. All sub- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 435, 445]\n\u00a0\n jects over which the sovereign power of a State extends, are objects of taxation; ....' McCulloch v. Maryland, supra, 4 Wheat. 429; Curry v. McCanless, supra, \n307 \nU.S. 366\n, 59 S.Ct. 905, 123 A.L.R. 162.\n We conclude that appellants' stockholders can have no constitutional objection to the withholding by Wisconsin of a tax measured by their dividends distributed from Wisconsin earnings.\n Appellants do not deny that the dividends are derived from earnings from within the state of Wisconsin, but it is urged that some of them at least were paid from corporate surplus earned and set aside in years before the taxing statute was enacted. But since the taxable event, the distribution of dividends paid from earnings, and the deduction of the tax from them occurred subsequent to the enactment of the taxing statute, no question of its retroactive application is involved.\n The contention of appellant, the Harvester Company, that the formula for assessing the tax is not one authorized by the statute is not open to consideration here. The State Supreme Court has construed and applied the statute and by its construction we are bound. Meyer, Auditor of State of Oklahoma, v. Wells, Fargo & Co., \n223 \nU.S. 298\n, 32 S.Ct. 218, and Davis v. Wallace, \n257 \nU.S. 478\n, 42 S.Ct. 164, on which appellant relies, were cases coming here from the lower federal courts, in which this Court was required to place its own construction on a state statute which had not been definitively construed by the state courts.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.\n\n Mr. Justice JACKSON, dissenting.\n The facts of one of these cases will make clear the grounds upon which I dissent.\n The International Harvester Company is incorporated under the laws of New Jersey. Its head business office \n\n[322 \nU.S. 435, 446]\n\u00a0\n is in Chicago, Illinois. It has qualified and has been admitted to do business in Wisconsin and in every state in the Union except Nevada. It has sales branches and manufacturing plants in Wisconsin, and in many other states. Proceeds of sales and receipts from operations in Wisconsin and in every other state are sent to the corporation treasury in Chicago and commingled in general funds without segregation or earmarking as to state of origin.\n More than 32,000 stockholders are owners of this enterprise. They are domiciled in every state of the Union, less than 2 per cent of them in Wisconsin. Under the corporation's charter and the applicable law of New Jersey the stockholders may be paid dividends only from its surplus or net profits. Every corporate act connected with payment of dividends takes place in Chicago. There the directors meet to declare them, there the checks are drawn and mailed. They are paid out of the corporation's general funds on deposit in Chicago or New York.\n In 1935 Wisconsin enacted a 'privilege dividend tax.' It provides, with exceptions not material:\n'Section 3. Privilege dividend tax. (1) For the privilege of declaring and receiving dividends, out of income derived from property located and business transacted in this state, there is hereby imposed a tax equal to 3 per cent of the amount of such dividends declared and paid by all corporations (foreign and local) .... Such tax shall be deducted and withheld from such dividends payable to residents and nonresidents by the payor corporation. ...\n\n'(3) Every such corporation hereby made liable for such tax, shall deduct the amount of such tax from the dividends so declared.\n\n'(4) In the case of corporations doing business within and without the state of Wisconsin, such tax shall apply only to dividends declared and paid out of income derived \n\n[322 \nU.S. 435, 447]\n\u00a0\n from business transacted and property located within the state of Wisconsin. ...' Wis.Stat. (1941)  71.60.\n\n Under this last provision the State by formula not now important apportions among the states the surplus from which dividends may be paid and thus determines a proportion of the dividend attributable to earnings in Wisconsin. As applied and sustained in this case, the short of the matter is this: Wisconsin says it may tax 32,000 stockholders, 98 per cent of whom reside in other states. It taxes them when and because they receive a dividend from a corporation not in its internal affairs subject to its laws, by acts not one of which is performed within its borders.\n After the Supreme Court of Wisconsin held this tax invalid it was reinstated by this Court. State of Wisconsin v. J. C. Penney Co., \n311 \nU.S. 435\n, 61 S.Ct. 246, 130 A.L.R. 1229. This was done on the theory that the tax was not what Wisconsin called it but was in substance an income tax on the corporation, deferred until the income was distributed and measured by the amount of the distribution. As so interpreted, it was the federal undistributed profits tax in reverse; it was a distributed profits tax. But the Wisconsin court has respectfully but firmly insisted that it knows whom Wisconsin is taxing and why. It says this is not an income tax, that it is no tax on the corporation, but is a tax on the stockholder when and because he receives a dividend.\n I think the parties are entitled to have the constitutionality of this far-reaching tax decided on the assumption that it is just what the Wisconsin Legislature and Supreme Court say it is. If we do, the question is whether a state may tax nonresident stockholders for receiving from a foreign corporation a dividend from its surplus or undivided profits merely because some time in the past a portion of the surplus was earned in the state.\n We must put out of consideration entirely reasoning by which we sustain state taxation of income of the corpora- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 435, 448]\n\u00a0\n tion. These dividends are not and cannot be regarded as income of the corporation within any legal or accounting definition. These surplus funds constituted income once-at the moment of receipt-and may be counted as income for any period which includes time of receipt. But once received, they became capital funds in the sense that earned surplus becomes capital. When they were distributed they were not income of the corporation. They were its surplus capital funds. Not even the power of this Court can make income of outgo. To speak of 'a tax on corporate income that is paid out' is as self-contradictory as to speak of round squares.\n These dividends of course are income to the stockholder, and any state with jurisdiction to tax him may tax them as such. But I am unable to agree that having 'afforded protection and benefits' to a corporation gives jurisdiction to tax the incomes of all its stockholders. Nor do I think that because the state has once permitted the corporation to do business and make earnings in the state its taxing power follows those earnings into the hands of third persons to whom they may be paid. A dividend when declared becomes a debt of the corporation, enforceable as any other debt. If there is power in Wisconsin, because funds were earned there, to tax the receipt of a dividend, there is no reason why it should not also have power to tax the recipients of corporate funds as wages, salaries, or as payment of any other obligation.\n Moreover, the Court itself apparently feels obligated to abandon the income-tax-on-the-corporation theory in order to avoid the objection of retroactivity. In considering this aspect of the tax it shifts to a 'taxable event' theory which places the event after the enactment of the statute.\n I also find it difficult to accept the statement that there is no 'constitutional obstacle either to the state's distributing the burden of the tax ratably among the stockhold- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 435, 449]\n\u00a0\n ers ... or to the state's imposing on the corporation the duty of acting as its agent for the collection of the tax ....' The relations between different classes of stockholders is fixed by the corporate charter. If this is a tax on the corporation, it is clear that its burden falls upon the equity stockholders and upon them alone. I do not think the State of Wisconsin would have the power to provide that the preferred stockholders of a New Jersey corporation, despite provisions of its charter, should assume a part of the equity burden.\n As supporting this tax, the opinion of the Court says that Wisconsin may impose upon the corporation 'a measure of control ... with respect to its withdrawal' of these earnings, and that their 'ultimate distribution ... to stockholders' is 'subject to some state control.' I do not understand to what reference is made. These earnings lawfully had been added to surplus of a New Jersey corporation, they were represented by funds lawfully transferred to Chicago or New York. From them the corporation made the distribution. What control Wisconsin had over these funds in these circumstances I do not see.\n The act in question does not purport to be one for the protection of local creditors against the corporation's illegal payment of dividends as was the act dealt with by Judge Cardozo in German-American Coffee Co. v. Diehl, 216 N.Y. 57, 109 N.E. 875. This act alters the purely internal relations of different classes of stockholders without in the least affecting their relation to creditors.\n It is impossible to reconcile the taxable-event theory with the benefit theory for supporting this tax. The taxable event clearly is the payment of the dividend. The right to make such payment is not derived from Wisconsin law. The ability to do so does not depend on Wisconsin earnings. The existence of earnings for the period, or of an accumulated surplus, from Wisconsin earnings alone \n\n[322 \nU.S. 435, 450]\n\u00a0\n would not authorize such a dividend. That would depend on net accumulations from all sources and surplus from Wisconsin might be neutralized by losses from operations elsewhere. In such a case it is clear this statute would not even purport to tax, although Wisconsin had extended exactly the same protection to the operations within the state as otherwise. Moreover, if earnings were had in Wisconsin and there were net earnings overall but the corporation should decide to accumulate them, the statute would not purport to lay the Wisconsin tax. These facts make clear that Wisconsin is doing what the Supreme Court of Wisconsin said it was doing. It lays a tax upon the stockholder's dividend. It does not tax the income of the corporation.\n I do not see that the way to tax the dividends of nonresident stockholders can be bridged by 'some practically effective device' necessary 'in order to enable the state to collect its tax-here by imposing on the corporation the duty to withhold the tax.' Do we mean that the state may empower or obligate a foreign corporation to collect for it taxes it is without power to collect itself? The physical power to get the money does not seem to me a test of the right to tax. Might does not make right even in taxation. To hold that what the use of official authority may get the state may keep, and that if it cannot get hold of a nonresident stockholder it may hold the company as hostage for him, is strange constitutional doctrine to me.\n Whatever rights Wisconsin has to reach beyond its borders and tax nonresidents every other state has also. One who puts his savings to work in an enterprise of national scope may be subjected to any number of state taxes on his dividends up to forty-eight. Any number up to forty-seven of them may be levied by states in which he never lived, never went, did no individual business, \n\n[322 \nU.S. 435, 451]\n\u00a0\n and has no vote. Representation is the ordinary guaranty of fairness in taxation.\n I do not think any fact in this case shows jurisdiction in Wisconsin to lay a tax on a privilege she does not grant and could not deny, which is exercised wholly outside of her borders and by those who are not her citizens or her corporate creatures. I see no foundation for the tax Wisconsin has laid and no better foundation for the substitute tax this Court has laid. I would reverse the judgments below. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The statute was re-enacted by  3 of ch. 309 of Wis.Laws of 1937;  1 of ch. 198 of Wis.Laws of 1939;  3 of ch. 63 of Wis.Laws of 1941; and  2 of ch. 367 of Wis.Laws of 1943. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The Wisconsin Privilege Dividend Tax does not discriminate against non-residents or foreign corporations, or place an undue burden on them without a corresponding burden on residents or domestic corporations.

Cavers, of Washington, D.C., for appellee O.P.A.\n Mr. Charles Hershenstein, of Jersey City, N.J., for appellee City of Jersey City.\n\n Mr. Justice JACKSON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a direct appeal by the Interstate Commerce Commission, whose orders the District Court of New Jersey has set aside, and by the Hudson & Manhattan Railroad \n\n[322 \nU.S. 503, 505]\n\u00a0\n Company, whose rates are subject to the enjoined orders. Respondents are the City of Jersey City and the Price Administrator, who intervened under powers duty delegated to him pursuant to the Emergency Price Control Act of 19421 and the Inflation Control or Stabilization Act of 1942.2\n The Hudson & Manhattan Railroad Company owns about 8.5 miles of electric railway, of which all but .63 miles is underground. It has two double-track lines, one of which, known as the 'uptown line,' connects Hoboken, New Jersey, with Christopher Street, New York, by who parallel tunnels under the Hudson River, and runs uptown under Sixth Avenue from Christopher Street to a terminal at 33rd Street. The other line, known as the 'downtown line,' crosses under the river by two parallel tunnels between Exchange Place, Jersey City, and Hudson Terminal, New York. It also extends westwardly in Jersey City to Journal Square, where connection is made with the Pennsylvania Railroad. The uptown and downtown lines are connected on the New Jersey side by means of a line paralleling the Hudson River. In conjunction with the Pennsylvania Railroad the Hudson & Manhattan operates a joint rapid-transit service between Hudson Terminal and Newark. It carries only passengers.\n The present controversy has its roots in a rate case precipitated by the Company's effort to establish a 10-cent fare on its downtown line in 1937.3 After full hear- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 503, 506]\n\u00a0\n ings the Interstate Commerce Commission fixed an 8-cent fare effective July 25, 1938.'4 The 10-cent fare was denied chiefly on the ground that, while the Company might be entitled to the revenue, such a fare would decrease its patronage, and the Commission believed that an 8-cent fare would produce more revenue. Commissioners Miller and Mahaffie dissented from denial of the 10-cent fare on such grounds, holding it had been 'amply justified' as 'reasonable and lawful for the services performed.' This Court held such grounds of denial to be sustained by evidence and to be within the Commission's discretion. Hudson & Manhattan Railway Co. v. United States, \n313 \nU.S. 98\n, 61 S.Ct. 884. The 8-cent fare remained in effect until the carrier on June 27, 1942 filed a petition in the same proceeding for further hearing, alleging changed conditions and increased costs in support of a 10-cent fare on the downtown line. Protests were filed by the City of Jersey City and the Hudson Bus Corporation. The Commission opened the proceeding and extensive hearings were held in September of 1942. Counsel for the Price Administrator appeared, stating that it was not his intention to offer evidence but that he reserved the right to make any motions and to file appropriate briefs. The hearings were concluded on September 19, 1942\n\n\n The Inflation Control Act of 1942, passed on October 2d, contained a proviso that 'no common carrier or other public utility shall make any general increase in its rates or charges which were in effect on September 15, 1942, unless it first gives thirty days notice to the President, or such agency as he may designate, and consents to the timely intervention by such agency before the Federal, State, or municipal authority having jurisdiction to consider such increase.'  1. Thereafter the Price Admin- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 503, 507]\n\u00a0\n istrator5 asked permission to and did file a brief opposing any increase in the rates. On January 25, 1943, the hearing examiner recommended that the Commission find the rate of 10 cents on the downtown lines to be just and reasonable. Exceptions were filed by Jersey City and the Price Administrator and argued by counsel for each, and on June 8, 1943 the Commission made its decision. \n6\n It reviewed the increases in operating costs since the 8-cent rate had been fixed and the need of the railroad for additional revenue 'in order to meet increased operating expenses and the interest on its bonds.' It increased the downtown fare from 8 cents to 9 cents, effective for duration of the war and six months thereafter, with permission to any of the parties to bring to the attention of the Commission additional facts if the revenue results should prove materially different from the Commission's estimate. The Commission's opinion considered the arguments of the Price Administrator against any increase, but said, 'It seems to us that an increase of 1 cent in respondent's downtown fare is unlikely to have any inflationary effect, and that the effect thereof upon the cost of living, while a factor to be given consideration, will be so slight, a maximum of about 12 cents a week and 52 cents a month per passenger, as to be negligible. We believe, therefore, that the increased fare herein approved will not be in conflict with the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942, as amended.' Three Commissioners dissented, holding that the Company had established its right to a 10-cent fare.\n A month later the railroad filed a petition for reconsideration. Among other things, it alleged that it could \n\n[322 \nU.S. 503, 508]\n\u00a0\n not avail itself of the 9-cent rate because its fare collection boxes could not handle the volume of coins necessitated by the 9-cent rate and under war conditions could not be replaced. It asked to charge a 10-cent fare until it could secure tokens. Jersey City answered, asking that the petition be denied and the 9-cent fare suspended. The Price Administrator also answered. He advocated what he called a feasible scheme to collect the 9-cent fare through the use of paper tickets. The Price Administrator also asked that the fares go back to 8 cents in view of alleged increased earnings and asked that in any event before the fares were increased on the basis suggested by the Company a further hearing be held. On August 3, 1943, the Commission issued a report and order. \n7\n It found that it would be impossible to collect a 9-cent cash fare, and it authorized an alternative basis of eleven tokens for $1.00 or a cash fare of 10 cents, provided the same alternative basis be put into effect on the uptown line. This resulted, of course, in a rate of 9 1\/11 cents to token purchasers on both lines.\n Thereupon Jersey City filed a complaint in the District Court, asking that the Commission's order be enjoined 'in so far as such order permits the establishment of any local interstate fare in excess of nine cents for transportation on the downtown line.' It alleged that in authorizing downtown fares 'in excess of the nine cent fare' fixed in the order of June 8, the Commission had deprived Jersey City of its full day in court by refusing it opportunity to cross-examine witnesses and present counter- evidence.\n The Commission then reopened the proceeding on its own motion, but only 'to permit any party hereto to present evidence directed solely to the propriety and lawfulness of the modification made by the Commission in its report of August 3, 1943, on further consideration of its prior findings and orders of July 11, 1938 and June 8, \n\n[322 \nU.S. 503, 509]\n\u00a0\n 1943' and to afford the right to cross-examine adverse witnesses. The Commission in its later report of November 2, 1943 referred to this reopening as being 'out of an abundance of caution.' At the reopened proceeding the Company offered testimony about the impracticability of collecting a 9 cent fare, and as to the earnings that would be derived from the proposed token and cash combination fares upon the assumption, supported by testimony, that 90 per cent of the passengers probably would purchase tokens. The examiner ruled that the basis of the 9-cent fare fixed by the order of June 8, 1943 was not in issue and confined evidence to the issues specified in the Commission's order. The Price Administrator offered a condensed income statement for the Hudson & Manhattan for the first seven months of 1943. The examiner declined to receive it, because it went only to the Company's need for revenue, an inquiry which was not reopened. The Price Administrator previously had submitted to the Commission a similar statement for five months of 1943, as part of its reply to the railroad's petition for modification of the 9-cent fare. The Commission in its report of August 3d rejected this statement as being without probative value. Neither of the statements showed the income of appellant from its railroad operations, but included income of the corporation from all operations, including the Hudson Terminal buildings in New York City and other real estate owned by it. The Price Administrator also petitioned the Commission for modification of the reopening order 'in order that the said record be brought up to date.' The purpose of this was stated to be to show that as a result of the war the earnings of the Company at an 8-cent fare for the full year 1943 would exceed the amount the Commission found adequate and reasonable in its 1938 order or in the order of June 8, 1943.\n On November 2, 1943 the Commission issued its report and order, allowing a 10-cent cash fare or eleven tokens \n\n[322 \nU.S. 503, 510]\n\u00a0\n for $1.00 as the rate on both the downtown and uptown lines. The Commission considered in its opinion the request of Jersey City and the Price Administrator that the limitations on the hearings should be removed and the whole rate case thrown open again. It pointed out that the complaint of Jersey City pending in the District Court did not question the propriety of the Commission's authorization of an increase in the downtown fare from 8 cents to 9 cents but challenged only the increase from 9 cents to 9 1\/11 cents with tokens and 10 cents in cash. It considered the offer of proof made in the hearings and said: 'Considering the contents of the motion now before us, and the offers of additional evidence made at the recent further hearing, we have no reason to believe that, if the additional hearing sought were held, we would feel warranted in modifying our findings as made in the second report. As will later appear, the alternative, fare basis herein approved can not be expected to yield materially better revenue results to respondent than we anticipated at the time of the second report. Accordingly, we see no sufficient reason for further reopening this proceeding at this time, and the motion will therefore be overruled.' On the merits the Commission said:\n'Upon the amplified record now before us, we find that the following basic facts, as underscored, have been established:\n\n'1. It is impracticable for respondent to collect a cash fare of 9 cents.\n\n'2. There is available to respondent no practicable method of collecting a fare of, or approximating, 9 cents except by the use of tokens.\n\n'3. The use of tokens only for the local downtown traffic, while contemporaneously using cash fares for the other local traffic of respondent, is impracticable. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 503, 511]\n\u00a0\n\n'4. The use of an alternative-fare basis of 11 tokens for $1 or a cash fare of a dime for local interstate passengers on both the downtown and uptown lines is the only practicable method now available by which respondent can reasonably be expected to obtain the financial benefits contemplated by our findings and conclusions in the second report as necessary to insure adequate transportation service.\n\n\n'5. The modification of our prior findings as made in the third report of August 3, 1943, is not in conflict with the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942, as amended by the Stabilization Act.\n\n'6. A cash fare of 10 cents for the occasional or irregular passenger on the downtown line compares favorably with the reasonable charge made for similar service on railroads generally.'\n\n On the basis of these findings the Commission authorized a fare of eleven tokens for $1.00 or a cash fare of 10 cents, payable by a dime, as reasonable and otherwise lawful for application during the war and for six months after its termination.\n Jersey City thereupon amended its complaint pending in the District Court. It asked that the Commission's order of June 8, 1943, which established the 9-cent rate, as well as that of November 2, 1943, which modified it as stated, be enjoined, in so far as such order permitted any fare on appellant's downtown line in excess of 8 cents. The Price Administrator intervened, alleging that an increase over the 8-cent fare in effect on September 15, 1942 was in violation of the Stabilization Act. The United States was named as a defendant but filed a neutral answer because two government agencies were in opposition to each other. The Commission and the railroad answered. A statutory court of three judges was constituted and \n\n[322 \nU.S. 503, 512]\n\u00a0\n an interlocutory injunction was granted November 26, 1943.\n On January 12, 1944 a majority of the court below, one judge dissenting, held both of the Commission's orders invalid upon two grounds. It was of the view that the Commission had denied a full hearing in refusing to reopen the whole proceeding to receive evidence relating to the 1943 earnings of the carrier, and it held that the Commission had brushed aside too lightly the economic stabilization arguments of the Price Administrator. The effect of the District Court's order is to disallow not only the token and cash combination fare, but also the 9-cent fare which the Commission found just, reasonable and lawful, and to continue the 8-cent rate fixed in 1938 and held by the Commission to have become clearly inadequate to the rights and needs of the Company.\n Each of the findings of fact by the Commission appears to be supported by substantial evidence. The court below has not found to the contrary, nor do we. Reasonable persons could no doubt differ as to whether it is probable that 90 per cent of the patrons will purchase tokens, whether the revenues of the lines will increase more than the operating costs, and as to various other features of the contest. But when this same railroad came to us complaining of such predicative findings we refused to review the weight of evidence and held that being supported by evidence the judgment of the Commission was final. Hudson & Manhattan R. Co. v. United States, \n313 \nU.S. 98\n, 61 S.Ct. 884. Of course we cannot hold that the judgment of the Commission is less final merely because it has been exercised on this occasion for relief of the Company.\n'Moreover, the Commission's order does not become suspect by reason of the fact that it is challenged. It is the product of expert judgment which carries a presumption of validity. And he who would upset the rate order under the Act carries the heavy burden of making a con- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 503, 513]\n\u00a0\n vincing showing that it is invalid because it is unjust and unreasonable in its consequences.' Federal Power Commission v. Hope Natural Gas Co., \n320 \nU.S. 591, 602\n, 64 S.Ct. 281, 288. The Commission considered that it had, and we find no reason to doubt that it had, the evidence before it that was needful to the discharge of its duty to the public and to the regulated railroad. 'With that sort of evidence before them, rate experts of acknowledged ability and fairness, and each acting independently of the other, may not have reached identically the same conclusion. We do not know whether the results would have been approximately the same. For there is no possibility of solving the question as though it were a mathematical problem to which there could only be one correct answer. Still there was in this mass of facts that out of which experts could have named a rate. The law makes the Commission's finding on such facts conclusive.' Interstate Commerce Commission v. Union Pacific R. Co., \n222 \nU.S. 541, 550\n, 32 S.Ct. 108, 112.\n\n'So long as there is warrant in the record for the judgment of the expert body it must stand. ... 'The judicial function is exhausted when there is found to be a rational basis for the conclusions approved by the administrative body.\" Rochester Tel. Corp. v. United States, \n307 \nU.S. 125, 145\n, 146 S., 59 S.Ct. 754, 764, 765; Mississippi Valley Barge Line Co. v. United States, \n292 \nU.S. 282, 286\n, 287 S., 54 S.Ct. 692, 693, 694.\n\n Unless, therefore, the court below is correct in holding that a fair hearing has been denied or in holding that the Commission misapprehended the effect of the emergency legislation, the order of the Commission is entitled to stand. We turn to those questions.\n\n\n I.\n\n\n The District Court has set aside for want of fair hearing two orders of the Commission, one of which permitted an increase from 8 cents to 9 cents in the rate and the latter of which modified the 9-cent rate so far as to permit a 9 1\/11 cent token rate and a 10-cent cash rate. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 503, 514]\n\u00a0\n No claim is made that full hearing was denied as to the first order. The original complaint in this action, as we have pointed out, did not question the 9-cent rate order, but only the subsequent steps to modify it. The contention as to the first order is that the Commission in the circumstances was compelled to give a full rehearing before its order could become final. And it is urged that the order after the limited rehearing is invalid because there was a legal right to a wider range of inquiry before modification of the first order.\n This raises an important but not a new question of administrative law. The Price Administrator's contention is that this record is 'stale' and that a fresh record is important. One of the grounds of resistance to administrative orders throughout federal experience with the administrative process has been the claims of private litigants to be entitled to rehearings to bring the record up to date and meanwhile to stall the enforcement of the administrative order. Administrative consideration of evidence-particularly where the evidence is taken by an examiner, his report submitted to the parties, and a hearing held on their exceptions to it-always creates a gap between the time the record is closed and the time the administrative decision is promulgated. This is especially true if the issues are difficult, the evidence intricate, and the consideration of the case deliberate and careful. If upon the coming down of the order litigants might demand rehearings as a matter of law because some new circumstance has arisen, some new trend has been observed, or some new fact discovered, there would be little hope that the administrative process could ever be consummated in an order that would not be subject to reopening. It has been almost a rule of necessity that rehearings were not matters of right, but were pleas to discretion. And likewise it has been considered that the \n\n[322 \nU.S. 503, 515]\n\u00a0\n discretion to be invoked was that of the body making the order, and not that of a reviewing body.\n Only once in the history of administrative law has this Court reversed a Commission for refusing to grant a rehearing on the contention that the record was 'stale.' In Atchison, T. & S.F.R. Co. v. United States, \n284 \nU.S. 248\n, 52 S.Ct. 146, this Court held that because of changed conditions the Interstate Commerce Commission abused its discretion in denying a rehearing. The record in that case was closed in September 1928. In February 1931, the railroads petitioned for rehearing and 'pointed out the grave reductions, in traffic and earnings, from which they were suffering, that their net operating income for 1930 was over $ 100,000,000 less than their average annual net operating income for the five years preceding, and that their credit was seriously impaired. At the time of this petition, the order * ** had not yet become effective, but the Commission stood upon the record of 1928 and, without reopening the proceedings or taking further evidence, provided that its order should become effective on June 1, 1931.' This, it was held, 'was not within the permitted range of the Commission's discretion, but was a denial of right.' \n284 \nU.S. 248, 261\n, 262 S., 52 S.Ct. 146, 150.\n The Court, however, promptly restricted that decision to its special facts, United States v. Northern Pacific R., \n288 \nU.S. 490\n, 53 S.Ct. 406, and it stands virtually alone. In Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. United States, \n298 \nU.S. 349, 389\n, 56 S.Ct. 797, 817, Mr. Justice Brandeis, concurring, said, 'The Atchison case rests upon its exceptional facts. It is apparently the only instance in which this Court has interfered with the exercise of the Commission's discretion in granting, or refusing, to reopen a hearing.' St. Joseph Stock Yards Co. v. United States, \n298 \nU.S. 38\n, 56 S.Ct. 720, arose under the Packers and Stockyards Act, 7 U.S.C.A.  181-229. The Secretary of Agriculture was upheld in refusing to reopen the proceeding to take account of \n\n[322 \nU.S. 503, 516]\n\u00a0\n changed conditions resulting from the economic legislation of Congress in 1933. Again, under the same Act, the Secretary of Agriculture denied a request to add three months' developments to the record, we refused to interfere, and the Court said, through Mr. Justice Roberts: 'The amended petition was filed about three months after the original order issued. It is inconceivable that economic conditions had so altered in this brief period as to demonstrate that the new schedule of rates, if just when promulgated, had become unjust and oppressive. The schedule should have been given a trial, and any alteration or modification should have been asked in the light of more extensive experience. We are unable to find anything arbitrary or unreasonable in the denial of the petitions.' Acker v. United States, \n298 \nU.S. 426, 433\n, 56 S.Ct. 824, 828.\n This Court has held that the Interstate Commerce Commission did not abuse its discretion in refusing a request for a new study as a basis for rate-making, although changes were alleged consisting of a falling off in volume of traffic, improvement of highways in the district resulting in diversion of traffic from rail to truck, decline in value of the articles transported, reduction in wages and cost of supplies, and curtailment of the amount of service rendered, and where the Commission decided that it was able on the record before it to consider the effect of the factors suggested by the appellants and that a new cost study was unnecessary. Illinois Commerce Commission v. United States, \n292 \nU.S. 474, 480\n, 54 S.Ct. 783, 785. Except that the trends are in an opposite direction, the inquiry demanded here is of the same nature. See also Georgia Public Service Commission v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 765, 769\n, 770 S., 51 S.Ct. 619, 620, 621.\n The Court has held that administrative tribunals 'have power themselves to initiate inquiry, or, when their authority is invoked, to control the range of investigation in ascertaining what is to satisfy the requirements of the public interest in relation to the needs of vast regions and \n\n[322 \nU.S. 503, 517]\n\u00a0\n sometimes the whole nation in the enjoyment of facilities for transportation, communication and other essential public services.' Federal Communications Commission v. Pottsville Broadcasting Co., \n309 \nU.S. 134, 142\n, 60 S.Ct. 437, 441. Cf. American Bridge Co. v. Commission, \n307 \nU.S. 486, 494\n, 59 S.Ct. 948, 952, 953.\n Nor can a litigant insist that a commission may not take a second step in a rate-making process without retracing all previous ones. As put by the Chief Justice: 'The establishment of a rate for a regulated industry often involves two steps of different character, one of which may appropriately precede the other. The first is the adjustment of the general revenue level to the demands of a fair return. The second is the adjustment of a rate schedule conforming to that level so as to eliminate discriminations and unfairness from its details.' Such procedure may be adopted where it is appropriate to carry out the provisions of an act. Federal Power Commission v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co., \n315 \nU.S. 575, 584\n, 62 S.Ct. 736, 742.\n We have held that 'The refusal to reconsider the issue of domination in the present unfair labor practice hearing accord in our view, with the Board's discretionary powers.' Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, \n313 \nU.S. 146, 161\n, 61 S.Ct. 908, 916.\n We have rejected the plea of railroad stockholders that events subsequent to approval of a reorganization plan of a very similar character to those alleged here, require its return for reconsideration. Group of Institutional Investors v. Chicago, M.St. P. & P.R. Co., \n318 \nU.S. 523, 542\n, 544 S., 63 S.Ct. 727, 739, 740; Ecker v. Western Pacific R. Corp., \n318 \nU.S. 448\n, 506-509, 63 S.Ct. 692, 722-724.\n The rule that petitions for rehearings before administrative bodies are addressed to their own discretion is uniformly accepted and seems to be almost universally applied on other federal courts. United States ex rel. Maine Potato Growers & Shippers Ass'n v. Interstate Commerce Commission, 66 App.D.C. 398, 88 F.2d 780, 784, certiorari denied \n300 \nU.S. 684\n, 57 S.Ct. 754; Mississippi Valley Barge Line Co. v. United States, D.C., 4 F.Supp. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 503, 518]\n\u00a0\n 745, 748; Union Stock Yards Co. v. United States, D.C., 9 F.Supp. 864, 873; American Commission Co. v. United States, D.C., 11 F.Supp. 965, 972; R.C.A. Communications, Inc., v. United States, D.C., 43 F.Supp. 851, 858.\n Central & South West Utilities Co. v. Securities and Exchange Commission, App.D.C., 136 F.2d 273, 275, involved an order of simplification under the holding company act, in which the petitioner moved for leave to adduce additional evidence. Denying the motion, the court said, 'Petitioners show that their financial position has improved somewhat since the Commission held its hearings. Section 11(b) authorizes the Commission to revoke or modify its order, after notice and hearing, in response to changed conditions, and there is no reason to assume that it will not do so if sufficient occasion arises. Nevertheless petitioners now ask leave, under Section 24(a) of the Act, to adduce their improved position as 'additional evidence' in the completed hearings which led to the present order. We need not decide whether supervening events of this general sort may sometimes be 'additional evidence' within the meaning of Section 24(a). If so, final administrative disposition and judicial review may often be prevented altogether by the mere fact that they take time.' See also Koppers United Co. v. Securities and Exchange Commission, App.D.C ., 138 F.2d 577; Colorado Radio Corp. v. Federal Communications Commission, 73 App.D.C. 225, 118 F.2d 24; Red River Broadcasting Co. v. Federal Communications Commission, 69 App.D.C. 1, 98 F.2d 282, certiorari denied \n305 \nU.S. 625\n, 59 S.Ct. 86.\n Various objections to the Price Administrator's contention are made, such as that the evidence he proposed to offer was remote, or if no probative value, that the application to reopen did not conform to the Commission's rules, that he became, along with Jersey City, estopped from questioning the 9-cent fare, by the original complaint in district court, which raised no issue about it, and that \n\n[322 \nU.S. 503, 519]\n\u00a0\n the parties did not proceed with due diligence. We do not find it necessary to examine any of these contentions.\n It is perfectly plain that unless the statutory authority of the Price Administrator gives him a different standing before administrative tribunals than can be claimed by private litigants there is no ground for holding that the denial of a rehearing constituted an abuse of discretion or amounted to unfairness which would invalidate the Commission's orders. The authorities referred to above make it abundantly plain that had the railroad's petition for rehearing been denied we would have held it to be in the sound discretion of the Commission and not reviewable. The rule of administrative law should not change because the shoe is on the other foot. There is no sufficient reason for breaking down our decisional rules that protect the administrative process against tactics to delay finality, unless Congress has so ordered us, as to which we next inquire.\n\n\n II.\n\n\n The court below gave as a second reason for setting aside the two orders that the Commission 'lightly brushed aside' the economic stabilization phase of the case and gave too little weight to the Price Administrator's contentions as to inflationary tendencies of rate increases. It said, and of course we agree, that the 'Commission here is under a distinct duty in this particular case, to give full effect to war time conditions and the stabilization legislation.'\n But that does not answer the real question, which is what is the effect of the stabilization legislation. In seeking this answer we are inquiring as to the relative powers and responsibilities of two federal agencies. Congress was free to apportion their functions as it saw fit and to transfer any part of the normal responsibility of the Commission to the Price Administrator or other executive agencies. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 503, 520]\n\u00a0\n Commerce Commission authorization of rate increases could have been subjected to review or veto so far as any objection of the Commission is concerned.\n But Congress did no such thing. The legislative history of relevant provisions of the Act was reviewed in Davies Warehouse Co. v. Bowles, \n321 \nU.S. 144\n, 64 S.Ct. 474. It was there pointed out that Congress rejected a proposal that such rates should not be increased without consent of the President. On the other hand it was assured by executive representatives that rate advances already subject to scrutiny on behalf of the public and to proof of reasonableness were not the source of the more substantial inflationary threats. Congress then adopted the provision we earlier quoted.\n In the light of such history this Court has been reluctant to construe the emergency legislation as giving the Administrator standing to make mandatory demands upon other tribunals or to strip them of their usual discretions. Under this statutory plan, as we have said in the language of Mr. Justice Douglas, 'The Administrator does not carry the sole burden of the war against inflation.' Hecht Co. v. Bowles, \n321 \nU.S. 325, 331\n, 64 S.Ct. 587, 592. At the same time we said that the discretionary action of other tribunals, even of courts, 'should reflect an acute awareness of the Congressional admonition that 'of all the consequences of war, except human slaughter, inflation is the most destructive' and that delay or indifference may be fatal.'\n No charge that the Commission ignored the Administrator's contentions can fairly be made on this record. \n8\n Al- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 503, 521]\n\u00a0\n though he intervened in the original proceeding, first on his own behalf and then for the Stabilization Director, he made no effort to offer any evidence either before or after the hearing closed, despite the fact that nearly nine months elapsed between the close of the hearing and the Commission's order. \n9\n Nor did he even move for rehearing, until after the railroad had asked for modification of the order. He was then permitted to intervene, to file briefs and to be heard in argument, to cross-examine and to offer evidence. His desire to reopen the whole case was refused, because the Commission, considering all that he offered to show, said: 'Considering the contents of the motion now before us, and the offers of additional evidence made at the recent further hearing, we have no reason to believe that, if the additional hearing sought were held, we would feel warranted in modifying our findings as made in the second report.' And the Commission in its second report weighed the contentions of the Administrator and decided that they did not outweigh the needs for added revenue \n\n[322 \nU.S. 503, 522]\n\u00a0\n for the road. It said: 'It seems to us that an increase of 1 cent in respondent's downtown fare is unlikely to have any inflationary effect, and that the effect thereof upon the cost of living, while a factor to be given consideration, will be so slight, a maximum of about 12 cents a week and 52 cents a month per passenger, as to be negligible.' Considering this among other findings of fact it concluded to authorize the increased fare 'to meet increased operating costs and the interest on its bonds.'\n That the weight to be given to stabilization considerations in relation to other factors calls for an exercise of judgment in any given case is not denied by the Administrator. Indeed in excepting to the examiner's report he said: 'We did not nor do we now, suggest that this proposed increase in fare (from 8 cents to 10 cents) will in and of itself result in inflation. Such a suggestion would, of course, be asinine.' Who, then, in this case is to judge the weight to be given such a factor? The opinion of the Administrator is not, as we have pointed out, mandatory on the Commission. Nor is such an economic judgment the function of the courts unless all that has been established in administrative law concerning the limitation on judicial review is to be thrown overboard. The decision of such a matter by the Commission is clearly not reviewable by a court because it thinks differently of the weight that should be accorded to some factors in relation to others.\n The Interstate Commerce Commission has responsibility for maintaining an adequate system of wartime transportation. It is without power to protect these essential transportation agencies from rising labor and material costs. It can decide only how such unavoidable costs shall be met. They can in whole or in part be charged to increased fares, or they can be allowed to result in defaults and receiverships and reorganizations, or they may be \n\n[322 \nU.S. 503, 523]\n\u00a0\n offset by inadequate service or delayed maintenance. All of these considerations must be weighed by the Commission with wartime transportation needs as well as avoiding inflationary tendencies as a public responsibility. The need for informed, expert and unbiased judgment is apparent. The problem is intricate, the carrier is one of peculiar characteristics, its wartime traffic is of varying density, with peaks and rush hours, the rates and carrying capacities of competitors by bus and ferry are involved in any estimate of traffic diversions or probable effects of rates. What rates are required to meet actual and proper operating expenses, what revenue must be available to avoid defaults and sustain credit, what divisions should be made on interchanged traffic are as complex problems in rate-making as can readily be imagined. The delicacy of the Commission's task in wartime is no reason for allowing greater scope to judicial review than we are willing to exercise in peacetime. We think the weight to be given to the Price Administrator's contentions was for the Commission, not the court, to determine. The scope of proper judicial review does not expand or contract, depending on what party invokes it. It is as narrow now as it was when appealed to by the Company. Cf. Hudson & Manhattan R. Co. v. United States, \n313 \nU.S. 98\n, 61 S. Ct. 884. If Congress desires to grant its own agencies greater privileges of judicial review than have been allowed to private parties it is at liberty to do so, but it is not for the Court to set aside, without legislative command, its slow-wrought general principles which protect the finality and integrity of decisions by administrative tribunals.\n As to the contention that the Stabilization Act gave the Administrator standing superior to that of other litigants to ask the courts to override the normal discretion of the Commission in granting or refusing rehearings, we have already spoken in Vinson v. Washington Gaslight Co., \n\n[322 \nU.S. 503, 524]\n\u00a0\n \n321 \nU.S. 489\n, 64 S.Ct. 731, 735. There, as here, the Stabilization Director insisted that he was 'denied a fair hearing because the Commission refused in the current proceeding to alter and enlarge the scope of inquiry.' There, as here, the controversy was 'between two governmental agencies as to whether the powers of the one or the other are preponderant in the circumstances.' Here, as there, we decline to invade the discretion of administrative tribunals to control their own rehearing procedure where the Congress has not given the Administrator standing superior to that of a litigant and has not divested the Commission of its ordinary discretions. The judgment below is\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice RUTLEDGE dissents.\n Mr. Justice BLACK took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS.\n I would decide this case differently. I think this decision and Vinson v. Washington Gas Light Co., \n321 \nU.S. 489\n, 64 S.Ct. 731, pretty well emasculate the provision of the Act of October 2, 1942 (56 Stat. 765, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix  961 et seq.) which prohibits 'any general increase' in utility rates unless notice is given to the federal agency in charge of inflation control and that agency is allowed to intervene in the proceedings. As I stated in my dissent in Vinson v. Washington Gas Light Co., supra, Congress intended by that provision that there should be as great an accommodation as possible between established standards for rate- making and existing wartime necessities. General rate increases were not to be allowed unless, for example, it was shown that they were necessary to preserve existing facilities under war conditions. I agree with Judge McLaughlin and Judge Meaney of the three-judge court that this emergency legislation \n\n[322 \nU.S. 503, 525]\n\u00a0\n required the Commission 'to give full effect to war time conditions and the stabilization legislation.' (54 F.Supp. 315, 319.) It was that policy which was reflected in Executive Order 9328 promulgated by the President on April 8, 1943, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix  901 note (8 Fed.Reg. 4681, 4682) and providing as follows:\n'The attention of all agencies of the Federal Government, and of all State and municipal authorities, concerned with the rates of common carriers or other public utilities, is directed to the stabilization program of which this order is a part so that rate increases will be disapproved and rate reductions effected, consistently with the Act of October 2, 1942, and other applicable federal, state or municipal law, in order to keep down the cost of living and effectuate the purposes of the stabilization program.'\n\n That policy is once more disregarded. The Interstate Commerce Commission proceeds to grant rate increases on the basis of peace time standards. It justifies the increase under the Act of October 2, 1942, by saying that the increase per consumer is negligible. By the same token every item in the list of consumer necessities could be increased a like percentage. What was negligible item by item would soon be substantial in the aggregate. That which first appears as a small trickle may eventually undermine the dam.\n But though I disagree with the result reached, I think it is precisely what Vinson v. Washington Gas Light Co. intended. That case and Davies Warehouse Co. v. Bowles, \n321 \nU.S. 144\n, 64 S.Ct. 474, give preferred treatment to a few businesses by allowing them to gain advantages from war conditions. I would overrule them. But so long as they stand I do not see how we can deny the Interstate Commerce Commission the power to do for the Hudson & Manhattan Railroad Co. what another commission was allowed to do for the Washington Gas Light Co.\n Mr. Justice MURPHY joins in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of January 30, 1942, c. 26, 56 Stat. 23, 50 U.S.C.App., Supp. II,  901 et seq., 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix  901 et seq. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Act of October 2, 1942, c. 578, 56 Stat. 765, 50 U.S.C.App., Supp. II,  961 et seq., 50 U.S.C.A.

Increases in the general price level ultimately affect the costs of rendering transportation service and the value of such service to the public. Such considerations were in fact carefully weighed and reflected in the increases which we authorized under Ex parte No. 148.' In Ex Parte No. 148, reported as Increased Railway Rates, Fares, and Charges, 1942, 248 I.C.C. 545, the railroads sought general increases of 10 per cent. in freight and passenger rates.

Nevertheless the Commission apparently took careful note of 'the effect upon the national defense of cumulated increases in production costs of manufactured products' and as to specific commodities, after consideration of the financial position of the affected railroads, denied or restricted the increases sought. 248 I.C.C. at page 610. \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] The Commission did have before it, however, traffic and gross revenue figures for the first two months of 1943, which were incorporated into the record by stipulation at the oral argument on April 20, 1943. \n\n\n\n\n","61":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJ. I. CASE CO. v. N.L.R.B.(1944)\nNo. 67\nArgued: January 3, 1944Decided: February 28, 1944\n\n\n\n Mr. Clark M. Robertson, of Milwaukee, Wis., for petitioner.\n Mr. Alvin J. Rockwell, of Washington, D.C., for respondent. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 332, 333]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice JACKSON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This cause was heard by the National Labor Relations Board on stipulated facts which so far as concern present issues are as follows:\n The petitioner, J. I. Case Company, at its Rock Island, Illinois, plant, from 1937 offered each employee an individual contract of employment. The contracts were uniform and for a term of one year. The Company agreed to furnish employment as steadily as conditions permitted, to pay a specified rate, which the Company might redetermine if the job changed, and to maintain certain hospital facilities. The employee agreed to accept the provisions, to serve faithfully and honestly for the term, to comply with factory rules, and that defective work should not be paid for. About 75% of the employees accepted and worked under these agreements.\n According to the Board's stipulation and finding, the execution of the contracts was not a condition of employment, nor was the status of individual employees affected by reason of signing or failing to sign the contracts. It is not found or contended that the agreements were coerced, obtained by any unfair labor practice, or that they were not valid under the circumstances in which they were made.\n While the individual contracts executed August 1, 1941 were in effect, a C.I.O. union petitioned the Board for certification as the exclusive bargaining representative of the production and maintenance employees. On December 17, 1941 a hearing was held, at which the Company urged the individual contracts as a bar to representation proceedings. The Board, however, directed an election, which was won by the union. The union was thereupon certified as the exclusive bargaining representative of the employees in question in respect to wages, hours, and other conditions of employment. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 332, 334]\n\u00a0\n The union then asked the Company to bargain. It refused, declaring that it could not deal with the union in any manner affecting rights and obligations under the individual contracts while they remained in effect. It offered to negotiate on matters which did not affect rights under the individual contracts, and said that upon the expiration of the contracts it would bargain as to all matters. Twice the Company sent circulars to its employees asserting the validity of the individual contracts and stating the position that it took before the Board in reference to them.\n The Board held that the Company had refused to bargain collectively, in violation of  8(5) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  158(5); and that the contracts had been utilized, by means of the circulars, to impede employees in the exercise of rights guaranteed by  7 of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  157, with the result that the Company had engaged in unfair labor practices within the meaning of  8(1) of the Act. It ordered the Company to cease and desist from giving effect to the contracts, from extending them or entering into new ones, from refusing to bargain and from interfering with the employees; and it required the Company to give notice accordingly and to bargain upon request.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals, with modification not in issue here, granted an order of enforcement. The issues are unsettled ones important in the administration of the Act, and we granted certiorari. In doing so we asked counsel, in view of the expiration of the individual contracts and the negotiation of a collective contract, to discuss whether the case was moot. In view of the continuing character of the obligation imposed by the order we think it is not, and will examine the merits.\n Contract in labor law is a term the implications of which must be determined from the connection in which it appears. Collective bargaining between employer and the representatives of a unit, usually a union, results in an \n\n[321 \nU.S. 332, 335]\n\u00a0\n accord as to terms which will overn hiring and work and pay in that unit. The result is not, however, a contract of employment except in rare cases; no one has a job by reason of it and no obligation to any individual ordinarily comes into existence from it alone. The negotiations between union and management result in what often has been called a trade agreement, rather than in a contract of employment. Without pushing the analogy too far, the agreement may be likened to the tariffs established by a carrier, to standard provisions prescribed by supervising authorities for insurance policies, or to utility schedules of rates and rules for service, which do not of themselves establish any relationships but which do govern the terms of the shipper or insurer or customer relationship whenever and with whomever it may be established. Indeed, in some European countries, contrary to American practice, the terms of a collectively negotiated trade agreement are submitted to a government department and if approved become a governmental regulation ruling employment in the unit. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n After the collective trade agreement is made, the individuals who shall benefit by it are identified by individual hirings. The employer, except as restricted by the collective agreement itself and except that he must engage in no unfair labor practice or discrimination, is free to select those he will employ or discharge. But the terms of the employment already have been traded out. There is little left to individual agreement except the act of hiring. This hiring may be by writing or by word of mouth or may be implied from conduct. In the sense of contracts of hiring, individual contracts between the employer and employee \n\n[321 \nU.S. 332, 336]\n\u00a0\n are not forbidden, but indeed are necessitated by the collective bargaining procedure.\n But, however engaged, an employee becomes entitled by virtue of the Labor Relations Act somewhat as a third party beneficiary to all benefits of the collective trade agreement, even if on his own he would yield to less favorable terms. The individual hiring contract is subsidiary to the terms of the trade agreement and may not waive any of its benefits, any more than a shipper can contract away the benefit of filed tariffs, the insurer the benefit of standard provisions, or the utility customer the benefit of legally established rates.\n Concurrent existence of these two types of agreement raises problems as to which the National Labor Relations Act makes no express provision. We have, however, held that individual contracts obtained as the result of an unfair labor practice may not be the basis of advantage to the violator of the Act nor of disadvantage to employees. National Licorice Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, \n309 \nU.S. 350\n, 60 S.Ct. 569. But it is urged that where, as here, the contracts were not unfairly or unlawfully obtained, the court indicated a contrary rule in National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., \n301 \nU.S. 1, 44\n, 45 S., 57 S. Ct. 615, 627, 628, 108 A.L.R. 1352, and Virginian R. Co. v. System Federation, \n300 \nU.S. 515\n, 57 S.Ct. 592. Without reviewing those cases in detail, it may be said that their decision called for nothing and their opinions contain nothing which may be properly read to rule the case before us. The court in those cases recognized the existence of some scope for individual contracts, but it did not undertake to define it or to consider the relations between lawful individual and collective agreements, which is the problem now before us.\n Care has been taken in the opinions of the Court to reserve a field for the individual contract, even in industries covered by the National Labor Relations Act, not merely as an act or evidence of hiring, but also in the sense of a completely individually bargained contract setting out \n\n[321 \nU.S. 332, 337]\n\u00a0\n terms of employment, because there are circumstances in which it may legally be used, in fact, in which there is no alternative. Without limiting the possibilities, instances such as the following will occur: Men may continue work after a collective agreement expires and, despite negotiation in good faith, the negotiation may be deadlocked or delayed; in the interim express or implied individual agreements may be held to govern. The conditions for collective bargaining may not exist; thus a majority of the employees may refuse to join a union or to agree upon or designate bargaining representatives, or the majority may not be demonstrable by the means prescribed by the statute, or a previously existent majority may have been lost without unlawful interference by the employer and no new majority have been formed. As the employer in these circumstances may be under no legal obligation to bargain collectively, he may be free to enter into individual contracts. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n Individual contracts no matter what the circumstances that justify their execution or what their terms, may not be availed of to defeat or delay the procedures prescribed by the National Labor Relations Act looking to collective bargaining, nor to exclude the contracting employee from a duly ascertained bargaining unit; nor may they be used to forestall bargaining or to limit or condition the terms of the collective agreement. 'The Board asserts a public right vested in it as a public body, charged in the public interest with the duty of preventing unfair labor practices.' National Licorice Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, \n309 \nU.S. 350, 364\n, 60 S.Ct. 569, 577. Wherever private contracts conflict with its functions, they obviously must yield or the Act would be reduced to a futility. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 332, 338]\n\u00a0\n It is equally clear since the collective trade agreement is to serve the purpose contemplated by the Act, the individual contract cannot be effective as a waiver of any benefit to which the employee otherwise would be entitled under the trade agreement. The very purpose of providing by statute for the collective agreement is to supersede the terms of separate agreements of employees with terms which reflect the strength and bargaining power and serve the welfare of the group. Its benefits and advantages are open to every employee of the represented unit, whatever the type or terms of his pre-existing contract of employment.\n But it is urged that some employees may lose by the collective agreement, that an individual workman may sometimes have, or be capable of getting, better terms than those obtainable by the group and that his freedom of contract must be respected on that account. We are not called upon to say that under no circumstances can an individual enforce an agreement more advantageous than a collective agreement, but we find the mere possibility that such agreements might be made no ground for holding generally that individual contracts may survive or surmount collective ones. The practice and philosophy of collective bargaining looks with suspicion on such individual advantages. Of course, where there is great variation in circumstances of employment or capacity of employees, it is possible for the collective bargain to prescribe only minimum rates or maximum hours or expressly to leave certain areas open to individual bargaining. But except as so provided, advantages to individuals may prove as disruptive of industrial peace as disadvantages. They are a fruitful way of interfering with organization and choice of representatives; increased compensation, if individually deserved, is often earned at the cost of breaking down some other standard thought to be for the welfare of the group, and always creates the suspicion of being \n\n[321 \nU.S. 332, 339]\n\u00a0\n paid at the long-range expense of the group as a whole. Such discriminations not infrequently amount to unfair labor practices. The workman is free, if he values his own bargaining position more than that of the group, to vote against representation; but the majority rules, and if it collectivizes the employment bargain, individual advantages or favors will generally in practice go in as a contribution to the collective result. We cannot except individual contracts generally from the operation of collective ones because some may be more individually advantageous. Individual contracts cannot subtract from collective ones, and whether under some circumstances they may add to them in matters covered by the collective bargain, we leave to be determined by appropriate forums under the laws of contracts applicable, and to the Labor Board if they constitute unfair labor practices.\n It also is urged that such individual contracts may embody matters that are not necessarily included within the statutory scope of collective bargaining, such as stock purchase, group insurance, hospitalization, or medical attention. We know of nothing to prevent the employee's, because he is an employee, making any contract provided it is not inconsistent with a collective agreement or does not amount to or result from or is not part of an unfair labor practice. But in so doing the employer may not incidentally exact or obtain any diminution of his own obligation or any increase of those of employees in the matters covered by collective agreement.\n Hence we find that the contentions of the Company that the individual contracts precluded a choice of representatives and warrnated refusal to bargain during their duration were properly over-ruled. It follows that representation to the employees by circular letter that they had such legal effect was improper and could properly be prohibited by the Board. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 332, 340]\n\u00a0\n One minor matter remains for consideration. The literal terms of the Board's order require the Company to 'cease and desist from (a) giving effect to the individual contracts of employment or any modification, continuation, extension or renewal thereof, or entering into any similar form of contract with its employees for any period subsequent to the date of this decision,' and to give written notice to each to that effect and that 'such contract will not in any manner be enforced or attempted to be enforced' and that 'such discontinuance of the contract is without prejudice to the assertion of any legal rights the employee may have acquired under such contract.'\n These provisions, it has been argued, go beyond the Board's power, leave employees free to bring but the Company powerless to defend actions on the contract, and prohibit making future contracts even when not obnoxious to the law or to any collective agreement.\n The Board, of course, has no power to adjudicate the validity or effect of such contracts except as to their effect on matters within its jurisdiction. National Licorice Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, supra. The Board, however, would construe the order more narrowly than its terms suggest. It says, 'The provision in question, as we have seen, is based upon the finding that the contracts were utilized as a means of interfering with rights guaranteed by the Act and constituted an obstacle to collective bargaining. Read in the context of this finding, the requirement of the cease and desist provisions enjoins petitioner only from continuing to derive benefits from the contracts heretofore utilized to forestall collective bargaining and deter self-organization, and from entering into new contracts either for the purpose of again thus utilizing them or under circumstances in which similar infringement of the collective bargaining process would be a probable consequence. The paragraph does not prevent petitioner from contracting with individual employees under circumstances which negative any \n\n[321 \nU.S. 332, 341]\n\u00a0\n intent to interfere with the employees' right under the Act. ... Thus construed, the challenged requirement is but a reasonable safeguard ....'\n We agree, but the literal language of the order may well be read in quite different meaning, especially when separated from findings and standing alone in the Court's enforcement order. It then becomes the language of the Court, and the Court would not be bound to look upon the Board's construction as its own. Questions of construction had better be ironed out before enforcement orders issue than upon contempt proceedings. A party is entitled to a definition as exact as the circumstances permit of the acts which he can perform only on pain of contempt of court. Nor should he be ordered to desist from more on the theory that he may violate the literal language and then defend by resort to the Board's construction of it. Courts' orders are not to be trifled with, nor should they invite litigation as to their meaning. It will occur often enough when every reasonable effort is made to avoid it. Where, as here, the literal language of the order goes beyond what the Board admits was intended, correction should be made. Paragraphs 1(a) and 2(a) of the decree of the court below are hereby modified, by adding the words in italics, to read as follows:\n'1. Cease and desist from:\n\n\n (a)\n Giving effect to the individual contracts of employment or any modification, continuation, extension, or renewal thereof to forestall collective bargaining or deter self-organization, or entering into any similar form of contract with its employees for any period subsequent to the date of this Decree for such purpose or with such effect.\n'2. Take the following affirmative action which the Board finds will effectuate the policies of the Act:\n\n\n (a)\n Give separate written notice to each of its employees who signed an individual contract of employment or any modification, continuation, extension, or renewal \n\n[321 \nU.S. 332, 342]\n\u00a0\n thereof, or any similar form of contract for any period subsequent to the date of this Decree, that such contract will not in any manner be enforced or attempted to be enforced to forestall collective bargaining or deter self-organization, that the employee is not required or expected by virtue of such contract to deal with respondent individually in respect to rates of pay, wages, hours of employment, or other conditions of employment, and that such discontinuance of the contract is without prejudice to the assertion of any legal rights the employee may have acquired under such contract or to any defenses there-to by the employer.'\n As so modified the decree is\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS is of opinion that the judgment should be reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Hamburger, 'The Extension of Collective Agreements to Cover Entire Trade and Industries' (1939) 40 International Labor Review 153; Methods of Collaboration between Public Authorities, Workers' Organizations, and Employers' Organizations (International Labour Conference, 1940) p. 112. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Cf.

Respondent is a common carrier by motor vehicle authorized by the Interstate Commerce Commission to transport in interstate commerce various commodities, including wines and liquors. See U.S.C. Title 49, c. 8, 49 U.S.C.A.  301 et seq. In regular course of business the respondent-carrier undertook to transport 225 cases of wines and liquors from East St. Louis, Illinois, through Missouri, into Oklahoma and thence to a consignee at Fort Sill, a military reservation within the boundaries of Oklahoma. While the vehicle carrying the liquors was momentarily stopped at Oklahoma City for the purpose of loading and unloading other freight, the petitioner-officials forcibly seized and took away the liquors.\n The carrier filed a complaint in the federal District Court alleging that the seizure constituted an unlawful interference with its authorized interstate transportation, and praying that the Court order the officials to return the liquors so that it might deliver them to the consignee at Fort Sill. The answer to the complaint, in substance, admitted the material facts relative to the shipment and seizure of the liquors but denied the allegation of the complaint that the seizure was unlawful. The answer did not allege that judicial proceedings concerning the seized liquor were pending, or were to be commenced, in an \n\n[321 \nU.S. 383, 385]\n\u00a0\n Oklahoma state court. After a trial on stipulated facts, the District Court ordered the liquors returned to the carrier and forbade the officials to interfere with completion of the shipment. 48 F.Supp. 594. The Circuit Court of Appeals, one Judge dissenting, affirmed. 10 Cir., 137 F.2d 274.\n Questions presented in the petition for review concerning important state and federal relationships with regard to federal enclaves prompted us to grant certiorari. \n320 \nU.S. 731\n, 64 S.Ct. 207. Argument has revealed, however, that the determinative issues are more narrow: (1) Did transportation of the liquors through Oklahoma violate that State's law so as to justify their seizure? (2) Should the District Court have denied the carrier equitable relief because of the 'unclean hands' doctrine, even though seizure of the liquors by the officials was illegal? This second question rests on the disputed premise that introduction of the liquors into Fort Sill would have violated the laws of the United States.\n Petitioners do not claim, nor could they claim, that either of these two separate questions should be decided in their favor on the ground that Oklahoma has power to control liquor transactions on the Fort Sill Reservation. With certain minor exceptions not here material, Oklahoma ceded to the United States in 1913 whatever authority it ever could have exercised in the Reservation. 1 The Oklahoma Supreme Court has recognized that the general power to govern the Fort Sill area is vested in the United States, not in Oklahoma,2 and our decisions lead to the same conclusion. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[321 \nU.S. 383, 386]\n\u00a0\n First. Since power to govern Fort Sill is in the United States, and since the seized liquors were not to be sold, delivered or otherwise disposed of in Oklahoma proper, as distinguished from Fort Sill, the only Oklahoma laws called to our attention which could have justified the seizure are those which apply to liquor transportation. No Oklahoma law purports on its face to prohibit or regulate interstate shipments of liquor into and through the state to another state, or to an area subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States. And we were informed at the bar by Oklahoma's legal representative that no state statute had been construed by any state court as applying to such through shipments. Oklahoma law does make it unlawful 'to import, bring, transport, or cause to be brought or transported into the State ... intoxicating liquor ... without a permit ... as hereinafter provided.' .okl.Stat.1941, Title 37 ,  41. The argument is that the Oklahoma legislature intended this statute to apply to liquor imported into the Fort Sill Reservation because the latter is located within the exterior boundaries of Oklahoma. Were this statute intended to do no more than provide a means whereby the state could protect itself from illegal liquor diversions within the area which Oklahoma has power to govern, the interpretation asked might well be an acceptable one. Duckworth v. State of Arkansas, \n314 \nU.S. 390\n, 62 S.Ct. 311, 138 A.L.R. 1144; John Thomas Carter and Eugene Pearson Macemore v. Commonwealth of Virginia, \n320 \nU.S. 131\n, 64 S.Ct. 464. But the statute has no such limited purpose. No permit to transport liquor into Oklahoma can be obtained at all except for scientific, mechanical, medicinal, industrial, or sacramental purposes. Okl.Stat.1941, Title 37,  42. To construe the state statute in the manner urged would be to say that, although Oklahoma admittedly has no power directly to regulate the liquor traffic on the Reservation, the Oklahoma legislature intended practically to exclude from the Reservation liquor which might be put to legal uses under controlling United States laws. Neither the words nor \n\n[321 \nU.S. 383, 387]\n\u00a0\n the scheme of the statute in question, nor any other relevant material pointed out to us, indicate that the Oklahoma legislature had such a purpose. Had the legislature expressed such a purpose, questions would be raised which we need not here consider. See Collins v. Yosemite Park & Curry Co., \n304 \nU.S. 518, 533\n, 58 S.Ct. 1009, 1016; Pacific Coast Dairy, Inc. v. Department of Agriculture of California, \n318 \nU.S. 285, 295\n, 63 S.Ct. 628, 630. Consequently, we find no justification for the seizure in Oklahoma law.\n Second. But it is said that despite the fact the seizure was illegal and wholly without justification, the consignee could not have received the liquors without violating the laws of the United States and for that reason the District Court should have denied the carrier any relief under the 'clean hands' doctrine.\n We may assume that because of the clean hands doctrine a federal court should not, in an ordinary case, lend its judicial power to a plaintiff who seeks to invoke that power for the purpose of consummating a transaction in clear violation of law. \n4\n But this does not mean that courts must always permit a defendant wrongdoer to retain the profits of his wrongdoing merely because the plaintiff himself is possibly guilty of transgressing the law in the transactions involved. \n5\n The maxim that he who comes into equity must come with clean hands is not applied by way of punishment for an unclean litigant but 'upon considerations that make for the advancement of right and justice.' Keystone Driller Co. v. General Excavator Co., \n290 \nU.S. 240, 245\n, 54 S.Ct. 146, 148. It is not a rigid formula which 'trammels the free and just exercise of discretion.' Ibid., 290 U.S. pages 245, 246, 54 S.Ct. page 148. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 383, 388]\n\u00a0\n Therefore, before deciding the applicability of the maxim to the case at hand, we must examine the particular transactions and circumstances involved together with the federal laws which are alleged to taint these transactions with illegality.\n As shown by the stipulated facts in this record, the circumstances of the liquor shipment were as follows: Fort Sill had an Officers' Club, which provided among other things an officers' mess, living quarters for some Officers, and other customary club facilities. Several hundred Officer-members gave to the Club Secretary, himself an Officer, separate written orders for liquor together with money or checks in payment for the respective orders. Acting for the Officer-members, the Secretary telephoned from Fort Sill to a dealer at East St. Louis, Illinois, and ordered the liquors shipped to the Club. The dealer delivered the liquors to the respondent-carrier under a uniform through bill of lading. It was this shipment which the state officials seized. Had the shipment not been seized it would have arrived at the Club for delivery to the several Officers who had paid for it.\n It is first contended that purchase and delivery of the liquors was in violation of U.S.C., Title 10,  1350, 10 U.S.C.A.  1350, set out in the margin. \n6\n The agreed facts, summarized above, sufficiently show that the transactions were not in violation of this statute.\n Petitioners next argue that the liquor transactions here involved were in violation of the assimilative crimes statute. \n7\n This statute, it is said, adopts all of the various \n\n[321 \nU.S. 383, 389]\n\u00a0\n penal statutes of Oklahoma relating to liquor and makes them the federal law applicable to the Fort Sill Reservation. Cf. United States v. Press Publishing Company, \n219 \nU.S. 1\n, 31 S.Ct. 212, 21 Ann.Cas. 942; Franklin v. United States, \n216 \nU.S. 559\n, 30 S.Ct. 434. Petitioners' argument as to the applicability of the assimilative crimes statute raises at least three distinct questions, no one of which is easily resolved: (1) Which, if any, of the Oklahoma penal statutes are so designed that they could be adopted by the assimilative crimes statute and applied to Fort Sill?8 See opinions of Circuit Court of Appeals, supra; cf. Murray v. Joe Gerrick & Co., \n291 \nU.S. 315\n, 54 S.Ct. 432, 92 A.L.R. 1259. (2) If there are Oklahoma statutes which could be so adopted, are \n\n[321 \nU.S. 383, 390]\n\u00a0\n all or any of them in conflict with federal policies as expressed by Acts of Congress other than the assimilative crimes statute or by valid Army Regulations9 which have the force of law?10 Cf. Stewart & Co. v. Sadrakula, \n309 \nU.S. 94\n, 99-104, 60 S.Ct. 431, 433-436, 127 A.L.R. 821. ( 3) Assuming that certain Oklahoma statutes are adaptable, and are not inconsistent with federal policies, would such statutes make penal the liquor transactions here stipulated to have taken place? Inextricably involved in each of the three questions is the further problem of whether certain of the Oklahoma liquor statutes may be inconsistent with Oklahoma's constitution as interpreted by the Oklahoma Supreme Court. See opinions of the Circuit Court of Appeals, supra; Ex parte Wilson, 6 Okl.Cr. 451, 119 P. 596; Morse v. State, 63 Okl.Cr. 445, 77 P.2d 757.\n Considering the difficulty and importance of a correct decision of the novel issues which an attempt to construe this federal criminal statute would present, together with the other circumstances of the present case, we are convinced that in the interest of sound administration of justice we should refrain from a complete exploration of these issues in this proceeding, especially since these is- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 383, 391]\n\u00a0\n sues are only collateral to the principal issue of the legality of the seizure of the liquor. Were we to decide that the assimilative crimes statute is not applicable to this shipment of liquors, we would, in effect, be construing a federal criminal statute against the United States in a proceeding in which the United States has never been represented. And, on the other hand, should we decide the statute outlaws the shipment, such a decision would be equivalent to a holding that more than 200 Army Officers, sworn to support the Constitution, had participated in a conspiracy to violate federal law. Not only that, it would for practical purposes be accepted as an authoritative determination that all army reservations in the State of Oklahoma must conduct their activities in accordance with numerous Oklahoma liquor regulations, some of which, at least, are of doubtful adaptability. And all of this would be decided in a case wherein neither the Army Officers nor the War Department nor the Attorney General of the United States have been represented, and upon a record consisting of stipulations between a private carrier and the legal representatives of Oklahoma.\n Nor is it any answer to say that the carrier should be compelled to sue in the Oklahoma state courts to reclaim the liquors in order to give the Oklahoma courts the opportunity collaterally to pass upon the question of whether these liquor transactions violate the federal assimilative crimes statute. That broad question, though some parts of it involve a consideration of the proper scope of the state law adopted by the federal government, is in the final analysis a question of the correct interpretation of a federal criminal statute, and therefore an issue upon which federal courts are not bound by the rulings of state courts. People of Puerto Rico v. Shell Co. (P.R.), Limited, \n302 \nU.S. 253, 266\n, 58 S.Ct. 167, 173. Indeed Congress has vested in the federal courts exclusive jurisdiction over the trial of all federal crimes. Judicial Code  256 as amended, 28 U.S.C.A.  371. And so, even if the carrier \n\n[321 \nU.S. 383, 392]\n\u00a0\n could bring suit in an Oklahoma state court to reclaim the liquor, a point which is itself subject to some doubt,11 the federal District Court should not for that reason refuse relief in the present suit.\n The ultimate question in this part of the case is whether the carrier, whose complete good faith is in no way questioned, should have the court's doors shut to it. So to hold would be to say that the state officials, who so far as this record shows, had no search warrant or judicial process of any kind,12 could retain liquors which they seized without authority of law. We do not find here any 'unconscientious or inequitable attitude' on the part of the carrier. International News Service v. Associated Press, \n248 \nU.S. 215, 245\n, 39 S.Ct. 68, 74, 2 A.L.R. 293. And so far as this record shows, the carrier, in seeking relief in the courts against the unlawful seizure, has proceeded in the only 'practicable and adequate way'13 available.\n If the carrier's delivery of these liquors on the Fort Sill Reservation would violate any federal law, federal agen- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 383, 393]\n\u00a0\n cies exist which are charged with responsibilities to institute appropriate proceedings against the carrier in federal tribunals. In such proceedings the parties would be the United States and the carrier, and the issue of violation of federal laws would be directly, and not collaterally, presented. The complicated federal questions involved, concerning various federal statutes as well as Army rules and regulations, could be answered upon an adequate presentation of all factors essential to a right and just determination.\n And, similarly, if the several hundred Army Officers who ordered and paid for these liquors have acted contrary to United States Statutes, Army Regulations, or Orders of the Post Commandant, it is not to be doubted that the Army or some other United States agency is capable of determining what course shall be pursued. Should the United States determine to proceed in the matter it could do so at such time and place as least would hamper essential military training, and the Army Officers would be heard before they would be stigmatized as law breakers and subjected as such to Army discipline. We will not, at this time, and upon this inadequate record, resolve all doubts against the lawfulness of their conduct in order to deny relief against a plainly unlawful seizure of their property from an interstate carrier whose good faith has not been questioned.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER, dissenting.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS and I are unable to agree with the Court's decision.\n The ultimate issue in this case is whether a federal court should, by issuing an injunction, aid in the consummation of what appears to be a violation of the Criminal Code of the United States. For it must not be forgotten that a mandatory injunction, the relief sought in this suit, 'is \n\n[321 \nU.S. 383, 394]\n\u00a0\n an extraordinary remedial process, which is granted, not as a matter of right, but in the exercise of a sound judicial discretion.' Morrison v. Work, \n266 \nU.S. 481, 490\n, 45 S.Ct. 149, 153.\n A large shipment of wine and spirituous liquors was seized by law- enforcement officers of the State of Oklahoma while the liquor had temporarily come to rest at the terminal of the Transit Company. The liquor, in course of transit from East St. Louis, Illinois, to the Fort Sill Military Reservation, was destined for the Officers Club at the Reservation for delivery to several hundred members of the Club on whose behalf its secretary was managing the importation of the liquor. Upon seizure the liquor was deposited in the County Court House of Oklahoma County, where it is held as an illegal shipment of intoxicating liquor subject to forfeiture and destruction. Thereupon the Transit Company brought this suit for a mandatory injunction against the state officers, requiring them to return the shipment and to refrain from interfering with its delivery by the Transit Company at the Reservation. The injunction issued and the Circuit Court of Appeals, in two separate opinions, approved, with one judge dissenting. D.C., 48 F.Supp. 594; 10 Cir., 137 F. 2d 274.\n The facts establish that which was done, if it had been done in Oklahoma proper, would under its laws have constituted a misdemeanor. Delivery of the liquor on the Reservation would therefore be an offense under the federal criminal law by virtue of the Act of June 6th, 1940, 54 Stat. 234, whereby Congress made applicable to the Reservation the penal laws of Oklahoma in existence on February 1, 1940, 18 U.S.C.  468, 18 U.S. C.A.  468. But even if there were doubt that the importation of the liquor into the Reservation under the circumstances of this record would offend the Criminal Code of the United States, on the ground that the act if committed within the jurisdiction of Oklahoma 'by the laws thereof in force on February 1, 1940 ... would be penal', equity should resolve the \n\n[321 \nU.S. 383, 395]\n\u00a0\n doubt in favor of law by denying the extraordinary remedy of injunction instead of resolving it against law by granting the injunction.\n Oklahoma is, colloquially speaking, a dry State. Only for strictly defined purposes may liquor from without the State be lawfully brought into it for consumption. Prohibited importations are penalized. If a transaction like the one before us related wholly to Oklahoma soil it would-there can hardly be doubt-be outlawed. The Circuit Judge who speaks with special knowledge of Oklahoma law assures us that 'the State of Oklahoma, by its Constitution and laws, makes it unlawful to possess, transport, furnish, or receive this particular shipment of intoxicating liquor, and it is therefore contraband and subject to seizure and confiscation under the laws of the State,' 137 F.2d at page 279. Judge Murrah calls specific attention to an Oklahoma statute which makes it a misdemeanor 'for any person in this State to receive directly or indirectly any liquors, the sale of which are prohibited by the laws of this State, from a common or other carrier.' \n1\n The opinion of Judge Phillips recognizes that this Act of 1917 penalizes the \n\n[321 \nU.S. 383, 396]\n\u00a0\n transaction before us within Oklahoma, but rejects its bearing when a federal court is asked to grant an injunction involving this law by suggesting that this statute is 'unconstitutional'. He bases this suggestion on the argument that inasmuch as the Oklahoma Supreme Court has held that a statute making mere possession of over one quart of spirituous liquors unlawful is not 'a reasonable exercise of the police powers', and therefore beyond the power of the legislature to make unlawful, Ex parte Wilson, 6 Okl.Cr. 451, 475, 119 P. 596, 606, 'it must likewise be beyond its power to make unlawful the possession of intoxicating liquor for personal use received from a common carrier.' 137 F.2d at page 277. 2 In other words, it is argued that because the Oklahoma Supreme Court held that the mere possession of liquor cannot be made a crime by Oklahoma, Oklahoma cannot prohibit the receipt of liquor from a carrier. On such reasoning a law that has been on the Oklahoma statute books for more than twenty-five years, and during that period actively enforced and never questioned, is thrown into discard when a federal court is asked to exercise its duty of discretion in granting the extraordinary relief of an injunction. I am unable to follow such reasoning because Oklahoma law makes it baseless. The validity of this provision, as already indicated, has been taken for granted by the Oklahoma courts. It was the subject of litigation in De Hasque v. Atchison, T. & S.F. Ry. Co., 68 Okl. 183, 173 P. 73, L.R.A.1918F, 259, and Crossland v. State, 74 Okl. 58, 176 P. 944, and a conviction under this Section was sus- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 383, 397]\n\u00a0\n tained in Walker v. State, 18 Okl.Cr. 661, 197 P. 520. This is a specific statute, the continuing validity of which is wholly unaffected by speculative doubts regarding other and irrelevant liquor legislation of Oklahoma. The dissenting judge was justified in reading the Act of 1917 as conclusively condemning the transaction which the carrier was seeking to consummate as an offense, were it subject to Oklahoma law. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n But the shipment of liquor in controversy was for delivery on the Fort Sill Reservation, that is, a place within the physical boundaries of Oklahoma but beyond its jurisdiction. It was stipulated between the parties that the purpose of the suit was to enable the Transit Company to transport and deliver the shipment to its destination in the Reservation. Such was the basis of the District Court's decree requiring the return of the shipment and enjoining interference with 'delivery of said shipment to its destination' and no place else. This brings us to the second half of the question in this case: may the Transit Company, according to the law that rules such matters on the Reservation, lawfully deliver this liquor at Fort Sill? Of course all transactions on the Reservation are subject to regulation by Congress. Constitution, Art. IV,  3, \n\n[321 \nU.S. 383, 398]\n\u00a0\n par. 2; see Collins v. Yosemite Park Co., \n304 \nU.S. 518\n, 58 S.Ct. 1009; Penn Dairies v. Milk Control Comm'n, \n318 \nU.S. 261\n, 63 S.Ct. 617; Pacific Coast Dairy v. Dep't of Agriculture, \n318 \nU.S. 285\n, 63 S.Ct. 628. If it chooses, Congress may provide a rule of law which runs counter to the expressed dry policy of Oklahoma, and it may do so either specifically for Fort Sill or generally for all federal reservations. Congress has not done so. It has done the opposite. For more than a hundred years most of the rules of life on national reservations have been controlled by the laws of the States in which these reservations are located. By the Act of March 3, 1825, 4 Stat. 115, Congress provided that when something is done on a federal reservation which is not made penal by the laws of Congress but which under State law, if the State had jurisdiction, would be punishable, the act should be equally punished as wrongful if committed on the reservation. In thus adopting the penal laws of the States as its code for lawful conduct on federal reservations within the States, Congress did not give to the States a free hand to impose the continuing process of State law-making on places over which the United States has jurisdiction. Only the laws of the States existing at the time when the Act of March 3, 1825 was enacted became operative on the reservations. United States v. Paul, 6 Pet. 141. And so, in view of the inevitable modifications and additions in the penal laws of the States, Congress has accommodated its adoption of those state laws, as the governing federal law, by bringing up to date from time to time its adoption for enforcement on federal reservations of the policies of the States which have penal sanctions. Accordingly, the Act of March 3, 1825, was in substance reenacted on April 5, 1866, 14 Stat. 12, 13, was carried forward in  5391 of the Revised Statutes of 1878, was again reenacted on July 7, 1898, 30 Stat. 717, and became  289 of the Federal Penal Code of 1910, 35 Stat. 1088, 1145, 18 U.S.C.A.  468. Since then and in relatively quick suc- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 383, 399]\n\u00a0\n cession, Congress has three times brought still nearer the effective date of state penal laws applicable on federal reservations, to wit by the amendments of June 15, 1933, 48 Stat. 152; June 20, 1935, 49 Stat. 394; and June 6, 1940, 54 Stat. 234. The last Amendment now controls whereby\n'Whoever ... shall do ... any act or thing which is not made penal by any laws of Congress, but which if committed or omitted within the jurisdiction of the State, Territory, or district in which such place is situated, by the laws thereof in force on February 1, 1940, and remaining in force at the time of the doing ... of such act or thing, would be penal, shall be deemed guilty of a like offense and be subject to a like punishment.' 18 U.S.C.  468, 18 U.S.C.A.  468.\n\n The very important purpose of this legislation in the working of our dual system, as expounded after the fullest consideration heretofore given to this subject by this Court, bears repetition:\n'while the statute leaves no doubt where acts are done on reservations which are expressly prohibited and punished as crimes by a law of the United States, that law is dominant and controlling, yet, on the other hand, where no law of the United States has expressly provided for the punishment of offenses committed on reservations, all acts done on such reservations which are made criminal by the laws of the several states are left to be punished under the applicable state statutes. When these results of the statute are borne in mind, it becomes manifest that Congress, in adopting it, sedulously considered the twofold character of our constitutional government, and had in view the enlightened purpose, so far as the punishment of crime was concerned, to interfere as little as might be with the authority of the states on that subject over all territory situated within their exterior boundaries, and which hence would be subject to exclusive state jurisdic- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 383, 400]\n\u00a0\n tion but for the existence of a United States reservation. In accomplishing these purposes it is apparent that the statute, instead of fixing by its own terms the punishment for crimes committed on such reservations which were not previously provided for by a law of the United States, adopted and wrote in the state law, with the single difference that the offense, although punished as an offense against the United States, was nevertheless punishable only in the way and to the extent that it would have been punishable if the territory embraced by the reservation remained subject to the jurisdiction of the State.' United States v. Press Publishing Co., \n219 \nU.S. 1, 9\n, 10 S., 31 S.Ct. 212-214, 21 Ann. Cas. 942.4\n\n Therefore the crucial question in relation to our present problem is whether any law of Congress has overridden the Oklahoma Act of 1917 which makes unlawful the transaction that the Transit Company seeks to consummate with the aid of an injunction issued by a federal court.\n There is no such law. Long before the Twenty-first Amendment, Congress did provide that 'The sale of or dealing in, beer, wine or any intoxicating liquors by any person in any post exchange or canteen or army transport or upon any premises used for military purposes by the United States, is hereby prohibited.' Act of February 2, \n\n[321 \nU.S. 383, 401]\n\u00a0\n 1901,  38, 31 Stat. 748, 758, 10 U.S.C.  1350, 10 U.S.C.A.  1350. Plainly, the purpose of this legislation is not to supplant social policies in regard to alcoholic liquor in the various States within which the many federal enclaves are located except to the extent of providing minimum regulations to restrict the free dealing in liquor at all Army posts including those within wet States. The specific barrier thus erected by Congress against the liberal liquor policies of some States should not now be used as a qualification of the generality of the Assimilative Crimes Statute in order to serve as a barrier against the prohibitory laws of other States. No such policy can be drawn from the Act of 1901-quite the opposite is implied. And assuming that the military could assert such a policy in the interest of Army morale, there is wholly lacking any manifestation that the Army deems it necessary for the morale of its officers that at Fort Sill conduct should be permitted which if committed in the surrounding territory of Oklahoma would offend its penal laws. So far as the War Department has indicated a policy, its policy like that of the Assimilative Crimes Statute is to adopt on military reservations the laws of their respective States. Thus, in reference to A.G. 250.1,  VI, par. 4 (1-20-43) of Circular No. 29 of the War Department, Jan. 25, 1943, provides: 'Beer of an alcoholic content not in excess of 3.2 per centum by weight may be sold or dealt in upon any of the mentioned premises unless a State enactment of the State in which the premises are located prohibits the sale of or dealing in such beer throughout the entire State.' And the Judge Advocate General has said that 'War Department policy does not favor sale of such (3.2) beer by exchanges in States where its sale is absolutely prohibited ....' Bulletin of the Judge Advocate General of the Army, July 1942, p. 100,  310.\n Even if there were more hypothetical doubt than the laws and decisions of Oklahoma make manifest as to the \n\n[321 \nU.S. 383, 402]\n\u00a0\n validity and vitality of the Act of 1917 and its applicability to the importation of the liquor shipment involved in this case, if the importation were into Oklahoma proper, such a contingency should be left for determination by appropriate proceedings in the state court to recover the liquor and not be made the basis for an injunction against the state law in the federal court. Since federal law here too turns on state law by adoption through the Assimilative Crimes Statute, the basis of our decision in Penn Dairies v. Milk Control Comm'n, supra, becomes relevant. Here, as in that case, there is an 'absence of some evidence of an inflexible Congressional policy', 318 U.S. at page 275, 63 S.Ct. at page 623, opposed to the policy expressed by the State. In this case as in that, we should therefore be slow to strike down state legislation by elaborate implications. The discretionary powers of equity particularly counsel against it. And even if there were more doubt than appears regarding the adoption of the Act of 1917 by the Assimilative Crimes Statute, whereby the delivery of the liquor by the Transit Company on the Reservation would constitute a misdemeanor, that doubt too should not be resolved against the law in such a proceeding as this for an injunction. That question although federal may also be litigated as part of the indicated state court suit, where the Attorney General may intervene and then come here if he chooses to assert whatever position the Government deems it appropriate to press.\n In my view therefore it was an inequitable exercise of discretion to issue this injunction. Of course, 'Equity does not demand that its suitors shall have led blameless lives.' Loughran v. Loughran, \n292 \nU.S. 216, 229\n, 54 S.Ct. 684, 689. But where the relief sought is not as to something past and collateral, but where it is the very means, as is the case here, for completing an outlawed transaction, a court of equity should withhold its aid and not become the promoter of wrongdoing. The possible illegality of the seizure \n\n[321 \nU.S. 383, 403]\n\u00a0\n of the liquor by the Oklahoma enforcement officers is quite irrelevant to our problem. 'A question of public policy is presented-not a mere adjudication of adversary rights between the two parties.' Weil v. Neary, \n278 \nU.S. 160, 171\n, 49 S.Ct. 144, 149. The abstention which equity exercises, as it should here, under the shorthand phrase of the 'clean hands doctrine' is not due to any desire to punish a litigant for his uncleanlines. 'But the objection that the plaintiff comes with unclean hands will be taken by the court itself. It will be taken despite the wish to the contrary of all the parties to the litigation. The court protects itself.' Mr. Justice Brandeis in Olmstead v. United States, \n277 \nU.S. 438, 485\n, 48 S.Ct. 564, 575, 66 A.L.R. 376. It is hardly seemly for a federal court to order the return of liquor seized with full knowledge by the court that the carrier would use the liquor to share in the commission of a misdemeanor. The penal statute here applicable is a police regulation violation of which ought not to be furthered by a federal court. While its violation does not imply moral turpitude, Congress has required that army officers should also conform to the law of a State on which military reservations are located in matters that are outside military concern. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Oklahoma Laws, 1913, c. 52, p. 90, 80 O.S.1941  4. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] See Utley v.

These penal statutes are designed to enforce a system of licensing such imports by special permits issued by a state agency. Okl.Stat.1941, Title 37,  41-48. Importation of liquors without a special permit is made penal. Ibid .,  41, 46. To hold, therefore, that the assimilative crimes statute adopts Oklahoma's penal liquor laws the Court might further have to hold that that statute compels federal officials on the Fort Sill Reservation to apply for and obtain state permits before they can lawfully import any liquors for any purpose. And a strong argument might be made that had Congress intended such a drastic result, it would have considered the problem and used more express language.

Petitioners have not contended that the liquor transactions here were contrary to any Army Regulations, and no Regulations have come to our attention which would indicate that there is a basis for such a contention. Whether the declaration of policies contained in these various regulations indicates an intention of the War Department to permit all liquor transactions not expressly prohibited and whether, if it does, the War Department has the power under Acts of Congress to permit such transactions, seem open questions. \n[\nFootnote 10\n] Standard Oil Co. of California v.

Laws 1913, c. 26, p. 48,  6, 37 O.S.A .  82. The validity of this statute was upheld (Caffee v. State, 11 Okl.

State, 63 Okl.Cr. 445, 458, 77 P.2d 757. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] At least one other provision of Oklahoma legislation may well be found to outlaw the delivery of the shipment for the completion of which the carrier is seeking the aid of the federal court. Chapter 16, p. 16,  1 of the Laws of 1939 makes it 'unlawful for any person ... to import, bring, transport, or cause to be brought or transported into the State of Oklahoma, any intoxicating liquor ... without a permit first secured therefor as hereinafter provided.' 37 O.S.A.  41. Permits may be issued, under  2 of that Act, only for the importation of alcohol for scientific, mechanical, medicinal or sacramental purposes. 37 O.S.A.  42. Since the importation of the liquor here involved cannot possibly be said to fall within the classifications for which permits are granted, these statutory provisions as applied to the circumstances in this case are penal, and as such, may be applicable to the Reservation under the Assimilative Crimes Act. 54 Stat. 234, 18 U.S.C.  468, 18 U.S.C.A.  468.

He was persuaded that the people would not view it as any hardship, that the great class of minor offences should continue to be punished in the same manner as they had been before the cession.' \n\n\n\n\n","63":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKANN v. U.S.(1944)\nNo. 35\nArgued: November 7, 1944Decided: December 4, 1944\n\n\n\n Mr. Simon E. Sobeloff, of Baltimore, Md., for petitioner.\n Mr. William A. Paisley, of Washington, D.C., for respondent. \n\n[323 \nU.S. 88, 89]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n We took this case because it involves important questions arising under  215 of the Criminal Code. \n1\n The section provides that 'Whoever, having devised ... any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises ... shall, for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice or attempting so to do, place, or cause to be placed, any letter, ... in any post office, or ... cause to be delivered by mail according to the direction thereon, ... any such letter, ... shall be fined not more than $1,000, or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.'\n The petitioner and six others were indicted in three counts for using the mail in execution of a scheme to defraud. Petitioner's co-defendants pleaded nolo contendere. He was tried and convicted on the second and third counts, and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The indictment alleged that Triumph Explosives, Inc., is a Maryland corporation engaged in the manufacture of munitions, for the United States, a large amount of whose stock is held by the general public; that petitioner was President and a director, one of his co-defendants was an officer and director and five of them salaried executive and administrative employes of the company. The indictment continued that the defendants devised a scheme to defraud Triumph and its stockholders and obtain money for themselves by diverting part of the profits of Triumph on its Government contracts to a corporation known as Elk Mills Loading Corporation and distributing such profits through salaries, dividends, and \n\n[323 \nU.S. 88, 90]\n\u00a0\n bonuses to be paid by Elk Mills to the defendants; that, in pursuance of the scheme, Elk Mills was organized, some defendants elected officers and directors, and others elected consultants at substantial salaries, and 49% of its stock distributed to five defendants, who were administrative employes of Triumph, without consideration; that Triumph, pursuant to the plan, subcontracted a Government contract to Elk Mills for 51% of the latter's stock, on a basis which would yield Elk Mills large profits, and would involve utilization of the employes and services of Triumph in the performance of the subcontract; and that the defendants, pursuant to the scheme, received from Elk Mills salaries and bonuses for which no substantial services were rendered, and dividends, to the detriment of Triumph. It was alleged that the fraudulent scheme was misrepresented upon the minutes of Triumph and false reasons for the transaction given. Further, that, pursuant to the scheme, it was to be represented that some of the defendants would purchase with their own money, and convey to Elk Mills, certain lands for the issue to them of 49% of the stock of Elk Mills, whereas it was not intended that these defendants should use their own funds in purchasing the land to be transferred in payment of the stock, and that this plan was carried out. In summary, it was charged that the scheme was such that Triumph should be deprived of the profits rightfully belonging to it and these profits should be distributed amongst the defendants through the instrumentality of Elk Mills; that bonuses were to be paid to each of the defendants out of the profits of Elk Mills, and such bonuses were paid.\n In the first count it was charged that the defendants, for the purpose of executing the scheme, caused to be delivered by mail a check drawn by Elk Mills on the Peoples Bank of Elkton, Maryland, in favor of petitioner. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[323 \nU.S. 88, 91]\n\u00a0\n In the second, it was charged that, for the same purpose, the defendants caused to be placed in the post office at Elkton a check drawn by one Jackson on Industrial Trust Company of Wilmington, Delaware. In the third, it was charged that, for the same purpose, the defendants caused to be delivered by mail a check drawn by Elk Mills on the Peoples Bank of Elkton in favor of one of the defendants, Willis.\n At the trial the Government proved the corporate existence of Triumph, proved that Triumph held Government contracts, that Elk Mills was incorporated and became subcontractor of a Government contract, that the stock of Elk Mills was distributed amongst certain of the defendants and Triumph, as in the indictment alleged, that, under the subcontract, Elk Mills was in receipt of substantial profits and that these profits were used to pay salaries and bonuses to the defendants, including petitioner. The Government offered evidence tending to prove that certain of these actions had been concealed from other directors of Triumph and that the true situation was discovered when a federal officer made an audit of Triumph's transactions under Government contracts.\n The petitioner offered evidence tending to prove that in order to expand Triumph's business two banks had loaned large sums to Triumph under written agreements which restricted the amount it could invest in capital assets and restricted the salaries and bonuses it could pay; that the four defendants who were executive employes were dissatisfied with their compensation and threatened to leave Triumph unless they should receive increased compensation; that the directors of Triumph devised the plan of incorporating Elk Mills and subcontracting with it to make possible the payment of salaries and bonuses without violating Triumph's agreements with its banks; that petitioner had no other motive in participating in the transactions relating to Elk Mills, and that, upon being \n\n[323 \nU.S. 88, 92]\n\u00a0\n advised of the arrangement, Triumph's banks were of opinion that it did not violate the agreements.\n It was proved by the Government that one Jackson contracted with Triumph for the building of a factory for Elk Mills on land conveyed to Triumph by several of the defendants. Some of these defendants informed the contractor that he might use the timber standing on the land in the construction of the building. After he had done so they falsely represented to him that they owned the timber and that he must pay them some $12,000 for it. He did so, by a check, to their order, and, in turn, billed Triumph for the same amount. There was evidence that the petitioner was asked whether it was proper to pay the bill and that he stated he did not see why not. It is not contended that the petitioner received any of this money, and his evidence tended to show he had no knowledge of this fraud perpetrated on Triumph.\n The use of the mails proved under count 2 was this: The check of Jackson, the contractor, for purchase of the timber, to the order of defendants Deibert, Feldman, Kann (not petitioner), Prial, and Willis, was by them endorsed and cashed at the Peoples Bank of Elkton, Maryland, and was, by that bank, deposited in the mail to be delivered to the bank in Wilmington, Delaware, on which it was drawn.\n With respect to the third count, the proof was that Elk Mills delivered its check on the Peoples Bank of Elkton for $5,000 to Willis, one of the executive employes, as a bonus. It was endorsed by Willis and deposited with the Farmers Trust Company of Newark, Delaware. The Newark bank mailed the check to the Peoples Bank of Elkton.\n The petitioner contends, first that there is no substantial evidence that the transactions involving Elk Mills' subcontract were other than innocent transactions \n\n[323 \nU.S. 88, 93]\n\u00a0\n intended to finance the Government contracts held by Triumph, in conformity to that Company's agreements with the bank; or, if the transactions were for an improper purpose, there is no proof that he was a party to any improper use of funds. Secondly, the petitioner urges that he admittedly received no money from the checks which are described in counts 2 and 3, and there is no proof he had knowledge, or reasonable cause to believe, that the checks would go through the mails and, therefore, he did not cause them to be sent or delivered within the intent of the statute. Thirdly, he urges that the mailing of the checks by the paying banks could not be for the purpose of executing the scheme since the defendants to whom those checks were delivered had received the money represented by the checks and each transaction, after such receipt, was irrevocable as respects the drawer.\n The petitioner strenuously argues his first contention, but, in the view we take of the case, we find it unnecessary to review the evidence, if we were otherwise inclined to do so in the face of the agreement of the courts below that a case was made for the jury on the question of the fraudulent nature of the scheme and the petitioner's participation in it.\n With respect to the second contention, while there may be some question as to whether the defendants may be said to have 'caused' the mailing of the checks, we think it a fair inference that those defendants who drew, or those who cashed, the checks believed that the banks which took them would mail them to the banks on which they were drawn, and assuming the petitioner participated in the scheme, their knowledge was his knowledge. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n The remaining contention is that the checks were not mailed in the execution of, or for the purpose of executing, the scheme. The check delivered to the five defendants \n\n[323 \nU.S. 88, 94]\n\u00a0\n by the building contractor in payment for timber they claimed to own was cashed by them at a local bank in Elkton, Maryland. By cashing it they received the moneys it was intended they should receive under the scheme. The Elkton bank became the owner of the check. \n5\n The same is true of the bonus check delivered to defendant Willis and deposited and credited to his account. The banks which cashed or credited the checks, being holders in due course, were entitled to collect from the drawee bank in each case and the drawer had no defense to payment. The scheme in each case had reached fruition. The persons intended to receive the money had received it irrevocably. It was immaterial to them, or to any consummation of the scheme, how the bank which paid or credited the check would collect from the drawee bank. It cannot be said that the mailings in question were for the purpose of executing the scheme, as the statute requires. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n The case is to be distinguished from those where the mails are used prior to, and as one step toward, the receipt of the fruits of the fraud, such as United States v. Kenofskey, \n243 \nU.S. 440\n, 37 S.Ct. 438.7 Also to be distinguished are cases where the use of the mails is a means of concealment so that further frauds which are part of the scheme \n\n[323 \nU.S. 88, 95]\n\u00a0\n may be perpetrated. \n8\n In these the mailing has ordinarily had a much closer relation to further fraudulent conduct than has the mere clearing of a check, although it is conceivable that this alone, in some settings, would be enough. The federal mail fraud statute does not purport to reach all frauds, but only those limited instances in which the use of the mails is a part of the execution of the fraud, leaving all other cases to be dealt with by appropriate state law.\n The Government argues that the scheme was not complete, that so long as Elk Mills remained a subcontractor the defendants expected to receive further bonuses and profits and that the clearing of these checks in the ordinary course was essential to its further prosecution. But, even in that view, the scheme was completely executed as respects the transactions in question when the defendants received the money intended to be obtained by their fraud, and the subsequent banking transactions between the banks concerned were merely incidental and collateral to the scheme and not a part of it.\n We hold, therefore, that one element of the offense defined by the statute, namely, that the mailing must be for the purpose of executing the fraud, is lacking in the present case. The judgment must be reversed.\n So ordered.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice BLACK, Mr. Justice JACKSON and Mr. Justice RUTLEDGE concur, dissenting.\n I hardly think we would set this conviction aside if the collecting bank instead of cashing the checks took them for collection only and refused to pay the defendants until the checks had been honored by the drawee. It is plain \n\n[323 \nU.S. 88, 96]\n\u00a0\n that the mails would then be used to obtain the fruits of the fraud. And I do not see why the fraud fails to become a federal offense merely because the collecting bank cashes the checks. That would seem to be irrelevant under these circumstances. As pointed out in Decker v. United States, 4 Cir., 140 F.2d 378, 379, 151 A.L.R. 754 the object of the scheme was to defraud Triumph; and the use of the mails was an essential step to that end. It is true that the collecting bank was a holder in due course against whom the drawer had no defense. But that does not mean that the fraudulent scheme had reached fruition at that point of time. Yet if legal technicalities rather than practical considerations are to decide that question it should be noted that the defendants were payee-indorsers of the checks. They had received only a conditional credit, or payment as the case may be. It took payment by the drawee to discharge them from their liability as indorsers. Not until then would the defendants receive irrevocably the proceeds of their fraud.\n Moreover, this was not the last step in the fraudulent scheme. It was a continuing venture. Smooth clearances of the checks were essential lest these intermediate dividends be interrupted and the conspirators be called upon to disgorge. Different considerations would be applicable if we were dealing with incidental mailings. But we are not. To obtain money was the sole object of this fraud. The use of the mails was crucial to the total success of the fraudulent project. We are not justified in chopping up the vital banking phase of the scheme into segments and isolating one part from the others. That would be warranted if the scheme were to defraud the collecting bank. But it is plain that these plans had a wider reach and that but for the use of the mails they would not have been finally consummated. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 18 U.S.C.  338, 18 U.S.C.A.  338. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 4 Cir., 140 F.2d 380. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The Government abandoned the first count at the trial. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Weiss v.

CLARK(1944)\nNo. 634\nArgued: Decided: May 22, 1944\n\n\n\n\n[322 \nU.S. 393, 394]\n\u00a0\n On Appeal from the Supreme Court of the State of Michigan.\n Mr. Irvin Long, of Detroit, Mich. for appellants.\n Messrs. Harry J. Merritt and Wm. Clarence Hudson, both of Royal Oak, Mich., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In this case appellants argue that certain provisions of two Acts passed by the Michigan legislature in 1937 are void in that, contrary to Art. I, sec. 10 of the United States Constitution, they impair the obligation of special assessment drain bonds issued in 1927, some of which are owned by appellants. The case is here on appeal from the Supreme Court of Michigan. 28 U.S.C.  344(a), 28 U.S.C.A.  344(a).1\n So far as here relevant, the two Acts2 said to be unconstitutional provide that parcels of land subject to special assessment for drain projects may be sold for unpaid taxes, and also provide that the purchaser at such a sale shall be \n\n[322 \nU.S. 393, 395]\n\u00a0\n granted a title free of all encumbrances, including all assessments for drain projects already constructed. The proceeds of each tax sale are applied towards payment of the unpaid drain assessment on the particular parcel of land, as well as towards payment of other delinquent taxes. Pursuant to these Acts, the State of Michigan has sold tax delinquent properties located in the drain district which issued appellants' bonds. The deeds of sale purport to release the properties from all encumbrances, including all assessments on account of the 1927 drain project.\n Appellants do not contend that the challenged Acts impair any term of the contract printed on the face of the drain bonds. What they contend is that the Acts impair a right secured to them by a statutory provision which was the law of Michigan at the time their bonds were issued and which, they say, became a part of the bond contract. See Von Hoffman v. City of Quincy, 4 Wall. 535, 550. The statutory provision upon which they rely reads:\n'If there is not sufficient money in the fund in a particular drain at the time of the maturity of the bonds last to mature to pay all outstanding bonds with interest, ... it shall be the duty of the commissioner to at once levy an additional assessment as hereinbefore provided in such an amount as will make up the deficiency.' Chapter X,  18, Act 316, Mich.Pub. Acts of 1923, as amended by Act 331, Mich.Pub. Acts of 1927\n\n\n\n Appellants' argument is that this statute has given them an indefeasible right to have a deficiency assessment levied on each privately owned parcel of land in the drain district, regardless of whether a particular parcel already has been sold at a tax sale and the proceeds applied toward payment of the drain bonds. In practical effect, they assert that by this statute lands subject to assessment for their drain bonds are subject to be sold not just once, but twice, for payment of the single benefit which the lands \n\n[322 \nU.S. 393, 396]\n\u00a0\n received from the original drain project. Consequently, their argument runs, the Michigan legislature was powerless to provide that purchasers of tax-delinquent property in the drain district be exempt from a deficiency drain assessment.\n This argument the Supreme Court of Michigan refused to accept. Emphasizing the serious consequences of such a hobbling of the State's powers to meet pressing problems, the Court pointed out that the power of the State to sell tax-delinquent lands free of the burden of assessments for completed drain projects was essential not only to protect the bondholders themselves but to protect the public interest. Without power in the State to offer an attractive title to prospective purchasers, the Court found, many of such lands would remain tax-delinquent and thereby be rendered valueless for all public revenue purposes, including drain assessments. The Court decined to read into the statute relied upon by appellants any purpose to permit drain districts to surrender the State's sovereign power to provide for the sale of tax-delinquent property free of encumbrances. It held that under Michigan law in effect when appellants' special assessment drain bonds were issued the bondholders' 'maximum security' for payment of assessments against drain district lands was the parcels of land themselves, and that when the bondholders received their fair share of the proceeds derived from the tax sale of any particular parcel they had received everything to which their bond contracts entitled them. Keefe v. Drain Com'r of Oakland County, 306 Mich. 503, 511, 512, 11 N.W.2d 220.\n Before we can find impairment of a contract we must find an obligation of the contract which has been impaired. Since the contract here relied upon is one between a political subdivision of a state and private individuals, settled principles of construction require that the obligation alleged to have been impaired be clearly and unequivocally \n\n[322 \nU.S. 393, 397]\n\u00a0\n expressed. This rule of construction applies with special force in the case at bar, for the interpretation of the bond contract urged by appellants would result in a drastic limitation upon the power of Michigan to enact legislation designed to remedy a situation obviously inimical to the interests of both municipal creditors and the general public. 3 'The continued existence of a government would be of no great value, if, by implications and presumptions, it was disarmed of the powers necessary to accomplish the ends of its creation.' Charles River Bridge v. Proprietors of Warren Bridge, 11 Pet. 420, 548; and see Gilman v. City of Sheboygan, 2 Black 510, 513; Fisher v. New Orleans, \n218 \nU.S. 438\n, 31 S.Ct. 57.\n We do not find in the provision of the drain statute relied upon by appellants a clear and unequivocal purpose of Michigan to permit drain districts to bargain away the State's power to sell tax-delinquent lands free of encumbrances. Long before the date when appellants' bonds were issued, the Michigan Supreme Court had held that, 'The general rule is that a sale and a conveyance (by the \n\n[322 \nU.S. 393, 398]\n\u00a0\n State) in due form for taxes extinguishes all prior liens, whether for taxes or otherwise. This rule is one of necessity, growing out of the imperative nature of the demand of the government for its revenues.' Auditor General v. Clifford, 143 Mich. 626, 630, 107 N.W. 287, 289; and see Municipal Investors Ass'n v. City of Birmingham, 298 Mich. 314, 325, 326, 299 N.W. 90, and cases there cited. The provision of the drain statute upon which appellants rest their case does not expressly purport to alter this 'rule of necessity.' On its face it deals only with the levy of an additional assessment in the event that drain bonds are not paid in full at maturity, and does not assume to deal with the manner of selling tax-delinquent properties in drain districts or the kind of title that can be conveyed at such sales. 'The language falls far short of subjecting lots which have been sold to pay tax or assessment liens to an additional assessment for the deficit. Such a construction would defeat the remedy of tax sales as a means of realizing the assessment lien.' Municipal Investors Ass'n v.

Land speculation ran riot in Michigan in the 1920's, bringing with it construction of subdivisions, paving and drainage projects, etc. Inflated land values produced their inevitable consequences. In the early 1930's a large part of Michigan lands had a market value far less than the unpaid property and improvement taxes accumulated upon them. Attempting to remedy the situation, the legislature tried tax collection moratoriums, and for six years no tax sales were held, but still unpaid taxes continued to amass. Property owners abandoned their heavily encumbered real estate; the state and local governments could get no revenue from the delinquent property; and municipal creditors could get neither principal nor interest. All suffered alike. Finally in 1937, upon the recommendation of legislative committees and planning commissions, Acts 114 and 155, supra, Note 1, together with Act 325, were passed by the legislature in an attempt to collect unpaid taxes and to free property of its accumulated tax burden. \n\n\n\n\n","65":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nL. P. STEUART & BRO. v. BOWLES(1944)\nNo. 793\nArgued: May 2, 1944Decided: May 22, 1944\n\n\n\n\n[322 \nU.S. 398, 399]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Renah F. Camalier, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Thomas F. Emerson, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Sec. 2(a)(2) of Act June 28, 1940, as amended by  301, Title III of the Second War Powers Act, 56 Stat. 178, 50 U.S.C.App. (Supp. III),  633, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix,  633, provides in part:\n'Whenever the President is satisfied that the fulfillment of requirements for the defense of the United States will result in a shortage in the supply of any material or of any facilities for defense or for private account or for export, the President may allocate such material or facilities in such manner, upon such conditions and to such extent as he shall deem necessary or appropriate in the public interest and to promote the national defense.'\n\n By  2(a)(8) of the Act the President is granted authority to exercise that power 'through such department, agency, or officer of the Government as he may direct and in conformity with any rules or regulations which he may prescribe.' That authority, so far as material here, was \n\n[322 \nU.S. 398, 400]\n\u00a0\n delegated to the Office of Price Administration,1 which promulgated Ration Order No. 11, effective October 22, 1942, providing for the rationing of fuel oil. \n2\n That order recited the now familiar facts concerning the then critical and acute shortage of fuel oil and other petroleum products in the Eastern states due to the great war activity. It stated that it was 'essential to guarantee the continued availability of adequate supplies of fuel oil for military and naval use and for industrial and agricultural operations' and that the 'reduction of demand to the available supply is sought to be achieved largely by a curtailment of the use of fuel oil for heating premises and for hot water, virtually the only classes of uses which can be uniformly reduced without directly impeding the war effort.' \n3\n The order inaugurated 'a system of rationing control' deemed necessary in order 'to provide for equitable distribution of fuel oil in the areas of shortage.' \n4\n Fuel oil rations for heat and for hot water were provided. Machinery was established for the regulation of the flow of fuel oil from suppliers to consumers. Only a few of those regulations are relevant here. Transfers of fuel oil to consumers were allowed only in exchange for ration coupons. \n5\n A dealer obtaining fuel oil from his supplier was generally required to surrender ration coupons within five days after the transfer. \n6\n Dealers were required, with exceptions not material here, to keep records of sales to consumers showing their names and addresses, the date and amount of the \n\n[322 \nU.S. 398, 401]\n\u00a0\n transfer, and the coupons detached. \n7\n Provision was also made for 'suspension orders' as follows:8\n'Any person who violates Ration Order No. 11 may, by administrative suspension order, be prohibited from receiving any transfers or deliveries of, or selling or using or otherwise disposing of, any fuel oil or other rationed product or facility. Such suspension order shall be issued for such period as in the judgment of the Administrator, or such person as he may designate for such purpose, is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and to promote the national security.'\n\n On December 31, 1943, a suspension order was issued against petitioner, a retail dealer in fuel oil in the District of Columbia. It was found that petitioner had obtained large quantities of fuel oil from its supplier without surrendering any ration coupons. It was found that petitioner had delivered many thousands of gallons of fuel oil to consumers without receiving ration coupons in exchange;9 and that in some instances petitioner delivered fuel oil to consumers without receipt of valid ration coupons in exchange. \n10\n Petitioner was also found to have \n\n[322 \nU.S. 398, 402]\n\u00a0\n failed to keep the required records showing its transfers of fuel oil to consumers. The suspension order prohibited petitioner from receiving fuel oil for resale or transfer to any consumer for the period from January 15, 1944 to December 31, 1944, the date when the Second War Powers Act expires. The order provided, however, that if petitioner furnished the Office of Price Administration with a list of consumers to whom it had sold fuel oil from October 21, 1941, to October 21, 1942, and if it surrendered all void ration coupons in its possession, it might transfer fuel oil to any consumer to whom it had transferred fuel oil during the year subsequent to October 21, 194111 and receive fuel oil sufficient for that purpose. The order finally provided that if the Petroleum Administrator for War12 should certify that the fuel oil needs of the District of Columbia could not be met by the supplies and the facilities of other suppliers and dealers in the area and that it was therefore essential to the welfare of the community that the provisions of the suspension order be modified, the restrictions might be wholly or partly removed. \n13\n The suspension order was issued after notice and hearings as provided in the regulations which govern the procedure in such cases. \n14\n\u00a0\n\n The present suit was brought in the District Court for the District of Columbia to enjoin the enforcement of the suspension order. A temporary restraining order was issued. Respondents moved for summary judgment. That motion was granted and the complaint was dismissed. On the appeal that judgment was affirmed. App. D.C., 140 F.2d 703. The case is here on a petition for a writ of certiorari \n\n[322 \nU.S. 398, 403]\n\u00a0\n which we granted because of the importance of the problem in the administration of the rationing regulations.\n The sole question presented by this case is whether the power of the President under  2(a)(2) of Title III of the Second War Powers Act to 'allocate' materials includes the power to issue suspension orders against retailers and to withhold rationed materials from them where it is established they have acquired and distributed the rationed materials in violation of the ration regulations.\n We state the question that narrowly because of the posture of the case as it reaches us. The constitutional authority of Congress to authorize as a war emergency measure the allocation or rationing of materials is not challenged. No question of delegation of authority is present. It is assumed, on petitioner's concession, that the President has validly delegated to the Office of Price Administration whatever authority he has under  2(a)(2) of Title III of the Act. And no question is raised, like those involved in Yakus v. United States, \n321 \nU.S. 414\n, 64 S.Ct. 660, and Bowles v. Willingham, \n321 \nU.S. 503\n, 64 S.Ct. 641 concerning the authority of Congress to delegate to the President in this way the power to allocate materials. No contention is made that petitioner was deprived of fuel oil without a hearing and an opportunity to defend. Nor is it argued that, although the power to issue suspension orders exists, that power was abused in this instance, so as to give rise to judicial review, and the limits of the authority exceeded by the specific provisions of the order which is before us. And finally, no challenge is made of the findings which underlie this suspension order. \n15\n\u00a0\n\n The argument, rather, is that the authority to 'allocate' materials does not include the power to issue suspension orders; and that no such power will be implied since sus- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 398, 404]\n\u00a0\n pension orders are penalties to which persons will not be subjected unless the statute plainly imposes them. See Tiffany v. National Bank, 18 Wall. 409, 410; Keppel v. Tiffin Savings Bank, \n197 \nU.S. 356, 362\n, 25 S.Ct. 443, 445; Wallace v. Cutten, \n298 \nU.S. 229, 237\n, 56 S.Ct. 753, 754. In that connection it is pointed out that Congress provided criminal and civil sanctions for violations of Title III of the Act. By  2(a)(5) any person who wilfully violates those provisions of the Act or any rule, regulation or order promulgated thereunder is guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to fine and imprisonment. By  2(a)(6) federal courts have power, among others, to enjoin any violation of those provisions of the Act or any rule, regulation or order thereunder. It is therefore contended that when violations of regulations under the Act are used as the basis for withholding rationed materials from persons, sanctions for law enforcement are created by administrative fiat contrary to the Act in question and contrary to constitutional requirements.\n We agree that it is for Congress to prescribe the penalties for the laws which it writes. It would transcend both the judicial and the administrative function to make additions to those which Congress has placed behind a statute. United States v. Two Hundred Barrels of Whiskey, \n95 \nU.S. 571\n; Campbell v. Galeno Chemical Co., \n281 \nU.S. 599\n, 50 S.Ct. 412; Wallace v. Cutten, supra. Hence we would have no difficulty in agreeing with petitioner's contention if the issue were whether a suspension order could be used as a means of punishment of an offender. But that statement of the question is a distortion of the issue presented on this record.\n The problem of the scarcity of materials is often acute and critical in a great war effort such as the present one. Whether the difficulty be transportation or production, there is apt to be an insufficient supply to meet essential civilian needs after military and industrial requirements \n\n[322 \nU.S. 398, 405]\n\u00a0\n have been satisfied. Thus without rationing, the fuel tanks of a few would be full; the fuel tanks of many would be empty. Some localities would have plenty; communities less favorably situated would suffer. Allocation or rationing is designed to eliminate such inequalities and to treat all alike who are similarly situated. The burdens are thus shared equally and limited supplies are utilized for the benefit of the greatest number. But middlemen-wholesalers and retailers-bent on defying the rationing system could raise havoc with it. By disregarding quotas prescribed for each householder and by giving some more than the allotted share they would defeat the objectives of rationing and destroy any program of allocation. These middlemen are the chief if not the only conduits between the source of limited supplies and the consumers. From the viewpoint of a rationing system a middleman who distributes the product in violation and disregard of the prescribed quotas is an inefficient and wasteful conduct. If the needs of consumers are to be met and the consumer allocations are to be filled, prudence might well dictate the avoidance or discard of such inefficient and unreliable means of distribution of a scarce and vital commodity. Certainly we could not say that the President would lack the power under this Act to take away from a wasteful factory and route to an efficient one a precious supply of material needed for the manufacture of articles of war. That power of allocation or rationing might indeed be the only way of getting the right equipment to our armed forces in time. From the point of view of the factory owner from whom the materials were diverted the action would be harsh. He would be deprived of an expected profit. But in times of war the national interest cannot wait on individual claims to preference. The waging of war and the control of its attendant economic problems are urgent business. Yet if the President has the power to channel raw materials into the most efficient industrial \n\n[322 \nU.S. 398, 406]\n\u00a0\n units and thus save scarce materials from wastage it is difficult to see why the same principle is not applicable to the distribution of fuel oil.\n If petitioner established that he was eliminated as a dealer or that his quota was cut down for reasons not relevant to allocation or efficient distribution of fuel oil, quite different considerations would be presented. But we can make no such assumption here. The suspension order rests on findings of serious violations repeatedly made. These violations were obviously germane to the problem of allocation of fuel oil. For they indicated that a scarce and vital commodity was being distributed in an inefficient, inequitable and wasteful way. The character of the violations thus negatives the charge that the suspension order was designed to punish petitioner rather than to protect the distribution system and the interests of conservation. Moreover, there is the following finding in support of the limitation on the number of customers which petitioner may hereafter service:\n'We have no way of knowing how many customers the respondent corporation can serve while at the same time faithfully observing the rationing regulations. But we do know from its clearly established violations from the very inception of fuel-oil rationing that the number it then served approached the upper limit of its capacity since the fact is clear that it did not (whether it would not or could not) thereafter both service this number and simultaneously comply with the rationing regulations. Additional customers, then, clearly impose a burden which the respondent cannot bear.'\n\n None of the findings is challenged here. Taken at their face value, as they must be, they refute the suggestion that the order was based on considerations not relevant to the problem of allocation. They sustain the conclusion that in restricting petitioner's quota the Office of Price Administration was doing no more than protecting a com- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 398, 407]\n\u00a0\n munity against distribution which measured by rationing standards was inequitable, unfair, and inefficient. If the power to 'allocate' did not embrace that power it would be feeble power indeed.\n What we have said disposes of the argument that if petitioner has violated Ration Order No. 11 the only recourse of the government is to proceed under  2(a)(5) or  2(a)(6) which provide criminal and civil sanctions. Those remedies are sanctions for the power to 'allocate'. They hardly subtract from that power. Yet they would be allowed to do just that if it were held that violations by middlemen of the ration orders and regulations could never be the basis of reallocation of fuel oil into more reliable channels of distribution.\n It is finally pointed out that Congress has seldom used the licensing power16 and that that power, when used, has been employed sparingly. Thus one of the sanctions of the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942, 56 Stat. 33, 50 U.S.C.App. (Supp. III)  925, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix,  925, is the power to revoke licenses for violations of maximum prices or rents.  205( f). That power may be utilized only in judicial proceedings; and licenses may be suspended only for limited periods.  205(f)(2). That consideration would be germane to the present problem if Congress had implemented the allocation procedure with a licensing system. Then the question might arise whether revocation of the license rather than the reallocation of materials by administrative action was the appropriate procedure in case of violations. Congress, however, did not adopt the licensing system when it came to rationing. And the failure to do so is hardly a reason for saying that the power to 'allocate' is less replete than a reading of the Act fairly permits.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS dissents. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Executive Order April 8, 1942, No. 9125, 7 Fed.Reg. 2719; War Production Board, Supplementary Directive 1-0, Oct. 16, 1942, 7 Fed.Reg. 8418. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 7 Fed.Reg. 8480. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Id., p. 8480. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] Id., p. 8480.

As the questioned confession followed a previous confession which was given on the same day and which was admittedly involuntary,1 the issue is the voluntary character of the second confession under the circumstances which existed at the time and place of its signature and, particularly, because of the alleged continued influence of the unlawful inducements which vitiated the prior confession.\n The petitioner was convicted in the state district court of Choctaw County, Oklahoma, on an information charging him and another with the crime of murder. The jury fixed his punishment at life imprisonment. The conviction was affirmed by the Criminal Court of Appeals, 75 Okl.Cr. --, 138 P.2d 142, rehearing 140 P.2d 248, and this Court granted certiorari, \n320 \nU.S. 732\n, 64 S.Ct. 202, upon the petitoner's representation that there had been admitted against him an involuntary confession procured under circumstances which made its use in evidence a violation of his rights under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[322 \nU.S. 596, 598]\n\u00a0\n Prior to Sunday, December 31, 1939, Elmer Rogers lived with his wife and three small sons in a tenant house situated a short distance northwest of Fort Towson, Choctaw County, Oklahoma. Late in the evening of that day Mr. and Mrs. Rogers and a four year old son Elvie were murdered at their home and the house was burned to conceal the crime.\n Suspicion was directed toward the petitioner Lyons and a confederate, Van Bizzell. On January 11, 1940. Lyons was arrested by a special policeman and another officer whose exact official status is not disclosed by the record. The first formal charge that appears is at Lyons' hearing before a magistrate on January 27, 1940. Immediately after his arrest there was an interrogation of about two hours at the jail. After he had been in jail eleven days he was again questioned, this time in the county prosecutor's office. This interrogation began about six-thirty in the evening, and on the following morning between two and four produced a confession. This questioning is the basis of the objection to the introduction as evidence of a second confession which was obtained later in the day at the state penitentiary at McAlester by Warden Jess Dunn and introduced in evidence at the trial. There was also a third confession, oral, which was admitted on the trial without objection by petitioner. This was given to a guard at the penitentiary two days after the second. Only the petitioner, police, prosecuting and penitentiary officials were present at any of these interrogations, except that a private citizen who drove the car that brought Lyons to McAleser witnessed this second confession. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 596, 599]\n\u00a0\n Lyons is married and was twenty-one or two years of age at the time of the arrest. The extent of his education or his occupation does not appear. He signed the second confession. From the transcript of his evidence, there is no indication of a subnormal intelligence. He had served two terms in the penitentiary-one for chicken stealing and one for burglary. Apparently he lived with various relatives.\n While petitioner was competently represented before and at the trial, counsel was not supplied him until after his preliminary examination, which was subsequent to the confessions. His wife and family visited him between his arrest and the first confession. There is testimony by Lyons of physical abuse by the police officers at the time of his arrest and first interrogation on January 11th. His sister visited him in jail shortly afterwards and testified as to marks of violence on his body and a blackened eye. Lyons says that this violence was accompanied by threats of further harm unless he confessed. This evidence was denied in toto by officers who were said to have participated.\n Eleven days later the second interrogation occurred. Again the evidence of assault is conflicting. Eleven or twelve officials were in and out of the prosecutor's small office during the night. Lyons says that he again suffered assault. Denials of violence were made by all the participants accused by Lyons except the county attorney, his assistant, the jailer and a highway patrolman. Disinterested witnesses testified to statements by an investigator which tended to implicate that officer in the use of force, and the prosecutor in cross-examination used language which gave color to defendant's charge. It is not disputed that the inquiry continued until two-thirty in the morning before an oral confession was obtained and that a pan of the victims' bones was placed in Lyon's lap by his \n\n[322 \nU.S. 596, 600]\n\u00a0\n interrogators to bring about his confession. As the confession obtained at this time was not offered in evidence, the only bearing these events have here is their tendency to show that the later confession at McAlester was involuntary.\n After the oral confession in the early morning hours of January 23, Lyons was taken to the scene of the crime and subjected to further questioning about the instruments which were used to commit the murders. He was returned to the jail about eight-thirty A.M. and left there until early afternoon. After that the prisoner was taken to a nearby town of Antlers, Oklahoma. Later in the day a deputy sheriff and a private citizen took the petitioner to the penitentiary. There, sometime between eight and eleven o'clock on that same evening, the petitioner signed the second confession.\n When the confession which was given at the penitentiary was offered, objection was made on the ground that force was practiced to secure it and that even if no force was then practiced, the fear instilled by the prisoner's former treatment at Hugo on his first and second interrogations continued sufficiently coercive in its effect to require the rejection of the second confession.\n The judge in accordance with Oklahoma practice and, after hearing evidence from the prosecution and the defense in the absence of the jury, first passed favorably upon its admissibility as a matter of law, Lyons v. State, Okl.Cr.App., 138 P.2d 142, 163; cf. McNabb v. United States, \n318 \nU.S. 332\n, 338, note 5, 63 S.Ct. 608, 612, and then, after witnesses testified before the jury as to the voluntary character of the confession, submitted the guilt or innocence of the defendant to the jury under a full instruction, approved by the Criminal Court of Appeals, to the effect that voluntary confessions are admissible against the person making them but are to be 'carefully scrutinized and received with great caution' \n\n[322 \nU.S. 596, 601]\n\u00a0\n by the jury and rejected if obtained by punishment, intimidation or threats. It was added that the mere fact that a confession was made in answer to inquiries 'while under arrest or in custody' does not prevent consideration of the evidence if made 'freely and voluntarily.' The instruction did not specifically cover the defendant's contention, embodied in a requested instruction, that the second confession sprang from the fear engendered by the treatment he had received at Hugo.\n The mere questioning of a suspect while in the custody of police officers is not prohibited either as a matter of common law or due process.

The question of how specific an instruction in a state court must be upon the involuntary character of a confession is, as a matter of procedure or practice, solely for the courts of the state. When the state- approved instruction fairly raises the question of whether or not the challenged confession was voluntary, as this instruction did, the requirements of due process, under the Fourteenth Amendment, are satisfied and this Court will not require a modification of local practice to meet views that it might have as to the advantages of concreteness. The instruction given satisfies the legal requirements of the State of Oklahoma as to the particularity with which issues must be presented to its juries, lyons v. State, Okl.Cr.App., 138 P.2d 142, 164, and in view of the scope of that instruction, it was sufficient to preclude any claim of violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The federal question presented is whether the second confession was given under such circumstances that its use as evidence at the trial constitutes a violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which requires that state criminal proceedings 'shall be consistent with the fundamental principles of liberty and \n\n[322 \nU.S. 596, 602]\n\u00a0\n justice.' Hebert v. Louisiana, \n272 \nU.S. 312, 316\n, 47 S.Ct. 103, 104, 48 A.L.R. 1102; Mooney v. Holohan, \n294 \nU.S. 103, 112\n, 55 S.Ct. 340, 341, 98 A.L.R. 406; Buchalter v. New York, \n319 \nU.S. 427, 429\n, 63 S.Ct. 1129, 1130.\n No formula to determine this question by its application to the facts of a given case can be devised. Hopt v. Utah, \n110 \nU.S. 574, 583\n, 4 S.Ct. 202, 206; Betts v. Brady, \n316 \nU.S. 455, 462\n, 62 S.Ct. 1252, 1256. Here improper methods were used to obtain a confession, but that confession was not used at the trial. Later, in another place and with different persons present, the accused again told the facts of the crime. Involuntary confessions, of course, may be given either simultaneously with or subsequently to unlawful pressures, force or threats. The question of whether those confessions subsequently given are themselves voluntary depends on the inferences as to the continuing effect of the coercive practices which may fairly be drawn from the surrounding circumstances. Lisenba v. California, \n314 \nU.S. 219, 240\n, 62 S.Ct. 280, 291. The voluntary or involuntary character of a confession is determined by a conclusion as to whether the accused, at the time he confesses, is in possession of 'mental freedom' to confess to or deny a suspected participation in a crime. Ashcraft v. State of Tennessee, \n322 \nU.S. 143\n, 64 S.Ct. 921; Hysler v. Florida, \n315 \nU.S. 411, 413\n, 62 S.Ct. 688, 689.\n When conceded facts exist which are irreconcilable with such mental freedom, regardless of the contrary conclusions of the triers of fact, whether judge or jury, this Court cannot avoid responsibility for such injustice by leaving the burden of adjudication solely in other hands. But where there is a dispute as to whether the acts which are charged to be coercive actually occurred, or where different inferences may fairly be drawn from admitted facts, the trial judge and the jury are not only in a better position to appraise the truth or falsity of the defendant's assertions from the demeanor of the witnesses but the legal duty is upon them to make the decision. Lisenba v. California, supra, 314 U.S. page 238, 62 S.Ct. page 290. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 596, 603]\n\u00a0\n Review here deals with circumstances which require examination into the possibility as to whether the judge and jury in the trial court could reasonably conclude that the McAlester confession was voluntary. The fact that there is evidence which would justify a contrary conclusion is immaterial. To triers of fact is left the determination of the truth or error of the testimony of prisoner and official alike. It is beyond question that if the triers of fact accepted as true the evidence of the immediate events at McAlester, which were detailed by Warden Dunn and the other witnesses, the verdict would be that the confession was voluntary, so that the petitioner's case rests upon the theory that the McAlester confession was the unavoidable outgrowth of the events at Hugo.\n The Fourteenth Amendment does not protect one who has admitted his guilt because of forbidden inducements against the use at trial of his subsequent confessions under all possible circumstances. The admissibility of the later confession depends upon the same test-is it voluntary. Of course the fact that the earlier statement was obtained from the prisoner by coercion is to be considered in appraising the character of the later confession. The effect of earlier abuse may be so clear as to forbid any other inference than that it dominated the mind of the accused to such an extent that the later confession is involuntary. If the relation between the earlier and later confession is not so close that one must say the facts of one control the character of the other, the inference is one for the triers of fact and their conclusion, in such an uncertain situation, that the confession should be admitted as voluntary, cannot be a denial of due process. Canty v. Alabama, \n309 \nU.S. 629\n, 60 S.Ct. 612, cannot be said to go further than to hold that the admission of confessions obtained by acts of oppression is sufficient to require a reversal of a state conviction by this Court. Our judgment there relied solely upon chambers v. Florida, \n309 \nU.S. 227\n, 60 S.Ct. 472. The Oklahoma \n\n[322 \nU.S. 596, 604]\n\u00a0\n Criminal Court of Appeals in the present case decided that the evidence would justify a determination that the effect of a prior coercion was dissipated before the second confession and we agree.\n Petitioner suggests a presumption that earlier abuses render subsequent confessions involuntary unless there is clear and definite evidence to overcome the presumption. We need not analyze this contention further than to say that in this case there is evidence for the state which, if believed, would make it abundantly clear that the events at Hugo did not bring about the confession at McAlester.\n In our view, the earlier events at Hugo do not lead unescapably to the conclusion that the later McAlester confession was brought about by the earlier mistreatments. The McAlester confession was separated from the early morning statement by a full twelve hours. It followed the prisoner's transfer from the control of the sheriff's force to that of the warden. One person who had been present during a part of the time while the Hugo interrogation was in progress was present at McAlester, it is true, but he was not among those charged with abusing Lyons during the questioning at Hugo. There was evidence from others present that Lyons readily confessed without any show of force or threats within a very short time of his surrender to Warden Dunn and after being warned by Dunn that anything he might say would be used against him and that he should not 'make a statement unless he voluntarily wanted to.' Lyons, as a former inmate of the institution, was acquainted with the warden. The petitioner testified to nothing in the past that would indicate any reason for him to fear mistreatment there. The fact that Lyons, a few days later, frankly admitted the killings to a sergeant of the prison guard, a former acquaintance from his own locality, under circumstances free of coercion suggests strongly that the petitioner had concluded that it was wise to make a clean breast of his guilt and that \n\n[322 \nU.S. 596, 605]\n\u00a0\n his confession to Dunn was voluntary. The answers to the warden's questions, as transcribed by a prison stenographer, contain statements correcting and supplementing the questioner's information and do not appear to be mere supine attempts to give the desired response to leading questions.\n The Fourteenth Amendment is a protection against criminal trials in state courts conducted in such a manner as amounts to a disregard of 'that fundamental fairness essential to the very concept of justice,' and in a way that 'necessarily prevent(s) a fair trial.' Lisenba v. California, \n314 \nU.S. 219, 236\n, 62 S.Ct. 280, 290. A coerced confession is offensive to basic standards of justice, not because the victim has a legal grievance against the police, but because declarations procured by torture are not premises from which a civilized forum will infer guilt. The Fourteenth Amendment does not provide review of mere error in jury verdicts, even though the error concerns the voluntary character of a confession. We cannot say that an inference of guilt based in part upon Lyons' McAlester confession is so illogical and unreasonable as to deny the petitioner a fair trial.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS concurs in the result.\n Mr. Justice RUTLEDGE dissents.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY, dissenting.\n This flagrant abuse by a state of the rights on an American citizen accused of murder ought not to be approved. The Fifth Amendment prohibits the federal government from convicting a defendant on evidence that he was compelled to give against himself. Bram v. United States, \n168 \nU.S. 532\n, 18 S.Ct. 183. Decisions of this Court in effect have held that the Fourteenth Amendment makes this prohibition applicable to the states. Chambers v. Florida, \n\n[322 \nU.S. 596, 606]\n\u00a0\n \n309 \nU.S. 227\n, 60 S.Ct. 472; Canty v. Alabama, \n309 \nU.S. 629\n, 60 S.Ct. 612; Lisenba v. California, \n314 \nU.S. 219\n, 62 S.Ct. 280; Ashcraft v. Tennessee, \n322 \nU.S. 143\n, 64 S.Ct. 921. Cf. Green, 'Liberty Under the Fourteenth Amendment,' 27 Wash. Univ. L.Q. 497, 533. It is our duty to apply that constitutional prohibition in this case.\n Even though approximately twelve hours intervened between the two confessions and even assuming that there was no violence surrounding the second confession, it is inconceivable under these circumstances that the second confession was free from the coercive atmosphere that admittedly impregnated the first one. The whole confession technique used here constituted one single, continuing transaction. To conclude that the brutality inflicted at the time of the first confession suddenly lost all of its effect in the short space of twelve hours is to close one's eyes to the realities of human nature. An individual does not that easily forget the type of torture that accompanied petitioner's previous refusal to confess, nor does a person like petitioner so quickly recover from the gruesome effects of having had a pan of human bones placed on his knees in order to force incriminating testimony from him. Cf. State v. Ellis, 294 Mo. 269, 242 S.W. 952, 24 A.L.R. 682; Fisher v. State, 145 Miss. 116, 110 So. 361; Reason v. State, 94 Miss. 290, 48 So. 820; Whitley v. State, 78 Miss. 255, 28 So. 852, 53 L.R.A. 402; State v. Wood, 122 La. 1014, 48 So. 438, 20 L.R.A.,N.S., 392. Moreover, the trial judge refused petitoner's request that the jury be charged that the second confession was not free and voluntary if it was obtained while petitoner was still suffering from the inhuman treatment he had previously received. Thus it cannot be said that we are confronted with a finding by the trier of facts that the coercive effect of the prior brutality had completely worn off by the time the second confession was signed.\n Presumably, therefore, this decision means that state officers are free to force a confession from an individual \n\n[322 \nU.S. 596, 607]\n\u00a0\n by ruthless methods, knowing full well that they dare not use such a confession at the trial, and then, as a part of the same continuing transaction and before the effects of the coercion can fairly be said to have completely worn off, procure another confession without any immediate violence being inflicted. The admission of such a tainted confession does not accord with the Fourteenth Amendment's command that a state shall not convict a defendant on evidence that he was compelled to give against himself. Chambers v. Florida, supra; Canty v. Alabama, supra; Lisenba v. California, supra; Ashcraft v. Tennessee, supra.\n Mr. Justice BLACK concurs in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Whether or not the other evidence in the record is sufficient to justify the general verdict of guilty is not necessary to consider. The confession was introduced over defendant's objection. If such admission of this confession denied a constitutional right to defendant the error requires reversal. Bram v. United States, \n168 \nU.S. 532\n, 540-542, 18 S.Ct. 183, 185, 186. Cf. Stromberg v. California, \n283 \nU.S. 359, 367\n, 368 S., 51 S.Ct. 532, 535, 73 A.L.R. 1484; Williams v. State of North Carolina, \n317 \nU.S. 287, 291\n, 292 S., 63 S.Ct. 207, 209, 210, 143 A.L.R. 1273. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] In petitioner's brief a claim is made that Oklahoma denied to him the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. Apparently petitioner relies upon his undue detention without preliminary examination, which was in violation of the state criminal procedure as a denial by Oklahoma of equal protection of the law. But the effect of the mere denial of a prompt examining trial is a matter of state, not of federal, law. To refuse this is not a denial of equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment although it is a fact for consideration on an allegation that a confession used at the trial was coerced. Cf. McNabb v. United States, \n318 \nU.S. 332, 340\n, 63 S.Ct. 608, 612; United States v. Mitchell, \n322 \nU.S. 65\n, 64 S.Ct. 896. \n\n\n\n\n","67":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMAHNICH v. SOUTHERN S.S. CO.(1944)\nNo. 200\nArgued: January 5, 1944Decided: January 31, 1944\n\n\n\n Mr. Abraham E. Freedman, of Philadelphia, Pa., for petitioners.\n Mr. Joseph W. Henderson, of Philadelphia, Pa., for respondent. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 96, 97]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner, a seaman on respondent's vessel, the 'Wichita Falls', was injured, while at sea, by a fall from a staging, which gave way when a piece of defective rope supporting it parted. The rope was supplied by the mate when there was ample sound rope available for use in rigging the staging. The question is whether the defect in the staging was a breach of the warranty of seaworthiness rendering the owner liable to indemnify the seaman for his injury.\n Petitioner brought this suit in personam in admiralty in the District Court for Eastern Pennsylvania, to recover indemnity and maintenance and cure. On the trial the evidence showed that the mate ordered petitioner to paint the bridge and to stand on the staging for that purpose. The staging consisted of a board supported at both ends by rope which, if sound, was sufficient in strength to sustain the stage and its load. The boatswain, by direction of the mate, had cut the rope for the staging from a coil, which had been stored for two years in the Lyle gun box. The rope, intended for use with the Lyle life-saving apparatus, had never been used. There was testimony that it had been examined and tested by the boatswain and the mate and that it was generally sound in appearance. After the accident, examination of the rope at the point where it broke showed that it was so rotten as to be inadequate to support the strain imposed upon it.\n The trial judge concluded from the evidence that there was sound rope on board available for rigging the staging. He found that there was no fault in the manner in which the stage had been rigged, but that the rope selected by the mate was defective and that petitioner's injury was attributable to the negligence of the boatswain and the \n\n[321 \nU.S. 96, 98]\n\u00a0\n mate in failing to observe the defect. \n1\n He held that the proceeding was brought too late to recover for the negligence under the Jones Act, and that the 'Wichita Falls' was not unseaworthy by reason of the defective rope used in rigging the staging, citing Plamals v. The Pinar Del Rio, \n277 \nU.S. 151, 155\n, 48 S.Ct. 457, 458. He accordingly denied indemnity to petitioner, but gave judgment in his favor for maintenance and cure.\n The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed, 129 F.2d 857, 135 F.2d 602, by a divided court, resting its decision on the statement quoted from the opinion in The Pinar Del Rio, supra, 277 U.S. at page 155, 48 S.Ct. at page 458, that 'The record does not support the suggestion that the Pinar Del Rio was unseaworthy. The mate selected a bad rope when good ones were available.' We granted certiorari, \n320 \nU.S. 725\n, 64 S.Ct. 56, upon a petition which urged that the statement quoted from The Pinar Del Rio, supra, does not rule this case, and that the decision below is inconsistent with the decisions in The Osceola, \n189 \nU.S. 158\n, 23 S.Ct. 483, and in Socony-Vacuum Oil Co. v. Smith, \n305 \nU.S. 424\n, 59 S.Ct. 262.\n The sole issue presented by the petition for certiorari is that of respondent's liability to indemnify petitioner for the injury suffered by reason of the defective staging. No question is raised with respect to petitioner's right to recover under the Jones Act or his right to the award of maintenance and cure or its adequacy.\n A finding of seaworthiness is usually a finding of fact. Luckenbach v. W. J. McCahan Sugar Refining Co., \n248 \nU.S. 139, 145\n, 39 S.Ct. 53, 54, 1 A.L.R. 1522; Steel v. State Line S.S. Co., L.R. 3 A.C. 72, 81, 82, 90, 91. Ordinarily we do not, in admiralty, more than in other \n\n[321 \nU.S. 96, 99]\n\u00a0\n cases, review the concurrent findings of fact of two courts below. The Camb Prince, \n170 \nU.S. 655, 658\n, 18 S.Ct. 753, 754, 755; The Wildcroft, \n201 \nU.S. 378, 387\n, 26 S.Ct. 467, 468; Luckenbach v. W. J. McCahan Sugar Refining Co., supra; Piedmont & George's Creek Coal Co. v. Seaboard Fisheries Co., \n254 \nU.S. 1, 13\n, 41 S.Ct. 1, 5; Just v. Chambers, \n312 \nU.S. 383, 385\n, 668 S., 61 S.Ct. 687, 690. Here, however, both courts below, holding themselves bound by The Pinar Del Rio, supra, have, on the facts found, held as a matter of law that the staging was seaworthy despite its defect. That conclusion of law is reviewable here.\n Until the enactment of the Jones Act, 41 Stat. 1007, 46 U.S.C.  688, 46 U.S.C.A.  688, the maritime law afforded no remedy by way of indemnity beyond maintenance and cure, for the injury to a seaman caused by the mere negligence of a ship's officer or member of the crew. But the admiralty rule that the vessel and owner are liable to indemnify a seaman for injury caused by unseaworthiness of the vessel or its appurtenant appliances and equipment, has been the settled law since this Court's ruling to that effect in The Osceola, supra, 189 U.S. at page 175, 23 S.Ct. at page 487. Chelentis v. Luckenbach S.S. Co., \n247 \nU.S. 372, 380\n, 381 S., 38 S.Ct. 501, 502, 503; Carlisle Packing Co. v. Sandanger, \n259 \nU.S. 255, 258\n, 260 S., 42 S.Ct. 475, 476, 477; Pacific S.S. Co. v. Peterson, \n278 \nU.S. 130, 134\n, 49 S.Ct. 75, 76; Cortes v. Baltimore Insular Line, \n287 \nU.S. 367, 370\n, 371 S., 53 S.Ct. 173, 174; Warner v. Goltra, \n293 \nU.S. 155, 158\n, 55 S.Ct. 46, 48; The Arizona v. Anelich, \n298 \nU.S. 110\n, 120 et seq., 56 S.Ct. 707, 710; Socony-Vacuum Oil Co. v. Smith supra, 305 U.S. at pages 428, 429, 59 S.Ct. at page 265; O'Donnell v. Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co., \n318 \nU.S. 36, 40\n, 63 S.Ct. 488, 491. The latter rule seems to have been derived from the seaman's privilege to abandon a ship improperly fitted out, and was generally applied, before its statement in The Osceola, supra, by numerous decisions of the lower federal courts during the last century. See The Arizona v. Anelich, supra, 298 U.S. at page 121, 56 S.Ct. at page 710, footnote 2.\n This was a recognized departure from the rule of the English law, which allowed no recovery other than maintenance and cure for injuries caused by unseaworthiness, Couch v. Steel, 3 El. & Bl. 402, until the enactment of the \n\n[321 \nU.S. 96, 100]\n\u00a0\n Merchant Shipping Act of 1876, 39 & 40 Vict. Chap. 80,  5, reenacted by the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894, 57 & 58 Vict., Chap. 60,  458. By that statute there is annexed to every contract of service between the owner of a ship or the master and any seaman thereof, an obligation that all reasonable means be used to insure the seaworthiness of the ship before and during the voyage. See Hedley v. Pinkney Steamship Co., (1894) A.C. 222.\n In a number of cases in the federal courts, decided before The Osceola, supra, the right of the seaman to recover for injuries caused by unseaworthiness seems to have been rested on the negligent failure, usually by the seaman's officers or fellow seamen, to supply seaworthy appliances. The Noddleburn, D.C., 28 F. 855, affirmed 30 F. 142; The Neptuno, D.C., 30 F. 925; The Frank and Willie, D.C., 45 F. 494; The Julia Fowler, D.C., 49 F. 277; Wm. Johnson & Co. v. Johansen, 5 Cir., 86 F. 886; and see The Columbia, D.C., 124 F. 745; The Lyndhurst, D.C., 149 F. 900. But later cases in this and other federal courts have followed the ruling of the Osceola, supra, that the exercise of due diligence does not relieve the owner of his obligation to the seaman to furnish adequate appliances. \n2\n Carlisle Packing Co. v. Sandanger, supra, 259 U.S. at pages 259, 260, 42 S. Ct. at pages 476, 477; The Arizona v. Anelich, supra, 298 U. S. at page 120 et seq., 56 S.Ct. at page 710; Beadle v. Spencer, \n298 \nU.S. 124, 128\n, 129 S., 56 S.Ct. 712, 713, 714; Socony-Vacuum Oil Co. v. Smith, supra, 305 U.S. at pages 428, 429, 432, 59 S.Ct. at pages 265, 267; The H. A. Scandrett, 2 Cir., 87 F. 2d 708, 710, 711; cf. The Edwin I. Morrison, \n153 \nU.S. 199, 210\n, 14 S.Ct. 823, 825.\n If the owner is liable for furnishing an unseaworthy appliance, even when he is not negligent, a fortiori his obligation is unaffected by the fact that the negligence of the officers of the vessel contributed to its unseaworthiness. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 96, 101]\n\u00a0\n It is true that before the Jones Act the owner was, in other respects, not responsible for injuries to a seaman caused by the negligence of officers or members of the crew. But this is not sufficient to insulate the owner from liability for their negligent failure to furnish seaworthy appliances, see Judge Addison Brown, in The Frank and Willie, supra, 45 F. at pages 495-497; Carlisle Packing Co. v. Sandanger, supra, 259 U.S. at pages 259- 260, 42 S.Ct. at pages 476, 477, more than their negligence relieves him from his liability for maintenance and cure. The Osceola, supra, 189 U.S. at page 175, 23 S.Ct. at page 487; Pacific S. S. Co. v. Peterson, supra, 278 U.S. at page 134, 49 S.Ct. at page 76; Calmar S.S. Corp. v. Taylor, \n303 \nU.S. 525, 527\n, 58 S.Ct. 651, 652, 653.\n It required the Harter Act to relax the exacting obligation to cargo of the owner's warranty of seaworthiness of ship and tackle. \n3\n That relaxation has not been extended, either by statute or by decision, to the like obligation of the owner to the seaman. The defense of the fellow servant rule to suits in admiralty for negligence, a defense precluded by the Jones Act, has never avowedly been deemed applicable to the owner's stricter obligation to the seaman of the warranty of seaworthiness.\n The Osceola, supra, in answer to certified questions, laid down as separately numbered and independent propositions the rule of the owner's unqualified obligation to furnish seaworthy appliances, and the rule that the owner is not liable to a seaman for the negligence of his fellow servants. It nowhere intimated that the owner is relieved from liability for providing an unseaworthy appliance, merely because the unseaworthiness was attributable to the negligence of fellow servants of the injured seaman rather than to the negligence of the owner. Indeed, to support the rule of absolute liability, the Court, see The Osceola, supra, 189 U.S. at pages 173-175, 23 S.Ct. at pages 486, 487, relied on cases in which the vessel or its owner had been held liable for injuries resulting from unseaworthiness, although application of the fellow \n\n[321 \nU.S. 96, 102]\n\u00a0\n servant rule would have barred recovery. Of one, The Frank and Willie, supra, the Court, after pointing out that the seaman was injured by reason of the negligent failure of the mate to provide a safe place in which to work, said, 'the question was really one of unseaworthiness, and not of negligence.'\n The Court cited, discussed and relied upon The Noddleburn, supra, Olson v. Flavel, 34 F. 477, The Frank and Willie, supra, and The Julia Fowler, supra. In each the seaman was injured as a result of his use of unseaworthy appliances rendered so by the negligence of a fellow servant. In The Julia Fowler, supra, the injury was caused by a fall from a boatswain's chair which the Court found, as in this case, was rigged with defective rope by reason of the fault of the mate. The inapplicability of the fellow servant rule to this type of case was recognized explicitly in The Noddleburn, supra, 28 F. at page 858, and in The Frank and Willie, supra, 45 F. at pages 495-497. And such was our holding in Carlisle Packing Co. v. Sandanger, supra, where it was said, 259 U.S. at page 259, 42 S.Ct. at page 477, 'without regard to negligence the vessel was unseaworthy.' See, also, the discussion in The H. A. Scandrett, supra, 87 F.2d at pages 710, 711.\n In thus refusing to limit, by application of the fellow servant rule, the liability of the vessel and owner for unseaworthiness, this Court was but applying the familiar and then well established rule of non-maritime torts, that the employer's duty to furnish the employee with safe appliances and a safe place to work, is nondelegable and not qualified by the fellow servant rule. Hough v. Railway Co., \n100 \nU.S. 213\n, 216-220; Northern Pac. R. Co. v. Herbert, \n116 \nU.S. 642, 647\n, 648 S., 6 S.Ct. 590, 592, 593; Baltimore & O.R. Co. v. Baugh, \n149 \nU.S. 368\n, 386-388, 13 S.Ct. 914, 921, 922; Union Pac. R. Co. v. Daniels, \n152 \nU.S. 684, 688\n, 689 S., 14 S.Ct. 756, 757, 758. It would be an anomaly if the fellow servant rule, discredited by the Jones Act as a defense in suits for negligence, were to be resuscitated and extended to suits founded on the warranty of \n\n[321 \nU.S. 96, 103]\n\u00a0\n seaworthiness, so as to lower the standard of the owner's duty to furnish safe appliances below that of the land employer.\n The staging from which petitioner fell was an appliance appurtenant to the ship. It was unseaworthy in the sense that it was inadequate for the purpose for which it was ordinarily used, because of the defective rope with which it was rigged. Its inadequacy rendered it unseaworthy, whether the mate's failure to observe the defect was negligent or unavoidable. Had it been adequate, petitioner would not have been injured and his injury was the proximate and immediate consequence of the unseaworthiness. See The Osceola, supra, 189 U.S. at pages 174, 175, 23 S. Ct. at pages 486, 487, and cases cited. Any negligence of the mate in selecting the rope and ordering its use as a part of the staging, or of the boatswain in using it for that purpose, could not relieve respondent of the duty to furnish a seaworthy staging. Whether petitioner knew of the defective condition of the rope does not appear, but in any case the seaman, in the performance of his duties, is not deemed to assume the risk of unseaworthy appliances. The Arizona v. Anelich, supra, 298 U.S. at page 123, 124, 56 S.Ct. at page 711, 712; Beadle v. Spencer, supra, 298 U.S. at pages 129, 130, 56 S.Ct. at pages 714, 715; Socony-Vacuum Oil Co. v. Smith, supra.\n Nor does the fact that there was sound rope on board, which might have been used to rig a safe staging, afford an excuse to the owner for the failure to provide a safe one. We have often had occasion to emphasize the conditions of the seaman's employment, see Socony-Vacuum Oil Co. v. Smith, supra, 305 U.S. at pages 430, 431, 59 S.Ct. at page 266, and cases cited, which have been deemed to make him a ward of the admiralty and to place large responsibility for his safety on the owner. He is subject to the rigorous discipline of the sea, and all the conditions of his service constrain him to accept, without critical examination and without protest, working conditions and appliances as commanded by his superior officers. These conditions, which have generated the exacting re- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 96, 104]\n\u00a0\n quirement that the vessel or the owner must provide the seaman with seaworthy appliances with which to do his work, likewise require that safe appliances be furnished when and where the work is to be done. For, as was said in The Osceola, supra, 189 U.S. at page 175, 23 S.Ct. at page 487, the owner's obligation is 'to supply and keep in order the proper appliances appurtenant to the ship.' (Italics supplied.) It is not enough that the 'Wichita Falls' had on board sound rope which could have been used to make the staging seaworthy, if in fact the staging was unsafe because sound rope was not used. The Julia Fowler, supra; The Navarino, D. C., 7 F.2d 743, 746; cf. The Portland, D.C., 213 F. 699.\n Respondent's argument that the defective rope was a consumable supply of the vessel, not falling within the requirement that the owner must furnish seaworthy equipment appurtenant to the vessel, is inappropriate here because, as we have said, it was the stage which was unseaworthy, by reason of the use of the defective rope in its construction. The stage was used in the repair of the ship, and was as intimately associated with it and with the seaman's employment as are the gangways or other appliances or the passageways used by the seaman in doing his work.\n Moreover it would not be enough to say that this case concerns a consumable supply, for in Carlisle Packing Co. v. Sandanger, supra, the owner was held liable to a seaman for unseaworthiness, where a consumable supply of the ship was stored in such fashion as to render it dangerous to the seaman who used it. There gasoline had been negligently placed in a can marked 'coal oil' and the seaman was burned by an explosion which resulted when he attempted to build a fire with the gasoline, which he had taken out of the can thinking it to be coal oil.\n The statement from The Pinar Del Rio, supra, relied upon by the two courts below, could be taken to support \n\n[321 \nU.S. 96, 105]\n\u00a0\n their decision, only on the assumption either that the presence of sound rope on the 'Wichita Falls' afforded an excuse for the failure to provide a safe staging, or that antecedent negligence of the mate in directing the use of the defective rope relieved the owner from liability for furnishing the appliance thereby rendered unseaworthy. But as we have seen, neither assumption is tenable in the light of our decisions before and since The Pinar Del Rio, supra. So far as this statement supports these assumptions, it is disapproved. We cannot follow it, and also follow The Osceola, supra, the cases which it approved and Carlisle Packing Co. v. Sandanger, supra. We prefer to follow the latter as the more consonant with principle and authority.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS.\n I think the judgment is wrong. The case does not present a situation calling for liberalizing the maritime law in favor of seamen by abolishing the defense of a fellow seaman's negligence. Congress did that in 1920, 41 Stat. 1007, 46 U.S.C.A.  688. But it required actions in such situations to be brought within two years, which it subsequently extended to three years. The sole question is whether recovery should be permitted beyond the time when Congress said action must be instituted. I should say nothing further on this question save that the method of reaching the decision seems to me contrary to right exercise of the judicial function.\n The petitioner has undoubtedly obtained care and cure to which, as a seaman, he was entitled irrespective of fault on the part of owner or master. He failed timely to avail himself of his right to sue under  33 of the Jones Act. In an action under that statute the defense of the negligence of a fellow servant would not have been open to the respondent. In an effort to obtain damages, he brought \n\n[321 \nU.S. 96, 106]\n\u00a0\n this action under the general maritime law. His recovery vel non under the unusual circumstances can be of little importance to others than himself and the respondent. But, in order to give him the demanded relief, the court resorts to nullification of an earlier decision, Plamals v. Pinar Del Rio, \n277 \nU.S. 151\n, 48 S.Ct. 457, indistinguishable in fact and law, which has stood unquestioned for sixteen years, and applied principles settled years before in The Osceola, \n189 \nU.S. 158\n, 23 S.Ct. 483.\n The history of Plamals v. Pinar Del Rio is important. The libellant, a seaman on a British ship lying in United States waters, was ordered by a mate to repair a stack. A sling was used, for which the mate selected a piece of rope. The rope broke and the seaman was injured. He filed a libel in rem against the vessel. The owner gave bond and released the ship.\n The libel, after reciting the facts, alleged that the injuries were due 'to the fault or neglect of the said steamship or those in charge of her in that the said rope was old, worn, and not suitable for use.' The libel failed to refer to  33 of the Jones Act, but, at the trial, the libellant's proctor stated that he relied upon it. The claimant in its answer asserted that the vessel was of British registry and, as the only redress open to the libellant was under the British Workmen's Compensation Law, the Admiralty Court should decline jurisdiction. The claimant amended its answer to deny liability on the ground that the ship was provided with proper tackle but, through the negligence of an officer, bad tackle was selected.\n The District Court held that the British law,-the law of the flag,- afforded no action in rem nor any action for indemnity since there was an ample supply of good rope on board and the mate chose an insufficient rope for use.\n On appeal the Circuit Court of Appeals held that the libellant's pleadings were inadequate but, as no point had \n\n[321 \nU.S. 96, 107]\n\u00a0\n been made of their infirmity, went on to consider 'whether, on the facts proven and under any applicable law, libelant has a case.' \n1\n It said the libellant must make out a case of maritime tort; that, under the law of England, there could be no recovery and that if the applicable law were the maritime law of the United States the libellant could not recover for the improvident or negligent act of the mate, adding: 'If the vessel had been unsupplied with good and proper rope, a different question would arise.'\n That court further held that, although, under the Jones Act, libellant could have sued at law or filed a libel in personam, the statute gave no right to a libel in rem. The decree dismissing the libel was, therefore, affirmed.\n Petitioner sought review in this court and, in his petition and briefs, asserted the right to maintain a libel in rem under the Jones Act but, in the alternative, insisted that, under the general maritime law, independent of the Jones Act, the libellant was entitled to recover for the failure to supply, and keep in order, proper appliances, properly rigged, and for the unseaworthiness of the vessel in this respect.\n It will be noted how closely that case parallels the instant one. In both, though for differing reasons, the libellant was precluded from relying on the Jones Act which would have avoided all question of a fellow servant's negligence. In both, the libellant then sought to resort to his claim for indemnity for a maritime tort. In the Pinar Del Rio case (\n277 \nU.S. 151\n, 48 S.Ct. 458) it was held that he had made no case on the latter theory, and in the present case it is held that he has made out such a case. This court, in the earlier case, held two things: first, that a libel in rem cannot be maintained under the Jones Act, and, second, that, if the case were treated as the Circuit Court of Appeals had treated it,-as one for \n\n[321 \nU.S. 96, 108]\n\u00a0\n recovery of indemnity for a maritime tort,-the record would not support the claim. The court said:\n'The record does not support the suggestion that the Pinar Del Rio was unseaworthy. The mate selected a bad rope when good ones were available.\n\n'We must treat the proceeding as one to enforce the liability prescribed by Section 33. It was so treated by petitioner's proctor at the original trial; and the application for certiorari here spoke of it as based upon that section. The evidence would not support a recovery upon any other ground.' (Italics added.)\n\n These holdings were made in answer to extended argument in the briefs, the petitioner on the one hand contending that the vessel should be treated as an American vessel and as being unseaworthy, respondent contending that, whether British or American, she was not unseaworthy under the law of either nation and that the libellant's injuries were due to the negligence of a fellow servant. What the court said, therefore, was clearly responsive to the contentions of the parties. The present decision does not merely disapprove language used in the earlier case. It overrules the case and alters long-established law without adequate reason.\n There has been some suggestion that the holding in the Pinar Del Rio case to which I have referred crept into the opinion by inadvertence. But I cannot assume any such thing in view of the proverbial care which all the justices exercise to prevent expression of opinion on questions not necessary to the decision of a case. The decision must be taken at face value as the expression of the views of all the members of the court.\n Cases now cited in the opinion of the court were cited and considered by the court in the Pinar Del Rio case. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[321 \nU.S. 96, 109]\n\u00a0\n The most important of them, and one on which the Circuit Court of Appeals relied in that case, was The Osceola, supra. 3 The instant decision not only overrules the Pinar Del Rio case but asserts that it is inconsistent with the holdings in The Osceola. If this be true it must be because the court has a different conception of the word consequence than that I have.\n In The Osceola this court, after the fullest consideration, recapitulated the admiralty law respecting the rights of injured seamen, inter alia, as follows (page 175 of 189 U.S., page 487 of 23 S.Ct.):\n'That the vessel and her owner are, both by English and American law, liable to an indemnity for injuries received by seamen in consequence of the unseaworthiness of the ship, or a failure to supply and keep in order the proper appliances appurtenant to the ship.' (Italics supplied.)\n\n'That all the members of the crew, except, perhaps, the master, are, as between themselves, fellow servants, and hence seamen cannot recover for injuries sustained through the negligence of another member of the crew beyond the expense of their maintenance and cure.'\n\n Unseaworthiness in the abstract does not afford a cause of action. An injury must be 'in consequence' of the unseaworthiness,-must be connected with and result from it. And 'unseaworthiness' covers a variety of situations variously affecting the work and risks of seamen. Unseaworthiness of the kind on which the court bases its opinion is very different from that due to a faulty mechanism which is an inherent risk to life and limb. If the doctrine now announced is right, a vessel supplied with the newest charts would be unseaworthy if the owner failed to remove old charts from the pilot house; it would make the owner an insurer that, no matter how \n\n[321 \nU.S. 96, 110]\n\u00a0\n many adequate facilities were at hand, no insufficient one was anywhere on the ship. Here the socalled unseaworthiness did not consist in want of adequate ropes for the seaman's need. His injury was due entirely to the negligent selection by the mate of a piece of bad rope when ample good rope was at hand. The district court found that the mate was negligent, the Circuit Court of Appeals accepted the finding, and the disposition of the case in this court is on the assumption of the correctness of this finding.\n The question, therefore, is whether the ship is liable for the mate's negligent choice of a defective piece of rope when there was plenty of good rope aboard. Under the principles announced in The Osceola, recovery in admiralty for a maritime tort is barred by the mate's negligence. It was to avoid the interposition of such a defense of a fellow servant's act that the Jones Act made the Federal Employers' Liability Act, 45 U.S.C.A.  51 et seq., applicable to the claims of injured seamen.\n The court professes to have to choose between the doctrine it reads into the decision in The Osceola case and the ruling in Pinar Del Rio. But further it asserts that Pinar Del Rio is in conflict with Carlisle Packing Co. v. Sandanger, \n259 \nU.S. 255\n, 42 S.Ct. 475, an opinion written by the same justice who wrote the opinion in the Pinar Del Rio case. The cited authority, as I read it, clearly ruled that in order for a seaman to recover for an injury where the ship is unseaworthy the unseaworthiness must be the direct cause of his injury.\n That was an action brought in a state court by an injured seaman against the owner of a motor boat. When the boat left on her voyage a can intended for the use of the crew, supposed to contain coal oil, and so labeled, had been filled with gasoline and the seaman, without notice of this fact, attempted to use the contents and was \n\n[321 \nU.S. 96, 111]\n\u00a0\n burned. The supply of life preservers was insufficient and his injuries were aggravated by his having to search for one before he could jump overboard and extinguish the flames consuming his clothing. A verdict and judgment for the seaman was sustained. This court found that erroneous instructions had been given the jury but held the error harmless since the record showed that, without regard to the owner's negligence, the vessel was unseaworthy when she left the dock, and the court held (page 259 of 259 U.S., page 477 of 42 S.Ct.): '... if thus unseaworthy and one of the crew received damage as the direct result thereof, he was entitled to recover compensatory damages.' (Italics supplied.) The court cited, amongst other cases, The Osceola.\n I am at a loss to understand the citation of this case as authority for the present decision. The reasoning of the court's opinion seems to be this: In the Carlisle Packing Co. case recovery was permitted because the injury was the direct result of unseaworthiness. That decision, therefore, requires that the owner be held liable in the instant case although the seaman's injury was not the direct result of unseaworthiness, but of the mate's negligence. It must be upon the basis of such reasoning that the Pinar Del Rio case is overruled and the judgment below reversed.\n There is some suggestion that the Pinar Del Rio case was overruled by Socony-Vacuum Oil Co. v. Smith, \n305 \nU.S. 424\n, 59 S.Ct. 262. It need only be said that the Pinar Del Rio case was not cited in the briefs of counsel in the Socony case nor referred to in the opinion and that in fact the Socony decision involved and purported to deal only with the general doctrine of assumption of risk and not with the defense of fellow servant's negligence. That the defenses are not the same is made plain by the fact that it has always been held that a fellow servant's negligence is no defense in actions brought under the Federal Em- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 96, 112]\n\u00a0\n ployers' Liability Act,4 whereas assumption of other risks was a defense5 until Congress recently explicitly acted to abolish it as such. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n Indeed, if in the Socony case, the suit had involved a fellow servant's negligence instead of the seaman's assumption of the risk involved in the use of an unsafe appliance supplied by the vessel, the case would have been so plainly ruled by earlier decisions7 that it would have merited no consideration, much less an opinion, by this court.\n The statement in the opinion that the defense of a fellow servant's negligence had never been deemed applicable to the owner's obligation to the seaman under the warranty of seaworthiness ignores the point that if the seaman is to recover the unseaworthiness must, under the authorities cited, be the direct cause of the injury. If it is not, but a fellow servant's negligence is the cause, the seaman could not recover,8 until the law was altered by the Jones Act.\n The evil resulting from overruling earlier considered decisions must be evident. In the present case, the court below naturally felt bound to follow and apply the law as clearly announced by this court. If litigants and lower federal courts are not to do so, the law becomes not a chart to govern conduct but a game of chance; instead of settling rights and liabilities it unsettles them. Counsel and \n\n[321 \nU.S. 96, 113]\n\u00a0\n parties will bring and prosecute actions in the teeth of the decisions that such actions are not maintainable on the not improbable chance that the asserted rule will be thrown overboard. Defendants will not know whether to litigate or to settle for they will have no assurance that a declared rule will be followed. But the more deplorable consequence will inevitably be that the administration of justice will fall into disrepute. Respect for tribunals must fall when the bar and the public come to understand that nothing that has been said in prior adjudication has force in a current controversy.\n Of course the law may grow to meet changing conditions. I do not advocate slavish adherence to authority where new conditions require new rules of conduct. But this is not such a case. The tendency to disregard precedents in the decision of cases like the present has become so strong in this court of late as, in my view, to shake confidence in the consistency of decision and leave the courts below on an uncharted sea of doubt and difficulty without any confidence that what was said yesterday will hold good tomorrow, unless indeed a modern instance grows into a custom of members of this court to make public announcement of a change of views and to indicate that they will change their votes on the same question when another case comes before the court. \n9\n This might, to some extent obviate the predicament in which the lower courts, the bar, and the public find themselves.\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER joins in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The dissenting judge in the Circuit Court of Appeals thought that this finding of negligence on the part of the ship's officers was erroneous. See 135 F.2d 602, 605. There was no attack on this finding here, and we have not examined the correctness of the trial judge's conclusion, for, as we will point out, the question whether there was such negligence does not control decision of the issues of this case. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] By statute the owner's similar obligation with respect to the carriage of goods is merely to exercise 'due diligence to make the ... vessel in all respects seaworthy.'

Morrison, of Philadelphia, Pa., for petitioner.\n Mr. Ralph F. Fuchs, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER announced the conclusion and judgment of the Court, and an opinion in which the CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice ROBERTS and Mr. Justice JACKSON concur.\n This is a controversy concerning a deficiency in petitioner's income tax for 1939\n\n\n In December 1938, the Governor of Pennsylvania appointed petitioner to serve an unexpired term as Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Luzerne County. Under Pennsylvania law such an interim judgeship is filled for a full term at the next election. McDonald accepted this temporary appointment with the understanding that he would contest both the primary and general elections. To obtain the support of his party organization he was obliged to pay to the party fund an 'assessment' made by the party's executive committee against all of the party's candidates. The amounts of such 'assessments' were fixed on the basis of the total prospective salaries to be received from the various offices. The salary of a common pleas judge was $12,000 a year for a term of ten years, and the 'assessment' against petitioner was fixed at $8,000. The proceeds from these 'assessments' went to the general campaign fund in the service of the party's entire ticket. In addition to this political levy, McDonald also spent $5,017.27 for customary campaign expenses-adver- \n\n[323 \nU.S. 57, 59]\n\u00a0\n tising, printing, travelling, etc. The sum of these outlays, $13,017.27, McDonald deducted as a 'reelection expense'. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue disallowed the item and notified him of a deficiency of $2,506.77.\n In appropriate proceedings before the Tax Court of the United States that Court sustained the Commissioner, 1 T.C. 738, and its decision was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 139 F.2d 400. We brought the case here, \n321 \nU.S. 762\n, 64 S.Ct. 938, to give a definitive judicial answer to an important problem in the administration of the federal income tax.\n What class of outlays may, in relation to the federal income tax, be deducted from gross income and in what amount are matters solely for Congress. Our only problem is to ascertain what provisions Congress has made regarding such expenditures as those for which the petitioner claims the right of deduction. The case is not embarrassed by any entanglement with corrupt practices legislation either state or federal.\n The materials from which must be distilled the will of Congress are the following provisions of the Internal Revenue Code:  23(a)(1)(A), 56 Stat. 798, 819, 26 U.S.C.  23(a)(1)(A) (Supp. 1943), 26 U.S.C.A.Int.Rev. Code,  23(a)(1) (A), in connection with  24(a)(1), 26 U.S.C.  24(a)(1), 26 U.S.C.A.Int.Rev.Code,  24(a)(1), and  48(d), 26 U.S.C.  48(d), 26 U. S.C.A.Int.Rev.Code,  48(d);  23(e)(2), 26 U.S.C.  23(e)(2), 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code,  23(e)(2);  23(a)(2), as amended by  121 of the Revenue Act of 1942, 56 Stat. 798, 819, 26 U.S.C.A.Int.Rev.Code,  23(a)(2).\n'All the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business' are allowed by  23(a)( 1)(A) as deductions in computing net income. According to tax law terminology ( 48(d) of the Internal Revenue Code) the performance by petitioner of his judicial office constituted carrying on a 'trade or business' within the terms of  23 of the Internal Revenue Code. He was therefore entitled to deduct from his gross income all the 'ordinary and \n\n[323 \nU.S. 57, 60]\n\u00a0\n necessary expenses' paid during 1939 in carrying on that 'trade or business.' He could, that is, deduct all expenses that related to the discharge of his functions as a judge. But his campaign contributions were not expenses incurred in being a judge but in trying to be a judge for the next ten years. That is as true of the money he spent more immediately for his own reelection as it is of the 'assessment' he paid into the party coffers for the success of his party's ticket. The incongruity of allowing such contributions as expenses incidental to the means of earning income as a judge is underlined by the insistence that payment of the 'assessment' levied by the party as a prerequisite to being allowed to be a candidate is deductible as a 'business' expense. If such 'assessments' for future acquisition of a profitable office are part of the expenses in performing the functions of that office for the taxable year, then why should not the same deduction be allowed for 'assessment' against office holders not candidates for immediate reappointment or reelection but who pay such 'assessments' out of party allegiance mixed or unmixed by a lively sense of future favors?\n\n In order to disallow them we are not called upon to find that petitioner's outlays come within the prohibition of  24 of the Internal Revenue Code in that they constituted 'Personal ... expenses.' 'Whether and to what extent deductions shall be allowed depends upon legislative grace; and only as there is clear provision therefor can any particular deduction be allowed.' New Colonial Ice Co. v. Helvering, \n292 \nU.S. 435, 440\n, 54 S.Ct. 788, 790. For these campaign expenses to be deductible, it must be found that they can conveniently come within  23(a)( 1)(A). To put it mildly, that section is not a clear provision for such an allowance. To determine allowable deductions by the different internal party arrangements for bearing the cost of political campaigns in the forty-eight states would disregard the explicit restrictions of  23 confining deduct- \n\n[323 \nU.S. 57, 61]\n\u00a0\n ible expenses solely to outlays in the efforts or services-here the business of judging-from which the income flows. Compare Welch v. Helvering, \n290 \nU.S. 111\n, 115-116, 54 S.Ct. 8, 9.\n Petitioner next insists that inasmuch as he was defeated for reelection his campaign expenses constitute a loss incurred in a 'transaction entered into for profit' and as such a deductible allowance by virtue of  23(e)(2).1 Such an argument does not deserve more than short shrift. In suffices to say that petitioner's money was not spent to buy the election but to buy the opportunity to persuade the electors. His campaign contribution was not an insurance of victory frustrated by 'an act of God' but the price paid for an active share in the hazards of popular elections. To argue that the loss of the election proves that the expense incurred in such election is a deductible 'loss' under  23(e)(2) is to play with words.\n Finally, reliance is placed on an amendment to the Internal Revenue Code introduced by  121 of the Revenue Act of 1942, 56 Stat. 798. 819.2 This amendment was proposed by the Treasury (1 Hearings before Committee on Ways and Means, Revenue Revision, 1942, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 88) to afford relief for a specifically defined inequitable situation which had become manifest by the decision of the Court in Higgins v. Commissioner, \n312 \nU.S. 212\n, 61 S.Ct. 475. In that case this Court held that by previous enactments Congress had made no provision for al- \n\n[323 \nU.S. 57, 62]\n\u00a0\n lowable deductions from profitable transactions not covered by the statutory concept of 'business' income. But of course earnings from 'the performance of the functions of a public office' had specifically been so covered.  48(d).3 Congress adopted the Treasury proposal for the restricted purpose which originated it. And so here the difficulty is not that petitioner's expenditures related to 'non-business' income, and thus were excluded from the legislative scheme before the 1942 Amendment, but that they were not incurred in 'carrying on' his 'business' of judging. The amendment of 1942 merely enlarged the category of incomes with reference to which expenses were deductible. It did not enlarge the range of allowable deductions4 of 'business' expenses. In short, the act of 1942 in no wise affected the disallowance of campaign expenses as consistently reflected by legislative history, court decision, Treasury practice and Treasury regulations. \n5\n Nothing whatever in the circumstances attending the adoption of  121 of the Revenue Act of 1942 warrants the suggestion that Congress unwittingly initiated a radi- \n\n[323 \nU.S. 57, 63]\n\u00a0\n cal change of policy regarding campaign expenditures. Every relevant item of evidence bearing upon the history of this amendment precludes the inference that the Treasury without intent and the Congress without appreciation opened wide the door for the allowance of campaign expenditures as deductible expenses. It surely is not fair to attribute to Congress the reversal of its policy and the enactment of a farreaching new policy in the absence of any evidence, however tenuous or speculative, that Congress was legislating on the subject.\n It is not for this Court to initiate policies as to the deduction of campaign expenses. It is for Congress to determine the relation of campaign expenditures to tax deductions by candidates for public office, under such circumstances and within such limits as commend themselves to its judgment. But we certainly cannot draw intimations of such a policy from legislation by Congress increasingly restrictive against campaign contributions and political activities by government officials. The relation between money and politics generally-and more particularly the cost of compaigns and contributions by prospective officeholders, especially judges-involves issues of far-reaching importance to a democracy and is beset with legislative difficulties that even judges can appreciate. But these difficulties can neither be met nor avoided by spurious interpretation of tax provisions dealing with allowable deductions.\n To find sanction in existing tax legislation for deduction of petitioner's campaign expenditures would necessarily require allowance of deduction for campaign expenditures by all candidates, whether incumbents seeking reelection or new contenders. To draw a distinction between outlays for reelation and those for election-to allow the former and disallow the latter-is unsupportable in reason. It is even more unsupportable in public policy to derive from what Congress has thus far enacted a handicap against \n\n[323 \nU.S. 57, 64]\n\u00a0\n candidates challenging existing officeholders. And so we cannot recognize pettioner's claim on the score that he was a candidate for reelection. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n Even if these conclusions, in the setting of federal income tax legislation, derived less easily than they do from the statutory provisions under scrutiny, we should not be inclined to displace the views of the Tax Court with our own. 7 Of course the Tax Court cannot define the limits of its own authority. And in cases like Commissioner v. Heininger, \n320 \nU.S. 467\n, 64 S.Ct. 249, where the Tax Court mistakenly felt itself bound by superior judicial authority, we must give corrective relief. But, as a system, tax legislation is not to be treated as though it were loose talk or presented isolated abstract questions of law casting upon the federal courts the task of independent construction. Tax language normally has an enclosed meaning or has legitimately acquired such by the authority of those specially skilled in its application. To speak of tax determinations made in the system of review specially designed for federal tax cases as technical is not to imply opprobrium.\n Having regard to the controversies which peculiarly call for this Court's adjudication and to the demands for their adequate disposition, as well as to the exigencies of litigation generally, relatively few appeals from Tax Court decisions can in any event come here. That court of necessity must be the main agency for nation-wide supervision of tax administration. Whatever the statutory or practical limitations upon the exercise of its authority, Congress has plainly designed that tribunal to serve, as it were, as the exchequer court of the country. Due regard \n\n[323 \nU.S. 57, 65]\n\u00a0\n for these considerations is the underlying rationale of Dobson v. Commissioner, \n320 \nU.S. 489\n, 64 S.Ct. 239. We are therefore relieved from discussing the numerous cases in which the Tax Court or its predecessor, the Board of Tax Appeals, allowed or disallowed deductions and their bearing on the situation before us. To do so involves detailed analysis of the special circumstances of various 'businesses' and expenses incident to their 'carrying on'. We shall not enter this quagmire of particularities.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice RUTLEDGE concurs in the result.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK, dissenting.\n Petitioner, a lawyer of many years' experience, gave up his practice and accepted appointment as a judge upon condition that he run to succeed himself. In campaigning for reelection he incurred certain campaign expenses. These expenses, according to the Circuit Court of Appeals, were 'legitimate in their entirety', and 'the objective of the expenditures was to obtain a considerable amount of money, over at least a decade of years.' (139 F.2d 400, 401.) This Court has not reached a contrary conclusion. For our purpose, therefore, we may consider that the expenses were incurred, at least in part, 'for the production ... of income.' The literal language of Section 121 of the Revenue Act of 1942, 56 Stat. 798, 819, is broad enough to allow a deduction for expenses so induced. That statute, which Congress made applicable retroactively, allows the following deduction, in computing net income:\n'In the case of an individual, all the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year for the production or collection of income, or for the management, conservation, or maintenance of property held for the production of income.'\n\n Prior to the enactment of this section, taxpayers in computing net income were not allowed deductions from gross \n\n[323 \nU.S. 57, 66]\n\u00a0\n income for expenses incurred unless they were 'ordinary and necessary expenses, paid or incurred ... in carrying on a trade or business.' Congress, by this new section, introduced a new type of deduction, for as the House and Senate Committees said, it allowed '... a deduction for the ordinary and necessary expenses of an individual paid or incurred ... for the production and collection of income. ...' Before the 1942 Act, an expense to be deductible had to be 'ordinary and necessary' in its relationship to the taxpayer's business; under the new section it need only be 'ordinary and necessary' in its relationship to the taxpayer's efforts to produce income. Hence, while the words 'ordinary and necessary expenses', defining permissible deductions, remained unchanged in the new section, they were given added content in their new relationship. Obviously, Treasury regulations and decisions, limiting the scope of 'ordinary and necessary' as applied to business expenses under the old law may be wholly unsuited to define the meaning of those words in their new context, and such rulings and decisions can throw little if any light on the meaning of Section 121. Since the enactment of the new section, the two questions essential to determination of deductibility are: Were the expenses incurred in an effort to produce income? Were these expenses, or part of them, 'ordinary and necessary' in connection with that effort? These are in most instances pure questions of fact and in cases such as this are to be determined by the tax court. See Commissioner v. Heininger, \n320 \nU.S. 467, 475\n, 64 S.Ct. 249, 254. The Tax Court did not make findings of fact on these crucial issues, but categorically denied that compaign expenses could be deducted at all. This, I think, was an erroneous interpretation of Section 121.\n The 1942 Act articulated the purpose of Congress to wipe out every vestige of a policy which denied tax deductions for legitimate expenses incurred in producing taxable income. Taxation on net, not on gross, income has \n\n[323 \nU.S. 57, 67]\n\u00a0\n always been the broad basic policy of our income tax laws. Net income may be defined as what remains out of gross income after subtracting the ordinary and necessary expenses incurred in efforts to obtain or to keep it. In 1941, this Court upheld in Higgins v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, \n312 \nU.S. 212\n, 61 S.Ct. 475, a finding of the Board of Tax Appeals that one who managed, conserved and maintained his own property was not engaged in a 'trade or business' and for this reason was not entitled to deduct expenses incurred in producing his gross income. The effect of this holding was to impair the general Congressional policy to tax only net income. Congress in its Revenue Act of 1942, supra, took note of this impairment and indicated in a most forthright manner its allegiance to the net income tax policy. Except for transactions carried on 'primarily as a sport, hobby, or recreation,' see Senate and House Committee Reports, supra, Congress provided a deduction for all ordinary and necessary expenses incurred in the production of income. The language it utilized was certainly far broader than was required to meet the narrow problem presented by the Higgins case. Congress specifically disposed of the Higgins problem by allowing a deduction for the expenses incurred in ' ... the management, conservation, or maintenance of property held for the production of income.' Had Congress simply enacted these words, and nothing more, it might properly have been inferred that it intended to grant the type of deduction denied in the Higgins case, and no other. But it provided an additional deduction, in the very same section, for expenses incurred in 'the production ... of income.' To hold, therefore, that Congress in this new section was concerning itself only with the restricted issue created by the Higgins case, is to deny any meaning or validity to this latter clause; in a larger sense, such a construction carves out of the section a vital segment which Congress intentionally-or so we must assume-put there. \n\n[323 \nU.S. 57, 68]\n\u00a0\n The Court interprets Section 121 as not permitting the deductions, without denying that the expenditures were made by petitioner for 'the production ... of income.' This interpretation rests in part on the conclusion that the Section in no wise applies to expenses incurred in 'business', and that the deductions claimed by the petitioner were in relation to a 'business' explicitly so denominated by  48(d) of the Internal Revenue Code. \n1\n The Court's construction would appear to be quite different from that of the House and Senate committees which reported their construction of the measure to their respective bodies. The reports expressly stated that 'The Amendment ... allows a deduction for the ordinary and necessary expenses of an individual incurred during the taxable year for the production and collection of income ... whether or not such expenses are incurred in carrying on a trade or business.' We cannot question the special competence of these two committees to interpret their own legislation. Congress therefore apparently intended to obliterate the legal niceties of the 'trade or business' distinction, insofar as they affected deductions for expenses incurred in the 'production and collection of income.'\n The Court's decision is also grounded upon its refernece to congressional policy restricting campaign contributions and political activities by government officials. We are \n\n[323 \nU.S. 57, 69]\n\u00a0\n not dealing here however, with campaign contributions made by one person to further the candidacy of another. Besides, Congress has not attempted to regulate expenditures of candidates for state office. I can hardly conceive that we should infer that it wanted to penalize through its tax laws, necessary campaign expenses, and thereby condemn a practice of compaigning that is as old as our country and which exists in every state of the Union. Unless our democratic philosophy is wrong, there can be no evil in a candidate spending a legally permissible and necessary sum to approach the electrorate and enable them to pass an informed judgment upon his qualifications. This is not, of course, to be taken as denoting approval of corrupt compaign expenditures, or of any of the myriad abuses which beset our systems of election. But we ought not to eviscerate a revenue act, and deny this state official a deduction for expenses incurred in a state election campaign, because Congress has limited campaign contributions in federal elections, and passed restrictive legislation against political activities by federal employees.\n The Tax Court too relied upon grounds of public policy. It thought it contrary to 'the basic ideology underlying the principles of our government' to hold that a public office constitutes a 'trade or business', although Congress for tax purposes had declared it was. The Tax Court also thought that 'under the ban of public conscience and ... public policy is the contention that expenditures made to promote one's candidacy for election to public office represent expenses 'paid ... for the production or collection of income.\" Public officials in this country, many of whom must campaign for election, are almost universally paid for their services. That we do pay out public servants is not at all inconsistent with the fact that public service in a large measure represents an honest expression of the social conscience. Nor does individual dependence upon remuneration for such services detract \n\n[323 \nU.S. 57, 70]\n\u00a0\n at all from the high and uncompromising standards of those who perform public duties. Without monetary rewards officeholding would necessarily be limited to one class only,-the independently wealthy. Proposals to accomplish such a purpose were deliberately rejected at the very beginning of the Nation's history. I deny the existence of a public policy which, while permitting Congress to tax the income of elected public officials, bars Congress from allowing a deduction for necessary campaign expenses.\n It is said that Dobson v. Commissioner, \n320 \nU.S. 489\n, 64 S.Ct. 239, gives some support to the Court's decision, and that we should not 'displace the views of the Tax Court with our own.' Cf. Security Flour Mills Co. v. Commissioner, \n321 \nU.S. 281\n, 64 S.Ct. 596. The Court's opinion does exactly that, for it rests in part upon its holding that McDonald as a judge was engaged in 'business', while the Tax Court specifically found that he was not. Neither the Dobson case nor any other to which the Court's opinion points has indicated that we should automatically accept the Tax Court's construction of a statute, while repudiating the reasons on which its conclusion rested.\n State officials all over this nation have been subject to federal income taxes since 1939. When they run for office, they must necessarily spend some money to advertise their compaigns. We permit private individuals to deduct expenses incurred in advertising to get business. If this petitioner had owned a factory, the operations of which were suspended because of war contracts, and had advertised goods which he could not presently sell, the expenses of such advertising would have been deductible under Treasury rulings. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[323 \nU.S. 57, 71]\n\u00a0\n So long as campaign expenses spent by candidates are legitimate, ordinary, and necessary, I am unwilling to assume that Congress intended by the 1942 Act to discriminate against the thousands of state officials subject to federal income taxes. The language Cougress used literally protects petitioner's right to a deduction; nothing in the legislative history indicates an intent to deny it. Certainly there are abuses in campaign expenditures. But that is a problem that should be attacked squarely by the proper state and federal authorities, and not by strained statutory construction which permits a discriminatory penalty to be imposed on taxpayers who work for the states, counties, municipalities, or the federal government. I think we should reverse and remand this cause to the Tax Court with instructions to pass upon the factual questions which it did not previously determine.\n Mr. Justice REED, Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, and Mr. Justice MURPHY join in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Losses by individuals.

If the petitioner is to be denied the benefit of the deduction under the 1942 Amendment (Section 121(a)(2)) on the ground that these expenses were incurred in a 'business', then it is difficult to understand why he should be denied the deduction under Section 23(a)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code, which provides deductions for expenses incurred in carrying on a business. On the one hand, the Court denies the deduction because the expenses were incurred in relation to a 'business'; on the other hand, the Court denies the deduction as a 'business expense' on the ground that his expenses 'were not incurred in 'carrying on' his 'business' ....' This is a distiction without a difference, two phrases with but a single thought. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] I.T. 3581, 1-2 Cum.Bull. 88 (1942); I.T. 3564, 1-2 Cum.Bull. 87 ( 1942).

Knowlton, of Washington, D.C., for appellee Interstate Commerce Commission.\n Mr. Mortimer Allen Sullivan, of Buffalo, N.Y., for appellees Associated Transport, Inc., and others.\n\n Mr. Justice RUTLEDGE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from a decree of a statutory three judge court,1 48 F.Supp. 933, refusing to set aside certain orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission which had authorized consolidation of seven large motor carriers.\n Associated Transport, Inc., was organized in Delaware in March, 1941, to bring about the proposed merger. In July, 1941, it applied to the Interstate Commerce Commission for permission, under Section 5 of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended, 49 U.S.C.  5, 49 U.S.C.A.  5, 54 Stat. 898, 905, to obtain control of eight motor carriers, through purchase of their capital stock, and to consolidate their operating rights and properties into one unit within a year from the \n\n[321 \nU.S. 67, 69]\n\u00a0\n date it acquired stock control. At the same time, Associated applied for permission under Section 214 of the Motor Carrier Act of 1935, 49 U.S.C.  314, 49 U.S.C.A.  314, 49 Stat. 543, 557, 52 Stat. 1240, 54 Stat. 924, to issue preferred and common stock to be used mainly in exchange for stocks of the eight common carriers and four associated noncarriers.\n Before the Commission, approval of the applications was opposed by the Secretary of Agriculture, the Anti-Trust Division of the Department of Justice, the National Grange, four fruit growers associations and Super Service Motor Freight Company, a motor carrier. \n2\n An examiner held hearings at which evidence was introduced, and the Commission heard argument on objections to his report before finally authorizing the consolidation. \n3\n 38 M.C.C. 137. McLean Trucking Company, Inc., a motor carrier which claims to compete with some of the carriers included in the merger, brought suit in the District Court to set aside the Commission's orders. The Secretary of Agriculture and the American Farm Bureau Federation intervened as plaintiffs. The United States confessed error. The Interstate Commerce Commission and the parties to the merger defended the Commission's order.\n The principal issues, later set forth with particularity, are intertwined. They relate to whether the Commission applied a proper standard in concluding to approve the merger; whether it failed to give due weight to the prohibitions and policies of the anti-trust laws; and whether, upon the evidence and within the meaning of Section 5(2)(b) \n\n[321 \nU.S. 67, 70]\n\u00a0\n of the Interstate Commerce Act, the Commission rightly could determine that Associated, upon consummation of the merger, would not be affiliated with any railroad. The Commission resolved all of these questions in favor of the merger, as did the District Court.\n In one respect, however, the case as presented to the court was in different posture than as it came to the Commission. This change arose from the elimination of one of the constituent companies, Arrow Carrier Corporation, from the merger between the time the Commission's orders were rendered and the hearing in the District Court. After the suit was begun the Commission, on the applicant's petition, modified its orders to exclude Arrow. Accordingly the Commission also amended its answer to indicate the change, and the case was decided on the orders as modified. They present the only questions for our consideration. It may be noted that the elimination of Arrow has bearing upon the issue relating to anti- trust policy, but more particularly on that relating to railroad affiliation.\n The eight carriers originally sought to be merged4 were Arrow Carrier Corporation, Paterson N.J.; Barnwell Brothers, Inc., Burlington, N.C.; Consolidated Motor Lines, Inc., Hartford, Conn.; Horton Motor Lines, Inc., Charlotte, N.C.; McCarthy Freight System, Inc., Taunton, Mass.; M. Moran Transportation Lines, Inc., Buffalo, N.Y.; Southeastern Motor Lines, Inc., Bristol, Va.; and Transportation, Inc., Atlanta, Ga. The merger embraces some of the principal operators along the Atlantic seaboard from Massachusetts to Florida. Certain of them \n\n[321 \nU.S. 67, 71]\n\u00a0\n serve communities as far west as Cleveland, Ohio, Nashville, Tennessee, and New Orleans, Louisiana. But the most important effect will be to create an end-to-end consolidation from points in the far South to New England, with obviously large possibilities for through service. According to evidence before the Commission the total assets of the companies involved, as of April 30, 1941, exceed $8,000,000 and their gross operating revenues for 1940 exceeded $19,000,000. The carriers operate principally as motor vehicle common carriers of general commodities over regular routes totalling 37,884 miles. Over 13,546 miles between important service points one or more competes with others in the group. \n5\n This competitive mileage will be eliminated by the merger, leaving a single carrier with routes extending over 24,338 miles.\n As a result of the proposed merger Associated will be the largest single motor carrier in the United States-at least in terms of its estimated revenues-and no other single motor carrier will compete with it throughout its service area. Nevertheless, after careful consideration and on evidence clearly sufficient to sustain it, the Commission found that on completion of the merger 'there would remain ample competitive motor- carrier service throughout the territory involved' and in addition that \n\n[321 \nU.S. 67, 72]\n\u00a0\n one or more rail carriers would offer substantial competition to Associated at all principal points. It also found that the consolidation would result in improved transportation service. Through movement of freight would be simplified and expedited, equipment would be utilized more efficiently, terminal facilities improved, handling of shipments reduced, relations with shippers and public regulatory bodies simplified, safe operation promoted, and substantial operating economies would be achieved. The Commission concluded that the applicant's assumption of the fixed charges of the carriers would not be inconsistent with the public interest, and consummation of the proposed transaction would not result in substantial injury to the carrier employees affected.\n In connection with Arrow's participation, the Commission found that The Transport Company, whose stock was wholly owned by Kuhn, Loeb and Company, had an option to purchase Arrow's common stock and would receive Associated's stock therefor when the merger was effected. The stock thus received, together with 9,000 shares of Associated's common stock already held, would give. The transport Company, and through it Kuhn, Loeb and Company, 6,877 shares of Associated's preferred and 67,167 of Associated's common, a total of 13 per cent and 9.53 per cent, respectively, of the preferred and common stocks expected to be outstanding at the conclusion of the transactions. \n6\n Kuhn, Loeb and Company is represented on the boards of directors of several railroads \n\n[321 \nU.S. 67, 73]\n\u00a0\n and for years has had investment banking connections with the Baltimore and Ohio and the Pennsylvania Railroads, each operating in territory to be served by Associated. A representative of Kuhn, Loeb and Company would be one of Associated's nine directors. After examining the blocks of stock which other persons would hold on completion of the consolidation and other matters bearing on the relationship between the proposed merger and the railroads, the Commission concluded that Associated would not be affiliated with any rail carriers. With the elimination of Arrow, of course, the likelihood of any influence on Associated's policies by Transport, and thus by Kuhn, Loeb and Company and the railroads, was substantially reduced.\n\n\n I.\n\n\n The pertinent provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act, which is controlling, are set forth in the margin. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n[321 \nU.S. 67, 74]\n\u00a0\n Section 5(2) makes lawful a consolidation of the sort here attempted only if the Commission authorizes it. The Commission is empowered to authorize and approve a\n__________ carrier subject to this part, part II, or part III to enter into any contract, agreement, or combination with any other such common carrier or carriers for the pooling or division of traffic, or of service, or of gross or net earnings, or of any portion thereof; and in any case of an unlawful agreement for the pooling or division of traffic, service, or earnings as aforesaid each day of its continuance shall be a separate offense: Provided, That whenever the Commission is of opinion, after hearing upon application of any such carrier or carriers or upon its own initiative, that the pooling or division, to the extent indicated by the Commission, of their traffic, service, or gross or net earnings, or of any portion thereof, will be in the interest of better service to the public or of economy in operation, and will not unduly restrain competition, the Commission shall by order approve and authorize, if assented to by all the carriers involved, such pooling or division, under such rules and regulations, and for such consideration as between such carriers and upon such terms and conditions, as shall be found by the Commission to be just and reasonable in the premises: ...\n'(2)(a) It shall be lawful, with the approval and authorization of the Commission, as provided in subdivision (b)-\n\n'(i) for two or more carriers to consolidate or merge their properties or franchises, or any part thereof, into one corporation for the ownership, management, and operation of the properties theretofore in separate ownership; or for any carrier, or two or more carriers jointly, to purchase, lease, or contract to operate the properties, or any part thereof, of another; or for any carrier, or two or more carriers jointly, to acquire control of another through ownership of its stock or otherwise; or for a person which is not a carrier to acquire control of two or more carriers through ownership of their stock or otherwise; or for a person which is not a carrier and which has control of one or more carriers to acquire control of another carrier through ownership of its stock or otherwise; or\n\n'(ii) for a carrier by railroad to acquire trackage rights over, or joint ownership in or joint use of, any railroad line or lines owned or operated by any other such carrier, and terminals incidental thereto.\n\n'(b) Whenever a transaction is proposed under subparagraph (a), the carrier or carriers or person seeking authority therefor shall pre- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 67, 75]\n\u00a0\n consolidation either as applied for or as qualified by such terms and conditions as it deems 'just and reasonable,' if it finds that the merger 'will be consistent with the\n\n__________ sent an application to the Commission, and thereupon the Commission shall notify the Governor of each State in which any part of the properties of the carriers involved in the proposed transaction is situated, and also such carriers and the applicant or applicants (and, in case carriers by motor vehicle are involved, the persons specified in section 205(e)), and shall afford reasonable opportunity for interested parties to be heard. If the Commission shall consider it necessary in order to determine whether the findings specified below may properly be made, it shall set said application for public hearing, and a public hearing shall be held in all cases where carriers by railroad are involved. If the Commission finds that, subject to such terms and conditions and such modifications as it shall find to be just and reasonable, the proposed transaction is within the scope of subparagraph (a) and will be consistent with the public interest, it shall enter an order approving and authorizing such transaction, upon the terms and conditions, and with the modifications, so found to be just and reasonable: Provided, That if a carrier by railroad subject to this part, or any person which is controlled by such a carrier, or affiliated therewith within the meaning of paragraph (6), is an applicant in the case of any such proposed transaction involving a motor carrier, the Commission shall not enter such an order unless it finds that the transaction proposed will be consistent with the public interest and will enable such carrier to use service by motor vehicle to public advantage in its operations and will not unduly restrain competition.\n'(c) In passing upon any proposed transaction under the provisions of this paragraph (2), the Commission shall give weight to the following considerations, among others: (1) The effect of the proposed transaction upon adequate transportation service to the public; (2) the effect upon the public interest of the inclusion, or failure to include, other railroads in the territory involved in the proposed transaction; (3) the total fixed charges resulting from the proposed transaction; and (4) the interest of the carrier employees affected.\n\n'(6) For the purposes of this section a person shall be held to be affiliated with a carrier if, by reason of the relationship of such per- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 67, 76]\n\u00a0\n public interest.' Section 5(2)(b). In passing upon a proposed consolidation the Commission is required to 'give weight to the following considerations, among others: (1) The effect of the proposed transaction upon adequate transportation service to the public; ... (3) the total fixed charges resulting from the proposed transaction; and (4) the interest of the carrier employees affected.' Section 5(2)(c). The foregoing provisions supply the general statutory standards for guiding the Commission's judgment; and within their broad limits, its authority is 'exclusive and plenary.' Section 5(11).\n\n However, in two particulars, pertinent especially to the issues concerning anti-trust policy and railroad affiliation, Section 5 lays down more explicit commands. One is a specific exemption of carriers and individuals participating in an approved merger 'from the operation of the antitrust laws and of all other restraints, limitations, and prohibitions of law, Federal, State, or municipal, insofar as may be necessary to enable them to carry into effect the trans-\n__________ son to such carrier (whether by reason of the method of, or circumstances surrounding organization or operation, or whether established through common directors, officers, or stockholders, a voting trust or trusts, a holding or investment company or companies, or any other direct or indirect means), it is reasonable to believe that the affairs of any carrier of which control may be acquired by such person will be managed in the interest of such other carrier. ...\n'(11) The authority conferred by this section shall be exclusive and plenary, ... and any carriers or other corporations, and their officers and employees and any other persons, participating in a transaction approved or authorized under the provisions of this section shall be and they are hereby relieved from the operation of the antitrust laws and of all other restraints, limitations, and prohibitions of law, Federal, State, or municipal, insofar as may be necessary to enable them to carry into effect the transactions so approved or provided for in accordance with the terms and conditions, if any, imposed by the Commission, and to hold, maintain, and operate any properties and exercise any control or franchises acquired through such transaction.' \n\n[321 \nU.S. 67, 77]\n\u00a0\n actions so approved ... and to hold, maintain, and operate any properties and exercise any control or franchises acquired through such transaction.' Section 5(11). The other provides the standards to be applied in cases of affiliation of a motor carrier with a railroad. Where a railroad or 'any person which is controlled by such a carrier, or affiliated therewith' 8 is an applicant in a consolidation proceeding, the Commission cannot approve the merger 'unless it finds that the transaction proposed will be consistent with the public interest and will enable such carrier to use service by motor vehicle to public advantage in its operations and will not unduly restrain competition.' Section 5(2)(b). In the light of these controlling statutory provisions the issues must be stated more sharply for proper perspective of what is at stake.\n\n\n\n II.\n\n\n As has been said, they are intertwined. This is true especially of the issues concerning the propriety of the standards applied and whether due consideration was given to the anti-trust laws and policies, although the question of rail affiliation is closely related to both.\n The chief attack on the orders is that the Commission improperly construed the standards by which Congress intended it to determine the propriety of a consolidation; and the burden of this complaint is that it did so 'by failing to consider and give due weight to the anti-trust and other laws of the United States.' The argument seems to be that the merger, notwithstanding the Commission's approval, violates the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, 15 U.S.C.A.  1-7, 15 note; hence the Commission is without power to approve the merger. This presupposes that Congress did not intend, by enacting the specific exemption of Section 5(11), to give the Commission leeway to approve any merger which, but for the ex- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 67, 78]\n\u00a0\n emption and the Commission's approval, would run afoul of the anti-trust laws. In other words, the Commission's authority is not 'exclusive and plenary,' as the Section declares, within the boundaries set by the Interstate Commerce Act, including the exemption; but it is restricted also by all the ramifications of the anti-trust laws and policies, to which the Commission must give strict regard in approving motor consolidations, as if the exemption did not exist.\n It is conceded that is not true of rail consolidations, though they are authorized, and subjected to the same standards, by the identical sections of the statute. A difference in application of the language is said to arise from the difference which existed in the conditions under which rail and motor carriers, respectively, were brought within the purview of the statutory commands. Thus, it is said, the Transportation Act of 1920, 41 Stat. 456, made a broad departure from previous policy by relieving rail consolidations, with the Commission's approval, from anti- trust restrictions in order to rehabilitate a broken down industry. But, it is also said, such a condition did not characterize motor carriers when they were brought under regulation in 1935 or at the time of any subsequent legislation affecting them. Hence, it is admitted the Commission with propriety may approve a rail consolidation, otherwise prohibited by the anti-trust laws, in order to bring about needed or desirable improvement in service and economies in operation. But, as to motor carriers, it is urged the consolidation cannot be effected with any such purposes or consequences. Only when the existing service is inadequate and consolidation is necessary to bring about adequate service to the public, the argument runs, can the Commission approve it.\n On its face the contention would seem to run in the teeth of the language and the purpose of Section 5(11). Nothing in its terms indicates an intention to create one au- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 67, 79]\n\u00a0\n thority for rail consolidations and another for motor mergers. Identical provisions govern both. And to restrict the application of the section to motor carriers in the manner urged would nullify its operation as to them. The attack, when carried to such an extent, comes down to one upon the policy which Congress has declared. It has done so in terms which do not admit of nullification by reference to the varying conditions under which different types of carriers were brought within the statute's operation. It is not for this Court, or any other, to override a policy, or an exemption from one, so clearly and specifically declared by Congress, whatever may be our views of the wisdom of its action. The argument in its full sweep therefore must be rejected. But, taken for less than that, it poses a problem of accommodation of the Transportation Act and the anti- trust legislation, to which we now turn. In doing so we note that the former is the later in time and constitutes not only a more recent but a more specific expression of policy.\n\n\n III.\n\n\n To secure the continuous, close and informed supervision which enforcement of legislative mandates frequently requires, Congress has vested expert administrative bodies such as the Interstate Commerce Commission with broad discretion and has charged them with the duty to execute stated and specific statutory policies. That delegation does not necessarily include either the duty or the authority to execute numerous other laws. Thus, here, the Commission has no power to enforce the Sherman Act as such. It cannot decide definitely whether the transaction contemplated constitutes a restraint of trade or an attempt to monopolize which is forbidden by that Act. The Commission's task is to enforce the Interstate Commerce Act and other legislation which deals specifically with transportation facilities and problems. That \n\n[321 \nU.S. 67, 80]\n\u00a0\n legislation constitutes the immediate frame of reference within which the Commission operates; and the policies expressed in it must be the basic determinants of its action.\n But in executing those policies the Commission may be faced with overlapping and at times inconsistent policies embodied in other legislation enacted at different times and with different problems in view. When this is true, it cannot without more ignore the latter. The precise adjustments which it must make, however, will vary from instance to instance depending on the extent to which Congress indicates a desire to have those policies leavened or implemented in the enforcement of the various specific provisions of the legislation with which the Commission is primarily and directly concerned. Cf. National Broadcasting Co., Inc., v. United States, \n319 \nU.S. 190\n, 63 S.Ct. 997; New York Central Securities Corp. v. United States, \n287 \nU.S. 12\n, 53 S.Ct. 45.\n The national transportation policy is the product of a long history of trial and error by Congress in attempting to regulate the nation's transportation facilities beginning with the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887.9 For present purposes it is not necessary to trace the history of those attempts in detail other than to note that the Transportation Act of 1920 marked a sharp change in the policies and objectives embodied in those efforts. \n10\n 'Theretofore, the effect of Congress had been directed mainly to the prevention of abuses; particularly those arising from ex- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 67, 81]\n\u00a0\n cessive or discriminatory rates';11 and emphasis on the preservation of free competition among carriers was part of that effort. \n12\n The Act of 1920 added 'a new and important object to previous interstate commerce legislation.' It sought 'affirmatively to build up a system of railways prepared to handle promptly all the interstate traffic of the country.' Dayton-Goose Creek R. Co. v. United States, \n263 \nU.S. 456, 478\n, 44 S.Ct. 169, 172, 33 A.L.R. 472; Texas & P.R. Co. v. Gulf C. & S.F.R. Co., \n270 \nU.S. 266, 277\n, 46 S.Ct. 263, 266. And in administering it, the Commission was to be guided primarily by consideration for 'adequacy of transportation service, ... its essential conditions of economy and efficiency, and ... appropriate provision and best use of transportation facilities ....' New York Central Securities Corp. v. United States, \n287 \nU.S. 12, 25\n, 53 S.Ct. 45, 48.\n Since that initial effort at reshaping regulation of railroads to 'insure ... adequate transportation service,'13 Congress has extended federal regulation in connection with other forms of transportation14 and has elaborated \n\n[321 \nU.S. 67, 82]\n\u00a0\n more fully the objectives to be achieved by its legislation. In 1935 it enacted a comprehensive scheme of regulation for motor carriers, designed to result in 'a system of coordinated transportation for the Nation which will supply the most efficient means of transport and furnish service as cheaply as is consistent with fair treatment of labor and with earnings which will support adequate credit and the ability to expand as need develops and to take advantage of all improvements in the art.' \n15\n The policy which was to guide the Commission in administering that Act was fully stated16 and has since been absorbed into the equally full statement of the National Transportation Policy. That policy, which is the Commission's guide to 'the public interest,' cf. New York Central Securities Corp. v. United States, \n287 \nU.S. 12\n, 53 S.Ct. 45; State of Texas v. United States, \n292 \nU.S. 522\n, 54 S.Ct. 819, demands that all modes of transportation subject to the provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act be so regulated as to 'recognize and preserve the inherent advantages of each; to promote safe, adequate, economical, and efficient service and foster sound economic conditions in transportation and among the several carriers; \n\n[321 \nU.S. 67, 83]\n\u00a0\n to encourage the establishment and maintenance of reasonable charges for transportation services, without unjust discriminations, undue preferences or advantages, or unfair or destructive competitive practices; ... all to the end of developing, coordinating, and preserving a national transportation system by water, highway, and rail, as well as other means, adequate to meet the needs of the commerce of the United States, of the Postal Service, and of the national defense.' 54 Stat. 899, 49 U.S.C.A. note preceding section 1.\n The history of the development of the special national transportation policy suggests, quite apart from the explicit provision of Section 5(11), that the policies of the anti-trust laws determine 'the public interest' in railroad regulation only in a qualified way. And the altered emphasis in railroad legislation on achieving an adequate, efficient, and economical system of transportation through close supervision of business operations and practices rather than through heavy reliance on the enforcement of free competition in various phases of the business, cf. New York Central Securities Corp. v. United States, \n287 \nU.S. 12\n, 53 S.Ct. 45, has its counterpart in motor carrier policy. The premises of motor carrier regulation posit some curtailment of free and unrestrained competition. \n17\n The origins18 and legislative \n\n[321 \nU.S. 67, 84]\n\u00a0\n history19 of the Motor Carrier Act adequately disclose that in it Congress recognized there may be occasions when 'competition between carriers may result in harm to the public, as well as in benefit; and that when a ( carrier) inflicts injury upon its rival, it may be the public which ultimately bears the loss.' Cf. Texas & P.R. Co. v. Gulf C. & S.F.R. Co., \n270 \nU.S. 266, 277\n, 46 S.Ct. 263, 266.\n Whatever may be the case with respect either to other kinds of transactions by or among carriers20 or to consolidations of different types of carriers, 21 there can be little doubt \n\n[321 \nU.S. 67, 85]\n\u00a0\n that the Commission is not to measure proposals for all-rail or all-motor consolidations by the standards of the anti-trust laws. Congress authorized such consolidations because it recognized that in some circumstances they were appropriate for effectuation of the national transportation policy. It was informed that this policy would be furthered by 'encouraging the organization of stronger units' in the motor carrier industry. 22 And in authorizing those consolidations it did not import the general policies of the antitrust laws as a measure of their permissibility. \n23\n It in terms relieved participants in appropriate mergers from the requirements of those laws. Section 5(11). In doing so, it presumably took into account the fact that the business affected is subject to strict regulation and supervision, particularly with respect to rates charged the public-an effective safeguard against the evils attending monopoly, at which the Sherman Act is directed. Against this background, no other inference is possible but that, as a factor in determining the propriety of motor-carrier consolidations the preservation of competition among carriers, although still a value,24 is significant chiefly as it aids in the \n\n[321 \nU.S. 67, 86]\n\u00a0\n attainment of the objectives of the national transportation policy.\n Therefore, the Commission is not bound, as appellants urge, to accede to the policies of the anti-trust laws so completely that only where 'inadequate' transportation facilities are sought to be made 'adequate' by consolidation can their dictates be over-borne by 'the public interest.' That view, in effect, would require the Commission to permit only those consolidations which would not offend the anti-trust laws. As has been said, this would render meaningless the exemption relieving the participants in a properly approved merger of the requirements of those laws, and would ignore the fact that the Motor Carrier Act is to be administered with an eye to affirmatively improving transportation facilities, not merely to preserving existing arrangements or competitive practices. \n25\n Compare Dayton-Goose Creek R. Co. v. United States, supra; The New England Divisions Case, supra.\n Congress however neither has made the anti-trust laws wholly inapplicable to the transportation industry nor has authorized the Commission in passing on a proposed merger to ignore their policy. Congress recognized that the process of consolidating motor carriers would result in some diminution of competition and might result in the creation of monopolies. To prevent the latter effect and to make certain that the former was permitted only where appropriate to further the national transportation policy, it placed in the Commission power to control such developments. \n26\n The national transportation policy re- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 67, 87]\n\u00a0\n quires the Commission to 'promote ... economical ... service and foster sound economic conditions in transportation and among the several carriers; to encourage the establishment and maintenance of reasonable charges for transportation services, without unjust discriminations, (or) undue preferences or advantages ....' The preservation of independent and competing motor carriers unquestionably has bearing on the achievement of those ends. Hence, the fact that the carriers participating in a properly authorized consolidation may obtain immunity from prosecution under the antitrust laws in no sense relieves the Commission of its duty, as an administrative matter, to consider the effect of the merger on competitors and on the general competitive situation in the industry in the light of the objectives of the national transportation policy.\n In short, the Commission must estimate the scope and appraise the effects of the curtailment of competition which will result from the proposed consolidation and consider them along with the advantages of improved service, safer operation, lower costs, etc., to determine whether the consolidation will assist in effectuating the over-all transportation policy. Resolving these considerations is a complex task which requires extensive facilities, expert judgment and considerable knowledge of the transportation industry. Congress left that task to the Commission 'to the end that the wisdom and experience of that Commission may be used not only in connection with this form of transportation, but in its coordination of all other forms.' 79 Cong.Rec. 12207. 'The wisdom and experience of that commission,' not of the courts, must determine whether the proposed consolidation is \n\n[321 \nU.S. 67, 88]\n\u00a0\n 'consistent with the public interest.' Cf. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Illinois Central R. Co., \n215 \nU.S. 452\n, 30 S.Ct. 155; Pennsylvania Co. v. United States, \n236 \nU.S. 351\n, 35 S.Ct. 370; United States v. Chicago Heights Trucking Co., \n310 \nU.S. 344\n, 60 S.Ct. 931; Purcell v. United States, \n315 \nU.S. 381\n, 62 S.Ct. 709. If the Commission did not exceed the statutory limits within which Congress confined its discretion and its findings are adequate and supported by evidence, it is not our function to upset its order.\n\n\n IV.\n\n\n The Commission found, as has been noted, that the proposed consolidation would result in improved transportation service, greater efficiency of operation and substantial operating economies. The higher load factor on trucks, reduction in the number of trucks used and the mileage traversed would lead to more efficient use of equipment and save motor fuel. Terminal facilities would be consolidated and used more effectively, through movement of freight would reduce costs and in a multitude of other ways the stability and safety of the service rendered would be enhanced. \n27\n The Commission also considered the extent to which competition among the merging carriers would be diminished, the effects of the consolidation on competing carriers and the consequences for transportation service and motor carrier operations in general in the areas affected. It found that in each of the areas served by the present components of the merger there are from 44 to more than 100 Class I carriers, many \n\n[321 \nU.S. 67, 89]\n\u00a0\n of which were regular route common carriers of general commodities, comparable in size-insofar as size is disclosed by operating revenues-to some of the participants in the consolidation. Between the principal points in each of the areas served substantial competition by independent Class I carriers now exists. While none of these carriers operates a through service over the entire area to be served by Associated, the Commission found that rail carrier service competes at all the principal points to be served by Associated, and that contract carriers also offer competition.\n The Commission determined, on the basis of facts appearing in the record and its experience with other consolidations, that it was not likely that Associated's size and competitive advantages would enable it to control the price and character of interchange traffic, to drain off substantial amounts of shippers' business or in other ways to smother the competition of other motor carriers. It concluded that ample competition would remain and, weighing all the factors, that the consolidation was 'consistent with the public interest.'\n Necessarily in its inquiry the Commission had to speculate to some extent as to the future consequences and effects of a present consolidation. But it based its judgment on available facts as to present operations and business practices and past experience with transportation operations and analogous transactions.\n We cannot say that the Commission measured 'the public interest' by standards other than those Congress provided or that its findings do not comply with the requirements of the Act. The material findings are supported by evidence; and while a more meticulous regard for its function might have impelled the Commission to accede to the Anti-Trust Division's request for certain information from other shippers bearing on the question of \n\n[321 \nU.S. 67, 90]\n\u00a0\n competition, we do not think its failure to do so requires, on this record, that its conclusions be overturned.\n\n\n V.\n\n\n Appellants also attack the propriety of the Commission's conclusion that Associated is not, and would not be, on consummation of the consolidation, 'affiliated' with any railroad. Whatever might have been the case if Arrow had been included in the merger, a different question is presented by the orders now under review.\n Section 5(2) provides: 'That if ... any person which is controlled by such a (rail) carrier, or affiliated therewith within the meaning of paragraph (6), is an applicant in the case of any such proposed transaction involving a motor carrier, the Commission shall not enter such an order unless it finds that the transaction proposed will be consistent with the public interest and will enable such carrier to use service by motor vehicle to public advantage in its operations and will not unduly restrain competition.'\n Section 5(6) provides: 'For the purposes of this section a person shall be held to be affiliated with a carrier if, by reason of the relationship of such person to such carrier (whether by reason of the method of, or circumstances surrounding organization or operation, or whether established through common directors, officers, or stockholders, a voting trust or trusts, a holding or investment company or companies, or any other direct or indirect means), it is reasonable to believe that the affairs of any carrier of which control may be acquired by such person will be managed in the interest of such other carrier.'\n The only relevant evidence now pointing toward affiliation of the applicant with rail carriers are the facts that Kuhn, Loeb and Company indirectly owns 9,000 shares \n\n[321 \nU.S. 67, 91]\n\u00a0\n of Associated's common stock, has one representative among the nine directors of Associated, has investment banking connections with competing rail carriers, and is represented on the boards of directors of other railroads. For present purposes we may assume that by virtue of those connections the rail carriers' interests will be the banking house's interests in directing the affairs of Associated. But aside from the proportionately small (9,000 out of 1,000,000 common shares) stock ownership and the place on the board of directors, the Commission found no connection-either in the origins of the present proposal or in personnel, financing or otherwise-between Kuhn, Loeb and Company and the rail carriers on the one hand and Associated on the other. This contrasts sharply with the circumstances in Transport Co., 36 M.C.C. 61, where a much larger merger of eastern motor carrier operators, sought to be consummated with at least the assistance of Kuhn, Loeb and Company, was denied approval by the Commission. And in the present merger others, not associated, so far as this record shows, with Kuhn, Loeb and Company or rail carriers would have substantial blocks of stock. \n28\n We cannot find anything arbitrary or unreasonable in the conclusion that the consolidation as finally authorized will not result in Associated's being affiliated with a carrier by rail. It may be added that under the Commission's order in this case the relatively close holdings which will emerge from the consolidation cannot be altered without the Commission's approval. And it is the consolidation as approved which is exempted from the operation of the anti-trust laws and the prohibition against rail affiliation without approval. Any future \n\n[321 \nU.S. 67, 92]\n\u00a0\n change which may bring the consolidation into clash with either prohibition may be considered when it arises.\n Accordingly the judgment is affirmed.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice MURPHY is of the opinion that the judgment should be reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice BLACK concurs, dissenting.\n I think that the Commission misconceived its authority under the merger and consolidation provisions of the Act. I agree that the Commission is not to measure motor vehicle consolidations by the standards of the anti-trust acts. Such a construction would make largely meaningless, as the opinion of the Court demonstrates, the power of the Commission under  5(11) to relieve participants in mergers or consolidations from the requirements of those acts. But I think a proper construction of the Act requires the Commission to give greater weight to the principles of competition than it apparently has done here.\n I agree that the standard of the 'public interest' which governs mergers and consolidations under  5 embraces the national transportation policy contained in the Act. That declared policy calls, among other things, for the recognition and preservation of 'the inherent advantages' of motor vehicle transportation; the promotion of 'safe, adequate, economical, and efficient service' and the fostering of 'sound economic conditions in transportation and among the several carriers'; the establishment and maintenance of reasonable charges 'without unjust discriminations, undue preferences or advantages, or unfair or destructive competitive practices'-to the end of 'developing, coordinating, and preserving a national transportation system' which is 'adequate to meet' the national needs. 54 Stat. 899. Those standards are specifically re- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 67, 93]\n\u00a0\n ferred to in  5(2)(c) where an itemization of some of the factors to which the Commission shall give weight is made. And the preamble itself states that 'All of the provisions of this Act shall be administered and enforced with a view to carrying out the above declaration of policy.'\n But I am of the opinion that the concept of the 'public interest' as used in  5 also embraces the anti-trust laws. Those laws extend to carriers as well as to other enterprises. But for the approval of the Commission the present consolidation would run afoul of the Sherman Act. United States v. Southern Pacific Co., \n259 \nU.S. 214\n, 42 S.Ct. 496. And the Clayton Act (which makes specific references to common carriers) by  11 expressly entrusts the Commission with the authority of enforcement of its provisions 'where applicable to common carriers.' 38 Stat. 734, 15 U.S.C.  21, 15 U.S.C.A.  21. Those laws still stand. We thus have a long standing policy of Congress to subject these common carriers to the anti-trust laws. And we should remember that, so far as motor vehicles are concerned, we are dealing with transportation units whose rights of way-the highways of the country-have been furnished by the public. These considerations indicate to me that while the power of Congress to authorize the Commission to lift the ban of the anti-trust laws in favor of common carriers is clear (New York Central Securities Corp. v. United States, \n287 \nU.S. 12, 25\n, 26 S., 53 S.Ct. 45, 48 ), administrative authority to replace the competitive system with a cartel should be strictly construed. I would read  5 of the Transportation Act so as to make for the greatest possible accommodation between the principles of competition and the national transportation policy. The occasions for the exercise of the administrative authority to grant exemptions from the anti-trust laws should be closely confined to those where the transportation need is clear. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 67, 94]\n\u00a0\n If it were the opinion of the Commission that the policy of the Transportation Act would be thwarted unless a particular type of merger or consolidation were permitted, I have no doubt that it would be authorized to lift the ban of the anti-trust laws. But unless such necessity or need were shown I do not think the anti-trust laws should be made to give way. Congress did not give the Commission carte blanche authority to substitute a cartel for a competitive system. It may so act only when that step 'will be consistent with the public interest.'  5(2)(b). But since the 'public interest' includes the principles of free enterprise, which have long distinguished our economy, I can hardly believe that Congress intended them to be swept aside unless they were in fact obstacles to the realization of the national transportation policy. But so far as we know from the present record that policy may be as readily achieved on a competitive basis as through the present type of consolidation. At least such a powerful combination of competitors as is presently projected is not shown to be necessary for that purpose. In this case the hand of the promoter seems more apparent than a transportation need.\n For these reasons I would resolve the ambiguities of the Act in favor of the maintenance of free enterprise. If that is too niggardly an interpretation of the Act, Congress can rectify it. But if the Commission is allowed to take the other view,1 a pattern of consolidation will have been approved which will allow the cartel rather than the competitive system to dominate this field. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 67, 95]\n\u00a0\n History shows that it is next to impossible to turn back the clock once such a trend gets under way.\n But there is another phase of the case which in my view requires a reversal of the judgment below. The Commission has allowed the investment banker of railroad companies to be represented on the board of the motor vehicle company. It did so after a finding that it was not 'reasonable to believe that the affairs of applicant would be managed in the interest of any railroad' and therefore that the motor vehicle company would not be affiliated with any railroad within the meaning of the Act.  5(5)(a), (6). But though we assume there was no such affiliation, I agree with Commissioner Patterson that that is not the end of the matter. The question still remains whether it is 'consistent with the public interest' to allow such a banker's nexus between the two competitors. I cannot believe that Congress intended the Commission to treat such a matter as inconsequential. The whole history of finance urges caution when one investment banker stakes out his claim to two competing companies. Experience shows that when one gains a seat at his competitor's table, it is the beginning of the end of competition. A new zone of influence has been created. Its efficacy turns not on the amount of stock ownership but on a host of subtle and imponderable considerations. Such an intertwined relationship has been 'the root of many evils' (Brandeis, Other People's Money, p. 51) and so demonstrably inimical to the 'public interest' in the past as not to be disregarded today.\n I agree that if  5 were read as the Court reads it, the order of the Commission should be affirmed. But since the Commission took a view of the law which in my opinion was erroneous, I would reverse the judgment below so that the case might be returned to the Commission for reconsideration of the application under the proper construction of  5. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 28 U.S.C.  44, 47, 47a, 345, 28 U.S.C.A.  44, 47, 47a, 345. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Other motor carriers, shippers and shippers' organizations intervened in the proceeding, as did also the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America.

( associated with McCarthy). \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The Commission found that Consolidated and McCarthy compete substantially throughout Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island but Consolidated alone operates between those areas and New York City. Consolidated and Moran complete between the principal points in New York State, but Moran's routes also extend to Cleveland, Ohio, and to several points in northern Pennsylvania. There is some competition among Arrow, Consolidated and Moran in New York, and others of Arrow's routes parallel those of Barnwell and Horton. Barnwell, Horton and Southeastern compete to some extent in parts of the Middle Atlantic States (excluding New York). Barnwell, Horton and Transportation, Inc., compete in portions of the southern region, and Southeastern competes somewhat with them in that area. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Associated is authorized by its charter to issue 100,000 shares of $ 100 par value preferred stock drawing six per cent cumulative dividends annually and 1,000,000 shares of $1.00 par value common stock. One of the conditions of the Commission's order here is that no par value be assigned the common stock. The Commission found that in exchange for all the outstanding stock of the merged companies (except a small quantity of the preferred stock of two of the carriers which was to be redeemed for cash) Associated was to issue \n 648,643 shares of its common and 39,049 shares of its preferred stock, which on the cancellation of certain shares in connection with the stock of one of the noncarriers would leave outstanding 633,171 shares of common and 37,942 shares of preferred. Another 15,000 shares of preferred were to be offered to the public in order to enable Associated to obtain surplus cash. The preferred, which like the common was entitled to one vote per share, was convertible into common at the option of the holders, on terms not here relevant.\n There were 71,480 shares of Associated's common stock outstanding at the time the application was filed, of which 31,240 were held by the president of Associated, 9,000 by The Transport Company (received for engineering accounting data given in connection with the merger), and the remainder by stockholders in the corporations to be merged. \n[\nFootnote 7\n] Section 5 provides in pertinent parts:\n'Sec. 5.

It was anticipated that the Act would confer benefits on the industry 'by promoting a more orderly conduct of the business, lessening irresponsible competition and undue internal strife, encouraging the organization of stronger units, and otherwise enabling the industry to put itself on a sounder and more generally profitable basis.'

In connection with the consolidation of rail and motor carriers Congress was explicit on the subject of competition in its mandate to the Commission. Fearful of the dangerous potentialities which such coordination might create (see 79 Cong.Rec. 5654-5655, 12206, 12222-12225) Congress prescribed more rigorous requirements for that process than for simple motor carrier consolidations. For the latter approval may be granted if the Commission finds the transaction 'consistent with the public interest.' For a rail carrier to consolidate with a motor carrier, Commission approval requires a finding that the transaction will 'be consistent with the public interest and will enable such carrier to use service by motor vehicle to public advantage in its operations and will not unduly restrain competition.' Compare the language of Section 213(a) of the Motor Carrier Act of 1935, 49 Stat. 555, 556, 52 Stat. 1239, (and cf. 86 Cong.Rec. 11546) with that of Section 5 of the Transportation Act of 1940. \n\n[\nFootnote 22\n] Cf. note 17 supra. Authorization of consolidation of rail carriers stems historically from circumstances different from those impelling the authorization of consolidation of motor carriers. Compare authorities cited in notes 9 and 10 supra with those in notes 17-19 supra. This difference in origins is not entirely to be ignored simply because the same provisions of Section 5 now govern both motor carrier and rail carrier consolidations. Cf. 86 Cong.Rec. 11546. But whatever effect the difference may have, as a guide to the Commission concerning the extent to which and circumstances in which consolidation should be allowed, it cannot nullify the power given to the Commission by Section 5(11). \n[\nFootnote 23\n] Compare the provisions of the statutes cited supra notes 20 and 21. \n[\nFootnote 24\n] Cf. note 26 infra; compare also 41 Stat. 481, 482; Chesapeake and Ohio R.

DILWORTH CO.(1944)\nNo. 311\nArgued: February 4, 1944Decided: May 15, 1944\n\n\n\n Mr. Leffel Gentry, of Little Rock, Ark., for petitioner.\n Mr. J. Fred Brown, of Memphis, Tenn., for respondent J. E. Dilworth Co.\n Mr. William H. Daggett, of Marianna, Ark., for respondent Reichman- Crosby Co.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n We are asked to reverse a decision of the Supreme Court of Arkansas holding that the Commerce Clause precludes liability for the sales tax of that State upon the transactions to be set forth. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 327, 328]\n\u00a0\n We take the descriptions of these transactions from the opinion under review. Respondents are Tennessee corporations with home offices and places of business in Memphis where they sell machinery and mill supplies. They are not qualified to do business in Arkansas and have neither sales office, branch plant nor any other place of business in that State. Orders for goods come to Tennessee through solicitation in Arkansas by traveling salesmen domiciled in Tennessee, by mail or telephone. But no matter how an order is placed it requires acceptance by the Memphis office, and on approval the goods are shipped from Tennessee. Title passes upon delivery to the carrier in Memphis, and collection of the sales price is not made in Arkansas. In short, we are here concerned with sales made by Tennessee vendors that are consummated in Tennessee for the delivery of goods in Arkansas.\n For such sales, the Supreme Court of Arkansas had held, in 1939, the State had no power to exact a sales tax, Mann v. McCarroll, 198 Ark. 628, 130 S.W.2d 721. The Arkansas legislation then in force was Act 154 of 1937. The transactions on which the Collector here seeks to tax extended over periods that bring into question Act 154 (extended by Act 364 of 1939) and a new Statute (Act 386 of 1941), known as the Gross Receipts Act. The Arkansas Supreme Court gave the Act of 1941 the same scope and significance as it attributed to the Act of 1937, that is, an act imposing a retail sales tax and not a use tax. In view of this construction, it has adhered to its earlier decision in Mann v. McCarroll, finding nothing in our intervening decision in McGoldrick v. Berwind-White Coal Co., \n309 \nU.S. 33\n, 60 S.Ct. 388, 128 A.L.R. 876, requiring a change in its constitutional views. 205 Ark. 780, 171 S.W.2d 62. To permit further examination of the complicated problems raised by the interplay of federal and state powers we brought the case here. \n320 \nU.S. 728\n, 64 S.Ct. 87. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 327, 329]\n\u00a0\n We agree with the Arkansas Supreme Court that the Berwind-White case presented a situation different from this case and that this case is on the other side of the line which marks off the limits of state power. A boundary line is none the worse for being narrow. Once it is recognized, as it long has been by this Court, that federal and state taxation do not move within wholly different orbits, that there are points of intersection between the powers of the two governments, and that there are transactions of what colloquially may be deemed a single process across state lines which may yet be taxed by the State of their occurrence, 'nice distinctions are to be expected', Galveston, Harrisburg, etc., R. Co. v. State of Texas, \n210 \nU.S. 217, 225\n, 28 S.Ct. 638, 639. The differentiations made by the court below between this case and the Berwind- White case are relevant and controlling. 'The distinguishing point between the Berwind-White Coal case and the cases at bar is that in the Berwind- White Coal case the corporation maintained its sales office in New York City, took its contracts in New York City and made actual delivery in New York City ....' 205 Ark. at page 786, 171 S.W.2d at page 65. This, according to practical notions of what constitutes a sale which is reflected by what the law deems a sale, constituted a sale in New York and accordingly we sustained a retail sales tax by New York. Here, as the Arkansas Supreme Court continued, 'the offices are maintained in Tennessee, the sale is made in Tennessee, and the delivery is consummated either in Tennessee or in interstate commerce with no interruption from Tennessee until delivery to the consignee essential to complete the interstate journey.' Because the relevant factors in the two cases decided together with the Berwind-White case were the same as those in Berwind-White, the decision in that case controlled the two other cases. 'In both cases the tax was imposed on all the sales of merchandise for which orders were taken \n\n[322 \nU.S. 327, 330]\n\u00a0\n within the city and possession of which was transferred to the purchaser there. Decision in both is controlled by our decision in the Berwind-White Company case.' McGoldrick v. Felt & Tarrant Mfg. Co., \n309 \nU.S. 70, 77\n, 60 S.Ct. 404, 405. In Berwind-White the Pennsylvania seller completed his sales in New York; in this case the Tennessee seller was through selling in Tennessee. We would have to destroy both business and legal notions to deny that under these circumstances the sale-the transfer of ownership-was made in Tennessee. For Arkansas to impose a tax on such transactions would be to project its powers beyond its boundaries and to tax an interstate transaction.\n It is suggested, however, that Arkansas could have levied a tax of the same amount on the use of these goods in Arkansas by the Arkansas buyers, and that such a use tax would not exceed the limits upon state power derived from the United States Constitution. Whatever might be the fate of such a tax were it before us, the not too short answer is that Arkansas has chosen not to impose such a use tax, as its Supreme Court so emphatically found. A sale tax and a use tax in many instances may bring about the same result. But they are different in conception, are assessments upon different transactions, and in the interlacings of the two legislative authorities within our federation may have to justify themselves on different constitutional grounds. A sales tax is a tax on the freedom of purchase-a freedom which wartime restrictions serve to emphasize. A use tax is a tax on the enjoyment of that which was purchased. In view of the differences in the basis of these two taxes and the differences in the relation of the taxing state to them, a tax on an interstate sale like the one before us and unlike the tax on the enjoyment of the goods sold, involves an assumption of power by a State which the Commerce Clause was meant to end. The very purpose of the Commerce Clause was to create an area of free trade among the several States. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 327, 331]\n\u00a0\n That clause vested the power of taxing a transaction forming an unbroken process of interstate commerce in the Congress, not in the States.\n The difference in substance between a sales and a use tax was adverted to in the leading case sustaining a tax on the use after a sale had spent its interstate character: 'A tax upon a use so closely connected with delivery as to be in substance a part thereof might be subject to the same objections that would be applicable to a tax upon the sale itself.' Henneford v. Silas Mason Co., \n300 \nU.S. 577, 583\n, 57 S.Ct. 524, 527. Thus we are not dealing with matters of nomenclature even though they be matters of nicety. 'The state court could not render valid, by misdescribing it, a tax law which in substance and effect was repugnant to the federal Constitution; neither can it render unconstitutional a tax, that in its actual effect violates no constitutional provision, by inaccurately defining it.' Wagner v. City of Covington, \n251 \nU.S. 95, 102\n, 104 S., 40 S.Ct. 93, 94, 168. Though sales and use taxes may secure the same revenues and serve complementary purposes, they are, as we have indicated, taxes on different transactions and for different opportunities afforded by a State.\n A very different situation underlay State of Wisconsin v. J. C. Penney Co., \n311 \nU.S. 435\n, 61 S.Ct. 246, 130 A.L.R. 1229. The Wisconsin Supreme Court and this Court were concerned with an exaction on a transaction which the Wisconsin Court described one way and we another. We looked behind the labels to the thing described, and the thing-taxation of the distribution of income earned in Wisconsin-did not offend the Federal Constitution. That case affords no ground for rejecting the deliberate choice of a State to impose a tax on a transfer of ownership and sustaining it, where the transfer was made beyond the state limits, as a use tax on that property because the State might, so far as the Federal Constitution is concerned, have enacted a use tax and such a use tax might have been collected on the \n\n[322 \nU.S. 327, 332]\n\u00a0\n enjoyment of the goods so sold. Such a mode of adjudication would imply a duty of excessive astuteness on our part to contract the area of free trade among the States.\n Judgment affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice BLACK and Mr. Justice MURPHY concur, dissenting.\n The present decision marks a retreat from the philosophy of the Berwind-White case, \n309 \nU.S. 33\n, 60 S.Ct. 388, 128 A.L.R. 876. It draws a distinction between the use tax (Felt & Tarrant Mfg. Co. v. Gallagher, \n306 \nU.S. 62\n, 59 S.Ct. 376) and the sales tax which on the facts of this case seems irrelevant to the power of Arkansas to tax. And it is squarely opposed to McGoldrick v. Felt & Tarrant Mfg. Co ., \n309 \nU.S. 70\n, 60 S.Ct. 404, which should be overruled if the present decision goes down.\n Felt & Tarrant Mfg. Co. v. Gallagher involved a use tax. The State of the buyer (California) was allowed to exact the tax from the Illinois seller for goods sold to California buyers though the seller's activities in California were not different in quality and hardly more numerous than the Arkansas activities of the Tennessee sellers in the present case. Though in some cases deliveries were made by the local agent for Felt & Tarrant, in others shipments were made by it from Illinois direct to the buyers in California. And in that case, as in the present case, the orders were accepted outside the State of the buyer and remittances were made direct to the out-of-state seller.\n In McGoldrick v. Felt & Tarrant Mfg. Co. we allowed New York City to collect its sales tax on sales which Felt & Tarrant made to New York purchasers under substantially the same course of dealing as obtained in case of the California use tax. Moreover, there were other transactions in McGoldrick v. Felt & Tarrant Mfg. Co. which were even closer to the sales in the present case. I refer to the sales to New York City buyers by a Massachusetts corporation \n\n[322 \nU.S. 327, 333]\n\u00a0\n (Du Grenier, Inc.) which was not authorized to do business in New York and which had no employee there. Another company, Stewart & McGuire, Inc., acted as its exclusive agent and solicited orders in New York City. The orders were forwarded to Massachusetts where they were accepted. Shipments were made by rail or truck (F.O.B. Haverhill, Mass.) to the purchaser in New York City, who paid the freight. Yet we allowed New York City to collect its sales tax on those transactions.\n If the federal Constitution does not prohibit New York City from levying its sales tax on the proceeds of those interstate transactions or California from exacting its use tax at the final stage of an interstate movement of goods, I fail to see why Arkansas should be prohibited from collecting the present tax.\n It is not enough to say that the use tax and the sales tax are different. A use tax may of course have a wider range of application than a sales tax. Henneford v. Silas Mason Co., \n300 \nU.S. 577\n, 57 S.Ct. 524. But a use tax and a sales tax applied at the very end of an interstate transaction have precisely the same economic incidence. Their effect on interstate commerce is identical. We stated as much in the Berwind-White case where, in speaking of the sales tax, we said (309 U.S. at page 49, 60 S.Ct. at page 393, 128 A.L.R. 876): 'It does not aim at or discriminate against interstate commerce. It is laid upon every purchaser, within the state, of goods for consumption, regardless of whether they have been transported in interstate commerce. Its only relation to the commerce arises from the fact that immediately preceding transfer of possession to the purchaser within the state, which is the taxable event regardless of the time and place of passing title, the merchandise has been transported in interstate commerce and brought to its journey's end. Such a tax has no different effect upon interstate commerce than a tax on the 'use' of property which has just been moved \n\n[322 \nU.S. 327, 334]\n\u00a0\n in interstate commerce', citing use tax cases including Henneford v. Silas Mason Co. and Felt & Tarrant Mfg. Co. v. Gallagher.\n The sales tax and the use tax are, to be sure, taxes on different phases of the interstate transaction. We may agree that the use tax is a tax 'on the enjoyment of that which was purchased.' But realistically the sales tax is a tax on the receipt of that which was purchased. For as we said in the excerpt from the Berwind-White case quoted above, it is the 'transfer of possession to the purchaser within the state' which is the 'taxable event regardless of the time and place of passing title.' And McGoldrick v. Felt & Tarrant Mfg. Co. makes plain that the transfer of possession need not be by the seller, for in that case, as in the present one, deliveries were made by common carriers which accepted the goods F.O. B. at points outside the State. In terms of state power, receipt of goods within the State of the buyer is as adequate a basis for the exercise of the taxing power as use within the State. And there should be no difference in result under the Commerce Clause where, as here, the practical impact on the interstate transaction is the same.\n It is no answer to say that the Arkansas sales tax may not be imposed because the out-of-state seller was 'through selling' when the tax was incurred. That was likewise true of both the use tax cases, including General Trading Co. v. State Tax Commission, \n322 \nU.S. 335\n, 64 S.Ct. 1028, and the sales tax decision in McGoldrick v. Felt & Tarrant Mfg. Co. The question is whether there is a phase of the interstate transaction on which the State of the buyer can lay hold without placing interstate commerce at a disadvantage. There is no showing that Tennessee was exacting from these vendors a tax on these same transactions or that Arkansas discriminated against them. I can see no warrant for an interpretation of the Commerce Clause which \n\n[322 \nU.S. 327, 335]\n\u00a0\n puts local industry at a competitive disadvantage with interstate business. If there is a taxable event within the State of the buyer, I would make the result under the Commerce Clause turn on practical considerations and business realities rather than on dialectics. If that is not done, I think we should retreat from the view that interstate commerce should carry its fair share of the costs of government in the localities where it finds its markets and adopt the views expressed in the dissent in the Berwind-White case. \n\n\n\n","71":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMCLEOD v. J.E. DILWORTH CO.(1944)\nNo. 311\nArgued: Decided: May 15, 1944\n\n\n Rehearing Denied, No. 355, June 12, 1944.\n See \n322 \nU.S. 772\n, 64 S.Ct. 1281.\n\n Mr. Justice RUTLEDGE.\n These three cases present in various applications the question of the power of a state to tax transactions having a close connection with interstate commerce.\n In No. 311, McLeod v. Dilworth Co., \n322 \nU.S. 327\n, 64 S.Ct. 1023, Arkansas has construed its tax to be a sales tax, but has held this cannot be applied where a Tennessee corporation, having its home office and place of business in Memphis, solicits orders in Arkansas, by mail, telephone or sending solicitors regularly from Tennessee, accepts the orders in Memphis, and delivers the goods there to the carrier for shipment to the purchaser in Arkansas. This Court holds the tax invalid, because 'the sale-the transfer of ownership-was made in Tennessee. For Arkansas to impose a tax on such transactions would be to project its powers beyond its boundaries and to tax an interstate transaction.' Though an Arkansas 'use tax' might be sustained in the same situation, 'we are not dealing with matters of nomenclature even though they be matters of nicety.' And the case is thought to be different from the \n\n[322 \nU.S. 349, 350]\n\u00a0\n Berwind-White case, \n309 \nU.S. 33\n, 60 S.Ct. 388, 128 A.L.R. 876, where New York City levied the tax, because, in the Arkansas court's language, 'the corporation maintained its sales office in New York City, took its contracts in New York City and made actual delivery in New York City ....' 205 Ark. 780, 171 S.W.2d 62, 65.\n On the other hand, in No. 441, General Trading Co. v. State Tax Commission, \n322 \nU.S. 335\n, 64 S.Ct. 1028, Iowa applies its 'use tax' to a transaction in which a Minnesota corporation ships goods from Minnesota, its only place of business, to Iowa purchasers on orders solicited in Iowa by salesmen sent there regularly from Minnesota for that purpose, the orders being accepted in Minnesota. This tax the Court sustains. While 'no State can tax the privilege of doing interstate business. ... the mere fact that property is used for interstate commerce or has come into an owner's possession as a result of interstate commerce does not diminish the protection which it may draw from a State to the upkeep of which it may be asked to bear its fair share. But a fair share precludes legislation obviously hostile or practically discriminatory toward interstate commerce. ... None of these infirmities affects the tax in this case ....' And the foreign or nonresident seller who does no more than solicit orders in Iowa, as the Tennessee seller does in Arkansas, may be made the state's tax collector.\n In No. 355, International Harvester Co. v. Department of Treasury of State of Indiana, \n322 \nU.S. 340\n, 64 S.Ct. 1019, the state applies its gross income tax, among other situations, to one (Class D) where a foreign corporation authorized to do and doing business in Indiana sells and delivers its product in Indiana to out-of-state customers who come into the State for the transaction. The Court sustains the tax as applied.\n\n\n I.\n\n\n For constitutional purposes, I see no difference but one of words and possibly one of the scope of coverage between the Arkansas tax in No. 311 and the Iowa tax in No. 441. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 349, 351]\n\u00a0\n This is true whether the issue is one of due process or one of undue burden on interstate commerce. Each tax is imposed by the consuming state. On the records here, each has a due process connection with the transaction in that fact and in the regular, continuous solicitation there. Neither lays a greater burden on the interstate business involved than it does on wholly intrastate business of the same sort. Neither segregates the interstate transaction for separate or special treatment. In each instance therefore interstate and intrastate business reach these markets on identical terms, so far as the effects of the state taxes are concerned.\n And in my opinion they do so under identical material circumstances. In both cases the sellers are 'nonresidents' of the taxing state, foreign corporations. Neither seller maintains an office or a place of business there. Each has these facilities solely in the state of origin. In both cases the orders are taken by solicitors sent regularly to the taxing state for that purpose. In both the orders are accepted at the home office in the state of origin. And in both the goods are shipped by delivery to the carrier or the post in the state of origin for carriage across the state line and delivery by it to the purchaser in his taxing state.\n In the face of such identities in connections and effects, it is hard to see how one tax can be upheld and the other voided. Surely the state's power to tax is not to turn on the technical legal effect, relevant for other purposes but not for this, that 'title passes' on delivery to the carrier in Memphis and may or may not so pass, so far as the record shows, when the Minnesota shipment is made to Iowa. In the absence of other and more substantial difference, that irrelevant technical consideration should not control. However it may be determined for locating the incidence of loss in transit or other questions arising among buyer, seller and carrier, for purposes of taxation that \n\n[322 \nU.S. 349, 352]\n\u00a0\n factor alone is a will-o'-the-wisp, insufficient to crux a due process connection from selling to consuming state and incapable of increasing or reducing any burden the tax may place upon the interstate transaction.\n The only other difference is in the terms used by Iowa and Arkansas, respectively, to describe their taxes. For reasons of her own Arkansas describes her tax as a 'sales tax.' Iowa calls hers a 'use tax.' This court now is committed to the validity of 'use' taxes. Henneford v. Silas Mason Co., Inc., \n300 \nU.S. 577\n, 57 S.Ct. 524; Felt & Tarrant Mfg. Co. v. Gallagher, \n306 \nU.S. 62\n, 59 S.Ct. 376; Nelson v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., \n312 \nU.S. 359\n, 61 S.Ct. 586, 132 A.L.R. 475; Nelson v. Montgomery Ward & Co., \n312 \nU.S. 373\n, 61 S.Ct. 593. Similarly, 'sales taxes' on 'interstate sales' have been sustained. In McGoldrick v. Berwind-White Coal Mining Co., \n309 \nU.S. 33\n, 60 S.Ct. 388, 128 A.L.R. 876, such a tax applied by the state of the market was upheld. Compare Banker Bros. Co. v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, \n222 \nU.S. 210\n, 32 S.Ct. 38; Wiloil Corporation v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, \n294 \nU.S. 169\n, 55 S.Ct. 358. Other things being the same, constitutionality should not turn on whether one name or the other is applied by the state. State of Wisconsin v. J. C. Penney Co., \n311 \nU.S. 435\n, 61 S.Ct. 246, 130 A.L.R. 1229. The difference may be important for the scope of the statute's application, that is, whether it is intended to apply to some transactions but not to others that are within reach of the state's taxing power. It hardly can determine whether the power exists.\n\n\n II.\n\n\n The Court's different treatment of the two taxes does not result from any substantial difference in the facts under which they are levied or the effects they may have on interstate trade. It arises rather from applying different constitutional provisions to the substantially identical taxes, in the one case to invalidate that of Arkansas, in the other to sustain that of Iowa. Due process destroys the former. Absence of undue burden upon interstate commerce sustains the latter. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 349, 353]\n\u00a0\n It would seem obvious that neither tax of its own force can impose a greater burden upon the interstate transaction to which it applies than it places upon the wholly local trade of the same character with which that transaction competes. By paying the Arkansas tax the Tennessee seller will pay no more than an Arkansas seller of the same goods to the same Arkansas buyer; and the latter will pay no more to the Tennessee seller than to an Arkansas vendor, on account of the tax, in absorbing its burden. The same thing is true of the Iowa tax in its incidence upon the sale by the Minnesota vendor. The cases are not different in the burden the two taxes place upon the interstate transactions. Nor in my opinion are they different in the existence of due process to sustain the taxes.\n'Due process' and 'commerce clause' conceptions are not always sharply separable in dealing with these problems. Cf. e.g., Western Union Tel. Co. v. State of Kansas, \n216 \nU.S. 1\n, 30 S.Ct. 190. To some extent they overlap. If there is a want of due process to sustain the tax, by that fact alone any burden the tax imposes on the commerce among the states becomes 'undue.' But, though overlapping, the two conceptions are not identical. There may be more than sufficient factual connections, with economic and legal effects, between the transaction and the taxing state to sustain the tax as against due process objections. Yet it may fall because of its burdening effect upon the commerce. And, although the two notions cannot always be separated, clarity of consideration and of decision would be promoted if the two issues are approached, where they are presented, at least tentatively as if they were separate and distinct, not intermingled ones.\n\n Thus, in the case from Arkansas no more than in that from Iowa should there be difficulty in finding due process connections with the taxing state sufficient to sustain the tax. As in the Iowa case, the goods are sold and shipped to Arkansas buyers. Arkansas is the consuming state, \n\n[322 \nU.S. 349, 354]\n\u00a0\n the market these goods seek and find. They find it by virtue of a continuous course of solicitation there by the Tennessee seller. The old notion that 'mere solicitation' is not 'doing business' when it is regular, continuous and persistent is fast losing its force. In the General Trading case it loses force altogether, for the Iowa statute defines this process in terms as a 'retailer maintaining a place of business in this state.' \n1\n The Iowa Supreme Court sustains the definition and this Court gives effect to its decision in upholding the tax. Fiction the definition may be; but it is fiction with substance because, for every relevant constitutional consideration affecting taxation of transactions, regular, continuous, persistent solicitation has the same economic, and should have the same legal, consequences as does maintaining an office for soliciting and even contracting purposes or maintaining a place of business, where the goods actually are shipped into the state from without for delivery to the particular buyer. There is no difference between the Iowa and the Arkansas situations in this respect. Both involve continuous, regular, and not intermittent or casual courses of solicitation. Both involve the shipment of goods from without to a buyer within the state. Both involve taxation by the state of the market. And if these substantial connections are sufficient to underpin the tax with due process in the one case, they are also in the other.\n That is true, if labels are not to control, unless something which happens or may happen outside the taxing state operates in the one case to defeat the jurisdiction, but does not defeat it in the other.\n As I read the Court's opinion, though it does not explicitly so state, the Arkansas tax falls because Tennessee could tax the transaction and, as between the two states, has exclusive power to do so. This is because 'the sale-the transfer of ownership-was made in Tennessee.' \n\n[322 \nU.S. 349, 355]\n\u00a0\n Arkansas' relation to the transaction is constitutionally different from that of New York in the Berwind-White case, though both are the state of the market, because the Berwind-White Company 'maintained its sales office in New York City, took its contracts in New York City and made actual delivery in New York City.' This 'constituted a sale in New York and accordingly we sustained a retail sales tax by New York.' So here the company's 'offices are maintained in Tennessee, the sale is made in Tennessee, and the delivery is consummated either in Tennessee or in interstate commerce ....' The inevitable conclusion, it seems to me, is that the Court is deciding not only that Arkansas cannot tax the transaction, but that Tennessee can tax it and is the only state which can do so. To put the matter shortly Arkansas cannot levy the tax because Tennessee can levy it. Hence 'for Arkansas to impose a tax on such transactions would be to project its powers beyond its boundaries and to tax an interstate transaction.'\n This statement of the matter appears to be a composite of due process and commerce clause ideas. If so, it is hard to see why the same considerations do not nullify Iowa's power to levy her tax in the identical circumstances and vest exclusive jurisdiction in Minnesota to tax those transactions. For in the Iowa case the selling corporation maintains its office and place of business in Minnesota, accepts the orders there, and the delivery, which is to carrier or post, is consummated, so far as the record shows, exactly in the manner it is made in the Tennessee-Arkansas transaction. If these facts nullify Arkansas' power to tax the transaction by vesting exclusive jurisdiction in Tennessee, it would seem a fortiori they would nullify Iowa's power and give Minnesota exclusive jurisdiction to tax the transactions there involved. Unless the sheer difference in the terms 'sale' and 'use,' and whatever difference these might make as a matter of legislative selec- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 349, 356]\n\u00a0\n tion of the transactions which are to bear the tax, are to control upon the existence of the power to tax, the result should be the same in both cases.\n Merely as a matter of due process, it is hard to see why any of the four states cannot tax the transactions these cases involve. Each has substantial relations and connections with the transaction, the state of market not less in either case than the state of origin. It 'sounds better' for the state of origin to call its tax a 'sales tax' and the state of market to name its tax a 'use tax.' But in the Berwind-White case the latter's 'sales tax' was sustained, where it is true more of the incidents of sale conjoined with the location of the place of market than do in either No. 311 or No. 441. If this is the distinguishing factor, as it might be for selecting one of the two connected jurisdictions for exclusive taxing power, it is not one which applies to either of these transactions. The identity is not between the Dilworth case and Berwind- White. It is rather between Dilworth and General Trading with Berwind- White differing from both. And, so far as due process alone is concerned, it should make no difference whether the tax in the one case is laid by Arkansas or Tennessee and in the other by Iowa or Minnesota. Each state has a sufficiently substantial and close connection with the transaction, whether by virtue of tax benefits conferred in general police protection and otherwise or on account of ideas of territorial sovereignty concerning occurrence of 'taxable incidents' within its borders, to furnish the due process foundation necessary to sustain the exercise of its taxing power. Whether it exerts this by selecting for 'impingement' of the tax some feature or incident of the transaction which it denominates 'sale' or 'use' is both illusory and unimportant in any bearing upon its constitutional authority as a matter of due process. If this has any substantive effect, it is merely one of legislative intent in selecting the transactions to bear the tax and thus \n\n[322 \nU.S. 349, 357]\n\u00a0\n fixing the scope of its coverage, not one of constitutional power. 'Use' may cover more transactions with which a state has due process connections than 'sale.' But whenever sale occurs and is taxed the tax bears equally, in final incidence of burden, upon the use which follows immediately upon it.\n The great difficulty in allocating taxing power as a matter of due process between the state of origin and the state of market arises from the fact that each state, considered without reference to the other, always has a sufficiently substantial relation in fact and in tax benefit conferred to the interstate transaction to sustain an exertion of its taxing power, a fact not always recognized. And from this failure, as well as from the terms in which statutes not directed specifically to reaching these transactions are cast, comes the search for some 'taxable incident taking place within the state's boundaries' as a hook for hanging constitutionality under due process ideas. 'Taxable incident' there must be. But to take what is in essence and totality an interstate transaction between a state of origin and one of market and hang the taxing power of either state upon some segmented incident of the whole and declare that this does or does not 'tax an interstate transaction' is to do two things. It is first to ignore that any tax hung on such an incident is levied on an interstate transaction. For the part cannot be separated from the whole. It is also to ignore the fact that each state, whether of origin or of market, has by that one fact alone a relation to the whole transaction so substantial as to nullify any due process prohibition. Whether the tax is levied on the 'sale' or on the 'use,' by the one state or by the other, it is in fact and effect a tax levied on an interstate transaction. Nothing in due process requirements prohibits either state to levy either sort of tax on such transactions. That Tennessee therefore may tax this transaction by a sales tax does not, in any proper conception of due process, deprive Arkansas of the same power. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 349, 358]\n\u00a0\n III.\n When, however, the issue is turned from due process to the prohibitive effect of the commerce clause, more substantial considerations arise from the fact that both the state of origin and that of market exert or may exert their taxing powers upon the interstate transaction. The long history of this problem boils down in general statement to the formula that the states, by virtue of the force of the commerce clause, may not unduly burden interstate commerce. This resolves itself into various corollary formulations. One is that a state may not single out interstate commerce for special tax burden. McGoldrick v. Berwind-White Coal Mining Co., \n309 \nU.S. 33, 55\n, 56 S., 60 S.Ct. 388, 397, 398, 128 A.L.R. 876. Nor may it discriminate against interstate commerce and in favor of its local trade. Welton v. State of Missouri, \n91 \nU.S. 275\n; Guy v. Baltimore, \n100 \nU.S. 434\n; Voight v. Wright, \n141 \nU.S. 62\n, 11 S.Ct. 855. Again, the state may not impose cumulative burdens upon interstate trade or commerce. Gwin, White & Prince, Inc., v. Henneford, \n305 \nU.S. 434\n, 59 S.Ct. 325; J. D. Adams Mfg. Co. v. Storen, \n304 \nU.S. 307\n, 58 S.Ct. 913, 117 A.L.R. 429. Thus, the state may not impose certain taxes on interstate commerce, its incidents or instrumentalities, which are no more in amount or burden than it places on its local business, not because this of itself is discriminatory, cumulative or special or would violate due process, but because other states also may have the right constitutionally, apart from the commerce clause, to tax the same thing and either the actuality or the risk of their doing so makes the total burden cumulative, discriminatory or special. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n In these interstate transactions cases involving taxation by the state of origin or that of market, the trouble arises, under the commerce clause, not from any danger that either tax taken alone, whether characterized as 'sales' or \n\n[322 \nU.S. 349, 359]\n\u00a0\n 'use' tax, will put interstate trade at a disadvantage which will burden unduly its competition with the local trade. So long as only one tax is applied and at the same rate as to wholly local transactions, no unduly discriminatory clog actually attaches to the interstate transaction of business.\n The real danger arises most obviously when both states levy the tax. Thus, if in the instant cases it were shown that, on the one hand, Arkansas and Iowa actually were applying a 'use' tax and Tennessee and Minnesota a 'sales' tax, so that in each case the interstate transaction were taxed at both ends, the heavier cumulative burden thus borne by the interstate business in comparison with the local trade in either state would be obvious. If in each case the state of origin were shown to impose a sales tax of three per cent and the state of market a use tax of the same amount, interstate transactions between the two obviously would bear double the local tax burden borne by local trade in each state. This is a difference of substance, not merely one of names, relevant to the problem created by the commerce clause, though not to that of 'jurisdiction' under due process conceptions. And the difference would be no less substantial if the taxes levied by both the state of origin and that of market were called 'sales' taxes or if, indeed, both were called 'use' taxes.\n The Iowa tax in No. 441 avoids this problem by allowing credit for any sales tax shown to be levied upon the transaction whether in Iowa or elsewhere. Clearly therefore that tax cannot in fact put the interstate transaction at a tax disadvantage with local trade done in Iowa or elsewhere. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n However, the Arkansas tax in No. 311 provides for no such credit. But in that case there is no showing that Tennessee actually imposes any tax upon the transaction. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 349, 360]\n\u00a0\n If there is a burden or clog on commerce, therefore, it arises from the fact that Tennessee has power constitutionally to impose a tax, may exercise it, and when this occurs the cumulative effect of both taxes will be discriminatorily burdensome, though neither tax singles out the transaction or bears upon it more heavily than upon the local trade to which it applies. In short, the risk of multiple taxation creates the unconstitutional burden which actual taxation by both states would impose in fact.\n In my opinion this is the real question and the only one presented in No. 311. And in my judgment, it is determined the wrong way, not on commerce clause grounds but upon an unsustainable application of the due process prohibition.\n Where the cumulative effect of two taxes, by whatever name called, one imposed by the state of origin, the other by the state of market, actually bears in practical effect upon such an interstate transaction, there is no escape under the doctrine of undue burden from one of two possible alternatives. Either one tax must fall or, what is the same thing, be required to give way to the other by allowing credit as the Iowa tax does, or there must be apportionment. Either solution presents an awkward alternative. But one or the other must be accepted unless that doctrine is to be discarded and one of two extreme positions taken, namely, that neither state can tax the interstate transaction or that both may do so until Congress intervenes to give its solution for the problem. It is too late to accept the former extreme, too early even if it were clearly desirable or permissible to follow the latter.\n As between apportionment and requiring one tax to fall or allow credit, the latter perhaps would be the preferable solution. And in my opinion it is the one which the Court in effect, though not in specific statement, adopts. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 349, 361]\n\u00a0\n That the decision is cast more largely in terms of due process than in those of the commerce clause does not nullify that effect.\n If in this case it were necessary to choose between the state of origin and that of market for the exercise of exclusive power to tax, or for requiring allowance of credit in order to avoid the cumulative burden, in my opinion the choice should lie in favor of the state of market rather than the state of origin. \n4\n The former is the state where the goods must come in competition with those sold locally. It is the one where the burden of the tax necessarily will fall equally on both classes of trade. To choose the tax of the state of origin presents at least some possibilities that the burden it imposes on its local trade, with which the interstate traffic does not compete, at any rate directly, will be heavier than that placed by the consuming state on its local business of the same character. If therefore choice has to be made, whether as a matter of exclusive power to tax or as one of allowing credit, it should be in favor of the state of market or consumption as the one most certain to place the same tax load on both the interstate and competing local business. Hence, if the risk of taxation by both states may be said to have the same constitutional consequences, under the commerce clause as taxation in actuality by both, the Arkansas tax, rather than the power of Tennessee to tax, should stand.\n It may be that the mere risk of double taxation would not have the same consequences, given always of course a sufficient due process connection with the taxing states, that actual double taxation has, or may have, for applica- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 349, 362]\n\u00a0\n tion of the commerce clause prohibition. Risk of course is not irrelevant to burden or to the clogging effect the rule against undue burden is intended to prevent. But in these situations it may be doubted, on entirely practical grounds, that the mere risk Tennessee may apply its taxing power to these transactions will have any substantial effect in restraining the commerce such as the actual application of that power would have. In any event, whether or not the choice must be made now or, as I think, has been made, it should go in favor of Arkansas, not Tennessee.\n For all practical purposes Indiana's gross income tax in No. 355 may be regarded as either a sales tax or a use tax laid in the state of market, comparable in all respects (except in words) to the Arkansas tax laid in No. 311 and to the Iowa tax imposed in No. 441, except that here the seller as well as the buyer does business and concludes the transaction in Indiana, the state of the market. This is clearly true of Classes C and E. It is true also of Class D, in my opinion, although the buyer there resided in Illinois but went to Indiana to enter into the transaction and take delivery of the goods. That he at once removed them, and completion of the transaction there, to Illinois, intended to do this from the beginning and this fact may have been known to the seller, does not take from the transaction its character as one entered into and completed in Indiana. Whether or not Illinois, in these circumstances, could impose a use tax or some other as a property tax is not presented and need not be determined. If the Arkansas and Iowa taxes stand, or either does, a fortiori the Indiana tax stands in these applications.\n Accordingly, I concur in the decisions in Nos. 441 and 355, but dissent from the decision in No. 311. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Cf.

At their request and upon their statement that they were dissatisfied with the union and would abandon it if their wages were increased, petitioner negotiated with them without the intervention of the union, granted the requested increases in wages and thereafter refused to recognize or bargain with the union. The only questions raised by the petition for certiorari are whether in the circumstances, petitioner's negotiations with its employees, its payment of increased wages, and its refusal to bargain with the union constituted unfair labor practices in violation of  8(1) and (5) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C .  158(1) and (5), 29 U.S.C.A.  158(1, 5).\n Upon complaint of the National Labor Relations Board charging petitioner with unfair labor practices, issued pur- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 678, 680]\n\u00a0\n suant to  10 of the Act, 29 U.S.C.  160, 29 U.S.C.A.  160, the Board found that petitioner had violated  8(1) and (5) of the Act by interfering with its employees in the exercise of their rights to bargain collectively, guaranteed by  7 of the Act, 29 U.S.C.  157, 29 U.S.C.A.  157, and by refusing to bargain with a union representing its employees. The Board entered the usual order directing petitioner to cease the unfair labor practices so found, and requiring it to bargain with the union. 43 N. L.R.B. 989. On the Board's petition to enforce its order, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit overruled petitioner's contentions that the union, at the time of the alleged unfair labor practices, no longer represented petitioner's employees for purposes of collective bargaining and directed compliance with the order. 135 F.2d 279. We granted certiorari, \n320 \nU.S. 723\n, 64 S.Ct. 67, as the case involves questions of importance in the administration of the National Labor Relations Act.\n The Board made findings supported by evidence that after eighteen of the twenty-six employees in petitioner's shipping and receiving department, constituting an appropriate bargaining unit, had designated the union as their bargaining agent, petitioner, on June 4th and 5th, 1941, recognized it as the exclusive bargaining representative of the employees. The union having proposed a contract providing for an increase of wages for the employees, petitioner agreed to meet the union representatives on June 9, 1941 in order to begin collective bargaining.\n Two days before that date, twelve of the employees who were members of the union, waited on petitioner's manager and stated that they and the six other members had no desire to belong to the union if through their own efforts they could obtain wage increases, a list of which they submitted. The manager, at that time, declined to discuss the union, but stated that he would consider the request for age increases with petitioner's president on the latter's return to the office on June 9th, and asked the employees to return on that day. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 678, 681]\n\u00a0\n On June 9th, the manager, after a conference with the president, met with a committee of four of the employees who had conferred with him two days before. He advised them that petitioner would grant substantially the requested wage increases. The committee then withdrew to convey this message to the other employees, who thereupon agreed to accept the wage increases. The committee returned to inform the manager of this and that the employees 'felt that they did not need the union, and we would rather stay out'. Later in the day, the committee notified the union representative that the employees no longer desired the union to represent them. At a meeting on the same day with the representatives of the union, at which this committee was present, petitioner's attorney stated that he understood that the union no longer represented a majority of the employees and he declined to negotiate with it unless it were established by an election that it did.\n From this, and from evidence which it is unnecessary to detail, the Board concluded, and we accept its findings, that the employees had not revoked their designation of the union as their bargaining agent before the wage increases were promised by petitioner's manager on June 9th; that the increases were induced by negotiations begun with petitioner on June 7th and concluded on June 9th before they had repudiated the union; that petitioner's determination to increase wages was 'occasioned solely by the employees' offer to withdraw from the union if the raises were granted'; and that the employees' defection from the union was induced by petitioner's conduct in dealing directly with the employees. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[321 \nU.S. 678, 682]\n\u00a0\n In sustaining the Board's order the Court of Appeals assumed that as there had been no election or certification of the union as their bargaining representative, the employees were free to revoke their designation of it and to engotiate directly with the employer for an increase in wages, without the intervention of the union. But it thought that if such a proposal came from the employer, it would be a forbidden interference with the collective bargaining process and it concluded that, in view of the difficulties of determining whether in fact such an offer, ostensibly coming from the employees, was induced by the employer, the Board could conclude that the mere acceptance by the employer of the employees' offer was an unfair labor practice. A concurring judge thought that the case was stripped of any intimation of employer control but that the Board's order should be sustained on the ground that it was an unfair labor practice for the employer to bargain with the employees when their revocation of the union's authority was made conditional upon the majority's agreement to abandon collective bargaining altogether, even for an unspecified time.\n We think it plain that the findings of the Board do not admit of either of these dispositions of the case. While the negotiations of petitioner with the employees resulted in a wage increase and their abandonment of the union, the negotiations were carried on by certain of the employees purporting to act in behalf of and to represent a majority. Nothing appears which would suggest, as the concurring judge thought, that any of the employees during or as \n\n[321 \nU.S. 678, 683]\n\u00a0\n a result of the negotiations had by agreement or otherwise foreclosed themselves from continuing such bargaining through the same or any other representatives whom they might choose. Nor in the circumstances disclosed by the evidence and the Board's findings can we say that it was of any significance whether, as the Court of Appeals thought, the employees' offer to abandon the union originated with them or was inspired by the employer. For in either case, as will presently appear, we think that the negotiations by petitioner for wage increases with any one other than the union, the designated representative of the employees, was an unfair labor practice. We think that the Board's order should have been enforced for the reasons stated by it.\n The petition for certiorari does not challenge the Board's findings that the union represented a majority of the employees in petitioner's shipping department, and that they constituted a proper bargaining unit and that petitioner had agreed to bargain with the union. The evidence shows and the Board found that when the employees opened their negotiations with petitioner's manager on June 7th, they had not repudiated the union. On the contrary they made it plain that their proposal for its abandonment was contingent upon petitioner's willingness to give the desired wage increases. The evidence also shows, as the Board found, that the employees did not withdraw their designation of the union as their bargaining representative until after they had voted to accept the wage increases, and that until then, they had held themselves out as union members throughout their negotiations with petitioner and its representatives.\n The National Labor Relations Act makes it the duty of the employer to bargain collectively with the chosen representatives of his employees. The obligation being exclusive, see  9(a) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.  159(a), 29 U.S.C.A.  159(a), it \n\n[321 \nU.S. 678, 684]\n\u00a0\n exacts 'the negative duty to treat with no other.' National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin, \n301 \nU.S. 1, 44\n, 57 S.Ct. 615, 628, 108 A.L.R. 1352; and see Virginian Railway Co. v. System Federation, \n300 \nU.S. 515, 548\n, 549 S., 57 S.Ct. 592, 599, 600. Petitioner, by ignoring the union as the employees' exclusive bargaining representative, by negotiating with its employees concerning wages at a time when wage negotiations with the union were pending, and by inducing its employees to abandon the union by promising them higher wages, violated  8(1) of the Act, which forbids interference with the right of employees to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choice.\n That it is a violation of the essential principle of collective bargaining and an infringement of the Act for the employer to disregard the bargaining representative by negotiating with individual employees, whether a majority or a majority, with respect to wages, hours and working conditions was recognized by this Court in J.I. Case Co. v. Labor Board, \n321 \nU.S. 332\n, 64 S.Ct. 576; cf. Order of Railroad Telegraphers v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., \n321 \nU.S. 342\n, 64 S.Ct. 582; see also National Licorice Co. v. Labor Board, \n309 \nU.S. 350\n, 359-361, 60 S.Ct. 569, 575, 576. The statute guarantees to all employees the right to bargain collectively through their chosen representatives. Bargaining carried on by the employer directly with the employees, whether a minority or majority, who have not revoked their designation of a bargaining agent, would be subversive of the mode of collective bargaining which the statute has ordained, as the Board, the expert body in this field, has found. Such conduct is therefore an interference with the rights guaranteed by  7 and a violation of  8(1) of the Act. \n2\n There is no \n\n[321 \nU.S. 678, 685]\n\u00a0\n necessity for us to determine the extent to which or the periods for which the employees, having designated a bargaining representative, may be foreclosed from revoking their designation, if at all, or the formalities, if any, necessary for such a revocation. Compare National Labor Relations Board v. Century Oxford Mfg. Co., 2 Cir., 140 F.2d 541. But orderly collective bargaining requires that the employer be not permitted to go behind the designated representatives, in order to bargain with the employees themselves, prior to such a revocation. And it is the fact here, as found by the Board, that the employees did not revoke their designation of the union as their bargaining agent at any time while they were themselves negotiating with petitioner, and that they left the union, as they had promised petitioner to do, only when petitioner had agreed to give them increased wages.\n Quite apart from the Board's finding of an unfair labor practice in petitioner's direct negotiations with its employees when they had not revoked their designation of the union, there can be no question but that it was likewise an unfair labor practice for petitioner, in response to the offer of its employees, to induce them by the grant of wage increases, to leave the union. \n3\n National Labor Relations Board v. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 678, 686]\n\u00a0\n Falk Corp., \n308 \nU.S. 453, 460\n, 461 S., 60 S.Ct. 307, 311. This violation of  8(1) was in itself sufficient to support the Board's order to cease and desist. The words and purpose of  7 and 8(1) of the Act enjoin an employer from interfering with, or coercing, its employees in their rights to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, and to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing. There could be no more obvious way of interfering with these rights of employees than by grants of wage increases upon the understanding that they would leave the union in return. The action of employees with respect to the choice of their bargaining agents may be induced by favors bestowed by the employer as well as by his threats or domination. International Ass'n of Machinists v. Labor Board, \n311 \nU.S. 72\n, 61 S.Ct. 83; National Labor Relations Board v. Falk Corp., supra; National Labor Relations Board v. Pennsylvania Greyhound Lines, \n303 \nU.S. 261\n, 266-268, 58 S.Ct. 571, 574, 575, 115 A.L.R. 307.\n Petitioner contends that it would be equally an unfair labor practice to refuse the wage increases as to grant them, for that would influence the employees to stay in the union, instead of abandoning it. But either consequence, as well as any violation of the Act, would in this case have been avoided if the employer, as is its statutory duty, had refused to negotiate with any one other than the duly designated bargaining representative of his employees. We are not now concerned with the question whether, in other circumstances, such action would have been an unfair labor practice. Nor does not possibility relieve peti- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 678, 687]\n\u00a0\n tioner of the consequences of its unfair labor practices which the Board has found.\n Petitioner was not relieved from its obligations because the employees asked that they be disregarded. The statute was enacted in the public interest for the protection of the employees' right to collective bargaining and it may not be ignored by the employer, even though the employees consent, National Labor Relations Board v. Newport News Co., \n308 \nU.S. 241, 251\n, 60 S.Ct. 203, 208, or the employees suggest the conduct found to be an unfair labor practice, National Licorice Co. v. Labor Board, supra, 309 U.S. page 353, 60 S.Ct. page 572, at least where the employer is in a position to secure any advantage from the practices, H. J. Heinz Co. v. Labor Board, \n311 \nU.S. 514\n, 519-521, 61 S.Ct. 320, 322, 323, and cases cited.\n Petitioner cannot, as justification for its refusal to bargain with the union, set up the defection of union members which it had induced by unfair labor practices, even though the result was that the union no longer had the support of a majority. It cannot thus, by its own action, disestablish the union as the bargaining representative of the employees, previously designated as such of their own free will. National Labor Relations Board v. Bradford Dyeing Ass'n, \n310 \nU.S. 318, 339\n, 340 S., 60 S.Ct. 918, 929; International Ass'n of Machinists v. Labor Board, supra, 311 U.S. page 82, 61 S.Ct. page 89; cf. National Licorice Co. v. Labor Board, supra, 309 U.S. page 359, 60 S.Ct. page 575. Petitioner's refusal to bargain under those circumstances was but an aggravation of its unfair labor practice in destroying the majority's support of the union, and was a violation of  8(1) and (5) of the Act.\n The Board rightly determined that petitioner had engaged in the unfair labor practices which the Board found, and this determination supports its order directing the cessation of those practices. The petition for certiorari has raised no question as to the propriety of the Board's order directing petitioner to bargain with the union, which was also sustained and ordered enforced by the Court of Ap- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 678, 688]\n\u00a0\n peals. We therefore have no occasion to consider that part of the order here. Compare Franks Bros. Co. v. Labor Board, \n321 \nU.S. 702\n, 64 S.Ct. 817, decided this day.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS dissents.\n\n Mr. Justice RUTLEDGE, dissenting.\n I dissent. The story told by this record is not of a dominating or intermeddling employer, interfering with employees in their collective bargaining arrangements or activities. It is rather of one which sought to do no more than meet its employees' wishes, freely formed and freely stated; and at the same time to be sure it would do nothing to violate the law governing their relations. The record is barren of any evidence of trouble or real dispute between Medo and its employees, of hostility by Medo to unions or employee organization, or of any refusal to bargain collectively as the statute requires. \n1\n On the contrary, it shows without contradiction that Medo regarded these things as wholly for the employees to settle among themselves; that it scrupulously sought to keep hands off; and that it was willing to bargain with them by whatever agency they might select. These attitudes were qualified only by the company's desire to be sure that the union was entitled legally to represent the employees and to avoid being caught in a possible jurisdictional dispute between the A.F. of L. and the C.I.O. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The Board has found that Medo was guilty of unfair labor practice in three respects: (1) in dealing directly with the employees, rather than through the union, on June 7 and 9; (2) in refusing to deal with the union ; (3) in granting the increased wages sought by the employees. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 678, 689]\n\u00a0\n On the facts, (1) and (2) come to the same thing, that before June 7 the union had acquired legal status as exclusive bargaining agent, which was effective to require Medo to deal only with it, and that this was not validly revoked then or later. The same things are subsumed by (3), which however poses the further question whether granting the increase in itself was an unlawful interference. The questions thus presented may be pictured more accurately in the light of further facts.\n There is no evidence of labor trouble or employee dissatisfaction prior to May, 1941. On the contrary, for all that appears, relations were peaceful and harmonious. During that spring the A.F. of L. \n3\n put on a campaign to organize all photographic supply stores in New York. In May it got around to Medo. The company had about 70 employees. Of these, about 25 or 26 (including some supervisory employees) were in the shipping and receiving department, doing manual labor in the plant's basement. The others were clerical employees and salesmen, working upstairs. Stoltman, the A.F. of L organizer, started out in May to organize all of Medo's employees in a single unit. Apparently he was not successful upstairs. But by May 23 he had signed up 18 of the downstairs men. He and they then decided to limit the unit to the basement, and requested the employer to negotiate. At the same time the union applied to the Board for certification. There was some short delay, owing to the absence of Medo's president over the Memorial Day holiday. But on June 4, at the Board's arrangement, the first conference concerning recognition was held. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n[321 \nU.S. 678, 690]\n\u00a0\n Several followed between that time and Saturday, June 7, when the employees intervened for themselves.\n At all times Medo showed willingness to negotiate. But it also wished to be sure, as it had both the right and the duty to be, that the unit was appropriate and the union had a majority of the employees. \n5\n Medo further wanted to know something about the terms the union would demand, if recognized; not wishing, as it said, to 'buy a pig in a poke.' All of these things were matters of discussion between Stoltman and various company representatives in the conferences held on June 4 and 5. But it was not until the latter date that Stoltman finally submitted his substantive demands to Medo through Seligsberg, its attorney.\n The Board's findings, in effect, are that on June 5 Seligsberg, in this conference with Stoltman, conceded finally all questions of representation, that is, of appropriateness of the unit and the union's majority status. Hence it concluded Medo then recognized the union as collective agent and, consequently, the only thing remaining for \n\n[321 \nU.S. 678, 691]\n\u00a0\n further discussion was the terms of the collective agreement. This finding is the basis for the Board's conclusion that Medo was guilty of unfair labor practices when it later dealt directly with the employees rather than through the union. Medo, however, says that all three questions remained open for final action by it at the conference scheduled for Monday, June 9, but not held because the employees intervened directly in their own behalf on Saturday, June 7.6\n Seligsberg made particular statements in his conference with Stoltman on June 5 which, if disconnected from the context of the whole conversation and treated as in themselves stating the employer's entire position, could be taken as indicating intention to close the discussion on appropriateness of the unit and the union's majority status. These statements are the Board's only foundation for finding that Medo at any time conceded recognition to the union with finality. In my opinion it would do violence to the facts to regard them as sufficient to sustain these findings. The employer was entitled to a reasonable time for ascertaining the union's status before dealing \n\n[321 \nU.S. 678, 692]\n\u00a0\n with it7 and this had not expired on June 7 or, for that matter, on June 9. 8 Prior to June 5 all questions were open. The conference then was not begun, carried through or concluded with any intention or purpose that understandings which might be reached were or could be taken to be final. Medo's representative was doing a lawyer's job,9 which was to see how far he and Stoltman could agree on terms to be considered by his client as a basis for final decision. They had been successful previously in bringing other employers and employees together in more difficult disputes and the whole intent of their conference was to find a basis of possible agreement upon all matters, including representation,10 for consider- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 678, 693]\n\u00a0\n ation by Medo for its final decision and with a view to further discussion and possible final settlement in the conference agreed upon for June 9. To tear Seligsberg's statements out of this setting and context and make of such tentative understandings or bases of further negotiation final concessions of recognition is to draw inferences wholly unwarranted by the record. It is therefore not at all clear that on June 7 negotiations had passed beyond the stage of recognition or, consequently, that the union then was legally entitled to act as exclusive bargaining agent.\n But even assuming that Medo on June 5, through Seligsberg, conceded recognition, still I cannot agree that it committed any unfair labor practice, under the facts shown here, either in merely hearing what the employees had to say or, after declining to be drawn into discussion of their relations with the union,11 in granting unconditionally their freely made and wholly uncoerced request for an increase in wages. In my view it is immaterial that this, in effect, short-circuited the union, for two reasons. One is that, under the special circumstances, the employees had the right to revoke the designation and did so by undertaking to deal for themselves; the other, which is perhaps but a different way of stating the first, is that the union itself had no right of interest sufficient to prevent them from doing so.\n At most the employer did nothing more than accede to the wishes of a clear majority, both in listening to their request and in granting it. There is no claim or semblance of proof that Medo induced the men to make the \n\n[321 \nU.S. 678, 694]\n\u00a0\n request. On the contrary, it is not disputed that, when they asked for the conference on June 7, the request came unexpectedly to Medo. And when, at the start of the conference the men mentioned the union situation, Medo's general manager, Hoppin, stated at once and flatly that he would not discuss their union affairs or relations with them, clearly implying that this was their business exclusively, not the company's. \n12\n Asked whether he would discuss other matters, he answered affirmatively. The men thereupon said they wanted the increase and there is some evidence they also said unconditionally that they did not want the union. \n13\n The Board, however, has found that they coupled the two statements conditionally, namely, that they did not want the union, if they could have the increase without it.\n The Board concluded that Medo's action on June 9 in granting the increases, though less than what were requested, 'constituted interference with the self-organizational rights of its employees,' on the theory that this influenced them to abandon the union. It also held that the employees' action in approaching the company on June 7 did not 'constitute an implied revocation of their resignation of the Union so as to relieve the respondent of the obligation to deal solely with it,' and therefore dealing directly with them was a violation of Medo's \n\n[321 \nU.S. 678, 695]\n\u00a0\n statutory duty to the union and an unfair labor practice. The Board's theory was, apparently, that the men, to revoke their designation, were required to communicate the revocation to the union and that the union had acquired such an interest or status no other act could terminate the agency, however inconsistent with its continued existence and exclusive character.\n The statute makes no provision that the agency, once created, shall continue for any specific time. It prescribes no particular method for terminating, as it makes none for creating,14 the agency. Greater formality hardly would seem to be required in the one case than in the other. The statute purports to be drawn in favor of protecting the interests of employees, not those of unions as such. \n15\n True, while the agency exists it is exclusive for its appropriate purposes. But it is so only while it does exist and the question here is whether it continued in force after the employees took matters into their own hands and showed to the employer by that act that they wanted to deal for themselves, not through the union.\n The Board implies and the Court says the employer should have declined to discuss with them any matter which was appropriate for collective bargaining, since the union was their agent for this purpose. Therefore, it is concluded, the employer violated their rights under the statute to bargain collectively. This, although it is conceded the twelve employees spoke for 18 of the 25 or 26 \n\n[321 \nU.S. 678, 696]\n\u00a0\n in the unit and it does not appear that what they did was disapproved or repudiated by the other six or seven. Merely to state this proposition should be enough to negate it. For it preserves rights of employees to bargain by representatives of their own choosing by destroying them. In all normal agency relations, except those 'coupled with an interest,'16 The principal can revoke them by exercising the agency himself. \n17\n He need not notify the agent. When he acts on his own behalf, he exhausts the subject matter of the agency and it comes to an end.\n Unless a designated union acquires, by its selection, a thraldom over the men who designate it analogous to the power acquired by one who has a 'power coupled with an interest,' unbreakable and irrevocable by him who gave it, it would seem that any powers the union may acquire by virtue of the designation would end whenever those who confer them and on whose behalf they are to exercised take them back of their own accord into their own hands and exercise them for themselves. And this should be true, whether or not previous notice is given to the union and whether or not the subject matter of the resumption may include, as one consequence of the dealing, the possible continuance of the agency. For it is the very taking back of the right to deal with their employer, not what he does in response to this, unless that creates some new pressure or influence not contemplated in the employees' freely made proposals, that shows the intent to destroy the agency. Dealing for themselves and dealing exclusively through the agent cannot coexist. The \n\n[321 \nU.S. 678, 697]\n\u00a0\n one wholly excludes the other and the real question becomes, which is to prevail, the agent's interest and right or the principal's, the union's or the employees'?\n I do not think Congress intended, by this legislation, to create rights in unions overriding those of the employees they represent. \n18\n Nor did it require a special from or mode for ending a collective agency any more than for creating it. What Congress did was to give the designated union the exclusive right to bargain collectively as long as, and only as long as, a majority of the employees of the unit consent to its doing so. When that majority vanishes by the employees' voluntary action, whatever form this may take, and the fact is made unmistakably clear to the employer, it not only is no longer under duty to deal with the union; it comes under affirmative obligation not to do so. For otherwise it would be dealing with a representative not of the employees' choice.\n There are two possibly applicable limitations. One is that the employer must not interfere to bring about the abandonment. The other is that, in large units, where there are difficult problems of ascertaining whether a majority exists at a particular time, a reasonable degree of stability in employment relations may require, to give the statute workable operation, that a majority designation be deemed to continue for a reasonable period, though changes meanwhile may take away the clearly existing majority, a question not yet finally determined. \n19\n\u00a0\n\n The latter limitation, if it is one, can have no reasonable application to a small unit and a small employer under circumstances like those involved here. In such a situation to impose it, where the actual desires of the majority may be easily and readily ascertained at any time, would \n\n[321 \nU.S. 678, 698]\n\u00a0\n be to force men into unions and into dealing with their employers through unions contrary to the employees' own wishes. The statute has no such purpose.\n But it is said the other limitation applies here, that the employer shall offer no inducement and exert no influence to secure abandonment. This, too, is a salutary principle when properly applied. And it may be applied as well to a small unit and a small employer as to large ones. But again the limitation is not universally applicable. Whether it is applicable or not depends upon what the employer does. Clearly if he stimulates a proposal from the employees to abandon the union for any substantial advantage he may give, the limitation should be effective. But does he do this when, with no suggestion or intimation on his part, when rather he has shown every willingness to leave the whole matter of their organization to his employees and to deal with them in any way they wish, they come to him, without influence, without coercion, and make a proposal wholly of their own conception and desire?\n It is not impossible for men to want wage increases and also to remain or become nonunion men at the same time. Nor is such a combination of desires illegal. When such a proposal is thus made, and the employer does no more than was done here, namely, accede to it, knowing he is dealing with a majority of the unit, saying in effect, 'Whether or not you have a union is your own business, not mine. But whether you do or not, you get the increase you want,' then in my judgment two things have happened: (1) The employees have revoked the collective agency, as they have a right to do; and (2) the employer has been guilty of no unfair labor practice either in hearing their proposal or in acceding to it. He has done no more than comply with the wishes of the majority, freely formed and freely stated. And this it is the employer's duty to do under the statute. If thereby the union has \n\n[321 \nU.S. 678, 699]\n\u00a0\n been by-passed, it is not through the employer's action, but rather through that of the employees. The employer's response, so limited, is not a violation of the principle, recently stated here,20 that individual employees cannot deal with the employer to create terms in the contract of employment inconsistent with the collective agreement. Such a situation presents no case of inconsistent individual bargaining. It involves rather one of collective bargaining, not by individuals as such, but by the majority on behalf of the unit.\n Finally, if more is needed, the matter should be considered in the light of Medo's predicament when the employees made the proposal, account being taken of the alternative courses open to it. Under the Court's ruling it was between the devil and the deep blue sea. There was no answer Medo could give which would not leave it open to a charge and a finding of unfair labor practice. The employees wanted an increase, according to the findings, with the union if they could not get one without it; without the union, if they could. The main thing in their minds was the increase, not the union. \n21\n In effect, according to the findings, they said so to their employer. It had to keep silent or reply. It could reply in several ways: ( 1) The union is your exclusive agent and we cannot deal with you while it is such; (2) we will give you the increase if you discharge the union; do that and then come back; (3) we will give you the increase and you can do as you please about the union; (4) we will not give the raise, union or no union.\n The Court says the company's reply should have been (1), whereas its response actually was (3).22 It finds the \n\n[321 \nU.S. 678, 700]\n\u00a0\n latter bad because in effect it offered 'inducement' to the employees to abandon the union. The trouble is that the same thing would have been true of (1) or of any of the other possible replies. Answers (2) and (4) clearly would constitute unfair labor practices, under the Court's view, the former as offering inducement to abandon, the latter as a flat refusal to bargain through the union or otherwise. Answer (1), while purporting to say only that the employer could not deal with anyone as long as the union retained its exclusive agency, in fact would be infected with two faults. One would be the assumption that the employees could not revoke the agency and take matters back into their own hands, without giving prior notice to the union, a question involved in the issues here. But, even more plainly, by making this response the employer would open itself to the charge and to the finding that it had said, in effect: 'We cannot deal with you directly while the union's agency stands unrevoked,' and thereby had offered, by clear implication, the inducement of dealing with the employees directly, conditioned upon their discharging the union.\n The only other answers open to the employer were (3), the one Medo actually made, and to remain silent. Merely ignoring the employees might have been taken to mean anything, but more probably answer (4) than any other. Silence therefore afforded no escape from the trap. Nor does the Act require silence in such a situation. Consequently answer (3), which Medo gave, was the only one it could give consistently with the view that the employer should hold out no inducement to the employees to abandon the union. In effect it said simply, 'We are perfectly willing you should have the increase. But whether you have it through the union or without it is entirely your own business and we will not have anything to do with this.' Any other reply would have \n\n[321 \nU.S. 678, 701]\n\u00a0\n been a counter-proposal offering inducement to abandon or a rejection of all bargaining. The answer Medo gave was neither. It was merely accession to the employees' wishes, not 'inducement' or offer held out; and it was coupled with the clear indication, under the circumstances, that what the employees might do about the union was wholly their own affair and none of Medo's.\n Accordingly, I think Medo gave the only possible answer consistent with the statute's requirements and purposes and the only one which afforded no substantial basis for finding either that it was refusing to bargain collectively or that it was interfering with the employees' rights of organization by offering inducement to get rid of the union. In my opinion the Wagner Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq., was not designed or intended to put an employer, whose sole purpose and conduct are to give his employees completely free rein in matters of organization and collective bargaining, on such a spot that anything he may do will be, or will form the basis for a finding that it is, an unfair labor practice. So to construe the Act not only would make it a trap for employers, but also would defeat the very purposes the statute was intended to accomplish, by fastening upon employers and employees alike union domination the latter do not want. This would be to destroy, not to safeguard, the employees' basic right of collective bargaining by representatives of their own choosing. I would reverse the judgment with instructions to dismiss the petition for enforcement. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] It has now long been settled that findings of the Board, as with those of other administrative agencies, are conclusive upon reviewing courts when supported by evidence, that the weighing of conflicting evidence is for the Board and not for the courts, that the inferences from the evidence are to be drawn by the Board and not by the courts, save only as questions of law are raised and that upon such questions of law, the experienced judgment of the Board is entitled to great weight. See Franks Bros. Co. v. Labor Board, \n321 \nU.S. 702\n, 64 S.Ct. 817, decided this day; National Labor Relations Board v. Southern Bell Co., \n319 \nU.S. 50, 60\n, 63 S. Ct. 905, 910, and cases cited; National Labor Relations Board v. Nevada Copper Co., \n316 \nU.S. 105, 106\n, 107 S., 62 S.Ct. 960, 961, and cases cited; cf. Dobson v. Commissioner, \n320 \nU.S. 489, 501\n, 64 S.Ct. 239, 246, and cases cited. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] That the Act 'carries the clear implication that employers shall not interfere' with the right of collective bargaining 'by bargaining with individuals or minority groups in their own behalf, after representatives have been picked by the majority to represent all,' was recognized by the reports of the Congressional committees recommending the adoption of the bill which became the National Labor Relations Act. Sen. Rep. No. 573, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 13; H. Rep. No. 1147, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 20. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] We find no evidence in the record that petitioner's representatives stated to the employees either in terms or in substance, 'We will give you the (wage) increases and you can do as you please about the union'. From the evidence, which fully supports the findings, it appears that the employees proposed to petitioner's manager on June 7th that they would leave the union if they were given wage raises; that the manager adjourned the meeting with the employees until June 9th in order to consider the suggested wage increases with petitioner's president. On that date, after considering the matter with the president, the manager announced to the employees that wage increases would be given, and this was immediately followed by the employees' desertion of the union. It also appears that it was petitioner's normal practice to grant wage increases only at the close of the year. From these facts the Board could conclude, as it did, that the purpose and the effect of the wage increases was to induce petitioner's employees to leave the union. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] There was no refusal to bargain with the union until June 9, 1941, after the employer and the employees had reached a full agreement. Cf. note 6 infra. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Cf. note 5 infra. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Acting through the American Federation of Photo Employees Union, Local 21314, of which Stoltman, chief union figure in this case, was president. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] The Board's part in bringing about the conference was due solely to the union's having applied to it for certification simultaneously with the making of its first demand upon Medo to negotiate with it, not to any refusal by Medo to negotiate concerning recognition. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] It felt, as Stoltman did at first, that there should be one unit in the small plant and was fearful of becoming involved in a jurisdictional dispute if the A.F. of L. should organize the unit downstairs and the C.I. O., which was actively organizing such units, should come in and organize the clerical and sales employees working upstairs.\n The union clearly had a majority of the claimed unit from May 23 to June 7, since 18 of the 25 or 26 employees embraced in the unit had signed membership application cards and none had revoked his application or membership in that period.\n The company, however, had to take Stoltman's word for this. It asked him for proof that his union represented a majority, but he declined to submit it, saying he would submit the cards only to a Board representative. The record does not show that Medo ever was given proof that the union had lined up its claimed and actual majority. This was one of the things which, in my opinion, the record shows was held for discussion and determination at the conference scheduled for June 9. Cf. text infra notes 6-10. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] It is undisputed that the employees, entirely of their own motion and without any stimulus or suggestion by Medo, on Saturday morning, June 7, sought a conference with Medo's officials, without disclosing their purpose. The request was granted and the conference held Saturday afternoon. As it opened one of the men mentioned the 'union situation.' But Medo's general manager, Hoppin, at once and flatly declined to discuss that, saying he would discuss anything else. The men then stated their desire for an increase in wages, and not to have the union. They specified the wages sought and Medo's reply, granting them in part, was given the following Monday morning, June 9. On Monday afternoon there was also a conference with Stoltman, but because of the turn events had taken by the employees' intervention it served only as the occasion for notifying him that Medo and the employees had reached agreement and therefore the company would not deal further with the union. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Cf., e.g., North Electric Mfg. Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 6 Cir., 123 F.2d 887; Texarkana Bus Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 8 Cir., 119 F.2d 480, 484. See also National Labor Relations Board v. Union Pacific Stages, Inc., 9 Cir., 99 F.2d 153, 158, 159. \n[\nFootnote 8\n] It is to be recalled that the whole period from demand by the union on Medo to negotiate to the time the employees intervened extended only from May 23 to June 7, and that the period of active negotiation began on June 4. Three days, or even a little more than two weeks, is hardly too much under the circumstances here present to allow an employer for determining whether the union meets the statute's requirements. \n[\nFootnote 9\n] Seligsberg's testimony was: 'That was the purpose of the postponement. They were to bring us proof of representation. We were both to stady the question of the unit, and we were to study it-and when I say 'we,' I mean the employer, because except as to language, I wouldn't know anything about it. They were to study it. Mr. Hoppin and Mr. Goodfield and Mr. Niemeyer, if he were there-which I don't remember-were to study the proposed terms and see how they compared with the possibilities.' ( Emphasis added.) Seligsberg consistently testified that he and Stoltman considered 'all three questions together, proof of majority, proof of unit, and the contract.' He was a director and secretary of the company, but not a shareholder. \n[\nFootnote 10\n] In the conference Seligsberg renewed a previous request for proof that the union had a majority and conditioned the discussion upon the company's being satisfied in this respect and that the unit was appropriate. Cf. note 9 supra. However, Stoltman again refused to exhibit the cards and renewed his offer only to submit them to a Board representative for comparison with Medo's payroll. The record does not show this was ever done, although is my opinion, contrary to the Board's findings, it does show conclusively that the parties contemplated it would be done and that the result of the comparison would be given to Medo before the negotiations should be concluded with finality of recognition. \n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] Cf. note 6 supra. \n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] Cf. note 6 supra. Hoppin's testimony was in response to the question 'What happened after they came to your office?' (on Saturday afternoon): 'They came up and said that, 'We have decided that we don't want to have anything to do with the union.' I immediately stopped them, and I told them that if there was anything at all pertaining to any union activities, I did not want to listen to them at all, but if it was anything else they had to offer, I would be willing to listen to them.' \n[\nFootnote 13\n] Hoppin testified he was told: 'We have one thing that we are primarily interested in. The working conditions here are excellent. We are very happy with our jobs, but we would like to get more money.' \n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] Cf. Lebanon Steel Foundry v. National Labor Relations Board, 76 U. S.App.D.C. 100, 130 F.2d 404. \n[\nFootnote 15\n] Whatever justiciable 'interest' the union may have in continuing to act as the employees' representative, its status as such is for the principal's benefit, not its own, and is terminable at the former's will.

Bair, of Chicago, Ill., for respondent Minneapolis- Honeywell Regulator Co.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought by respondent, Mid-Continent Investment Co., against petitioner, Mercoid Corporation, for contributory infringement of the Cross combination patent No. 1,758,146, issued May 13, 1930, for a domestic heating system. Mercoid in its answer denied contributory infringement and alleged that Mid-Continent should be barred from relief because it was seeking to extend the grant of the patent to unpatented devices. The alleged improper use of the patent was also the basis of a counterclaim filed by Mercoid in which it was averred that Mid-Continent and its exclusive licensee under the patent, respondent Minneapolis- Honeywell Regulator Co., who was brought in as a party plaintiff, had conspired to expand the monopoly of the patent in violation of the anti- trust laws. Mercoid asked not only for declaratory relief but for an accounting and treble damages as well. The District Court found that Mercoid did not contribute to the infringement of the Cross patent; that respondents had conspired to establish a monopoly in an unpatented appliance beyond the scope of the patent and in violation of the anti- trust laws; and that respondents were in no position to maintain the suit because of that conspiracy. Mercoid was granted an injunction but its prayer for damages was denied. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the District Court in disallowing dam- \n\n[320 \nU.S. 661, 663]\n\u00a0\n ages under the counterclaim. In all other respects it reversed that judgment, holding that Mercoid was guilty of contributory infringement under the rule of Leeds & Catlin Co. v. Victor Talking Machine Co., No. 2, \n213 \nU.S. 325\n, 29 S.Ct. 503, and that Carbice Corp. v. American Patents Corp., \n283 \nU.S. 27\n, 51 S.Ct. 334 and Leitch Mfg. Co. v. Barber Co., \n302 \nU.S. 458\n, 58 S.Ct. 288, did not bar recovery as the District Court had thought. 133 F.2d 803. The case is here on a petition for a writ of certiorari which we granted because of the public importance of the questions presented.\n The controversy centers around the license agreement between Mid- Continent and Minneapolis-Honeywell. By that agreement Minneapolis- Honeywell received an exclusive license to make, use, sell, and to sub- license others to make, use, and sell the Cross combination patent No. 1, 758,146. The royalty payments under the license, however, were to be based only upon sales of the combustion stoker switch which was an element of the combination patent embodied in the patented article but which was itself unpatented. The license agreement was construed by the Circuit Court of Appeals to mean that the royalty payments were to be made only on switches used for fire maintenance purposes under the Cross patent. And Minneapolis-Honeywell in advertising its stoker switches stated that the 'right to use' the Cross system patent was 'only granted to the user' when the stoker switches of Minneapolis-Honeywell were purchased from it and used in the system. Neither Mid-Continent nor Minneapolis-Honeywell manufactures or installs heating systems under the Cross combination patent. There was ample evidence to sustain the findings of the District Court that respondents endeavored to use the license agreement so as to prevent the sale or use of combustion stoker switches in these heating systems unless they were the switches made by Minneapolis-Honeywell and purchased from it or its sub-licensees. \n\n[320 \nU.S. 661, 664]\n\u00a0\n The patent is a combination or system patent, covering a domestic heating system which comprises three main elements-a motor driven stoker for feeding fuel to the combustion chamber of a furnace, a room thermostat for controlling the feeding of fuel, and a combustion stoker switch to prevent extinguishment of the fire. The room thermostat functions to supply, or discontinue the supply of, heat by closing or then opening the circuit to the stoker motor at the required temperatures. The combusion stoker switch, or holdfire control, is responsive to a low temperature in the furnace causing the stoker to feed fuel so as to prevent the furnace fire from going out. The control of the combustion stoker switch is said to be effective in mild weather when the room thermostat may not call for heat for a considerable period.\n Mercoid, like Mid-Continent and Minneapolis-Honeywell, does not sell or install the Cross heating system. But the Circuit Court of Appeals found that Mercoid manufactured and sold combustion stoker switches for use in the Cross combination patent. And we may assume that Mercoid did not act innocently. Indeed the Circuit Court of Appeals said that it could find no use for the accused devices other than in the Cross combination patent. And it assumed, as was held in Smith v. Mid-Continent Inv. Co., 8 Cir., 106 F.2d 622, that the Cross patent was valid. But though we assume the validity of the patent and accept fully the findings of the Circuit Court of Appeals, we think the judgment below should be reversed.\n Ever since Henry v. A. B. Dick Co., \n224 \nU.S. 1\n, 32 S.Ct. 364, Ann.Cas.1913D, 880, was overruled by Motion Picture Co. v. Universal Film Co., \n243 \nU.S. 502\n, 37 S.Ct. 416, L.R.A. 1917E, 1187, Ann.Cas.1918A, 959, this Court has consistently held that the owner of a patent may not employ it to secure a limited monopoly of an unpatented material used in applying the invention. Carbice Corp. v. American Patents Corp., supra; Leitch Mfg. Co. v. Barber Co., supra; Morton Salt \n\n[320 \nU.S. 661, 665]\n\u00a0\n Co. v. G. S. Suppiger Co., \n314 \nU.S. 488\n, 62 S.Ct. 402, 404; B. B. Chemical Co. v. Ellis, \n314 \nU.S. 495\n, 62 S.Ct. 406. In those cases both direct and contributory infringement suits were disallowed on a showing that the owner of the patent was using it 'as the effective means of restraining competition with its sale of an unpatented article.' Morton Salt Co. v. G. S. Suppiger Co., supra, 314 U.S. page 490, 62 S.Ct. page 404. The Court has repeatedly held that to allow such suits would be to extend the aid of a court of equity in expanding the patent beyond the legitimate scope of its monopoly. It is true that those cases involved the use of the patent for a machine or process to secure a partial monopoly in supplies consumed in its operation or unpatented materials employed in it. But we can see no difference in principle where the unpatented material or device is itself an integral part of the structure embodying the patent.\n The grant of a patent is the grant of a special privilege 'to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts.' Const., Art. I,  8. It carries, of course, a right to be free from competition in the practice of the invention. But the limits of the patent are narrowly and strictly confined to the precise terms of the grant. Ethyl Gasoline Corp. v. United States, \n309 \nU.S. 436, 456\n, 60 S.Ct. 618, 625; United States v. Univis Lens Co., \n316 \nU.S. 241, 251\n, 62 S.Ct. 1088, 1093. It is the public interest which is dominant in the patent system. Pennock v. Dialogue, 2 Pet. 1; Kendall v. Winsor, 21 How. 322, 329; Adams v. Burke, 17 Wall. 453; Motion Picture Co. v. Universal Film Co., supra, 243 U.S. pages 510, 511, 37 S.Ct. page 418, L.R.A.1917E, 1187, Ann.Cas.1918A, 959; Morton Salt Co. v. G. S. Suppiger Co., supra; United States v. Masonite Corp., \n316 \nU.S. 265, 278\n, 62 S.Ct. 1070, 1077. It is the protection of the public in a system of free enterprise which alike nullifies a patent where any part of it is invalid (Marconi Wireless Co. v. United States, \n320 \nU.S. 1, 58\n, 63 S.Ct. 1393, 1419; and see General Electric Co. v. Wabash Corp., \n304 \nU.S. 364, 372\n, 58 S.Ct. 899, 903) and denies to the patentee after issuance the power to use it in such a way as to acquire a monopoly which is not plainly within \n\n[320 \nU.S. 661, 666]\n\u00a0\n the terms of the grant. The necessities or convenience of the patentee do not justify any use of the monopoly of the patent to create another monopoly. The fact that the patentee has the power to refuse a license does not enable him to enlarge the monopoly of the patent by the expedient of attaching conditions to its use. United States v. Masonite Corp., supra, 316 U.S. page 277, 62 S.Ct. page 1077. The method by which the monopoly is sought to be extended is immaterial. United States v. Univis Lens Co., supra, 316 U.S. pages 251, 252, 62 S.Ct. pages 1093, 1094. The patent is a privilege. But it is a privilege which is conditioned by a public purpose. It results from invention and is limited to the invention which it defines. When the patentee ties something else to his invention, he acts only by virtue of his right as the owner of property to make contracts concerning it and not otherwise. He then is subject to all the limitations upon that right which the general law imposes upon such contracts. The contract is not saved by anything in the patent laws because it relates to the invention. If it were, the mere act of the patentee could make the distinctive claim of the patent attach to something which does not possess the quality of invention. Then the patent would be diverted from its statutory purpose and become a ready instrument for economic control in domains where the anti-trust acts or other laws not the patent statutes define the public policy.\n The instant case is a graphic illustration of the evils of an expansion of the patent monopoly by private engagements. The patent in question embraces furnace assemblies which neither the patentee nor the licensee makes or vends. The struggle is not over a combination patent and the right to make or vend it. The contest is solely over unpatented wares which go into the patented product. Respondents point out that the royalties under the license are measured by the number of unpatented controls which are sold and that no royalty is paid unless a furnace cov- \n\n[320 \nU.S. 661, 667]\n\u00a0\n ered by the patent has been installed. But the fact remains that the competition which is sought to be controlled is not competition in the sale of the patented assembly but merely competition in the sale of the unpatented thermostatic controls. The patent is employed to protect the market for a device on which no patent has been granted. But for the patent such restraint on trade would plainly run afoul of the anti-trust laws. If the restraint is lawful becuase of the patent, the patent will have been expanded by contract. That on which no patent could be obtained would be as effectively protected as if a patent had been issued. Private business would function as its own patent office and impose its own law upon its licensees. It would obtain by contract what letters patent alone may grant. Such a vast power 'to multiply monopolies' at the will of the patentee (Chief Justice White dissenting in Henry v. A. B. Dick Co., supra, 224 U.S. page 53, 32 S.Ct. page 381, Ann.Cas.1913D, 880) would carve out exceptions to the anti-trust laws which Congress has not sanctioned. Mr. Justice Brandeis, speaking for the Court, stated in the Carbice case that 'Control over the supply of such unpatented material is beyond the scope of the patentee's monopoly; and this limitation, inherent in the patent grant, is not dependent upon the peculiar function or character of the unpatented material or on the way in which it is used.' 283 U.S. page 33, 51 S.Ct. page 336. We now add that it makes no difference that the unpatented device is part of the patented whole.\n That result may not be obviated in the present case by calling the combustion stoker switch the 'heart of the invention' or the 'advance in the art'. The patent is for a combination only. Since none of the separate elements of the combination is claimed as the invention, none of them when dealt with separately is protected by the patent monopoly. Leeds & Catlin v. Victor Talking Machine Co. (No. 1), \n213 \nU.S. 301, 318\n, 29 S.Ct. 495, 500. Whether the parts are new or old, the combination is the in- \n\n[320 \nU.S. 661, 668]\n\u00a0\n vention and it is distinct from any of them. See Schumacher v. Cornell, \n96 \nU.S. 549\n, 554; Rowell v. Lindsay, \n113 \nU.S. 97, 101\n, 5 S.Ct. 507, 509. If a limited monopoly over the combustion stoker switch were allowed, it would not be a monopoly accorded inventive genius by the patent laws but a monopoly born of a commercial desire to avoid the rigors of competition fostered by the anti-trust laws. If such an expansion of the patent monopoly could be effected by contract, the integrity of the patent system would be seriously compromised.\n Leeds & Catlin v. Victor Talking Machine Co. (No. 2), supra, is authority for the conclusion that he who sells an unpatented part of a combination patent for use in the assembled machine may be guilty of contributory infringement. The protection which the Court in that case extended to the phonograph record, which was an unpatented part of the patented phonograph, is in substance inconsistent with the view which we have expressed in this case. The rule of the Leeds & Catlin case (No. 2) accordingly must no longer prevail against the defense1 that a combination patent is being used to protect an unpatented part from competition. That result obtains here though we assume for the purposes of this case that Mercoid was a contributory infringer and that respondents could have enjoined the infringement had they not misused the patent for the purpose of monopolizing unpatented material. Inasmuch as their misuse of the patent would have precluded them from enjoining a direct infringement (Mor- \n\n[320 \nU.S. 661, 669]\n\u00a0\n ton Salt Co. v. G. S. Suppiger Co., supra), they cannot stand in any better position with respect to a contributory infringer. Where there is a collision between the principle of the Carbice case and the conventional rules governing either direct or contributory infringement, the former revails.\n The result of this decision, together with those which have preceded it, is to limit substantially the doctrine of contributory infringement. What residuum may be left we need not stop to consider. It is sufficient to say that in whatever posture the issue may be tendered courts of equity will withhold relief where the patentee and those claiming under him are using the patent privilege contrary to the public interest. Morton Salt Co. v. G. S. Suppiger Co., supra, 314 U.S. page 492, 62 S.Ct. page 405.\n There remain the questions of res judicata and Mercoid's right to relief under the counterclaim.\n Respondents point out that Mercoid knew of Mid-Continent's actions and the license agreement prior to 1935 when the earlier suit involving the validity of the Cross patent (Smith v. Mid-Continent Inv. Co., supra) was instituted. They state, and the District Court found, that although Mercoid was not made a party to the earlier suit it provided the defense. The contention therefore is that the doctrine of res judicata binds Mercoid as respects issues which were actually litigated and all issues which might have been raised in that earlier suit. And it is pointed out that among the defense which might have been interposed were those relating to the misuse of the patent and the violations of the anti-trust laws. It is argued, moreover, that although Minneapolis-Honeywell was not a party to the earlier litigation, it is entitled to the benefit of the judgment since its title or claim derives from the patentee. We do not stop to examine the premises on which the argument is based; for though we assume that they are correct, it does not follow that the \n\n[320 \nU.S. 661, 670]\n\u00a0\n doctrine of res judicata forecloses the defense which is tendered.\n Respondents ask the equity court for an injunction against infringement by petitioner of the patent in question and for an accounting. Should such a decree be entered, the Court would be placing its imprimatur on a scheme which involves a misuse of the patent privilege and a violation of the anti-trust laws. It would aid in the consummation of a conspiracy to expand a patent beyond its legitimate scope. But patentees and licensees cannot secure aid from the court to bring such an event to pass, 'unless it is in accordance with policy to grant that help.' Beasley v. Texas & Pacific Ry. Co., \n191 \nU.S. 492, 497\n, 24 S.Ct. 164, 166. And the determination of that policy is not 'at the mercy' of the parties (Id. 191 U.S. page 498, 24 S.Ct., page 166) nor dependent on the usual rules governing the settlement of private litigation. 'Courts of equity may, and frequently do, go much farther both to give and withhold relief in furtherance of the public interest than they are accustomed to go when only private interests are involved.' Virginian Ry. Co. v. System Federation No. 40, \n300 \nU.S. 515, 552\n, 57 S.Ct. 592, 601. 'Where an important public interest would be prejudiced,' the reasons for denying injunctive relief 'may be compelling.' City of Harrisonville v. W. S. Dickey Clay Mfg. Co., \n289 \nU.S. 334, 338\n, 53 S.Ct. 602, 603. And see United States v. Morgan, \n307 \nU.S. 183, 194\n, 59 S.Ct. 795, 801. That is the principle which has led this Court in the past to withhold aid from a patentee in suits for either direct or indirect infringement where the patent was being misused. Morton Salt Co. v. G. S. Suppiger Co., supra, 314 U.S. page 492, 62 S.Ct. page 405. That principle is controlling here. The parties cannot foreclose the courts from the exercise of that discretion by the failure to interpose the same defense in an earlier litigation. Cf. Sola Electric Co. v. Jefferson Electric Co., \n317 \nU.S. 173\n, 63 S.Ct. 172.\n What we have just said does not, of course, dispose of Mercoid's counterclaim for damages. That was based \n\n[320 \nU.S. 661, 671]\n\u00a0\n on  4 of the Clayton Act which provides: 'Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the anti- trust laws may sue therefor in any district court of the United States in the district in which the defendant resides or is found or has an agent, without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee.' 38 Stat. 731, 15 U.S.C.  15, 15 U.S.C.A.  15. Though Mercoid were barred in the present case from asserting any defense which might have been interposed in the earlier litigation, it would not follow that its counterclaim for damages would likewise be barred. That claim for damages is more than a defense; it is a separate statutory cause of action. The fact that it might have been asserted as a counterclaim in the prior suit by reason of Rule 13(b) of the Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c, does not mean that the failure to do so renders the prior judgment res judicata as respects it. Virginia-Carolina Chemical Co. v. Kirven, \n215 \nU.S. 252\n, 30 S.Ct. 78; Larsen v. Northland Transportation Co., \n292 \nU.S. 20\n, 54 S.Ct. 584. And see Scott, Collateral Estoppel by Judgment, 56 Harv.L.Rev. 1, 26-28; Restatement of the Law of Judgments,  58. The case is then governed by the principle that where the second cause of action between the parties is upon a different claim the prior judgment is res judicata not as to issues which might have been tendered but 'only as to those matters in issue or points controverted, upon the determination of which the finding or verdict was rendered.' Cromwell v. County of Sac, \n94 \nU.S. 351\n, 353. And see Russell v. Place, \n94 \nU.S. 606\n. It was held in Fleitmann v. Welsbach Street Lighting Co., \n240 \nU.S. 27\n, 36 S.Ct. 233, that the statutory liability in question may be enforced only through the verdict of a jury in a court of common law. But there is no reason under the Rules of Civil Procedure why that may not be done under this counterclaim. Rules 12(h), 13, 38, 42(b). Whether the evi- \n\n[320 \nU.S. 661, 672]\n\u00a0\n dence will show damages within the rule of Story Parchment Co. v. Paterson Co., \n282 \nU.S. 555\n, 51 S.Ct. 248, is of course a distinct question on which we intimate no opinion.\n We have mentioned the statutory claim for damages because both the District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals denied that relief. But since the cause must be remanded to the District Court, we think the question whether res judicata bars any other part of the relief sought by the counterclaim may appropriately be reserved for it.\nREVERSED.\n Opinion of Mr. Justice BLACK.\n Although I entirely agree with the Court's judgments and the grounds on which they rest, I find it necessary to add a few remarks in order that silence may not be understood as acquiescence in the views expressed in the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER. There is no inclination on my part to challenge the wisdom of the established practice whereby we do not discuss issues in the abstract. As I see, it, that salutary practice has no application to the Court's discussion of contributory infringement in the present case. The court below rested its decision on what it considered to be a doctrine of contributory infringement, and counsel for respondent have discussed and relied upon it here. The Court's opinion demonstrates that the subject cannot be ignored since at least one element of the 'complicated idea' which is 'compressed' in the judicially created 'formula' of contributory infringement clashes head-on with elements of the Carbice doctrine.\n But my disagreement with this dissenting opinion runs much deeper than the mere question of whether the Court has here discussed the so- called formula of contributory infringement at an improper or inopportune time. It seems to me that the judicial error of discussing abstract \n\n[320 \nU.S. 661, 673]\n\u00a0\n questions is slight compared to the error of interpreting legislative enactments on the basis of a court's preconceived views on 'morals' and 'ethics.'\n If there is such a wrong as contributory infringement, it must have been created by the federal patent statutes. Since they make no direct mention of such a wrong, its existence could only be rested on inferences as to Congressional intent. In searching for Congressional intent we ordinarily look to such sources as statutory language and legislative history. The dissent in question mentions neither of these guides; in fact, it mentions no statute at all. Instead, the chief reliance appears to be upon the law of torts, a quotation from a decision of a lower federal court which held that no infringement was shown, and the writer's personal views on 'morals' and 'ethics.' Not one of these references, unless it be the latter, throws enough light on the patent statutes to justify its use in construing these statutes as creating, in addition to a right of recovery for infringement, a more expansive right judicially characterized as a 'formula' of 'contributory infringement.' And for judges to rest their interpretation of statutes on nothing but their own conceptions of 'morals' and 'ethics' is, to say the least, dangerous business.\n If the present case compelled consideration of the morals and ethics of contributory infringement, I should be most reluctant to conclude that the scales of moral value are weighted against the right of producers to sell their unpatented goods in a free market. At least since Adam Smith wrote, unhampered competition has not generally been considered immoral. While there have been objections to the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, 15 U.S.C.A .  1-7, 15 note, few if any of the objectors have questioned its morality.\n It has long been recognized that a socially undesirable practice may seek acceptance under the guise of conventional moral symbols. And repeated judicial assertion \n\n[320 \nU.S. 661, 674]\n\u00a0\n that a bad practice is hallowed by morals may, if unchallenged, help it to receive the acceptance which it seeks. With this in mind, I wish to make explicit my protest against talking about the judicial doctrine of 'contributory infringement' as though it were entitled to the same respect as a universally recognized moral truth.\n Mr. Justice MURPHY concurs in this opinion.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS.\n First. I agree that the patentee may not extend his exclusive statutory right to make, use, and vend by forbidding one practicing the invention from using in such practice an unpatented article susceptible to such use. He may not obtain an injunction against such user for infringement. This is a pure question of the extent of the right of exclusion conferred by the patent statute. \n1\n It nowise involves the antitrust acts. A patent is property and it may, like other property, be so used as to violate those acts,2 but that is not this case.\n Second. I think the opinion may create confusion respecting contributory infringement. The court below, thinking the doctrine of the Carbice and Leitch cases inapplicable, necessarily concluded that the user of the system infringed the patent if he used any thermostat other than that manufactured by respondent's exclusive licensee. But those cases show that so to do would not constitute infringement of the patent. And if the purchaser and user could not be amerced as an infringer certainly one who sold to him with the purpose that he should use the thermostat cannot be amerced for contributing to a non-existent infringement. One may disagree with the \n\n[320 \nU.S. 661, 675]\n\u00a0\n decision of this court in Leeds & Catlin Co. v. Victor Talking Machine Co., \n213 \nU.S. 325\n, 29 S.Ct. 503, that the substitution by the user of the talking machine of a record not made by the licensor constituted an infringement of the patent, but, accepting the premise that such conduct was infringement, one who participated in it by knowingly and intentionally selling records to the user became an aider and participant in the infringement and, as such, liable to the owner of the patent. I cannot believe that the court's opinion is intended to lay down a different principle.\n Third. I disagree with the application of the rule res judicata to one phase of the litigation. Mercoid defended an earlier suit brought by the respondent against a user of the patented combination who bought and installed as part of the system a Mercoid thermostat. Confessedly the defense now asserted under the Carbice doctrine was available, was not made, and judgment of validity and infringement was entered.\n I fail to see what great question of public interest or public policy is violated by holding that one to whom a defense was available, in rebuttal of a claim broader than was warranted by the statute on which the plaintiff's right was founded, is bound by the judgment rendered. That judgment stands unreversed. The defense, if made, as it could have been, would have benefited the defendant in its pocketbook. We are now told that a misconstruction of the patent law by a licensor is so violent and flagrant a flouting of the public interest that a court of equity must hold its hand for the benefit of a defendant whenever he chooses to invoke that interest for his private benefit, though he has failed to make the defense in an earlier litigation and stands of record an infringer. If a wrong against the public has been perpetrated it may be redressed at the instance of the representatives of government. \n\n[320 \nU.S. 661, 676]\n\u00a0\n I can only speculate as to the results of such a holding. If applicable here, I cannot see why the principle should not apply to every suit or action based upon, or arising out of, statutory provisions, and to every defense bottomed on public policy, whether expressed in statute or not. Surely the defendant in the earlier suit, after the decree against him became final, could not have defended a charge of contempt for disobeying the decree on the ground now asserted. And if the judgment concluded him thus directly, I cannot agree that he may now disregard it or collaterally attack it. And confessedly Mercoid stands in his shoes. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n I should affirm the judgment.\n Mr. Justice REED joins in this opinion.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER, dissenting.\n The Court holds in effect that the owner of a patent who exacts, as the condition of a license, that unpatented materials used in connection with the invention shall be purchased only from the licensor cannot obtain relief from equity against one who supplies such unpatented materials even though the unpatented appliance was not for common use but was designedly adapted for the practice of the invention, but when so used did not involve an infringement of the patent. The decision is thus merely an appropriate application of what has come to be known as the doctrine in the Carbice case, \n283 \nU.S. 27\n, 51 S.Ct. 334. In this view I concur.\n But in the series of cases in which that doctrine has heretofore been applied (Motion Picture Co. v. Universal Film Co., \n243 \nU.S. 502\n, 37 S.Ct. 416, L.R.A. 1917E, 1187, Ann.Cas.1918A, 959; Carbice Corp. v. Am. Patents Corp., supra; Morton Salt Co. v. Suppiger Co., 314 \n\n[320 \nU.S. 661, 677]\n\u00a0\n U.S. 488, 62 S.Ct. 402; B.B. Chemical Co. v. Ellis, \n314 \nU.S. 495\n, 62 S.Ct. 406), not once has this Court found it relevant to reject either explicitly or by indirection, another doctrine of the law, that of contributory infringement, nor has it seen fit to make animadversions upon it. This is so doubtless for the simple reason that appropriate occasions for relief against contributory infringement are unrelated to the circumstances which bring the Carbice doctrine into play. In a word, if there is no infringement of a patent there can be no contributory infringer.\n Within its true limits the idea of contributory infringement was woven into the fabric of our law and has been part of it for now more than seventy years. See Roberts, Contributory Infringement of Patent Rights, 12 Harv.L.Rev. 35, and e.g. Thomson-Houston Electric Co. v. Ohio Brass Co., 6 Cir., 80 F. 712. The doctrine has been put perhaps most simply by Judge Shepley: 'Different parties may all infringe, by respectively making or selling, each of them, one of the elements of a patented combination, provided those separate elements are made for the purpose, and with the intent, of their being combined by a party having no right to combine them. But the mere manufacture of a separate element of a patented combination, unless such manufacture be proved to have been conducted for the purpose, and with the intent of aiding infringement, is not, in and of itself, infringement.' Saxe v. Hammond, 21 Fed.Cas. 593, No. 12,411, 1 Ban. & A. 629, 632. So understood, the doctrine of contributory infringement is an expression both of law and morals. It is but one phase of a more comprehending doctrine of legal liability enforced by this Court both in civil and criminal cases. See, for instance, American Bank & Trust Co. v. Federal Reserve Bank, \n256 \nU.S. 350\n, 41 S.Ct. 499, and Direct Sales Co. v. United States, \n319 \nU.S. 703\n, 63 S.Ct. 1265. Indeed, the opinion in the Carbice case explicitly recognizes a proper scope for the doctrine of contributory infringement as a phase of the \n\n[320 \nU.S. 661, 678]\n\u00a0\n law of torts: 'Infringement, whether direct or contributory, is essentially a tort, and implies invasion of some right of the patentee.' Carbice Corp. v. Am. Patents Corp., \n283 \nU.S. 27, 33\n, 51 S.Ct. 334, 336.\n To be sure, the doctrine of contributory infringement may be misconceived and has been misapplied. That is the fate of all shorthand statements of complicated ideas, whether in law or in the natural sciences. But the misapplication of a formula into which a complicated idea is compressed and thereby mutilated is a poor excuse for rejecting the idea. It will be time enough to define the appropriate limits of the doctrine of contributory infringement when we are required to deal with the problem. Until then litigants and lower courts ought not to be embarrassed by gratuitous innuendoes against a principle of the law which, within its proper bounds, is accredited by legal history as well as ethics. The long and on the whole not unworthy history of our judicial administration admonishes us against expressing views on matters not before us. The history of this Court especially admonishes us against the evils of giving opinions not called for. See e.g. Hughes, The Supreme Court of the United States, p. 50, and 49 Harv.L.Rev. 68, 98. The duty of not going beyond the necessities of a case is not a lifeless technicality. The experience of centuries is behind the wisdom of not deciding, whether explicitly or by atmospheric pressure, matters that do not come to the Court with the impact of necessity.\n For the reasons set forth by my brother ROBERTS, res judicata calls for affirmance.\n\n Mr. Justice JACKSON, in dissent.\n'A patent,' said Mr. Justice Holmes, 'is property carried to the highest degree of abstraction-a right in rem to exclude, without a physical object or content.' \n1\n Here the \n\n[320 \nU.S. 661, 679]\n\u00a0\n patent covers a combination-a system-a sequence-which is said to be new, although every element and factor in it is old and unpatentable. Thus we have an abstract right in an abstruse relationship between things in which individually there is no right-a legal concept which either is very profound or almost unintelligible, I cannot be quite sure which.\n\n Undoubtedly the man who first devised a thermostat to control the flow of electric energy gave something to the world. But one who merely carried it to a new location, or used two instead of one, or three instead of two, or used it to control current for a stoker motor rather than for a damper, did not do much that I would not expect of a good mechanic familiar with the instrument. But that question of validity is not here. I assume that this patent confers some rights and ask what they are.\n Of course the abstract right to the 'sequence' has little economic importance unless its monopoly comprehends not only the arrangement but some, at least, of its components. If the patentee may not exclude competitors from making and vending strategic unpatented elements such as the thermostat, adapted to use in the combination, the patented system is so vulnerable to competition as to be almost worthless. On the other hand, if he may prohibit such competition, his system patent gathers up into its monopoly devices long known to the art and hence not themselves subject to any patent.\n It is suggested that such a patent should protect the patentee at least against one who knowingly and intentionally builds a device for use in the combination and vends it for that purpose. That is what appears to have been done here. As to ethics, the parties seem to me as much on a parity as the pot and the kettle. But want of knowledge or innocent intent is not ordinarily available to diminish patent protection. I do not see how intent can \n\n[320 \nU.S. 661, 680]\n\u00a0\n make infringement of what otherwise is not. The less legal rights depend on someone's state of mind, the better.\n The practical issue is whether we will leave such a combination patent with little value indeed or whether we will give it value by projecting its economic effects to elements not by themselves a part of its legal monopoly. In these circumstances I think we should protect the patent owner in the enjoyment of just what he has been granted-an abstract right in an abstruse combination-worth whatever such a totality may be worth. I see no constitutional or statutory authority for giving it additional value by bringing into its monopoly all or any of the unpatentable parts.\n For these reasons I agree with the Court that no case of infringement could have been made out had the issue been raised when it was timely. But I agree with the views of the doctrine of res adjudicata expressed by Mr. Justice ROBERTS and for that reason join the dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Court in that case did not refer to the doctrine of misuse of a patent. That doctrine indeed was developed in this Court some years later as shown by the Motion Picture case. The record in the Leeds & Catlin case indicates that the point which we deem crucial in the instant case was adverted to only obliquely in the briefs. The Court was chiefly concerned with the proposition that a substitution or renewal of an unpatented element of a combination patent, as distinguished from its repair, is a 'reconstruction' of the combination. 213 U.S. pages 333, 336, 29 S.Ct. pages 505, 506. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Carbice Corp. v.

Wilkinson, of Chicago, Ill., for petitioner.\n Mr. Will Freeman, of Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These are companion cases to Mercoid Corp. v. Mid-Continent Investment Co., \n320 \nU.S. 661\n, 64 S.Ct. 268, decided this day. One suit was instituted by petitioner, the other by respondent. Petitioner sought a declaratory judgment to the effect that the Freeman patent No. 1,813,732 was invalid and that petitioner did not infringe it, that respondent had used the Freeman patent in violation of the anti-trust laws, that respondent be restrained from threatening petitioner and its customers with infringement suits, that an accounting be had and treble damages awarded. Respondent in its bill sought a decree sustaining the validity of the Freeman patent and declaring that petitioner had infringed and contributed to the infringement of its claims. In the latter action petitioner filed a counterclaim praying for substantially the same relief as in its earlier bill. After issues were joined the causes were consolidated and tried together. The District Court said that the Freeman patent was valid and that Mercoid was guilty of contributory infringement. But it held that Minneapolis-Honeywell was using the patent as a means of controlling an unpatented device contrary to the rule of Morton Salt Co. v. G. S. Suppiger Co., \n314 \nU.S. 488\n, 62 S.Ct. 402. Accordingly, it dismissed both complaints. 43 F.Supp. 878. On appeal the Circuit Court of Appeals held that the patent claims in issue were valid and that Mercoid had infringed them. But it disagreed with the District Court that respondent had sought to extend the scope of the patent in violation of the anti-trust Laws. Accordingly, it reversed the judgment of the District Court, dismissing respondent's bill \n\n[320 \nU.S. 680, 682]\n\u00a0\n and affirmed it as respects the relief claimed by petitioner. 7 Cir., 133 F.2d 811.\n The Freeman patent, as found below, covers a system of hot air furnace control which requires three thermostats for its operation. A room thermostat starts the stoker. Another thermostat (or limit switch) breaks the stoker circuit when the air in the furnace reaches a predetermined temperature, irrespective of the fact that the room thermostat may still call for heat. This second thermostat operates to prevent unsafe conditions due to overheating. The third thermostat is also in the furnace. It controls a fan which forces hot air from the furnace to the rooms. It does not permit the fan to start until the air in the furnace reaches a specified degree of heat. But at that point it starts the fan which continues to run, even though the limit switch has stopped the stoker, so long as the furnace is hot and the room thermostat calls for heat. The District Court found that the Freeman patent was a combination patent on a system of furnace control which requires those three thermostats for its operation and that it was not a patent on 'either the fan switch or the limit switch or both of them.' (43 F.Supp. 881.) That finding was not disturbed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, (133 F.2d 813) which held that Freeman's 'advance in the art' was the arrangement of thermostatic switches, subject to furnace heat to secure in connection with other parts the 'sequence of operations' which we have described.\n Minneapolis-Honeywell has licensed five of its manufacturing competitors under the Freeman patent. The licensees are granted a non- exclusive right under the patent to make, use and sell a 'combination furnace control' which is defined as a thermostatic switch usable for a Freeman installation and designed in one unit to control the fan and limit circuits. Royalty payments to Minneapolis-Honeywell are based on the sales of the combination furnace controls, although the Circuit Court of Appeals found that the only Minneapolis-Honeywell con- \n\n[320 \nU.S. 680, 683]\n\u00a0\n trol 'which gets protection as a result of the licenses is the control usable only for a Freeman type installation.' Each licensee is required to insert in its catalogues or other sales literature and to attach to each combination furnace control sold a notice to the effect that the control includes a license for one installation of the Freeman heating system. The licenses establish minimum prices for the sale of the controls; and those prices must not be cut by the licensees through the inclusion of 'extras' or through the reduction of charges for services. Price lists are attached governing sales to manufacturers, jobbers, wholesalers, and dealers. Equal terms to all licensees are provided. Minneapolis-Honeywell tried on several occasions to induce Mercoid to take a license. Being unsuccessful it brought its present suit.\n Neither the petitioner nor the respondent sells or installs the Freeman system in furnaces; that is to say, they do not practice the invention. They are competitors in supplying the switch to control the fan and limit circuits employed in such systems. That switch or combustion furnace control is unpatented1 and respondent concedes that it is 'less than the complete claimed invention.' But, as we have said, the Circuit Court of Appeals took the view that that control provides 'the sequence of operations which is the precise essence of Freeman's advance in the art.' And the accused device has, according to the Circuit Court of Appeals, 'no other use than for accomplishing the sequence of operations of the Freeman patent.' The Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that although the combustion furnace control was unpatented, it served 'to distinguish the invention' and to mark the 'advance in the art' achieved by the Freeman patent. It accordingly \n\n[320 \nU.S. 680, 684]\n\u00a0\n held that the patent laws permit and the anti-trust laws do not forbid the control over the sale and use of the unpatented device which Minneapolis- Honeywell sought to achieve through its licensing agreements. We do not agree, even though we assume the patent to be valid.\n The fact that an unpatented part of a combination patent may distinguish the invention does not draw to it the privileges of a patent. That may be done only in the manner provided by law. However worthy it may be, however essential to the patent, an unpatented part of a combination patent is no more entitled to monopolistic protection than any other unpatented device. For as we pointed out in Mercoid v. Mid-Continent Investment Co., supra, a patent on a combination is a patent on the assembled or functioning whole, not on the separate parts. The legality of any attempt to bring unpatented goods within the protection of the patent is measured by the anti-trust laws not by the patent law. For the reasons stated in Mercoid v. Mid-Continent Investment Co., supra, the effort here made to control competition in this unpatented device plainly violates the anti-trust laws, even apart from the price-fixing provisions of the license agreements. It follows that petitioner is entitled to be relieved against the consequences of those acts. It likewise follows that respondent may not obtain from a court of equity any decree which directly or indirectly helps it to subvert the public policy which underlies the grant of its patent.

However, they failed to file a timely bill of exceptions in the District Court. Thereafter they applied to the Circuit Court of Appeals for an order granting them 'the right to have a Bill of Exceptions' and for additional time in which to settle and file it. This application was denied without opinion or explanation. When the case subsequently came before another division of judges of that court for argument on the merits, petitioners renewed their request for permission to file a bill. This was, in effect, a motion for rehearing of the decision of the first division of judges of the court. Counsel was then allowed by the court to leave with it, but not to file, a copy of the reporter's transcript of the evidence 'in order that we might assure ourselves that no fundamental injustice had been done by the previous denial of an extension, and that we would not, because of the absence of a bill of exceptions, be affirming a conviction which was not properly an offense under the Act.' 139 F.2d at page 969, note 1. The court then treated the case as though the transcript were properly before it and sustained petitioners' conviction on the merits. Having reached the conclusion that there was no merit in petitioners' con- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 369, 371]\n\u00a0\n tentions and that the result would have been the same had a bill of exceptions been filed, the court refused to permit the 'purported' transcript to be filed. No other reason was given for this refusal.\n Petitioners have raised before us the propriety of the action of the court below, claiming that they thereby have been prevented from urging and arguing certain assignments of error which they wished to urge. It is clear from Rule IV of the Criminal Appeals Rules2 that the Circuit Court of Appeals has the right to exercise sound judicial discretion in supervising and controlling the proceedings on appeal. Ray v. United States, \n301 \nU.S. 158, 166\n, 167 S., 57 S.Ct. 700, 704; Forte v. United States, \n302 \nU.S. 220, 223\n, 58 S.Ct. 180; Kay v. United States, \n303 \nU.S. 1, 9\n, 10 S., 58 S.Ct. 468, 472, 473; Miller v. United States, \n317 \nU.S. 192, 199\n, 601 S., 63 S.Ct. 187, 191. This includes the right to grant or deny belated applications for permission to file bills of exceptions. And the court's action in the matter is not reviewable in this Court absent a clear abuse of discretion.\n But under the peculiar circumstances of this case it is unnecessary to determine whether the court below abused its discretion in refusing to allow a bill to be filed. When that court examined the transcript of the evidence and conclusively adjudicated the merits, it accomplished in substance all that would have been achieved if the formality of filing the transcript had occurred and the court had then passed upon the merits. In order that petitioners shall not be unfairly deprived of the right to seek a review of that court's determination of the merits, we may consider the court's action as in effect having approved the filing of the transcript as a bill of exceptions. A copy of the transcript has been lodged with the Clerk of this Court and no question has been raised as to its correctness or completeness. In accordance with the Government's suggestion and in the exercise of our supervisory \n\n[322 \nU.S. 369, 372]\n\u00a0\n appellate power, we shall treat the transcript as a part of the record before us and consider the case on its merits.\n The petitioners, man and wife, operated a house of prostitution in Grand Island, Nebraska. In 1940 they planned an automobile trip to Salt Lake City, Utah, in order to visit Mrs. Mortensen's parents. Two girls who were employed by petitioners as prostitutes asked to be taken along for a vacation and the Mortensens agreed to their request. They motored to Yellowstone National Park and then on to Salt Lake City, where they all stayed at a tourist camp for four or five days. They visited Mrs. Mortensen's parents and, in addition, the girls 'went to shows and around in the parks' and saw various other parts of the city. The four then returned in petitioners' automobile to Grand Island; on arrival they drove immediately to petitioners' house of ill fame and retired to their respective rooms. The following day one of the girls resumed her activities as a prostitute in petitioners' employ, while the other did not resume such activities for a week or ten days because of illness. Both girls continued to act as prostitutes for petitioners for a year or more after their return from Salt Lake City.\n It is undisputed that this was purely a vacation trip, with the two girls paying their own living expenses and petitioners bearing the expenses of transportation. One of the girls had offered to help pay for the transportation, but petitioners refused on the ground that the cost would remain the same even if the girls did not accompany them. No acts of prostitution or other immorality occurred during the two-week trip and there was no discussion of such acts during the course of the journey. Both girls testified that during the trip they gave no consideration to their work as prostitutes and made no plans to abandon such activities. There was also uncontradicted evidence that the two girls were under no obligation or compulsion of any kind to return to Grand Island to work for petition- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 369, 373]\n\u00a0\n ers. They were free at any time before, during or after the vacation excursion to leave petitioners' employ and engage in their own pursuits. Both girls claimed that Grand Island was their residence, one of them testifying that she boarded her child with a family in that city.\n Petitioners were charged in two counts with violating Section 2 of the Mann Act in that they transported and caused to be transported, and aided and assisted in obtaining transportation for and in transporting, two girls in interstate commerce from Salt Lake City to Grand Island for the purpose of prostitution and debauchery, and with intent to induce, entice and compel the girls to give themselves up to debauchery and to engage in immoral practices. The jury was charged that purpose was an essential ingredient of the crime and that if the jury found that the transportation from Salt Lake City to Grand Island was planned with no immoral purpose, no crime was committed. The jury was also told that, to convict, it must find that the Government had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that petitioners transported the girls from Salt Lake City to Grand Island for the purpose of prostitution and debauchery. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on both counts. This conviction was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals under circumstances previously described.\n The primary issue before us is whether there was any evidence from which the jury could rightly find that petitioners transported the girls from Salt Lake City to Grand Island for an immoral purpose in violation of the Mann Act.\n The penalties of Section 2 of the Act are directed at those who knowingly transport in interstate commerce 'any woman or girl for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose, or with the intent and purpose to induce, entice, or compel such woman or girl to become a prostitute or to give herself up to debauchery, \n\n[322 \nU.S. 369, 374]\n\u00a0\n or to engage in any other immoral practice.' The statute thus aims to penalize only those who use interstate commerce with a view toward accomplishing the unlawful purposes. To constitute a violation of the Act, it is essential that the interstate transportation have for its object or be the means of effecting or facilitating the proscribed activities. Hansen v. Haff, \n291 \nU.S. 559, 563\n, 54 S.Ct. 494, 495. An intention that the women or girls shall engage in the conduct outlawed by Section 2 must be found to exist before the conclusion of the interstate journey and must be the dominant motive of such interstate movement. And the transportation must be designed to bring about such result. Without that necessary intention and motivation, immoral conduct during or following the journey is insufficient to subject the transporter to the penalties of the Act.\n Since the issue as to whether petitioners intended that the two girls should resume their immoral conduct on their return to Grand Island and transported them in interstate commerce for that purpose was submitted to the jury with appropriate instructions we would normally be precluded from reviewing or disturbing the inferences of fact drawn from the evidence by the jury. But we have never hesitated to examine a record to determine whether there was any competent and substantial evidence fairly tending to support the verdict. Cf. Abrams v. United States, \n250 \nU.S. 616, 619\n, 40 S. Ct. 17, 18. Our examination of the record in this case convinces us that there was a complete lack of relevant evidence from which the jury could properly find or infer, beyond a reasonable doubt, that petitioners transported the girls in interstate commerce 'for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery' within the meaning of the Mann Act.\n It may be assumed that petitioners anticipated that the two girls would resume their activities as prostitutes upon their return to Grand Island. But we do not think it is \n\n[322 \nU.S. 369, 375]\n\u00a0\n fair or permissible under the evidence adduced to infer that this interstate vacation trip, or any part of it, was undertaken by petitioners for the purpose of, or as a means of effecting or facilitating, such activities. The sole purpose of the journey from beginning to end was to provide innocent recreation and a holiday for petitioners and the two girls. It was a complete break or interlude in the operation of petitioners' house of ill fame and was entirely disassociated therefrom. There was no evidence that any immoral acts occurred on the journey or that petitioners forced the girls against their will to return to Grand Island for immoral purposes. What Congress has outlawed by the Mann Act, however, is the use of interstate commerce as a calculated means for effectuating sexual immorality. In ordinary speech an interstate trip undertaken for an innocent vacation purpose constitutes the use of interstate commerce for that innocent purpose. Such a trip does not lose that meaning when viewed in light of a criminal statute outlawing interstate trips for immoral purposes.\n The fact that the two girls actually resumed their immoral practices after their return to Grand Island does not, standing alone, operate to inject a retroactive illegal purpose into the return trip to Grand Island. Nor does it justify an arbitrary splitting of the round trip into two parts so as to permit an inference that the purpose of the drive to Salt Lake City was innocent while the purpose of the homeward journey to Grand Island was criminal. The return journey under the circumstances of this case cannot be considered apart from its integral relation with the innocent round trip as a whole. There is no evidence of any change in the purpose of the trip during its course. If innocent when it began it remained so until it ended. Guilt or innocence does not turn merely on the direction of travel during part of a trip not undertaken for immoral ends. If the return journey was illegal, so was the out- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 369, 376]\n\u00a0\n going one since all intended, from the beginning, to end the journey where it began, at Grand Island. The outward leg of the trip was interstate transportation. Yet it was not charged, and could not well be, that proof of this part of the trip was a violation of the Act. It differed in no respect from the other part, except in the direction of travel. That is not enough to make the first part innocent, the last part illegal. Criminal intent and purpose must be grounded on something less ingenious than that which is necessary to sustain a finding of such a purpose in making the return interstate journey to Grand Island. 'People not of good moral character, like others, travel from place to place and change their residence. But to say that because they indulge in illegal or immoral acts, they travel for that purpose, is to emphasize that which is incidental and ignore what is of primary significance.' Hansen v. Haff, supra, 291 U.S. at pages 562, 563, 54 S.Ct. 495. Cf. Ex parte Rocha, D.C., 30 F.2d 823.\n An artificial and unrealistic view of the nature and purpose of the return journey to Grand Island is necessary to sustain this conviction. But we are unwilling to sanction the application of the Mann Act in a manner that is so manifestly unfair. Whatever their faults, petitioners are entitled to have just and fair treatment under the law and not to be punished for transporting girls in interstate commerce for a purpose wholly different from any of the purposes condemned by Congress.\n We do not here question or reconsider any previous construction placed on the Act which may have led the federal government into areas of regulation not originally contemplated by Congress. But experience with the administration of the law admonishes us against adding another chapter of statutory construction and application which would have a similar effect and which would make possible even further justification of the fear expressed at the time of the adoption of the legislation that its broad provisions 'are liable to furnish boundless opportunity to \n\n[322 \nU.S. 369, 377]\n\u00a0\n hold up and blackmail and make unnecessary trouble, without any corresponding benefits to society.' \n3\n\u00a0\n\n To punish those who transport inmates of a house of prostitution on an innocent vacation trip in no way related to the practice of their commercial vice is consistent neither with the purpose nor with the language of the Act. Congress was attempting primarily to eliminate the 'white slave' business which uses interstate and foreign commerce as a means of procuring and distributing its victims and 'to prevent panderers and procurers from compelling thousands of women and girls against their will and desire to enter and continue in a life of prostitution.' \n4\n Such clearly was not the situation revealed by the facts of this case. To accomplish its purpose the statute enumerates the prohibited acts in broad language capable of application beyond that intended by the legislative framers. But even such broad language is conditioned upon the use of interstate transportation for the purpose of, or as a means of effecting or facilitating, the commission of the illegal acts. Here the interstate round trip had no such purpose and was in no way related to the subsequent immoralities in Grand Island. In short, we perceive no statutory purpose or language which prohibits petitioners under these circumstances from using interstate transportation for a vacation or for any other innocent purpose.\n The judgment of the court below is reversed.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE.\n Mr. Justice BLACK, Mr. Justice REED, Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and I think the judgment should be affirmed.\n Courts have no more concern with the policy and wisdom of the Mann Act, 18 U.S.C.A.  397 et seq., than of the Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. A.  151 et seq., or \n\n[322 \nU.S. 369, 378]\n\u00a0\n any other which Congress may constitutionally adopt. Those are matters for Congress to determine, not the courts. Congress, in enacting the Mann Act, declared in unmistakable terms that any person who should transport across state lines 'any woman ... for the purpose of prostitution ... or with the intent and purpose to induce ... such woman ... to give herself up to debauchery, or to engage in any other immoral practice ... shall be deemed guilty of a felony.' 18 U.S.C.A.  398.\n The fact that petitioners, who were engaged in an established business of operating a house of prostitution in Nebraska, took some of its women inmates on a transient and innocent vacation trip to other states, is in no way incompatible with the conclusion that petitioners, in bringing them back to Nebraska, purposed and intended that they should resume there the practice of commercial vice, which in fact they did promptly resume in petitioners' establishment. The record is without evidence that they engaged, or intended to engage in any other activities in Nebraska, or that anything other than the practice of their profession was the object of their return. For this reason the case is controlled by Lapina v. Williams, \n232 \nU.S. 78\n, 34 S.Ct. 196, rather than by Hansen v. Haff, \n291 \nU.S. 559\n, 54 S.Ct. 494. The jury was properly instructed, its verdict is supported by ample evidence, and the two courts below rightly sustained it. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of June 25, 1910,  2, 36 Stat. 825, 18 U.S.C.  398, 18 U.S.C.

Respondents' contention that they were not required to bargain because the newsboys are not their 'employees' within the meaning of that term in the National Labor Relations Act, 49 Stat. 450, 29 U.S.C.  152, 29 U.S.C.A.  152,1 presents the important question which we granted certiorari2 to resolve. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 111, 114]\n\u00a0\n The proceedings before the National Labor Relations Board were begun with the filing of four petitions for investigation and certification3 by Los Angeles Newsboys Local Industrial Union No. 75. Hearings were held in a consolidated proceeding4 after which the Board made findings of fact and concluded that the regular full-time newsboys selling each paper were employees within the Act and that questions affecting commerce concerning the representation of employees had arisen. It designated appropriate units and ordered elections. 28 N.L.R.B. 1006.5 At these the union was selected as their representative by majorities of the eligible newsboys. After the union was appropriately certified. 33 N.L.R.B. 941, 36 N.L.R.B. 285, the respondents refused to bargain with it. Thereupon proceedings under Section 10, 49 Stat. 453-455, 29 U.S.C.  160, 29 U.S.C.A.  160, were instituted, a hearing6 was held and respondents were found to have violated Section 8(1) and (5) of the Act, 49 Stat. 452, 453, 29 U.S.C.  158(1), (5), 29 U.S.C.A.  158(1, 5). They were ordered to cease and desist from such violations and to bargain collectively with the union upon request. 39 N.L.R.B. 1245, 1256.\n Upon respondents' petitions for review and the Board's petitions for enforcement, the Circuit Court of Appeals, one judge dissenting, set aside the Board's orders. Re- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 111, 115]\n\u00a0\n jecting the Board's analysis, the court independently examined the question whether the newsboys are employees within the Act, decided that the statute imports common-law standards to determine that question, and held the newsboys are not employees. 136 F.2d 608.\n The findings of the Board disclose that the Los Angeles Times and the Los Angeles Examiner, published daily and Sunday,7 are morning papers. Each publishes several editions which are distributed on the streets during the evening before their dateline, between about 6:00 or 6:30 p.m. and 1:00 a.m., and other editions distributed during the following morning until about 10:00 o'clock. The Los Angeles Evening Herald and Express, published every day but Sunday, is an evening paper, which has six editions on the presses between 9:00 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. \n8\n The News, also published every day but Sunday, is a twenty-four hour paper with ten editions. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n The papers are distributed to the ultimate consumer through a variety of channels, including independent dealers and newsstands often attached to drug, grocery or confectionery stores, carriers who make home deliveries, and newsboys who sell on the streets of the city and its suburbs. Only the last of these are involved in this case.\n The newsboys work under varying terms and conditions. They may be 'bootjackers,' selling to the general public at places other than established corners, or they may sell \n\n[322 \nU.S. 111, 116]\n\u00a0\n at fixed 'spots.' They may sell only casually or part-time, or full-time; and they may be employed regularly and continuously or only temporarily. The units which the Board determined to be appropriate are composed of those who sell full-time at established spots. Those vendors, misnamed boys, are generally mature men, dependent upon the proceeds of their sales for their sustenance, and frequently supporters of families. Working thus as news vendors on a regular basis often for a number of years, they form a stable group with relatively little turnover, in contrast to schoolboys and others who sell as bootjackers, temporary and casual distributors.\n Over-all circulation and distribution of the papers are under the general supervision of circulation managers. But for purposes of street distribution each paper has divided metropolitan Los Angeles into geographic districts. Each district is under the direct and close supervision of a district manager. His function in the mechanics of distribution is to supply the newsboys in his district with papers which he obtains from the publisher and to turn over to the publisher the receipts which he collects from their sales, either directly or with the assistance of 'checkmen' or 'main spot' boys. \n10\n The latter, stationed at the important corners or 'spots' in the district, are newsboys who, among other things, receive delivery of the papers, redistribute them to other newsboys stationed at less important corners, and collect receipts from their sales. \n11\n For that service, which occupies a minor portion \n\n[322 \nU.S. 111, 117]\n\u00a0\n of their working day, the checkmen receive a small salary from the publisher. \n12\n The bulk of their day, however, they spend in hawking papers at their 'spots' like other full-time newsboys. A large part of the appropriate units selected by the Board for the News and the Herald are checkmen who, in that capacity, clearly are employees of those papers.\n The newsbodys' compensation consists in the difference between the prices at which they sell the papers and the prices they pay for them. The former are fixed by the publishers and the latter are fixed either by the publishers or, in the case of the News, by the district manager. \n13\n In practice the newsboys receive their papers on credit. They pay for those sold either sometime during or after the close of their selling day, returning for credit all unsold papers. \n14\n Lost or otherwise unreturned papers, however, must be paid for as though sold. Not only is the 'profit' per paper thus effectively fixed by the publisher, but substantial control of the newsboys' total 'take home' can be effected through the ability to designate their sales areas and the power to determine the number of papers allocated to each. While as a practical matter this power is not exercised fully, the newsboys' 'right' to decide how many papers they will take is also not absolute. In practice, the Board found, they cannot determine the size of their established order without the cooperation of the district manager. And often the number of papers they must take is determined unilaterally by the district managers.\n In addition to effectively fixing the compensation, respondents in a variety of ways prescribe, if not the \n\n[322 \nU.S. 111, 118]\n\u00a0\n minutiae of daily activities, at least the broad terms and conditions of work. This is accomplished largely through the supervisory efforts of the district managers, who serve as the nexus between the publishers and the newsboys. \n15\n The district managers assign 'spots' or corners to which the newsboys are expected to confine their selling activities. 16 Transfers from one 'spot' to another may be ordered by the district manager for reasons of discipline or efficiency or other cause. Transportation to the spots from the newspaper building is offered by each of respondents. Hours of work on the spots are determined not simply by the impersonal pressures of the market, but to a real extent by explicit instructions from the district managers. Adherence to the prescribed hours is observed closely by the district managers or other supervisory agents of the publishers. Sanctions, varying in severity \n\n[322 \nU.S. 111, 119]\n\u00a0\n from reprimand to dismissal, are visited on the tardy and the delinquent. By similar supervisory controls minimum standards of diligence and good conduct while at work are sought to be enforced. However wide may be the latitude for individual initiative beyond those standards, district managers' instructions in what the publishers apparently regard as helpful sales technique are expected to be followed. Such varied items as the manner of displaying the paper, of emphasizing current features and headlines, and of placing advertising placards, or the advantages of soliciting customers at specific stores or in the traffic lanes are among the subjects of this instruction. Moreover, newsboys are furnished with sales equipment, such as racks, boxes and change aprons, and advertising placards by the publishers. In this pattern of employment the Board found that the newsboys are an integral part of the publishers' distribution system and circulation organization. And the record discloses that the newsboys and checkmen feel they are employees of the papers and respondents' supervisory employees, if not respondents themselves, regard them as such.\n In addition to questioning the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain these findings, respondents point to a number of other attributes characterizing their relationship with the newboys17 and urge that on the entire \n\n[322 \nU.S. 111, 120]\n\u00a0\n record the latter cannot be considered their employees. They base this conclusion on the argument that by common-law standards the extent of their control and direction of the newsboys' working activities creates no more than an 'independent contractor' relationship and that common-law standards determine the 'employee' relationship under the Act. They further urge that the Board's selection of a collective bargaining unit is neither appropriate nor supported by substantial evidence. \n18\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n I.\n\n\n The principal question is whether the newsboys are 'employees.' Because Congress did not explicitly define the term, respondents say its meaning must be determined by reference to common-law standards. In their view 'common-law standards' are those the courts have applied in distinguishing between 'employees' and 'independent contractors' when working out various problems unrelated to the Wagner Act's purposes and provisions.\n The argument assumes that there is some simple, uniform and easily applicable test which the courts have used, in dealing with such problems, to determine whether persons doing work for others fall in one class or the other. Unfortunately this is not true. Only by a long and tortuous history was the simple formulation worked out which has been stated most frequently as 'the test' for deciding whether one who hires another is responsible in tort for his wrongdoing. \n19\n But this formula has been by no means \n\n[322 \nU.S. 111, 121]\n\u00a0\n exclusively controlling in the solution of other problems. And its simplicity has been illusory because it is more largely simplicity of formulation than of application. Few problems in the law have given greater variety of application and conflict in results than the cases arising in the borderland between what is clearly an employer-employee relationship and what is clearly one of independent entrepreneurial dealing. \n20\n This is true within the limited field of determining vicarious liability in tort. It becomes more so when the field is expanded to include all of the possible applications of the distinction.\n It is hardly necessary to stress particular instances of these variations or to empha size that they have arisen principally, first, in the struggle of the courts to work out common-law liabilities where the legislature has given no guides for judgment,21 more recently also under statutes which have posed the same problem for solution in the light of the enactment's particular terms and purposes. \n22\n\u00a0\n\n[322 \nU.S. 111, 122]\n\u00a0\n It is enough to point out that, with reference to an identical problem, results may be contrary over a very considerable region of doubt in applying the distinction, depending upon the state or jurisdiction where the determination is made;23 and that within a single jurisdiction a person who, for instance, is held to be an 'independent contractor' for the purpose of imposing vicarious liability in tort may be an 'employee' for the purposes of particular legislation, such as unemployment compensation. See, e.g., Globe Grain & Milling Co. v. Industrial Commn., 98 Utah 36, 91 P.2d 512. In short, the assumed simplicity and uniformity, resulting from application of 'common-law standards,' does not exist.\n Mere reference to these possible variations as characterizing the application of the Wagner Act in the treatment of persons identically situated in the facts surrounding their employment and in the influences tending to disrupt it, would be enough to require pause before accepting a thesis which would introduce them into its administration. This would be true, even if the statute itself had indicated less clearly than it does the intent they should not apply.\n Two possible consequences could follow. One would be to refer the decision of who are employees to local state law. The alternative would be to make it turn on a sort of pervading general essence distilled from state law. Congress obviously did not intend the former result. It \n\n[322 \nU.S. 111, 123]\n\u00a0\n would introduce variations into the statute's operation as wide as the differences the forty-eight states and other local jurisdictions make in applying the distinction for wholly different purposes. Persons who might be 'employees' in one state would be 'independent contractors' in another. They would be within or without the statute's protection depending not on whether their situation falls factually within the ambit Congress had in mind, but upon the accidents of the location of their work and the attitude of the particular local jurisdiction in casting doubtful cases one way or the other. Persons working across state lines might fall in one class or the other, possibly both, depending on whether the Board and the courts would be required to give effect to the law of one state or of the adjoining one, or to that of each in relation to the portion of the work done within its borders.\n Both the terms and the purposes of the statute, as well as the legislative history, show that Congress had in mind no such patchwork plan for securing freedom of employees' organization and of collective bargaining. The Wagner Act is federal legislation, administered by a national agency, intended to solve a national problem on a national scale. Cf. e.g., Sen. Rep. No. 573, 74th Cong., 1st Sess. 2-4. It is an Act, therefore, in reference to which it is not only proper, but necessary for us to assume, 'in the absence of a plain indication to the contrary, that Congress ... is not making the application of the federal act dependent on state law.' Jerome v. United States, \n318 \nU.S. 101, 104\n, 63 S.Ct. 483, 485. Nothing in the statute's background, history, terms or purposes indicates its scope is to be limited by such varying local conceptions, either statutory or judicial, or that it is to be administered in accordance with whatever different standards the respective states may see fit to adopt for the disposition of unrelated, local problems. Consequently, so far as the meaning of 'employee' in this statute is concerned, 'the federal law must prevail no matter what name is given to the interest or \n\n[322 \nU.S. 111, 124]\n\u00a0\n right by state law.' Morgan v. Commissioner, \n309 \nU.S. 78, 81\n, 626 S., 60 S.Ct. 424, 426, 1035; cf. National Labor Relations Board v. Blount, 131 F.2d 585 (C.C.A.).\n\n\n II.\n\n\n Whether, given the intended national uniformity, the term 'employee' includes such workers as these newsboys must be answered primarily from the history, terms and purposes of the legislation. The word 'is not treated by Congress as a word of art having a definite meaning ....' Rather 'it takes color from its surroundings ... (in) the statute where it appears,' United States v. American Trucking Associations, Inc., \n310 \nU.S. 534, 545\n, 60 S.Ct. 1059, 1065, and derives meaning from the context of that statute, which 'must be read in the light of the mischief to be corrected and the end to be attained.' South Chicago Coal & Dock Co. v. Bassett, \n309 \nU.S. 251, 259\n, 60 S.Ct. 544, 549; cf. New Negro Alliance v. Sanitary Grocery Co., \n303 \nU.S. 552\n, \n304 \nU.S. 542\n, 58 S.Ct. 703; Milk Wagon Drivers' Union Local No. 753 v. Lake Valley Farm Products, Inc., \n311 \nU.S. 91\n, 61 S.Ct. 122.\n Congress, on the one hand, was not thinking solely of the immediate technical relation of employer and employee. It had in mind at least some other persons than those standing in the proximate legal relation of employee to the particular employer involved in the labor dispute. \n24\n It cannot be taken, however, that the purpose was to include all other persons who may perform service for another or was to ignore entirely legal classifications made for other purposes. Congress had in mind a wider field than the narrow technical legal relation of 'master and servant,' as the common law had worked this out in all its variations, and at the same time a narrower one than the entire area of rendering service to others. The question comes down therefore to how much was included of the inter- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 111, 125]\n\u00a0\n mediate region between what is clearly and unequivocally 'employment,' by any appropriate test, and what is as clearly entrepreneurial enterprise and not employment.\n It will not do, for deciding this question as one of uniform national application, to import wholesale the traditional common-law conceptions or some distilled essence of their local variations as exclusively controlling limitations upon the scope of the statute's effectiveness. To do this would be merely to select some of the local, hairline variations for nation-wide application and thus to reject others for coverage under the Act. That result hardly would be consistent with the statute's broad terms and purposes.\n Congress was not seeking to solve the nationally harassing problems with which the statute deals by solutions only partially effective. It rather sought to find a broad solution, one that would bring industrial peace by substituting, so far as its power could reach, the rights of workers to self-organization and collective bargaining for the industrial strife which prevails where these rights are not effectively established. Yet only partial solutions would be provided if large segments of workers about whose technical legal position such local differences exist should be wholly excluded from coverage by reason of such differences. Yet that result could not be avoided, if choice must be made among them and controlled by them in deciding who are 'employees' within the Act's meaning. Enmeshed in such distinctions, the administration of the statute soon might become encumbered by the same sort of technical legal refinement as has characterized the long evolution of the employee- independent contractor dichotomy in the courts for other purposes. The consequences would be ultimately to defeat, in part at least, the achievement of the statute's objectives. Congress no more intended to \n\n[322 \nU.S. 111, 126]\n\u00a0\n import this mass of technicality as a controlling 'standard' for uniform national application than to refer decision of the question outright to the local law.\n The Act, as its first section states, was designed to avert the 'substantial obstructions to the free flow of commerce' which result from 'strikes and other forms of industrial strife or unrest' by eliminating the causes of that unrest. It is premised on explicit findings that strikes and industrial strife themselves result in large measure from the refusal of employers to bargain collectively and the inability of individual workers to bargain successfully for improvements in their 'wages, hours, or other working conditions' with employers who are 'organized in the corporate or other forms of ownership association.' Hence the avowed and interrelated purposes of the Act are to encourage collective bargaining and to remedy the individual worker's inequality of bargaining power by 'protecting the exercise ... of full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of their own choosing, for the purpose of negotiating the terms and conditions of their employment or other mutual aid or protection.' 49 Stat. 449, 450, 29 U.S.C.A.  151.\n The mischief at which the Act is aimed and the remedies it offers are not confined exclusively to 'employees' within the traditional legal distinctions separating them from 'independent contractors.' Myriad forms of service relationship, with infinite and subtle variations in the terms of employment, blanket the nation's economy. Some are within this Act, others beyond its coverage. Large numbers will fall clearly on one side or on the other, by whatever test may be applied. But intermediate there will be many, the incidents of whose employment partake in part of the one group, in part of the other, in varying proportions of weight. And consequently the legal pendulum, for purposes of applying the statute, may swing one way \n\n[322 \nU.S. 111, 127]\n\u00a0\n or the other, depending upon the weight of this balance and its relation to the special purpose at hand.\n Unless the common-law tests are to be imported and made exclusively controlling, without regard to the statute's purposes, it cannot be irrelevant that the particular workers in these cases are subject, as a matter of economic fact, to the evils the statute was designed to eradicate and that the remedies it affords are appropriate for preventing them or curing their harmful effects in the special situation. Interruption of commerce through strikes and unrest may stem as well from labor disputes between some who, for other purposes, are technically 'independent contractors' and their employers as from disputes between persons who, for those purposes, are 'employees' and their employers. Cf. Milk Wagon Drivers' Union Local No. 753 v. Lake Valley Farm Products, Inc., \n311 \nU.S. 91\n, 61 S.Ct. 122. Inequality of bargaining power in controversies over wages, hours and working conditions may as well characterize the status of the one group as of the other. The former, when acting alone, may be as 'helpless in dealing with an employer,' as 'dependent ... on his daily wage' and as 'unable to leave the employ and to resist arbitrary and unfair treatment' as the latter. For each, 'union ... (may be) essential to give ... opportunity to deal on equality with their employer.' \n25\n And for each, collective bargaining may be appropriate and effective for the 'friendly adjustment of industrial disputes arising out of differences as to wages, hours, or other working conditions.' \n26\n 49 Stat. 449, 29 U.S.C.A.  151. In \n\n[322 \nU.S. 111, 128]\n\u00a0\n short, when the particular situation of employment combines these characteristics, so that the economic facts of the relation make it more nearly one of employment than of independent business enterprise with respect to the ends sought to be accomplished by the legislation, those characteristics may outweigh technical legal classification for purposes unrelated to the statute's objectives and bring the relation within its protections.\n To eliminate the causes of labor disputes and industrial strife, Congress thought it necessary to create a balance of forces in certain types of economic relationships. These do not embrace simply employment associations in which controversies could be limited to disputes over proper 'physical conduct in the performance of the service.' \n27\n On the contrary, Congress recognized those economic relationships cannot be fitted neatly into the containers designated 'employee' and 'employer' which an earlier law had shaped for different purposes. Its Reports on the bill disclose clearly the understanding that 'employers and employees not in proximate relationship may be drawn into common controversies by economic forces,'28 and that the very disputes sought to be avoided might involve \n\n[322 \nU.S. 111, 129]\n\u00a0\n 'employees (who) are at times brought into an economic relationship with employers who are not their employers.' \n29\n In this light, the broad language of the Act's definitions, which in terms reject conventional limitations on such conceptions as 'employee,' 'employer,' and 'labor dispute,' 30 leaves no doubt that its applicability is to be determined broadly, in doubtful situations, by underlying economic facts rather than technically and exclusively by previously established legal classifications. Cf. National Labor Relations Board v. Blount, supra.\n Hence 'technical concepts pertinent to an employer's legal responsibility to third persons for the acts of his servants' have been rejected in various applications of this Act both here (International Association of Machinists v. National Labor Relations Board, \n311 \nU.S. 72, 80\n, 81 S., 61 S.Ct. 83 88, 89; H. J. Heinz Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, \n311 \nU.S. 514, 520\n, 521 S., 61 S.Ct. 320, 323) 31 and in other federal courts (National Labor Relations Board v. Condenser Corporation of America, 3 Cir., 128 F.2d 67; North Whittier Heights Citrus Ass'n v. National Labor Relations Board, 9 Cir., 109 F.2d 76, 82; National Labor Relations Board v. Blount, supra). There is no good reason for invoking them to restrict the scope of the term 'employee' sought to be done in this case. That term, like other provisions, must be understood with reference to the purpose of the Act and the facts involved in the economic relationship. \n32\n 'Where all the conditions of the relation require protection, protection ought to be given.' \n33\n\u00a0\n\n[322 \nU.S. 111, 130]\n\u00a0\n It is not necessary in this case to make a completely definitive limitation around the term 'employee.' That task has been assigned primarily to the agency created by Congress to administer the Act. Determination of 'where all the conditions of the relation require protection' involves inquiries for the Board charged with this duty. Everyday experience in the administration of the statute gives it familiarity with the circumstances and backgrounds of employment relationships in various industries, with the abilities and needs of the workers for self organization and collective action, and with the adaptability of collective bargaining for the peaceful settlement of their disputes with their employers. The experience thus acquired must be brought frequently to bear on the question who is an employee under the Act. Resolving that question, like determining whether unfair labor practices have been committed, 'belongs to the usual administrative routine' of the Board. \n34\n Gray v. Powell, \n314 \nU.S. 402, 411\n, 62 S.Ct. 326, 332. Cf. National Labor Relations Board v. Standard Oil Co., 7 Cir., 138 F.2d 885, 887, 888.\n In making that body's determinations as to the facts in these matters conclusive, if supported by evidence, Congress entrusted to it primarily the decision whether the evidence establishes the material facts. Hence in reviewing the Board's ultimate conclusions, it is not the court's function to substitute its own inferences of fact for the Board's, when the latter have support in the record. National Labor Relations Board v. Nevada Consolidated Copper Corp., \n316 \nU.S. 105\n, 62 S.Ct. 960; cf. Walker v. Altmeyer, 2 Cir., 137 F.2d 531. Undoubtedly questions of statutory interpretation, especially when arising in the first instance in judicial proceedings, are for \n\n[322 \nU.S. 111, 131]\n\u00a0\n the courts to resolve, giving appropriate weight to the judgment of those whose special duty is to administer the questioned statute. Norwegian Nitrogen Products Co. v. United States, \n288 \nU.S. 294\n, 53 S.Ct. 350; United States v. American Trucking Associations, Inc., \n310 \nU.S. 534\n, 60 S.Ct. 1059. But where the question is one of specific application of a broad statutory term in a proceeding in which the agency administering the statute must determine it initially, the reviewing court's function is limited. Like the commissioner's determination under the Longshoremen's & Harbor Workers' Act,35 that a man is not a 'member of a crew' (South Chicago Coal & Dock Co. v. Bassett, \n309 \nU.S. 251\n, 60 S.Ct. 544, 547) or that he was injured 'in the course of his employment' (Parker v. Motor Boat Sales, Inc., \n314 \nU.S. 244\n, 62 S.Ct. 221, 222) and the Federal Communications Commission's determination36 that one company is under the 'control' of another (Rochester Telephone Corp. v. United States, \n307 \nU.S. 125\n, 59 S.Ct. 754), the Board's determination that specified persons are 'employees' under this Act is to be accepted if it has 'warrant in the record' and a reasonable basis in law.\n In this case the Board found that the designated newsboys work continuously and regularly, rely upon their earnings for the support of themselves and their families, and have their total wages influenced in large measure by the publishers who dictate their buying and selling prices, fix their markets and control their supply of papers. Their hours of work and their efforts on the job are supervised and to some extent prescribed by the publishers or their agents. Much of their sales equipment and advertising materials is furnished by the publishers with the intention that it be used for the publisher's benefit. Stating that 'the primary consideration in the determination of the applicability of the statutory definition is whether \n\n[322 \nU.S. 111, 132]\n\u00a0\n effectuation of the declared policy and purposes of the Act comprehend securing to the individual the rights guaranteed and protection afforded by the Act,' the Board concluded that the newsboys are employees. The record sustains the Board's findings and there is ample basis in the law for its conclusion.\n\n\n III.\n\n\n The Board's selection of the collective bargaining units also must be upheld. The units chosen for the News and the Herald consist of all full- time37 newsboys and checkmen engaged to sell the papers in Los Angeles. Bootjackers, temporary, casual and part-time38 newsboys are excluded. The units designated for the Times and the Examiner consist of newsboys selling at established spots39 in Los Angeles40 four or more hours per day five or more days per week, except temporary newsboys. \n41\n\u00a0\n\n The Board predicated its designations in part upon the finding that the units included, in general, men who were responsible workers, continuously and regularly employed as vendors and dependent upon their sales for their liveli- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 111, 133]\n\u00a0\n hood, while schoolboys and transient or casual workers were excluded. The discretion which Congress vested in the Board to determine an appropriate unit is hardly overstepped by the choice of a unit based on a distinction so clearly consistent with the need for responsible bargaining. That the Board's selection emphasizes difference in tenure rather than function is, on this record certainly, no abuse of discretion.\n Nor is there substance in the objection that the Board's designations on the one hand fail to embrace all workers who in fact come within the responsible or stable full-time category generically stated, and on the other hand fail to exclude all who in fact come within the schoolboy or more volatile part-time category. The record does not suggest that the units designated, at least so far as Los Angeles newsboys are concerned, do not substantially effectuate the Board's theory or embrace a large portion of those who would make up a stable bargaining group based on responsible tenure and full-time work. In these matters the Board cannot be held to mathematical precision. If it chooses to couch its orders in terms which for good reasons it regards effective to accomplish its stated ends, peripheral or hypothetical deviations will not defeat an otherwise appropriate order.\n Another objection urged by the Times, the Herald and the Examiner is to the Board's exclusion of suburban newsboys42 from the units on the ground they were not organized by the union. The Board found that although all vendors in metropolitan Los Angeles were eligible for membership, the union had not been extended to the suburban groups generally and that no other labor organization was seeking to represent respondents' employees. There is no suggestion either that the union deliberately \n\n[322 \nU.S. 111, 134]\n\u00a0\n excluded suburban newsboys who sought admission or that suburban newsboys have displayed any interest in collective bargaining or self-organization.\n Wide variations in the forms of employee self-organization and the complexities of modern industrial organization make difficult the use of inflexible rules as the test of an appropriate unit. Congress was informed of the need for flexibility in shaping the unit to the particular case43 and accordingly gave the Board wide discretion in the matter. Its choice of a unit is limited specifically only by the requirement that it be an 'employer unit, craft unit, plant unit, or subdivision thereof' and that the selection be made so as 'to insure to employees the full benefit of their right to self-organization and to collective bargaining, and otherwise to effectuate the policies of this Act.' Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, \n313 \nU.S. 146\n, 61 S.Ct. 908, 912. The flexibility which Congress thus permitted has characterized the Board's administration of the section and has led it to resort to a wide variety of factors in case-to-case determination of the appropriate unit. \n44\n Among the considerations to which it has given weight is the extent of organization of the union requesting certification or collective bargaining. This is done on the expressed theory that it is desirable in the determination of an appropriate unit to render collective bargaining of the company's employees an immediate possibility. 45 No \n\n[322 \nU.S. 111, 135]\n\u00a0\n plausible reason is suggested for withholding the benefits of the Act from those here seeking it until a group of geographically separated employees becomes interested in collective bargaining. In the circumstances disclosed by this record we cannot say the Board's conclusions are lacking in a 'rational basis.'\n The judgment are reversed and the causes are remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Mr. Justice REED concurs in the result. He is of the opinion that the test of coverage for employees is that announced by the Board in the matter of Stockholders Publishing Company, Inc., and Los Angeles Newsboys Local Industrial Union No. 75, C.I.O., and other similar cases, decided January 9, 1941, 28 N.L.R.B. 1006, 1022, 1023.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS.\n I think the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be affirmed. The opinion of that court reported in 136 F.2d 608, seems to me adequately to state the controlling facts and correctly to deal with the question of law presented for decision. I should not add anything were it not for certain arguments presented here and apparently accepted by the court.\n I think it plain that newsboys are not 'employees' of the respondents within the meaning and intent of the National Labor Relations Act. When Congress, in  2(3), 29 U.S.C.A.  152(3), said: 'The term 'employee' shall include any employee, ...' it stated as clearly as language could do it that the provisions of the Act were to extend to those who, as a result of decades of tradition which had become part of the common understanding of our people, bear the named relationship. Clearly also Congress did not dele- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 111, 136]\n\u00a0\n gate to the National Labor Relations Board the function of defining the relationship of employment so as to promote what the Board understood to be the underlying purpose of the statute. The question who is an employee, so as to make the statute applicable to him, is a question of the meaning of the Act and, therefore, is a judicial and not an administrative question.\n I do not think that the court below suggested that the federal courts sitting in the various states must determine whether a given person is an employee by application of either the local statutes or local state decisions. Quite the contrary. As a result of common law development, many prescriptions of federal statutes take on meaning which is uniformly ascribed to them by the federal courts, irrespective of local variance. Funk v. United States, \n290 \nU.S. 371\n, 54 S.Ct. 212, 93 A.L.R. 1136. This court has repeatedly resorted to just such considerations in defining the very term 'employee' as used in other federal statutes, as the opinion of the court below shows. There is a general and prevailing rule throughout the Union as to the indicia of employment and the criteria of one's status as employee. Unquestionably it was to this common, general, and prevailing understanding that Congress referred in the statute and, according to that understanding, the facts stated in the opinion below, and in that of this court, in my judgment, demonstrate that the newsboys were not employees of the newspapers.\n It is urged that the Act uses the term in some loose and unusual sense such as justifies the Board's decision because Congress added to the definition of employee above quoted these further words: 'and shall not be limited to the employees of a particular employer, unless the Act explicitly states otherwise, ....' The suggestion seems to be that Congress intended that the term employee should mean those who were not in fact employees, but it \n\n[322 \nU.S. 111, 137]\n\u00a0\n is perfectly evident, not only from the provisions of the Act as a whole but from the Senate Committee's Report, that this phrase was added to prevent any misconception of the provisions whereby employees were to be allowed freely to combine and to be represented in collective bargaining by the representatives of their union. Congress intended to make it clear that employee organizations did not have to be organizations of the employees of any single employer. But that qualifying phrase means no more than this and was never intended to permit the Board to designate as employees those who, in traditional understanding, have no such status. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 2(3) of the Act provides that 'The term 'employee' shall include any employee, and shall not be limited to the employees of a particular employer, unless the Act explicitly states otherwise, and shall include any individual whose work has ceased as a consequence of, or in connection with, any current labor dispute or because of any unfair labor practice, and who has not obtained any other regular and substantially equivalent employment, but shall not include any individual employed as an agricultural laborer, or in the domestic service of any family or person at his home, or any individual employed by his parent or spouse.' \n[\nFootnote 2\n] \n320 \nU.S. 728\n, 64 S.Ct. 88. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Pursuant to Section 9(b) and (c) of the Act, 49 Stat. 453, 29 U.S.C .  159(b) and (c), 29 U.S.C.A.  159(b, c). \n[\nFootnote 4\n] Although it treated the four representation petitions in one consolidated proceeding and disposed of them in one opinion, the Board did not consider evidence with respect to one publisher as applicable to any of the others. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] Subsequently those orders were amended in various details. 29 N.L.R. B. 94, 95; 30 N.L.R.B. 696, 697; 31 N.L.R.B. 697. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] The record in the representation proceeding was in effect incorporated in the complaint proceeding. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] The Times' daily circulation is about 220,000 and its Sunday circulation is about 368,000. The Examiner's daily circulation is about 214,000 and its Sunday circulation is about 566,000. \n[\nFootnote 8\n] The Herald has a circulation of about 243,000. Both it and the Examiner are owned by Hearst Publications, Inc. \n[\nFootnote 9\n] The News has a circulation of about 195,000. Its first three and seventh editions are consigned for the most part to route delivery or suburban dealers. Its fourth edition, which goes to press at 2:45 a.m., is sold in the city during the mornings. The remaining editions, which go to press at regular intervals between 9:50 a.m and 5:00 p.m., are sold in the city during the afternoons. \n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] The Examiner, The Herald, and The News all employ 'main spot' boys or checkmen; the Times does not. \n[\nFootnote 11\n] The Times district managers deliver the papers directly to the newsboys and collect directly from them. On the other papers district managers may deliver bundles of papers to the checkmen or directly to the newsboys themselves. The Times customarily transports its newsboys to their 'spots' from the Times building, where they first report and pick up their papers. The other respondents offer similar transportation to those of their newsboys who desire it. \n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] In the case of the Examiner these 'main spot' boys, although performing services similar to those of checkmen, are less closely knit to the publisher and sometimes receive no compensation for their services. \n[\nFootnote 13\n] See infra, note 15. \n[\nFootnote 14\n] Newsboys selling the Herald in one residential area do not receive credit for all unsold papers. \n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] Admittedly the Times, Examiner, and Herald district managers are employees of their respective papers. While the News urged earnestly that its managers are not its employees, the Board found otherwise. They do not operate on a formal salary basis but they receive guaranteed minimum payments which the Board found are 'no more than a fixed salary bearing another label.' And while they, rather than the publisher, fix the price of the paper to the newsboy, the Board found, on substantial evidence, that they function for the News in specified districts, distribute racks, aprons, advertising placards from the News to the newsboys, give instructions as to their use, supervise the redistributing activities of the checkmen (themselves clearly employees of the News), and hand out News checks to the checkmen for their services. On this and other evidence suggesting that however different may be their formal arrangements, News district managers bear substantially the same relation to the publisher on one hand and the newsboys on the other as do the other district managers, the Board concluded that they were employees of the paper. \n[\nFootnote 16\n] Although from time to time these 'spots' are bought and sold among the vendors themselves, without objection by district managers and publishers, this in no way negates the need for the district managers' implicit approval of a spotholder or their authority to remove vendors from their 'spots' for reasons of discipline or efficiency. \n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] E.g., that there is either no evidence in the record to show, or the record explicitly negatives, that respondents carry the newsboys on their payrolls, pay 'salaries' to them, keep records of their sales or locations, or register them as 'employees' with the Social Security Board, or that the newsboys are covered by workmen's compensation insurance of the California Compensation Act. Furthermore, it is urged the record shows that the newsboys all sell newspapers, periodicals and other items not furnished to them by their respective publishers, assume the risk for papers lost, stolen or destroyed, purchase and sell their 'spots,' hire assistants and relief men and make arrangements among themselves for the sale of competing or left-over papers. \n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] They have abandoned here the contention, made in the circuit court, that the Act does not reach their controversies with the newsboys because they do not affect commerce. \n[\nFootnote 19\n] The so-called 'control test' with which common-law judges have wrestled to secure precise and ready applications did not escape the difficulties encountered in borderland cases by its reformulation in the Restatement of the Law of Agency  220. That even at the common law the control test and the complex of incidents evolved in applying it to distinguish an 'employee' from an 'independent contractor,' for purposes of vicarious liability in tort, did not necessarily have the same significance in other contexts, compare Lumley v.

STATE OF MINNESOTA(1944)\nNo. 33\nArgued: Decided: May 15, 1944\n\n\n\n Rehearing Denied Oct. 9, 1944\n\n\n See 65 S.Ct. 26.\n Mr. Michael J. Doherty, of St. Paul, Minn., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Andrew R. Bratter and George B. Sjoselius, both of St. Paul, Minn., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER announced the conclusion and judgment of the Court.\n The question before us is whether the Commerce Clause or the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment bars the State of Minnesota from enforcing the personal property tax it has laid on the entire fleet of airplanes owned by the petitioner and operated by it in interstate transportation. The answer involves the application of \n\n[322 \nU.S. 292, 293]\n\u00a0\n settled legal principles to the precise circumstances of this case. To these, about which there is no dispute, we turn.\n Northwest Airlines is a Minnesota corporation and its principal place of business is St. Paul. It is a commercial airline carrying persons, property and mail on regular fixed routes, with due allowance for weather, predominantly within the territory comprising Illinois, Minnesota, North Dakota, Montana, Oregon, Wisconsin and Washington. For all the planes St. Paul is the home port registered with the Civil Aeronautics Authority, under whose certificate of convenience and necessity Northwest operates. At six of its scheduled cities, Northwest operates maintenance bases, but the work of rebuilding and overhauling the planes is done in St. Paul. Details as to stopovers, other runs, the location of flying crew bases and of the usual facilities for aircraft, have no bearing on our problem.\n The tax in controversy is for the year 1939. All of Northwest's planes were in Minnesota from time to time during that year. All were, however, continuously engaged in flying from State to State, except when laid up for repairs and overhauling for unidentified periods. On May 1, 1939, the time fixed by Minnesota for assessing personal property subject to its tax (Minn.Stat.1941,  273.01), Northwest's scheduled route mileage in Minnesota was 14% of its total scheduled route mileage, and the scheduled plane mileage was 16% of that scheduled. It based its personal property tax return for 1939 on the number of planes in Minnesota on May 1, 1939. Thereupon the appropriate taxing authority of Minnesota assessed a tax against Northwest on the basis of the entire fleet coming into Minnesota. For that additional assessment this suit was brought. The Supreme Court of Minnesota, with three judges dissenting, affirmed the judgment of a lower court in favor of the State. 213 Minn. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 292, 294]\n\u00a0\n 395, 7 N.W.2d 691. A new phase of an old problem led us to bring the case here. \n319 \nU.S. 734\n, 63 S.Ct. 1157.\n The tax here assessed by Minnesota is a tax assessed upon 'all personal property of persons residing therein, including the property of corporations ....' Minn.Stat.1941,  272.01. It is not a charge laid for engaging in interstate commerce or upon airlines specifically; it is not aimed by indirection against interstate commerce or measured by such commerce. Nor is the tax assessed against planes which were 'continuously without the state during the whole tax year,' New York Central & H.R.R. Co. v. Miller, \n202 \nU.S. 584, 594\n, 26 S.Ct. 714, 716, and had thereby acquired 'a permanent location elsewhere,' Southern Pacific Co. v. Kentucky, \n222 \nU.S. 63, 68\n, 32 S.Ct. 13, 15; and see Cream of Wheat Co. v. Grand Forks County, \n253 \nU.S. 325\n, 328-330, 40 S.Ct. 558, 559, 560.\n Minnesota is here taxing a corporation for all its property within the State during the tax year no part of which receives permanent protection from any other State. The benefits given to Northwest by Minnesota and for which Minnesota taxes-its corporate facilities and the governmental resources which Northwest enjoys in the conduct of its business in Minnesota-are concretely symbolized by the fact that Northwest's principal place of business is in St. Paul and that St. Paul is the 'home port' of all its planes. The relation between Northwest and Minnesota-a relation existing between no other State and Northwest-and the benefits which this relation affords are the constitutional foundation for the taxing power which Minnesota has asserted. See State Tax Com. v. Aldrich, \n316 \nU.S. 174, 180\n, 62 S.Ct. 1008, 1011, 139 A.L.R. 1436. No other State can claim to tax as the State of the legal domicile as well as the home State of the fleet, as a business fact. No other State is the State which gave Northwest the power to be as well as the power to function as Northwest functions in Minnesota; no other State could impose a tax that derives from the significant legal relation of creator and creature \n\n[322 \nU.S. 292, 295]\n\u00a0\n and the practical consequences of that relation in this case. On the basis of rights which Minnesota alone originated and Minnesota continues to safeguard, she alone can tax the personalty which is permanently attributable to Minnesota and to no other State. It is too late to suggest that this taxing power of a State is less because the tax may be reflected in the cost of transportation. See In re Delaware Railroad Tax, 18 Wall. 206, 232.\n Such being the case, it is clearly ruled by New York Central & H.R.R. Co. v. Miller, supra. Here, as in that case, a corporation is taxed for all its property within the State during the tax year none of which was 'continuously without the state during the whole tax year.' Therefore the doctrine of Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky, \n199 \nU.S. 194\n, 26 S. Ct. 36, 4 Ann.Cas. 493, does not come into play. The fact that Northwest paid personal property taxes for the year 1939 upon 'some proportion of its full value' of its airplane fleet in some other States does not abridge the power of taxation of Minnesota as the home State of the fleet in the circumstances of the present case. The taxability of any part of this fleet by any other State than Minnesota, in view of the taxability of the entire fleet by that State, is not now before us. It was not shown in the Miller case and it is not shown here that a defined part of the domiciliary corpus has acquired a permanent location, i.e., a taxing situs, elsewhere. \n1\n That \n\n[322 \nU.S. 292, 296]\n\u00a0\n was the decisive feature of the Miller case, and it was deemed decisive as late as 1933 in Johnson Refining Oil Co. v. Oklahoma, \n290 \nU.S. 158\n, 54 S. Ct. 152, which was strongly pressed upon us by Northwest. In that case it was not the home State, Illinois, but a foreign State, Oklahoma, which was seeking to tax a whole fleet of tank cars used by the oil company. That case fell outside of the decision of the Miller case and ours falls precisely within it. 'Appellant had its domicile in Illinois,' as Mr. Chief Justice Hughes pointed out, 'and that state had jurisdiction to tax appellant's personal property which had not acquired an actual situs elsewhere.' 290 U.S. at page 161, 54 S.Ct. at page 153. 2 This constitutional basis for what Minnesota did, reflects practicalities in the relations between the States and air transportation. 'It has been customary to tax operating airplanes at their overhaul \n\n[322 \nU.S. 292, 297]\n\u00a0\n base.' Thompson, State and Local Taxation Affecting Air Transportation ( 1933) 4 J.Air L. 479, 483.\n The doctrine of tax apportionment for instrumentalities engaged in interstate commerce introduced by Pullman's Palace-Car Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n141 \nU.S. 18\n, 11 S.Ct. 876, is here inapplicable. The principle of that case is that a nondomiciliary State may tax an interstate carrier 'engaged in running railroad cars into, through, and out of the state, and having at all times a large number of cars within the state ... by taking as the basis of assessment such proportion of its capital stock as the number of miles of railroad over which its cars are run within the state bears to the whole number of miles in all the states over which its cars are run.' Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky, supra, 199 U.S. at page 206, 26 S.Ct. at page 38, 4 Ann.Cas. 493. This principle was successively extended to the old means of transportation and communication, such as express companies and telegraph systems. But the doctrine of apportionment has neither in theory nor in practice been applied to tax units of interstate commerce visiting for fractional periods of the taxing year. (Thus, for instance, 'The coaches of the company ... are daily passing from one end of the state to the other', in Pullman's Palace-Car Co. v. Pennsylvania, supra, 141 U.S. at page 20, 11 S.Ct. at page 877, citing the opinion of the court below in 107 Pa. 156, 160.) The continuous protection by a State other than the domiciliary State-that is, protection throughout the tax year-has furnished the constitutional basis for tax apportionment in these interstate commerce situations, and it is on that basis that the tax laws have been framed and administered.\n The taxing power of the domiciliary State has a very different basis. It has power to tax because it is the State of domicile and no other State is. For reasons within its own sphere of choice Congress at one time chartered interstate carriers and at other times has left the chartering and all that goes with it to the States. That is a practical fact of legislative choice and a practical fact \n\n[322 \nU.S. 292, 298]\n\u00a0\n from which legal significance has always followed. That far-reaching fact was recognized, as a matter of course, by Mr. Justice Bradley in his dissent in the Pullman's Palace-Car Co. case, supra, 141 U.S. at page 32, 11 S.Ct. at page 881. Congress of course could exert its controlling authority over commerce by appropriate regulation and exclude a domiciliary State from authority which it otherwise would have because it is the domiciliary State. But no judicial restriction has been applied against the domiciliary State except when property (or a portion of fungible units) is permanently situated in a State other than the domiciliary State. \n3\n And permanently means continuously throughout the year, not a fraction thereof, whether days or weeks.\n Such was the unanimous decision in the Miller case or the Miller case decided nothing. The present case is precisely the case which Mr. Justice Holmes assumed the Miller case to be. By substituting Minnesota for New York we have inescapably the facts of the present case; 'Suppose, then, that the state of Minnesota had taxed the property directly, there was nothing to hinder its taxing the whole of it. It is true that it has been decided that property, even of a domestic corporation, cannot be taxed \n\n[322 \nU.S. 292, 299]\n\u00a0\n if it is permanently out of the State. ... But it has not been decided, and it could not be decided, that a state may not tax its own corporations for all their property within the state during the tax year, even if every item of that property should be taken successively into another state for a day, a week, or six months, and then brought back. Using the language of domicil, which now so frequently is applied to inanimate things, the state of origin remains the permanent situs of the property, notwithstanding its occasional excursions to foreign parts.' New York Central & H.R.R. Co. v. Miller, supra, 202 U.S. at pages 596, 597, 26 S.Ct. at pages 716, 717.4 Surely, the power of the State of origin to 'tax its own corporations for all their property within the state during the tax year' cannot constitutionally be affected whether the property takes fixed trips or indeterminate trips so long as the property is not 'continuously without the state during the whole tax year', New York Central & H.R.R. Co. v. Miller, supra, 202 U.S. at page 594, 26 S.Ct. at page 716, even when, as in the Miller case, from 12% to 64% of the property was shown to have been used outside of New York during the tax year, but in no one visited State permanently, that is, for the whole year. And that is the decisive constitutional fact about the Miller case-that although from 12% to 64% of the rolling stock of the railroad was outside of New York throughout the tax year, New York was nevertheless allowed to tax it all because no part was in any other State throughout the year.\n To introduce a new doctrine of tax apportionment as a limitation upon the hitherto established taxing power of the home State is not merely to indulge in constitutional \n\n[322 \nU.S. 292, 300]\n\u00a0\n innovation. It is to introduce practical dislocation into the established taxing systems of the States. The doctrine of tax apportionment has been painfully evolved in working out the financial relations between the States and interstate transportation and communication conducted on land and thereby forming a part of the organic life of these States. Although a part of the taxing systems of this country, the rule of apportionment is beset with friction, waste and difficulties, but at all events it grew out of, and has established itself in regard to land commerce. \n5\n To what extent it should be carried over to the totally new problems presented by the very different modes of transportation and communication that the airplane and the radio have already introduced, let alone the still more subtle and complicated technological facilities that are on the horizon, raises questions that we ought not to anticipate; certainly we ought not to embarrass the future by judicial answers which at best can deal only in a truncated way with problems sufficiently difficult even for legislative statesmanship.\n The doctrine in the Miller case, which we here apply, does not subject property permanently located outside of the domiciliary State to double taxation. But not to subject property that has no locality other than the State of its owner's domicile to taxation there would free such floating property from taxation everywhere. And what the Miller case decided is that neither the Commerce Clause nor the Fourteenth Amendment affords such constitutional immunity.\n Each new means of interstate transportation and communication has engendered controversy regarding the \n\n[322 \nU.S. 292, 301]\n\u00a0\n taxing powers of the States inter se and as between the States and the Federal Government. Such controversies and some conflict and confusion are inevitable under a federal system. They have long been the source of difficulty and dissatisfaction for us, see J. B. Moore, Taxation of Movables and the Fourteenth Amendment (1907) 7 Col.L.Rev. 309; Groves, Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations, Proceedings Thirty-fifth Annual Conference, National Tax Association, p. 105, and have equally plagued the British federal systems, see Report of the (Australian) Royal Commission on the Constitution, (1929) c, XII (p. 127), c. XIX (p. 187), c. XXIII (at p. 259); Report of the (Canadian) Royal Commission on Dominion-Provincial Relations, (1940) Bk. I, c. VIII, Bk. II,  B, c, III. In response to arguments addressed also to us about the dangers of harassing state taxation affecting national transportation, the concurring judge below adverts to the power of Congress to incorporate airlines and to control their taxation. But insofar as these are matters that go beyond the constitutional issues which dispose of this case, they are not our concern.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK, concurring.\n I concur in the judgment of the Court and in substantially all that is said in the opinion, but I would not in this case foreclose consideration of the taxing rights of States other than Minnesota.\n I believe there is small support in reason or in the Constitution for the doctrine that the Commerce Clause in and of itself prohibits a state from applying its general tax laws to transactions and properties in interstate commerce unless it is able to make two correct prophecies as to what this Court ultimately may hold, namely, (1) The permissible total of taxes which might be imposed by an aggregate of states on the taxed properties or transactions; and (2) The proportion of this total which the state itself \n\n[322 \nU.S. 292, 302]\n\u00a0\n fairly may claim. See dissenting opinions in Adams Manufacturing Co. v. Storen, \n304 \nU.S. 307, 316\n, 58 S.Ct. 913, 918, 117 A.L.R. 429; Gwin, etc., Inc., v. Henneford, \n305 \nU.S. 434, 442\n, 59 S.Ct. 325, 329. Extension of this dubious doctrine to the new problems of air transport gives promise of little but tax confusion.\n The differing views of members of the Court in this and related cases illustrate the difficulties inherent in the judicial formulation of general rules to meet the national problems arising from state taxation which bears in incidence upon interstate commerce. These problems, it seems to me, call for Congressional investigation, consideration, and action. The Constitution gives that branch of government the power to regulate commerce among the states, and until it acts I think we should enter the field with extreme caution. See dissenting opinion, McCarroll v. Dixie Greyhound Lines, \n309 \nU.S. 176, 183\n, 60 S.Ct. 504, 507.\n\n Mr. Justice JACKSON, concurring.\n This case considers for the first time constitutional limitations upon state power to tax airplanes. Several principles of limitation have been judicially evolved in reference to ships and to railroad rolling stock. The question is which, if any of these should be transferred to air transport.\n We are at a stage in development of air commerce roughly comparable to that of steamship navigation in 1824 when Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, came before this Court. Any authorization of local burdens on our national air commerce will lead to their multiplication in this country. Moreover, such an example is not likely to be neglected by other revenue-needy nations as international air transport expands.\n Aviation has added a new dimension to travel and to our ideas. The ancient idea that landlordism and sovereignty extend from the center of the world to the periph- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 292, 303]\n\u00a0\n ery of the universe has been modified. Today the landowner no more possesses a vertical control of all the air above him than a shore owner possesses horizontal control of all the sea before him. The air is too precious as an open highway to permit it to be 'owned' to the exclusion or embarrassment of air navigation by surface landlords who could put it to little real use.\n Students of our legal evolution know how this Court interpreted the commerce clause of the Constitution to lift navigable waters of the United States out of local controls and into the domain of federal control. Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, to United States v. Appalachian Electric Power Co., \n311 \nU.S. 377\n, 61 S.Ct. 291. Air as an element in which to navigate is even more inevitably federalized by the commerce clause than is navigable water. Local exactions and barriers to free transit in the air would neutralize its indifference to space and its conquest of time.\n Congress has recognized the national responsibility for requlating air commerce. Federal control is intensive and exclusive. Planes do not wander about in the sky like vagrant clouds. They move only by federal permission, subject to federal inspection, in the hands of federally certified personnel and under an intricate system of federal commands. The moment a ship taxies onto a runway it is caught up in an elaborate and detailed system of controls. It takes off only by instruction from the control tower, it travels on prescribed beams, it may be diverted from its intended landing, and it obeys signals and orders. Its privileges, rights, and protection, so far as transit is concerned, it owes to the Federal Government alone and not to any state government.\n Congress has not extended its protection and control to the field of taxation, although I take it no one denies that constitutionally it may do so. It may exact a single uniform federal tax on the property or the business to \n\n[322 \nU.S. 292, 304]\n\u00a0\n the exclusion of taxation by the states. It may subject the vehicles or other incidents to any type of state and local taxation, or it may declare them tax-free altogether. Our function is to determine what rule governs in the absence of such legislative enactment.\n Certainly today flight over a state either casually or on regular routes and schedules confers no jurisdiction to tax. Earlier ideas of a state's sovereignty over the air above it might argue for such a right to tax, but it is one of those cases where legal philosophy has to take account of the fact that the world does move.\n Does the act of landing within a state, even regularly and on schedule, confer jurisdiction to tax? Undoubtedly a plane, like any other article of personal property, could land or remain within a state in such a way as to become a part of the property within the state. But when a plane lands to receive and discharge passengers, to undergo servicing or repairs, or to await a convenient departing schedule, it does not in my opinion lose its character as a plane in transit. Long ago this Court held that the landing of a ship within the ports of a state for similar purposes did not confer jurisdiction to tax. Hays v. Pacific Mail S.S. Co., 17 How. 596; City of St. Louis v. Wiggins Ferry Co., 11 Wall. 423; Morgan v. Parham, 16 Wall. 471; cf. Ayer & Lord Tie Co. v. Kentucky, \n202 \nU.S. 409\n, 26 S.Ct. 679, 6 Ann. Cas. 205. I cannot consider that to alight out of the skies onto a landing field and take off again into the air confers any greater taxing jurisdiction on a state than for a ship for the same purposes to come alongside a wharf on the water and get under way again.\n What, then, remains as a basis for Minnesota's claim to tax this entire fleet of planes at their full value as property of the State of Minnesota? They have been within the state only transiently and in the same manner in which they have been in many states: to serve the public and to be serviced. The planes have received no 'protection' \n\n[322 \nU.S. 292, 305]\n\u00a0\n or 'benefit' from Minnesota that they have not received from many others. It might be difficult, in view of the complete control of this type of activity by the Federal Government, to find what benefits or protection any state extends. But no distinction whatever can be pointed out between those extended by Minnesota and those extended by any state where there is a terminal or a stopping place.\n But it is said that Minnesota incorporated the company. Of course it is her right to tax the company she has created and the franchise she has granted. I suppose there are many ways that she might constitutionally measure the value of this privilege. If she chartered a corporation on condition that all property it might acquire, tangible or intangible, should be taxable under her laws, I do not think a company which accepted such a charter could appeal to the Constitution to give back what it voluntarily contracted away. But no such stipulation has been made in the charter in this case. The tax imposed here is a general ad valorem property tax on the full value of every plane of the fleet operated by this company. Domicile of an owner is a usual test of power to tax intangibles, but has not generally been a conclusive test of taxability of tangible property situated elsewhere. If we should suppose that this corporation had a Delaware charter instead of a Minnesota one, and had nothing in Delaware except its agent, but operated otherwise in Minnesota exactly as it has done, would we say that the entire right to tax the fleet moved to Delaware because it was the corporation's state of domicile? I do not think that domicile, in the facts of this case, is decisive of Minnesota's claim to tax the tangible property of the company wherever situate.\n It is strongly and plausibly advocated that the theory of apportionment of the total value among the several states of operation, heretofore applied to state taxation \n\n[322 \nU.S. 292, 306]\n\u00a0\n of railroad rolling stock, be transferred to air transportation. This would mean that each state of operation (no one ventures to say whether flight alone or both flight and landing would be required) could tax a proportion of the total value.\n The apportionment theory is a mongrel one, a cross between desire not to interfere with state taxation and desire at the same time not utterly to crush out interstate commerce. It is a practical, but rather illogical, device to prevent duplication of tax burdens on vehicles in transit. It is established in our decisions and has been found more or less workable with more or less arbitrary formulate of apportionment. Nothing either in theory or in practice commends it for transfer to air commerce. A state has a different relation to rolling stock of railroads than it has to airplanes. Rolling stock is useless without surface rights and continuous structures on every inch of land over which it operates. Surface rights the railroad has acquired from the state or under its law. There is a physical basis within the state for the taxation of rolling stock which is lacking in the case of airplanes.\n It seems more than likely that no solution of the competition among states to tax this transportation agency can be devised by the judicial process without legislative help. The best analogy that I find in existing decisions is the 'home port' theory applied to ships. See Hays v. Pacific Mail S.S. Co., City of St. Louis v. Wiggins Ferry Co., Morgan v. Parham, supra. There is difficulty in the application of this doctrine to air commerce, I grant. There is no statutory machinery for fixing the home port. If federal registration established statehood as it establishes nationality, the home port doctrine would be easy to apply. However, on the record before us it seems unquestioned that Minnesota is in an operational as well as in a domiciliary sense the home port of this fleet. On that doctrine Minnesota can tax the fleet, but its right to do so is exclusive, \n\n[322 \nU.S. 292, 307]\n\u00a0\n for no other state can acquire jurisdiction to tax merely because it provides a port of call. I therefore concur in the conclusion reached by the opinion of Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER. I do not accept the opinion because it falls short of commitment that Minnesota's right is exclusive of any similar right elsewhere. It is, I know, difficult to judge and dangerous to foreclose claims of other states that are not before us. That is the weakness of the judicial process in these tax questions where the total problem that faces an industry reaches us only in installments. If the reasoning should hereafter be extended to support full taxation everywhere, it would offend the commerce clause, as I see it, even more seriously than apportioned taxation everywhere.\n The evils of local taxation of goods or vehicles in transit are not measured by the exaction of one locality alone, but by the aggregation of them. I certainly do not favor exemption of interstate commerce from its 'just share of taxation.' But history shows that fair judgment as to what exactions are just to the passerby cannot be left to local opinion. When local authority is taxing its own, the taxed ones may be assumed to be able to protect themselves at the polls. No such sanction enforces fair dealing to the transient. In all ages and climes those who are settled in strategic localities have made the moving world pay dearly. This the commerce clause was designed to end in the United States.\n The rule I suggest seems most consonant with the purposes of the commerce clause among those found in our precedents. But the whole problem we deal with is unprecedented. I do not think we can derive from decisional law a satisfactory adjustment of the conflicting needs of the nation for free air commerce and the natural desire of localities to have revenue from the business that goes on about them. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 292, 308]\n\u00a0\n I concur in the affirmance of the judgment below, but only because the record seems to me to establish Minnesota as a 'home port' within the meaning of the old and somewhat neglected but to me wise authorities cited.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE, dissenting.\n In my opinion the Minnesota levy imposed an unconstitutional tax on petitioner's vehicles of interstate transportation in violation of the commerce clause, and for that reason the judgment below should be reversed.\n Petitioner, a Minnesota corporation, is owner of a large number of airplanes which it uses exclusively in interstate transportation moving on regular schedules and over fixed routes extending through eight states between Chicago, Illinois and the Pacific coast, with the usual landing fields and maintenance bases at intermediate points, including Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota. It is stipulated that on May 1, 1939, 14% of the total mileage of the prescribed interstate routes was in Minnesota and that 16% of the daily plane mileage of all petitioner's interstate planes was in that state.\n Although the Minnesota statute taxing personal property directs that it shall be listed for taxation on May 1st of each year and assessed for taxation at its value on that date, Minn.Stat.1941  273.01, the state taxing authorities have levied on petitioner, and the Minnesota Supreme Court and this Court have sustained an annual tax on the full value of all its planes used in interstate commerce which have come into the state at any time during the year. It is evident that if, with the Minnesota tax now sustained, other states are left free to impose a further or comparable tax on the same property for the same tax period, a serious question is raised whether the tax is not a prohibited burden on interstate commerce.\n It is no longer doubted that interstate business 'must pay its way' by sustaining its fair share of the property \n\n[322 \nU.S. 292, 309]\n\u00a0\n tax burden which the states in which the interstate business is done may lawfully impose generally on property located within them. See Western Live Stock v. Bureau, \n303 \nU.S. 250, 254\n, 255 S., 58 S.Ct. 546, 548, 549, 115 A.L.R. 944, and cases cited. Obviously interstate business bears no undue part of that burden if the personal property tax imposed on it by a given state is-like a tax on real estate located there-exclusive of all other property taxes imposed by other states, as is the case with the taxation of vessels, Old Dominion S.S. Co. v. Virginia, \n198 \nU.S. 299\n, 25 S.Ct. 686, 3 Ann.Cas. 1100; Southern Pacific Co. v. Kentucky, \n222 \nU.S. 63\n, 32 S.Ct. 13, and cases cited; cf. New York Central & H.R.R. Co. v. Miller, \n202 \nU.S. 584\n, 26 S.Ct. 714, or if the tax on its personal property regularly used over fixed routes in interstate commerce, both within and without the taxing state, is fairly apportioned to its use within the state, as has until now been the rule as to railroad cars. Marye v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., \n127 \nU.S. 117, 123\n, 124 S., 8 S.Ct. 1037, 1039, 1040; Pullman's Palace-Car Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n141 \nU.S. 18\n, 11 S.Ct. 876; American Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Hall, \n174 \nU.S. 70\n, 19 S.Ct. 599; Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Lynch, \n177 \nU.S. 149\n, 20 S.Ct. 631; Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky, \n199 \nU.S. 194\n, 26 S.Ct. 36, 4 Ann.Cas. 493; Germania Refining Co. v. Fuller, \n245 \nU.S. 632\n, 38 S.Ct. 63; Union Tank Line v. Wright, \n249 \nU.S. 275\n, 39 S.Ct. 276; Johnson Oil Refining Co. v. Oklahoma, \n290 \nU.S. 158\n, 54 S.Ct. 152.\n If the tax levied here were held to be exclusive of all property taxes imposed on petitioner's airplanes by other states there could be no serious question of an undue burden on interstate commerce. That question arises now only because the rationale found necessary to support the present tax leaves other states free to impose comparable taxes on the same property used in interstate commerce which Minnesota has already taxed for the entire taxable year and at its full value.\n Such, I think, is the necessary consequence of the Court's decision and judgment now given. They do not sustain the tax on the ground that Minnesota, as the state of petitioner's domicile, has exclusive power to tax respondent's \n\n[322 \nU.S. 292, 310]\n\u00a0\n planes which pass in and out of Minnesota in performance of their interstate functions. They do not deny that the planes are constitutionally subject, to some extent, to personal property taxes by the states through which they pass. Our decisions, as will presently appear, establish that they are, and that vehicles of interstate transportation moving from the state of the owner's domicile over regular routes within the jurisdiction of other states also acquire a tax situs there, so that, to an extent presently to be considered, they may be taxed by each of the states through which they pass. In fact the record discloses that petitioner's interstate planes, already taxed by Minnesota for their full value, are in addition subjected to personal property taxes in six of the seven other states through which they fly.\n But if petitioner's airplanes, which are taxable for some portion of their value in each of the states in which they carry on interstate transportation over fixed routes and regular schedules, are also taxed for their full value by Minnesota, the state of the domicile, it is evident that merely because they are engaged in interstate commerce they may be subjected to multiple state taxation far in excess of their value, and far beyond any tax which any one of the states concerned could under its established system of taxation impose on vehicles whose movements are confined within its territorial limits. It is a scheme of property taxation on which, so far as the decision now rendered gives us any hint, the commerce clause sets no restriction, but which is so burdensome in its operation as compared with the taxes imposed on intrastate vehicles that few interstate carriers could support it and survive economically.\n The case thus sharply presents in a new form the old question whether the commerce clause affords any protection against multiple state taxation of the physical \n\n[322 \nU.S. 292, 311]\n\u00a0\n facilities used in interstate transportation which, because they move from state to state, are exposed to full taxation in each, save only as the due process and commerce clauses may prevent. Although the question is new in form it is old in substance and this Court has considered it so often in other but similar relationships that the answer here seems plain.\n Of controlling significance in this case are certain elementary propositions, so long accepted and applied by this Court that they cannot be said to be debatable here, although they seem not to have been taken into account in deciding this case either here or in the Minnesota Supreme Court. The first is that the constitutional basis for the state taxation of the airplanes, which are chattels, is their physical presence within the taxing state, and not the domicile of the owner. Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky, supra; Johnson Oil Refining Co. v. Oklahoma, supra, \n290 \nU.S. 161, 162\n, 54 S.Ct. 153, 154, and cases cited. In this respect, as this Court has often pointed out, the taxation of chattels rests on a different basis than does the taxation of intangibles, which have no physical situs and may be reached by the tax gatherer only through exertion of the power of the state over the person of those who have some legal interest in the intangibles. Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky, supra, \n199 \nU.S. 205, 206\n, 26 S.Ct. 38, 39, 4 Ann.Cas. 493; Schwab v. Richardson, \n263 \nU.S. 88, 92\n, 44 S.Ct. 60, 62; Frick v. Pennsylvania, \n268 \nU.S. 473, 494\n, 45 S.Ct. 603, 606, 42 A.L.R. 316; Blodgett v. Silberman, \n277 \nU.S. 1\n, 16-18, 48 S.Ct. 410, 416; Wheeling Steel Corp. v. Fox, \n298 \nU.S. 193, 209\n, 210 S., 56 S.Ct. 773, 776, 777; Curry v. McCanless, \n307 \nU.S. 357\n, 363-366, 59 S.Ct. 900, 903-906, 123 A.L.R. 162; Graves v. Elliott, \n307 \nU.S. 383\n, 59 S.Ct. 913; Graves v. Schmidlapp, \n315 \nU.S. 657\n, 62 S.Ct. 870, 141 A.L.R. 948; State Tax Com. v. Aldrich, \n316 \nU.S. 174\n, 62 S.Ct. 1008, 139 A.L.R. 1436.\n A state may, within the Fourteenth Amendment, tax a chattel located within its limits, although its owner is domiciled elsewhere, Brown v. Houston, \n114 \nU.S. 622\n, 5 S.Ct. 1091; Coe v. Errol, \n116 \nU.S. 517\n, 6 S.Ct. 475; Pullman's Palace-Car Co. v. Pennsylvania, supra; Old Dominion S.S. Co. v. Virginia, supra. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 292, 312]\n\u00a0\n But due process precludes the state of the domicile from taxing it unless it is brought within that state's boundaries. Delaware, L. & W.R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n198 \nU.S. 341\n, 25 S.Ct. 669; Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky, supra; Frick v. Pennsylvania, supra, \n268 \nU.S. 489\n et seq., 45 S.Ct. 604 et seq., 42 A.L.R. 316. It is plain then that for present purposes, and so far as the Fourteenth Amendment is concerned, respondent's airplanes, which are chattels regularly moving over fixed interstate routes, are subject in some measure to the taxing power of every state in which they regularly stop on their interstate mission. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n In some instances it may be that vehicles of transportation moving interstate are so sporadically and irregularly present in other states that they acquire no tax situs there, Hays v. Pacific Mail S.S. Co., 17 How. 596; City St. Louis v. Wiggins Ferry Co., 11 Wall. 423; Morgan v. Parham, 16 Wall. 471; Ayer & Lord Tie Co. v. Kentucky, \n202 \nU.S. 409\n, 26 S.Ct. 679, 6 Ann.Cas. 205, and hence remain taxable to their full value by the state of the domicile because they are not taxable elsewhere, New York Central & H.R.R. Co. v. Miller, supra; Southern Pacific Co. v. Kentucky, supra. But that is not the case as to any of the planes here involved. And our decisions establish that, except in the case of tangibles which have nowhere acquired a tax situs based on physical presence, and for that reason remain taxable at the domicile even if never present there, the state's power to tax chattels depends \n\n[322 \nU.S. 292, 313]\n\u00a0\n on their physical presence and is neither added to nor subtracted from because the taxing state may or may not happen to be the state of the owner's domicile.\n We need not consider to what extent the due process clause limits the taxing power of each state through which airplanes or other vehicles of interstate transportation pass, to the taxation of part only of their value, fairly related to their use within the state, or precluded the Minnesota Supreme Court from extending to tangible property moving in more than one state the rule of Curry v. McCanless, supra, and subsequent cases, permitting full taxation of intangibles by each state having a substantial relationship to the interest taxed. For we are dealing here with tangible instrumentalities of interstate commerce, entitled as such to the protection afforded by the commerce clause from unduly burdensome state taxation, even though the tax might otherwise be within the constitutional power of the state. And it is plain as this Court has often held, that if one state may impose a personal property tax at full value on an interstate carrier's vehicles of transportation, and other states through which they pass may also tax them for the same tax period, the resulting tax would be destructive of the commerce by imposing on it a multiple tax burden to which intrastate carriers are not subjected.\n This Court has never denied the power of the several states to impose a property tax on vehicles used in interstate transportation in the taxing state. It has recognized, as we have seen, that such instruments of interstate transportation, at least if moving over fixed routes on regular schedules, may thus acquire a tax situs in every state through which they pass. And it has met the problem of burdensome multiple taxation by the several states through which such vehicles pass by recognizing that the due process clause or the commerce clause or both pre- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 292, 314]\n\u00a0\n clude each state from imposing on the interstate commerce involved an undue or inequitable share of the tax burden. In Nashville, C. & St. L. Ry. v. Browing, \n310 \nU.S. 362, 365\n, 60 S.Ct. 968, 970, we recently considered 'the guiding principles for adjustment of the state's right to secure its revenues and the nation's duty to protect interstate transportation.' We declared that 'The problem to be solved is what portion of an interstate organism may appropriately be attributed to each of the various states in which it functions.' And, in sustaining the tax, apportioned according to mileage, upon the entire property, including rolling stock, of an interstate railroad, imposed by Tennessee, the state of the owner's domicile, in which its principal business office and over 70% of its trackage was located, we said that the state could not 'use a fiscal formula ... to project the taxing power of the state plainly beyond its borders.'\n This Court has accordingly held invalid state taxation of vehicles of interstate transportation unless the tax is equitably apportioned to the use of the vehicles within the state compared to their use without, whether the tax is laid by the state of the domicile or another. \n2\n Such an \n\n[322 \nU.S. 292, 315]\n\u00a0\n apportionment has been sustained when made according to the mileage traveled within and without the state, Pullman's Palace-Car Co. v. Pennsylvania, supra, \n141 \nU.S. 26\n, 11 S.Ct. 879, or the average number of vehicles within the taxing state during the tax period. Marye v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., supra; American Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Hall, supra, \n174 \nU.S. 82\n, 19 S.Ct. 604; Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Lynch, supra. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n But if the tax is laid without apportionment or if the apportionment, when made, is plainly inequitable so as to bear unfairly on the commerce by compelling the carrier to pay to the taxing state more than its fair share of the tax measured by the full value of the property, this Court has set aside the tax as an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce, whether it be in form on the rolling \n\n[322 \nU.S. 292, 316]\n\u00a0\n stock, Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky, supra; Union Tank Line v. Wright, supra; Johnson Oil Refining Co. v. Oklahoma, supra, or on the carrier's entire property, Fargo v. Hart, \n193 \nU.S. 490\n, 24 S.Ct. 498; or on a franchise or right to do business, Allen v. Pullman's Palace Car Co., \n191 \nU.S. 171\n, 24 S.Ct. 39; Wallace v. Hines, \n253 \nU.S. 66\n, 40 S.Ct. 435; Southern R. Co. v. Kentucky, \n274 \nU.S. 76\n, 47 S.Ct. 542; cf. Norfolk, etc., R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n136 \nU.S. 114\n, 10 S.Ct. 958.\n Upon like principles this Court has consistently held that a tax laid by a state on gross receipts from interstate commerce, which is comparable to a property tax at full value on vehicles of interstate transportation, violates the commerce clause unless equitably apportioned. Galveston, H., etc., R. Co. v. Texas, \n210 \nU.S. 217\n, 28 S.Ct. 638; Meyer, Auditor of Oklahoma v. Wells, Fargo & Co., \n223 \nU.S. 298\n, 32 S.Ct. 218; see Cudahy Packing Co. v. Minnesota, \n246 \nU.S. 450\n, 453-455, 38 S.Ct. 373, 374, 375; Pullman Company v. Richardson, \n261 \nU.S. 330, 338\n, 339 S., 43 S.Ct. 366, 368, 369. To the same effect as to capital stock taxes, see Atchison, etc., R. Co. v. O'Connor, \n223 \nU.S. 280, 285\n, 32 S.Ct. 216, 217, Ann.Cas. 1913C, 1050, and cases cited.\n In many the tax was held invalid although imposed by the state of the domicile of the taxpayer. Philadelphia & S.M. Steamship Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n122 \nU.S. 326, 342\n, 7 S.Ct. 1118, 1123, overruling State Tax on Railway Gross Receipts, 15 Wall. 284; Crew Levick Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n245 \nU.S. 292\n, 38 S.Ct. 126: New Jersey Bell Telephone Co. v. Tax Board, \n280 \nU.S. 338\n, 50 S.Ct. 111; Fisher's Blend Station v. Tax Commission, \n297 \nU.S. 650\n, 56 S.Ct. 608; Puget Sound Stevedoring Co. v. Tax Commission, \n302 \nU.S. 90\n, 58 S.Ct. 72; Adams Mfg. Co. v. Storen, \n304 \nU.S. 307\n, 58 S. Ct. 913, 117 A.L.R. 429; Gwin, White & Prince v. Henneford, \n305 \nU.S. 434\n, 59 S.Ct. 325; see Western Live Stock v. Bureau, supra. The same rule is applied to the taxation by the domicile of goods carried interstate, Case of the State Freight Tax, 15 Wall. 232; Eureka Pipe Line Co. v. Hallanan, \n257 \nU.S. 265\n, 42 S.Ct. 101; and the taxation of goods in transit generally, Hughes Bros. Timber Co. v. Minnesota, \n272 \nU.S. 469\n, 47 S.Ct. 170. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 292, 317]\n\u00a0\n In Galveston, H., etc., R. Co. v. Texas, supra, \n210 \nU.S. 228\n, 28 S.Ct. 640, in which a tax on gross receipts of a railway engaged in interstate commerce was condemned because not apportioned, the Court declared, 'Of course, it does not matter that plaintiffs in error are domestic corporations.' The like rule, applied to the taxation by the state of the owner's domicile of railroad property, including rolling stock, was approved in Nashville, C. & St. L. Ry. v. Browning, supra. And in Bacon v. Illinois, \n227 \nU.S. 504, 511\n, 512 S., 33 S.Ct. 299, 301, the Court was at pains to point out that the power of a state to tax goods in transit is not affected by the fact that it is or is not the domicile of the owner. These cases clearly establish that, whatever relevance domicile may at times have to the power of a state under the due process clause to tax tangibles, it has none to the question whether the exercise of that power to burdens interstate commerce as to violate the commerce clause.\n It cannot be said either in point of practicality or of legal theory that anything is added to Minnesota's power to tax by reason of the fact that all of petitioner's aircraft are registered with the Civil Aeronautics Authority with St. Paul, Minnesota, designated as their 'home port.' Section 501 of the Civil Aeronautics Act, 52 Stat. 1005, 49 U.S.C.  521, 49 U.S.C.A.  521, requiring the registration with the Authority of aircraft, merely provides that a certificate of registration 'shall be conclusive evidence of nationality for international purposes.' Neither the statute nor the regulations adopted under it attach any other consequences to the registration of airplanes at a particular 'home port.' The much more detailed provisions of R.S.  4141, 4178 as amended, 46 U.S. C.A.  17, 46, requiring registration of vessels at a particular home port and the painting of the name of that port on the stern of the vessel, have been held irrelevant to state power to tax, even though the port of enrollment is also one at which the vessel regularly calls, City of St. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 292, 318]\n\u00a0\n Louis v. Wiggins Ferry Co., supra; Ayer & Lord Tie Co. v. Kentucky, supra; see Southern Pacific Co. v. Kentucky, supra, \n222 \nU.S. 68, 73\n, 32 S.Ct. 14, 17.\n Nor is it of any significance for tax purposes whether Minnesota is 'as a business fact the home state of the fleet'. While the existence of a business domicile has been thought to afford a basis for the state taxation of intangibles, on the theory that they have become localized there, Wheeling Steel Corp. v. Fox, supra, \n298 \nU.S. 211\n, et seq., 56 S.Ct. 777, et seq., the constitutional bases for the taxation of tangibles and of intangibles are, as we have seen, quite different, and under our decisions, to which we have referred, the only basis for the taxation of tangibles is their physical presence in the taxing jurisdiction. And even the taxation of intangibles of interstate carriers is subject to the rule of apportionment wherever the tax without it would subject the commerce to the burden of multiple state taxation. The 'unit rule' for the taxation of interstate carriers applies to tangibles and intangibles alike and requires an equitable apportionment of the tax on both. Adams Express Co. v. Ohio State Auditor, \n165 \nU.S. 194, 222\n, 226 S., 17 S.Ct. 305, 309, 311; Id., \n166 \nU.S. 185, 223\n, 224 S., 225, 17 S. Ct. 604, 607, 608; Fargo v. Hart, supra, \n193 \nU.S. 499\n, 24 S. Ct. 500; Meyer, Auditor of Oklahoma v. Wells Fargo & Co., supra, \n223 \nU.S. 300\n, 32 S.Ct. 219; Wallace v. Hines, supra, \n253 \nU.S. 69, 70\n, 40 S.Ct. 436, 437; Southern R. Co. v. Kentucky, supra, \n274 \nU.S. 81\n, 47 S.Ct. 544.\n Moreover, the difficulties of applying to aircraft a rule of taxation at a 'home port' are essentially those which have led, long since, to the abandonment of the idea by this Court as applied to vessels. Compare City of St. Louis v. Wiggins Ferry Co., supra; Ayer & Lord Tie Co. v. Kentucky, supra. While it appears from the present record that petitioner maintains at St. Paul, Minnesota, its airplane and engine overhauling base, at which the principal repairs to planes and engines are made, it also operates maintenance bases at Chicago, Illinois, Minneapolis, Minnesota, Fargo, North Dakota, Billings, Montana, and Spokane and Seattle, \n\n[322 \nU.S. 292, 319]\n\u00a0\n Washington, at which points it maintains crews of mechanics and maintenance equipment. It owns and leases hangars and office space at all of its stopping points, each of which are manned by its employees. On the tax day, May 1, 1939, petitioner's planes made no scheduled stop in St. Paul. Thus a number of states have a physical relationship to petitioner's business-by reason of the movement of planes, over the fixed routes, the landing of planes, the maintenance and operation of repair and service equipment, landing fields, hangars, and office buildings, with their attendant employees-which, for practical purposes, is as substantial in nature as that claimed for Minnesota.\n Even if we could say on this record that Minnesota and it alone can be regarded as the 'home state', we have no assurance that in taxing planes operated by other and more complex business organizations, one state will have any greater claim to that designation than several others, and the court's opinion furnishes no test to guide in the choice among them, if choice has any relevance. Nor does it say that the power to tax vehicles of interstate transportation at the domicile or the 'home port' is exclusive. Obviously, unless it is deemed to be thus exclusive it does not foreclose any state within which the planes move on fixed routes from imposing a like tax burden. And if it is deemed to be exclusive the other states must be denied their just claims to collect an equitable tax on property regularly used within them in carrying on an interstate business. North Dakota, for instance, in taxing the planes regularly landing within its borders, is not taxing rights originating in and safeguarded by Minnesota, or exercising any rights attributable to Minnesota. No reason appears why North Dakota should be denied the right to tax the planes to the extent that they are within its borders, or why, to that extent, Minnesota \n\n[322 \nU.S. 292, 320]\n\u00a0\n has any relationship to them sufficient either to enable it to tax them or to preclude North Dakota from taxing them.\n The taxation of vehicles of interstate transportation in a business organized and conducted as is petitioner's is as capable of apportionment, and the insupportable multiple tax burden on interstate commerce is as readily avoided by apportionment of the tax, as in the case of the taxation of tangible and intangible property of railroads, railroad car supply companies, express companies, and the like which we have repeatedly held to be subject to the rule of apportionment. To refuse now to apply the rule of apportionment to petitioner's airplanes, after a half century of its application by this Court as the means of avoiding prohibited multiple state tax burdens on vehicles of interstate transportation; to extend to airplanes moving interstate over fixed routes on regular schedules, the rule that intangibles may be taxed at the business domicile whether or not taxed elsewhere; and to revive the abandoned doctrine that vessels may be taxed in full at their home port, while rejecting the correlative rule that they are exempt from taxation elsewhere, is to disregard the teachings of experience and of precedent. It subjects a new and important industry to state tax burdens, essentially discriminatory in their effect on interstate commerce, to which other interstate carriers are not subject and which it was the very purpose of the commerce clause to avoid.\n Respondent places its reliance on New York Central & H.R.R. v. Miller, supra. There the Court sustained a franchise tax by the state of domicile including in its measure the full value of freight cars moving in and out of the state, often out of the taxpayer's possession for an indefinite time, and moving in the service of other roads on their independent business. The decision proceeded on the assumption, not tenable here but which the facts of that case were thought to support, that the cars were not \n\n[322 \nU.S. 292, 321]\n\u00a0\n shown to have moved so regularly or continuously in any state or group of states outside the domicile as to gain a tax situs there. The Court in distinguishing the case from Pullman's Palace-Car Co. v. Pennsylvania, supra, which sustained a state tax on a foreign railroad corporation, measured by the intrastate mileage of cars passing in and out of the taxing state, said (202 U.S. at pages 597, 598, 26 S.Ct. at page 717):\n'But, in that case, it was found that the 'cars used in this state have, during all the time for which tax is charged, been running into, through, and out of the State.' The same cars were continuously receiving the protection of the state, and, therefore, it was just that the state should tax a proportion of them. Whether, if the same amount of protection had been received in respect of constantly changing cars, the same principle would have applied, was not decided, and it is not necessary to decide now. In the present case, however, it does not appear that any specific cars or any average of cars was so continuously in any other state as to be taxable there. The absences relied on were not in the course of travel upon fixed routes, but random excursions of casually chosen cars, determined by the varying orders of particular shippers and the arbitrary convenience of other roads. Therefore we need not consider either whether there is any necessary parallelism between liability elsewhere and immunity at home.'\n\n The present case raises the question which the Miller case found it unnecessary to decide but which this Court has consistently answered by requiring the apportionment of a tax on vehicles of interstate transportation according to their regular use within and without the taxing state. In the Miller case it appeared that the cars moved not only over the carrier's own tracks, but also were interchanged with other railroads, and thus, as the Court pointed out, moved about almost at random throughout the United States. No evidence was offered tending to show in what states the cars moved, or with what degree \n\n[322 \nU.S. 292, 322]\n\u00a0\n of regularity they were present in any particular state or group of states other than New York. The Court was thus not called upon to consider whether New York could tax the cars if they moved between New York and other named states with such regularity that an 'average of cars' could be said to be continuously so moving in those other states. Here, on the other hand, it is stipulated and found that all of petitioner's planes are 'continuously engaged in flying from state to state in the course of ( petitioner's) operations' and that those operations are on regular schedules along fixed routes through eight states. The total mileage of regular routes and the total daily mileage on those routes both in Minnesota and outside are definitely stipulated and found. Hence there is no warrant for saying that their presence in each of the states through which they pass is not as regular and continuous in nature as it is in Minnesota. These findings establish that, while no particular plane is permanently within any state, its planes are continuously flying in, and an average number or a percentage of the total is regularly, i.e., 'permanently' within, each of the states through which they pass. Here, as was the case in Pullman's Palace-Car Co. v. Pennsylvania, supra (\n141 \nU.S. 18\n, 11 S.Ct. 877), the same planes are 'running into, through, and out of' each of the states along petitioner's routes and an 'average' of planes is continuously within each of those states. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n[322 \nU.S. 292, 323]\n\u00a0\n We are not now concurned with the proper apportionment of taxable values among the states outside the state of Minnesota. Since the movement of the planes, wherever they go, is over fixed routes and on regular schedules, they acquire a tax situs outside Minnesota to the extent that they do not move within it. Hence the extent to which they move in and are taxable by one state outside Minnesota rather than another is irrelevant. It is enough that the Minnesota tax is for full value and that Minnesota's fiscal formula imposes a prohibited burden on interstate commerce because it is used 'to project the tax power of the state plainly beyond its borders', to reach instruments of interstate commerce which are taxable elsewhere, and that the extent of that projection may be measured by comparing either the plane or the \n\n[322 \nU.S. 292, 324]\n\u00a0\n route mileage over fixed routes in Minnesota with like mileage over fixed routes in the states outside Minnesota.\n Both before and since the Miller case this Court has ruled that vehicles of interstate transportation regularly moving to and from the state of domicile from and to other states acquire a tax situs in the latter, and that the state of domicile cannot constitutionally levy on them an unapportioned property tax. Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky, supra; Johnson Oil Refining Co. v. Oklahoma, supra; Nashville, C . & St. L. Ry. v. Browning, supra. In Johnson Oil Refining Co. v. Oklahoma, supra, \n290 \nU.S. 161, 162\n, 54 S.Ct. 153, 154, where the cars moved from and to Oklahoma to and from various states including Illinois, the state of domicile, we declared that the cars had acquired a tax situs outside Illinois and were to that extent not taxable by Illinois. The court rested its decision on the rule, state without qualification, that 'When a fleet of cars is habitually employed in several states-the individual cars constantily running in and out of each state-it cannot be said that any one of the states is entitled to tax the entire number of cars regardless of their use in the other states.' \n5\n Those cases should control \n\n[322 \nU.S. 292, 325]\n\u00a0\n now. For here we are confronted with a scheme of taxation imposed on vehicles of interstate transportation located within the taxing state for only a limited and specified part of their active life. For the rest, they are in other states, moving over fixed routes of travel where, under our decisions, they plainly have a tax situs, and where they are in fact taxed in six of the seven states other than Minnesota through which they pass.\n The tax now sustained is so obviously disproportionate to the protection afforded to the taxed property by the taxing state as to place a constitutionally intolerable burden on interstate commerce. But it is a burden which is capable of equitable adjustment which would satisfy constitutional requirements by the application of the principles of apportionment which this court has repeatedly sanctioned, and which it is the constitutional duty of the State of Minnesota to apply. The application of these principles does not call for mathematical exactness nor for the rigid application of a particular formula; only if the resulting valuation is palpably excessive will it be set aside. But a reasonable attempt must be made to tax only so much of the value as is fairly related to use within the taxing state. Union Tank Line v. Wright, supra, \n249 \nU.S. 282\n, 39 S.Ct. 278; Great Northern R. Co. v. Weeks, supra, \n297 \nU.S. 144\n, 56 S.Ct. 431; Nashville C. & St. L. Ry. v. Browning, supra, \n310 \nU.S. 365\n, 60 S.Ct. 970. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 292, 326]\n\u00a0\n It is no answer to suggest that the states other than Minnesota have not asserted their constitutional power to tax or that we do not know how or to what extent they have exercised it. The extent to which one state may constitutionally tax the instruments of interstate transportation does not depend on what other states may happen to do, but on what the taxing state has constitutional power to do. The jurisdiction of Minnesota to tax 'must be determined on a basis which is consistent with the like jurisdiction of other states.' Johnson Oil Refining Co. v. Oklahoma, supra, \n290 \nU.S. 162\n, 54 S.Ct. 154. Minnesota cannot justify its imposition of an undue proportion of the total tax burden which can be imposed on an interstate carrier by saying that other states have taken or may take less than their share of the tax. It is enough that the tax exposes petitioner to 'the risk of a multiple burden to which local commerce is not exposed. Adams Mfg. Co. v. Storen, supra, (\n304 \nU.S. 311\n, 58 S.Ct. 916, 117 A.L.R. 429).' Gwin, White & Prince, Inc., v. Henneford, supra, \n305 \nU.S. 439\n, 59 S.Ct. 328, and cases cited. To hold otherwise would be to measure Minnesota's power to tax, not by constitutional standards, but by the action of other states over which neither Minnesota nor petitioner has any control and to leave petitioner's tax to be measured from year to year, not according to any legal standard, but by the unpredictable uncontrolled action of other states.\n The judgment should be reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings in the course of which the state court would be free, if so advised, to inquire to what extent, if at all, the tax may, in harmony with state law, be apportioned in conformity to principles heretofore announced by this Court, and to that extent sustained.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS, Mr. Justice REED, and Mr. Justice RUTLEDGE join in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In the Miller case, the New York Central Railroad introduced evidence that during the taxable years in question, a proportion of its cars, ranging from about 12% to 64%, was used outside of New York. This figure was arrived at by using the ratio between Central's mileage outside of New York and its total mileage. The comptroller nevertheless ruled that all of Central's cars were taxable in New York, the State of domicile. On review of this ruling as applied in the first tax year involved, the New York Court of Appeals remitted the proceedings to the comptroller to determine whether any of the rolling stock was used exclusively out of the State. People ex rel. New York Cent. & H.R.R. Co. v. Knight, 173 N.Y. 255, 65 N.E. 1102. No such evidence was introduced for any tax year, although there was evidence to show 'that a certain proportion of cars, although not the same cars, was continuously without the state during the whole tax year.' \n202 \nU.S. 584, 594\n, 26 S.Ct. 714, 716. The comptroller made no reduction in the tax, and this action was affirmed by the Appellate Division (89 App.Div. 127, 84 N.Y.S. 1088), the Court of Appeals (177 N.Y. 584, 69 N.E. 1129) and on review here. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] In the Johnson Oil Refining Co. case, supra, this Court reaffirmed not less than three times that the State of domicile has jurisdiction to tax the personal property of its corporation unless such property has acquired an 'actual situs' in another State. And by 'actual situs' it meant, as its references to Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky, supra, and the Miller case indicate, what those cases required for 'actual situs' before the constitutional power of the domiciliary State to tax could be curtailed, namely continuous presence in another State which thereby supplants the home State and acquires the taxing power over personalty that has become a permanent part of the foreign State. Surely the situs which personal property may acquire for tax purposes in a State other than that of the owner's domicile cannot be made to depend on some undefined concept of 'permanence' short of a tax year, leaving the adequate size of the fraction of the tax year for judicial determination in each year. Such a doctrine would play havoc with the tax laws of the forty-eight states. It would multiply manifold the recognized difficulties of ascertaining the domicile of individuals. See State of Texas v. Florida, \n306 \nU.S. 398\n, 59 S.Ct. 563, 830, 121 A.L.R. 1179; District of Columbia v. Murphy, \n314 \nU.S. 441\n, 62 S.Ct. 303. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] In the most recent apportionment case to come before this Court, Nashville, C. & St. L. Ry. v. Browning, \n310 \nU.S. 362\n, 60 S.Ct. 968, 970, we merely sustained the application by the Tennessee Railroad Commission and the Tennessee Supreme Court (176 Tenn. 245, 140 S. W.2d 781) of a 'familiar and frequently sanctioned formula' for apportionment on a mileage basis against the claim of the inapplicability of this formula in the circumstances of that case because of the disparity in the revenue-producing capacity between the lines in and out of Tennessee. Mathematical exactitude in making the apportionment has never been a constitutional requirement. That is the essence of the Browning holding. No suggestion can be found at any stage of that litigation in any wise touching the present problem, namely, whether the domiciliary State is constitutionally limited in taxing all the movables that come within it except by the Union Transit doctrine, that a proportion which had during the entire tax year been within another State cannot be taxed in the domiciliary State. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] In speaking of 'occasional excursions to foreign parts' and 'random excursions' (202 U.S. at page 597, 26 S.Ct. at page 717), Mr. Justice Holmes merely put colloquially the legally significant fact that neither any specific cars nor any average of cars was so continuously in any other State as to have been withdrawn from the home State and to have established for tax purposes an adopted home State. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] And that the constitutional power of the domiciliary State to tax vessels is precisely the same as its power to tax rolling stock is conclusively shown by the Court's reliance in the Miller case on a case decided a week before, namely Ayer & Lord Tie Co. v. Kentucky, \n202 \nU.S. 409\n, 26 S.Ct. 679, 6 Ann.Cas. 205. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] We need not consider here whether the jurisdiction of a state over air above it-as distinguished from the control of a private landowner over air above his land-affords a basis for taxation of planes which regularly fly over the state but do not regularly land within its borders. For in six of the seven states, other than Minnesota, over which petitioner's airplanes regularly fly, they also make regular scheduled landings. Plainly those states have jurisdiction to tax a proportionate part of their value and to that extent the judgment of the Minnesota Supreme Court, permitting taxation in full by the domicile, is erroneous, and the cause should be remanded for further proceedings. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The rule, generally applied, that vessels are taxable only by the domicile, Hays v. Pacific Mail S.S. Co., 17 How. 596, 597; St. Louis v. Wiggins Ferry Co., 11 Wall. 423, 430, 431, 432; Morgan v. Parham, 16 Wall. 471, 475; Transportation Co. v. Wheeling, \n99 \nU.S. 273, 279\n, 280 S.; Ayer & Lord Tie Co. v. Kentucky, \n202 \nU.S. 409, 421\n, 26 S.Ct. 679, 682, 6 Ann.Cas. 205; Southern Pacific Co. v. Kentucky, \n222 \nU.S. 63, 68\n, 69 S., 77, 32 S.Ct. 13, 14, 15, 18, is no exception to these rules. For vessels ordinarily move on the high seas, outside the jurisdiction of any state, and merely touch briefly at ports within a state. Hence they acquire no tax situs in any of the states at which they touch port, and are taxable by the domicile or not at all. See Pullman's Palace-Car Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n141 \nU.S. 18, 23\n, 11 S.Ct. 876, 878; Southern Pacific Co. v. Kentucky, supra, \n222 \nU.S. 75\n, 32 S.Ct. 17. The suggestion in the earlier cases, see Hays v. Pacific Mail S.S. Co., supra, 17 How. 600; City of St. Louis v. Wiggins Ferry Co., supra; Morgan v. Parham, supra, that vessels were to be taxed exclusively at the home port, whether or not it was the domicile, was rejected in Ayer & Lord Tie Co. v. Kentucky, supra, and Southern Pacific Co. v. Kentucky, supra, and has never been revived. But where the vessels operate wholly on waters within one state, they have been held to be taxable there, Old Dominion Steamship Co. v. Virginia, \n198 \nU.S. 299\n, 25 S.Ct. 686, 3 Ann.Cas. 1100, and not at the domicile, Southern Pacific Co. v. Kentucky, supra, \n222 \nU.S. 67, 72\n, 32 S.Ct. 14, 16, a result which, like the rule of apportionment in taxing railroad cars, avoids the burden of multiple taxation. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Similarly taxes by the state of domicile or other states on the carrier's entire property including rolling stock have been sustained if apportioned according to mileage, Pittsburgh, etc., R. Co. v. Backus, \n154 \nU.S. 421\n, 14 S.Ct. 1114; Adams Express Co. v. Ohio State Auditor, \n165 \nU.S. 194\n, 17 S.Ct. 305; Id., \n166 \nU.S. 185\n, 17 S. Ct. 604; American Express Co. v.

Weeks, \n297 \nU.S. 135\n, 56 S.Ct. 426. Likewise gross receipts taxes, if properly apportioned or otherwise limited to receipts from business done within the state, have been upheld, Erie R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, 21 Wall. 492; State of Maine v. Grand Trunk R. Co., \n142 \nU.S. 217\n, 12 S.Ct. 121, 163, as explained in Galveston, etc., R. Co. v.

Minnesota, \n246 \nU.S. 450\n, 38 S.Ct. 373; Pullman Co. v. Richardson, \n261 \nU.S. 330\n, 43 S.Ct. 366; cf. New York, Lake Erie & W.R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n158 \nU.S. 431\n, 15 S.Ct. 896. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] It is true that here there is no evidence of the average number of planes present within Minnesota or any other state during the tax year. But where the movement through the state is regular and continuous, as it is here and was not in the Miller case, apportionment may be made by showing the plane mileage or route mileage within and without the state. Pullman's Palace-Car Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n141 \nU.S. 18\n, 11 S.Ct. 876; Nashville C. & St. L. Ry. v. Browning, \n310 \nU.S. 362\n, 60 S.Ct. 968, and cases cited. The Minnesota court here did not rest its decision on the ground that petitioner had sought to apportion by mileage instead of by average number of cars, and had introduced no evidence to support the latter type of apportionment. If it had it might well have remanded the cause to permit any deficiencies of proof to be remedied. It held rather that regardless of the nature of proof of apportionment Minnesota, as the state of the domicile, could tax the cars for their entire value.\n In this respect also the case is unlike the Miller case. There, as the record reveals, the carrier's evidence showed only the car mileage within and without the state, and its owned track mileage within and without the state. But since the cars moved over irregular routes without fixed schedules, car mileage afforded no basis of apportionment, without proof also that the cars were present in particular states with sufficient regularity to acquire a tax situs there. Owned track mileage likewise failed to afford a basis of apportionment, in the absence of some proof that the tracks were regularly used by the cars in question. Nor did the carrier lack opportunity to make fuller proof. The cause as it came here involved five successive tax years, as to each of which the carrier was afforded a hearing with opportunity to introduce evidence. The carrier having failed despite this repeated opportunity to introduce evidence which would, on any theory of apportionment, support a conclusion that any particular proportion of cars had acquired a tax situs elsewhere, this Court, as it pointed out, was not called upon to apply the rule of Pullman's Palace-Car Co. v. Pennsylvania, supra, or to consider whether, consistently with the commerce clause, property used as an instrumentality of commerce may be subjected to the risk of double taxation. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] In Union Refrigerator Transit Company v. Kentucky, \n199 \nU.S. 194\n, 26 S.Ct. 36, 4 Ann.Cas. 493, it appeared that the cars of the Transit Company, the taxpayer, moved in and out of Kentucky, the state of domicile. The Transit Company disclaimed on the record any effort to prove that it had any cars which never came within the state, and sought to establish the number 'permanently located' outside it only by proof of gross earnings within and without the state. In holding that the state of domicile could not tax tangible personal property 'permanently located in other states' (199 U.S. at page 201, 26 S.Ct. at page 36, 4 Ann.Cas. 493), it is clear that the Court was limiting the taxing power of the state of domicile to the extent that the cars moving between Kentucky and other states had, under the rule of apportionment, gained a tax situs outside the state because they were 'located and employed' there (199 U.S. at page 211, 26 S.Ct. at page 41, 4 Ann.Cas. 493). This is evident from its citation (199 U.S. at page 206, 26 S.Ct. at page 38, 4 Ann.Cas. 493) of Pullman's Palace-Car Company v. Pennsylvania, \n141 \nU.S. 18\n, 11 S.Ct. 876, and American Refrigerator Transit Company v. Hall, \n174 \nU.S. 70\n, 19 S.Ct. 599, as cases involving property 'permanently located' in the taxing states. Both cases involved rolling stock continuously moving into and out of the taxing state and sustained taxes upon a proportion of the carrier's total rolling stock based respectively upon the track mileage or upon the average number of cars used within the taxing state. Had the Court intended to exempt, from the domicile's power to tax, only property which never came into the domicile it would have been necessary for it to discuss also the contention that the Union Transit Company had been denied the equal protection of the laws because railroads were taxed only upon the value of their rolling stock used within the state determined by the proportionate mileage within the state. 199 U.S. at pages 202, 211, 26 S.Ct. at pages 36, 41, 4 Ann.Cas. 493. \n\n\n\n\n","78":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNORTHWESTERN E. CO. v. FEDERAL POWER COM'N(1944)\nNo. 195\nArgued: Decided: January 31, 1944\n\n\n\n As Amended Feb. 14, 1944. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 119, 120]\n\u00a0\n Mr. A. J. G. Priest, of New York City, for petitioners.\n Mr. Charles V. Shannon, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioners assert that an order of the Federal Power Commission made pursuant to its authority to prescribe a uniform system of accounts for electric utilities is invalid because in excess of the Commission's statutory power and in violation of the Fifth and Tenth Amendments to the Constitution.\n Northwestern Electric Company is an operating utility all of whose common shares are owned by American Power & Light Company. Shortly after organization Northwestern issued 100,000 shares of $100 par common stock to promoters. Later the transaction was entered on its books as 'Land and Water Rights' with a corresponding credit to 'Common Capital Stock'. Northwestern received no cash or property for the stock so issued. The company prospered and its common stock became valuable. In 1925 American purchased all the common stock for $5,095,946.48. In 1936 Northwestern was permitted by the regulatory authorities of the States of Oregon and Washington, in which it operates, to reduce the par value of its common stock from $100 to $35, thus reducing the outstanding common to $3,500,000. This reduction was \n\n[321 \nU.S. 119, 121]\n\u00a0\n made in order that the stock might then represent the fair value of the company's assets. Entries on the asset side were written down $6,500,000 to offset the reduction in common stock liability.\n Acting under  301(a) of the Federal Power Act of 19351 the Commission prescribed a uniform system of accounts for utilities and ordered reclassification of their electric plant accounts with necessary adjusting entries to reflect such new classification as of January 1, 1937. Northwestern submitted a classification and the Commission, after investigation, issued a report thereon and requested Northwestern to submit a plan for disposition of the item of $3,500,000 upon its books and recommended that the amount should be transferred to Account 107-Electric Plant Adjustments-pending submission of such a plan. Northwestern failed to comply with these requests and an order to show cause was issued upon which a hearing was held. The Commission found that the cost of the physical property was all represented by obligations issued by the company and that the common stock did not represent money or property received. The Commission further found that in the interest of consumers, investors, and the public, the $3,500,000 write-up to be entered in Account 107 should be disposed of by applying net income above preferred stock dividend requirements to its elimination, and added that this disposition would insure the company's receiving value to balance common stock liability and that dividends ought not to be paid on the common stock until it had an equivalent paid-in value. An order was entered requiring Northwestern to comply with the finding.\n The Commission granted a rehearing only as respects the required disposition of the asset item of $3,500,000, but refused a rehearing on all other matters involved in the \n\n[321 \nU.S. 119, 122]\n\u00a0\n case. Northwestern obtained a review in the Circuit Court of Appeals,2 which sustained the order as against Northwestern's contentions that the Commission was without power to make an order for the keeping of its accounts, because of existing State regulation; that the Commission's action was not sustained by the proofs before it, was an abuse of discretion, and constituted a denial of due process of law, since the system of accounts prescribed was to show the company's plant at the amount it cost rather than at its present fair value. Inasmuch as the rehearing was pending before the Commission on the disposition to be made of the write-up, the Circuit Court of Appeals declined to pass upon that matter. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n In connection with the rehearing, the Commission requested the company to suggest any disposition of the $3,500,000 item it thought appropriate. The company refused to make any suggestion, its position being that the entry should remain in Account No. 107. The result of permitting it thus to remain in the plant and property accounts of the company would be a continuance of a showing on its books of actual asset value to balance the outstanding common stock liability. The Commission reaffirmed its order and Northwestern again sought review in the Circuit Court of Appeals. American, which had been permitted to intervene, joined in the application for court review. The Circuit Court of Appeals refused to disturb the Commission's order. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n The Commission's power to prescribe a uniform system of accounting and to require Northwestern to keep accounts accordingly is not open to doubt. Its action was \n\n[321 \nU.S. 119, 123]\n\u00a0\n fully justified by the Act,5 the relevant provisions of which are within the legislative power. \n6\n The only inquiries now open are whether the order as to the disposition of the $3,500,000 item appearing in Account 107 goes beyond the Commission's statutory mandate or constitutional limitations. We hold that it does neither.\n The case presents only a question of proper accounting. In the light of the admitted fact that there has been a write-up of three and one-half million dollars on the asset side of the accounts to balance a stock liability created by the company in the same amount, which represents no value received for the stock issued, any accounting which limits plant items to their actual value when and as acquired demands that this write- up be eliminated from the accounts. Those in which the company previously carried the item were 'Land and Water Rights', 'Miscellaneous Non- Operating Intangible Capital', and 'Organization'. A mere write-up belongs in none of these accounts and cannot properly appear in any other account on the asset side of the ledger. If it should so remain, it would have to be in a new account reflecting present value in excess of actual cost which would, in effect, be a plant appreciation account and the Commission's form of accounting does not permit the carrying of any such item in the asset account since its system is a cost system of accounting.\n The question is whether the write-up must be written off the books in some manner. Northwestern says it \n\n[321 \nU.S. 119, 124]\n\u00a0\n should not be, but it offered no evidence before the Commission to show that in accounts based upon cost any such item should appear in plant account or elsewhere. There was expert evidence by Commission's witnesses that it must be eliminated. Novertheless the petitioners insist the Commission's order as to disposition is arbitrary.\n Although, as suggested in a brief filed by the American Institute of Accountants, the Commission's prescribed method of eliminating the write- up may not accord with the best accounting practice, it is sustained by expert evidence. It is not for us to determine what is the better practice so long as the Commission has not plainly adopted an obviously arbitrary plan. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n The objections based upon the Constitution are without merit and need but brief notice. That the accounting method prescribed interferes with the function of management to some extent is beside the point. \n8\n That the Commission's action prevents the company from redressing the deficiency of paid-in capital by entering among its assets appreciation of value subsequent to the issue of the common stock takes nothing from the company or the stockholders. Although if American had purchased the assets of Northwestern it might have been allowed to place among its assets on its own books the actual cost to it of the physical property of Northwestern, the fact is irrelevant upon the question whether Northwestern may carry a fictitious asset account representing estimated value of capital stock issued neither for money nor for property at exchange value.\n Nothing in the statute or the order prevents Northwestern keeping other accounts if it so desires which \n\n[321 \nU.S. 119, 125]\n\u00a0\n will give information with regard to estimated present appreciated value of its assets.\n We find nothing in the statute which would have prevented a readjustment of the common stock account or the earned surplus account if the company had been willing and had proposed such readjustment to bring the statutory accounts into line with the Commission's prescribed system.\n The Commission's order does not violate the reserved rights of the states under the Tenth Amendment. We are not here concerned with what the regulatory authorities of Oregon or Washington may or may not demand or permit. Whatever that action may be, it is subordinate to Congress' appropriate exercise of the commerce power. The Commission's order does not purport presently to affect or constrain action by the states within their fields.\n We are not called upon to make any decision as to the ability of the company legally to declare and pay dividends.\n The petitioners attack the regulations as in conflict with the powers and the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which also has regulatory power over Northwestern; but an examination of the statute and of the orders and proceedings of the Securities and Exchange Commission satisfies us that no conflict exists.\n The judgment is affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 49 Stat. 847, 854, 16 U.S.C.  825(a), 16 U.S.C.A.  825(a). \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] As authorized by Sec. 313(b), 49 Stat. 860, 16 U.S.C.  825l(b), 16 U.S.C.A.  825l(b). \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Northwestern Electric Co. v.

WARNER CO.(1944)\nNo. 362\nArgued: Decided: March 27, 1944\n\n\n\n Mr. Francis M. Shea, Asst. Atty. Gen., for petitioner. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 565, 566]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Samuel B. Fortenbaugh, Jr., of Philadelphia, Pa., for respondent.\n Mr. Abraham E. Freedman, of Philadelphia, Pa., for National Marine Engineers Beneficial Ass'n, amicus curiae by special leave of Court.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question in this case is whether Nicholas Rusin, a bargeman employed by respondent, is entitled to compensation under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, 44 Stat. 1424, 33 U.S. C.  901 et seq., 33 U.S.C.A.  901 et seq., for injuries received when a capstan bar, which he was using to shift the barge at a pier, pulled out and struck him upon the chest and caused him to fall. The answer turns on whether Rusin was a 'master or member of a crew of any vessel'. If he was, he is not entitled to the compensation because such persons are expressly excluded from the coverage of the Act by  2(3) and  3(a)(1).\n The Deputy Commissioner found that Rusin was a harbor worker, not a 'master or member of a crew', and granted him a compensation award. \n1\n The District Court upheld the Deputy Commissioner in a suit which respondent- employer brought to set aside the award. 45 F.Supp. 835. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. 137 F.2d 57. The case is here on a petition for a writ of certiorari which we granted because of the asserted failure of the court below to give proper effect to our decision in South Chicago Coal & Dock Co. v. Bassett, \n309 \nU.S. 251\n, 60 S.Ct. 544. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 565, 567]\n\u00a0\n The facts, as found by the Deputy Commissioner and amplified by additional evidence adduced before the District Court, are not in dispute. Rusin was employed as a boatman on a barge which at the time of the injury was afloat on the navigable waters of the United States. The barge had no motive power of its own and was moved either by towing or for shorter distances, by the winding up of a cable by means of a capstan operated by hand. The barge, which was documented as a vessel of the United States, never went to sea but was confined in its operation to waters within a radius of thirty miles of Philadelphia. Rusin was employed under a union contract with respondent which stated that all bargemen assigned to specific barges in active operation were to be paid a monthly salary of $ 80 and were to be provided with quarters. It also stated that that compensation was 'for all work performed by Bargemen in the operation of his own vessel' and that the rates provided were 'based upon all services and time required to safeguard and operate the barge fleet, including necessary pumping, watching, or other emergency duties on Sundays and holidays.' Rusin was continuously aboard. He bought his own meals and lived, ate, and slept on the barge. When he worked on any other boat, he received wages at an hourly rate, in addition to the monthly salary. Rusin had little experience as a seaman except that which he obtained as a bargeman. His duties consisted of taking general care of the barge. They included taking care of the lines at docks, tightening or slackening them as necessary; repairing leaks; pumping out the barge; taking lines from tugs; responding to whistles from the tugs; putting out navigational lights and signals; taking orders from the tugboat when being towed; moving the barge at piers by the capstan. He could not set the course or control or change it at any time. He was subject to orders of respondent's marine superintendent \n\n[321 \nU.S. 565, 568]\n\u00a0\n except when in tow at which time he was subject to the control of the tugboat captain. But he had no duties in connection with the handling of cargo and no shore duties. At the time of the injury he was the sole person aboard or employed upon the barge.\n Sec. 19(a) of the Act gives the Deputy Commissioner 'full power and authority to hear and determine all questions in respect of' claims for compensation. And  21(b) gives the federal district courts power to suspend or set aside, in whole or in part, compensation orders if 'not in accordance with law'. In considering those provisions of the Act in the Bassett case we held that the District Court was not warranted in setting aside such an order because the court would weigh or appraise the evidence differently. The duty of the District Court, we said, was to give the award effect, 'if there was evidence to support it.' 309 U.S. at page 258, 60 S.Ct. at page 548. And we stated that the findings of the Deputy Commissioner were conclusive even though the evidence permitted conflicting inferences. 309 U.S. page 260, 60 S.Ct. page 549. And see Parker v. Motor Boat Sales, Inc., \n314 \nU.S. 244, 246\n, 62 S.Ct. 221, 223. This statement of the finality to be accorded findings of the Deputy Commissioner under the Act was not new. It had been stated in substantially similar terms in Voehl v. Indemnity Insurance Co., \n288 \nU.S. 162, 166\n, 53 S.Ct. 380, 381, 87 A.L.R. 245, and in Del Vecchio v. Bowers, \n296 \nU.S. 280, 287\n, 56 S.Ct. 190, 193. The rule fashioned by these cases followed the design of the Act of encouraging prompt and expeditious adjudication of claims arising under it. 2 \n\n[321 \nU.S. 565, 569]\n\u00a0\n By giving a large degree of finality to administrative determinations contests and delays, which employees could ill afford and which might deprive the Act of much of its beneficent effect, were discouraged. Thus it is that the judicial review conferred by  21(b) does not give authority to the courts to set aside awards because they are deemed to be against the weight of the evidence. More is required. The error must be one of law, such as the misconstruction of a term of the Act.\n We think the award granted by the Deputy Commissioner had such an infirmity. \n 3\n\u00a0\n\n If the award were to stand, there would be brought within the Act a group of workers whom we do not believe Congress intended to include. The Senate Report makes clear that 'The purpose of this bill is to provide for com- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 565, 570]\n\u00a0\n pensation, in the stead of liability, for a class of employees commonly known as 'longshoremen'. These men are mainly employed in loading, unloading, refitting, and repairing ships.' S. Rep. No. 973, 69th Cong. 1st Sess., p. 16. We reviewed the history of the Act in the Bassett case and in the Parker case, and more recently in Davis v. Department of Labor & Industries, \n317 \nU.S. 249\n, 63 S.Ct. 225. As we noted in those cases, the Act was adopted to meet the difficulties engendered by the decision in Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, \n244 \nU.S. 205\n, 37 S.Ct. 524, L.R.A.1918C, 451, Ann.Cas.1917E, 900. And see Knickerbocker Ice Co. v. Stewart, \n253 \nU.S. 149\n, 40 S.Ct. 438, 11 A.L.R. 1145; State of Washington v. W. C. Dawson & Co., \n264 \nU.S. 219\n, 44 S.Ct. 302. That line of cases carved out a domain in which, according to a majority of this Court, state law could not constitutionally afford compensation to maritime employees. It was to fill that gap in the system of workmen's compensation that the present Act was passed. S. Rep. No. 973, supra, p. 16. But as we pointed out in the Bassett case, 309 U.S. pages 256, 257, 60 S.Ct. page 547, the effort to bring a master and members of a crew of a vessel under the Act was successfully opposed by the representatives of maritime employees. See Nogueira v. New York, N.H. & H.R. Co., \n281 \nU.S. 128, 136\n, 50 S.Ct. 303, 305; Warner v. Goltra, \n293 \nU.S. 155, 159\n, 160 S., 55 S.Ct. 46, 48. And the maritime unions which appeared as amicus curiae in the present case emphasize the importance of that exception. The liability of an employer under the Act is exclusive.  5. On the other hand, those who are not covered by it but who are protected by maritime law are entitled to maintenance and cure, a remedy not restricted to accidents. As we said in Aguilar v. Standard Oil Co., \n318 \nU.S. 724, 732\n, 63 S.Ct. 930, 934, 'In this respect it is a broader liability than that imposed by modern workmen's compensation statutes.' Moreover, seamen may sue under the Jones Act (41 Stat. 988, 1007, 46 U.S.C .  688, 46 U.S.C.A.  688) for injuries in the course of their employment. And in such actions assumption of risk is no defense. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co. v. Smith, \n305 \nU.S. 424\n, 59 S.Ct. 262. Or suit \n\n[321 \nU.S. 565, 571]\n\u00a0\n may be brought in admiralty for injuries caused by unseaworthiness of the vessel or its appurtenant appliances and equipment. Mahnich v. Southern Steamship Co., \n321 \nU.S. 96\n, 64 S.Ct. 455, and cases cited. These are basic rights. The maritime unions appearing in the present case maintain that those remedies are indeed superior to the relief afforded by the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Act. Whether they are more desirable than a system of compensation is not for us to determine. But where Congress has provided that those basic rights shall not be withheld from a class or classes of maritime employees it is our duty on judicial review to respect the command and not permit the exemption to be narrowed whether by administrative construction or otherwise.\n If a barge without motive power of its own can have a 'crew' within the meaning of the Act and if a 'crew' may consist of one man, we do not see why Rusin does not meet the requirements. A barge is a vessel within the meaning of the Act even when it has no motive power of its own, since it is a means of transportation on water. \n4\n See The General Cass, Fed.Cas. No. 5,307; Seabrook v. Raft, D.C., 40 F. 596; In re Eastern Dredging Co., D.C., 138 F. 942; City of Los Angeles v. United Dredging Co., 9 Cir., 14 F. 2d 364; The Robert W. Parsons, \n191 \nU.S. 17, 30\n, 24 S.Ct. 8, 12; Ellis v. United States, \n206 \nU.S. 246, 259\n, 27 S.Ct. 600, 602, 11 Ann.Cas. 589. A crew is generally 'equivalent to ship's company' as Mr. Justice Story said in United States v. Winn, 28 Fed.Cas. pages 733, 737, No. 16,740. But we pointed out in the Bassett case that the word does not have 'an absolutely unvarying legal significance'. 309 U.S. at page 258, 60 S.Ct. at page 548. We know of no reason why a person in sole charge of a vessel on a voyage is not as much a 'member of a crew' as he would be if there were two or more aboard. We said in the Bassett case \n\n[321 \nU.S. 565, 572]\n\u00a0\n that the term 'crew' embraced those 'who are naturally and primarily on board' the vessel 'to aid in her navigation'. 309 U.S. page 260, 60 S.Ct. page 549. But navigation is not limited to 'putting over the helm'. It also embraces duties essential for other purposes of the vessel. Certainly members of the crew are not confined to those who can 'hand, reef and steer'. Judge Hough pointed out in The Buena Ventura, D.C., 243 F. 797, 799, that 'every one is entitled to the privilege of a seaman who, like seamen, at all times contribute to the labor about the operation and welfare of the ship when she is upon a voyage.' And see The Minna, D.C., 11 F. 759; Disbrow v. Walsh Bros., D.C., 36 F. 607, 608 (bargeman). We think that 'crew' must have at least as broad a meaning under the Act. \n5\n For it is plain from the amendment exempting a 'master or member of a crew' that ship's company was not broght under the Act. And we are told by the Senate Report, as already noted, that the purpose of the legislation was to provide compensation for those who 'are mainly employed in loading, unloading, refitting, and repairing ships.' S. Rep. No. 973, supra.\n Rusin, unlike the employee in the Bassett case,6 did no work on the latter variety. He performed on the barge functions of the same quality as those performed in the maintenance and operation of many vessels. His were indeed different from the functions of any other 'crew' only as they were made so by the nature of the vessel and its navigational requirements. The contract under which he was employed stated that the compensation was 'based upon all services and time required to safeguard and operate the barge fleet.' The services rendered con- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 565, 573]\n\u00a0\n formed to that standard and no other. Rusin moreover had that permanent attachment to the vessel which commonly characterizes a crew. See A. L. Mechling Barge Line v. Bassett, 7 Cir., 119 F.2d 995.\n We conclude that only by a distorted definition of the word 'crew' as used in the Act could Rusin be restricted to the remedy which it affords and excluded from recovery under the Jones Act or be denied relief in admiralty. See Maryland Casualty Co. v. Lawson, 5 Cir., 94 F.2d 190; Loverich v. Warner Co., 3 Cir., 118 F.2d 690; Cantey v. McLain Line Inc., D.C., 32 F.Supp. 1023; Id., 2 Cir., 114 F.2d 1017, which we reversed in \n312 \nU.S. 667\n, 61 S.Ct. 829\n\n\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS concurs in the result. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Cf. the finding of the Deputy Commissioner in Diomede v. Lowe, D.C., 14 F.Supp. 380; Id., 2 Cir., 87 F.2d 296. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Sec. 14(b) makes the first instalment of compensation due on the fourteenth day after the employer has knowledge of the injury or death. Sec. 14(f) provides that if compensation, payable under an award, is not paid within ten days after it is due, a penalty of twenty per cent is added. Sec. 18 provides for the issuance by the Deputy Commissioner of a supplementary order when an employer is in default of payment of compensation due under an award for a period of thirty days. On such an order judgment and execution may be obtained in the federal district courts, the supplementary order of the Deputy Commissioner being final. Any waiver of the right to compensation under the Act is made invalid by  15(b). Agreements for compensation not made in accordance with the Act are outlawed.  15(a), 16. Limitations on the granting of interlocutory injunctions staying payment of compensation while an award is being contested are contained in  21(b). And the United States attorney is directed to appear on behalf of the Deputy Commissioner and defend compensation orders. 45 Stat. 490, 33 U.S.C.  921a. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] In Davis v. Department of Labor & Industries, \n317 \nU.S. 249\n, 63 S.Ct. 225, we were dealing with the problem of determining whether a socalled harbor worker could be compensated under a state act or must come under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Act. That problem was embarrassed by the fact that the line between federal and state domain had been drawn with reference to the rule of the Jensen case. There are no such complications here. In this case the line is one which Congress has drawn between two mutually exclusive federal systems. The risk of employees choosing the wrong remedy has been anticipated by Congress and at least partially avoided. For  13(d) provides that where recovery is denied to any person in a suit brought at law or in admiralty to recover damages on the ground that his remedy was under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Act the limitation of time for making application for an award begins to run 'only from the date of termination of such suit'. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] 'Vessel' is defined in Rev.Stat.  3, 1 U.S.C.  3, 1 U.S.C.A.  3, to include 'every description of water craft or other artificial contrivance used, or capable of being used, as a means of transportation on water.' \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] 'Seaman' as used in a particular context may of course have a broader meaning than 'crew'.

RAILWAY EXPRESS AGENCY(1944)\nNo. 343\nArgued: November 10, 1943Decided: February 28, 1944\n\n\n\n\n[321 \nU.S. 342, 343]\n\u00a0\n Mr. William G. McRae, of Atlanta, Ga., for petitioner.\n Mr. Blair Foster, of Atlanta, Ga., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice JACKSON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This hoary litigation presents the question whether a carrier by contracts with individual employees made in 1930 could supersede or expand terms of an agreement collectively bargained between the employer and the union in 1917, in view of the provisions of the Railway Labor Act of 1926, 45 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq., which was applicable when the controversy arose.\n Petitioner was a union designated to represent certain crafts and classes of employees of carriers by railroad. Employees here involved are agents at stations on the Seaboard Airline Railroad, who primarily are employees of the railway and secondarily of the railway express agency; they receive compensation from each employer. For some years they were represented by the union in bargaining collective agreements with predecessor express companies. The last was executed in 1917 and was assumed by this respondent March 1, 1929\n\n\n In 1930, the Express Company began to handle new business consisting mainly of carload shipments of perishables which formerly had been handled by the railroad company as freight. The Express Company thought the change in volume and character of its shipments warranted an adjustment of rates of pay applicable to certain of the agencies where the shipments originated. The Railway Labor Act of 1926, then in effect, provided that \n\n[321 \nU.S. 342, 344]\n\u00a0\n carriers and representatives of employees should give at least thirty days written notice of an intended change affecting rates of pay, rules, or working conditions, and should agree upon time and place of conference. \n1\n The collective agreement also provided that no change should be made in its terms 'until after 30 days notice in writing has been given.' The Express Company gave no such notice to the union signatory to the 1917 collective agreement. Instead, it gave individual notices to the agents that their compensation for such shipments would be $5.00 per car, the notices on one division going out on March 25, and those on another, April 8, and all becoming effective April 10, 1930. The agents involved, after various objections and negotiations, individually accepted the rate, although there is controversy as to whether their acceptance was wholly voluntary. For purposes of decision, however, we assume voluntary assent and that but for provisions of the Railway Labor Act valid individual contracts resulted.\n The local chairman of the union protested and insisted that collective bargaining must control the compensation of the agents. The Express Company declined to accede to the claims, and the union's claim that the agents must be compensated under the collective agreement remained unadjusted. Attempts to adjust were renewed by the general chairman, but no voluntary Board of Adjustment was agreed upon as provided under  3 of the 1926 Act. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[321 \nU.S. 342, 345]\n\u00a0\n The statutory Board was created in 1934,3 the Company refused to join the union in a petition, and the union on October 8, 1935, gave notice of its intention to refer the dispute to the Board. The Company challenged the Board's jurisdiction, a hearing was had, the bi-partisan board deadlocked, a referee was named, and in 1936 objections to jurisdiction were overruled and a hearing on the merits was directed. After the hearing the Board again deadlocked, again a referee was chosen, and on December 15, 1937, an award sustaining the claims that the agents were entitled to the compensation provided by the collectively bargained agreement was made, accompanied by a holding that the individual contracts were ineffective. The Company failed to comply with the award and in December 1939, after almost two years, the present action was commenced in the United States District Court. The district courts are given jurisdiction to enforce awards of the Board, its orders and findings being declared to be 'prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated.' Laws 1934, c. 691,  3, First ( p), 48 Stat. 1192, 45 U.S.C.A.  153, First (p). In June 1942 decision was rendered by which the district court enforced the Adjustment Board's award. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed upon the ground that the collective agreement had been superseded validly by the individual contracts and upon the further ground that the claims under collective agreements were barred by the statute \n\n[321 \nU.S. 342, 346]\n\u00a0\n of limitations. \n4\n These questions are unsettled ones important to the administration of the current Railway Labor Act, and we granted certiorari. \n 5\n\u00a0\n\n\n 1. \nThe Company contends that special voluntary individual contracts as to rates of pay, rules, and conditions of employment may validly be made, notwithstanding the existence of a collective agreement, and that the terms of the individual agreements supersede those of the collectively bargained one. If this were true, statutes requiring collective bargaining would have little substance, for what was made collectively could be promptly unmade individually. It is said, however, that in this case the agreements affect relatively few agents and that those are specially and uniquely situated. This apparently is true, for the application of the collective agreement results in an award of some $40,000 to one agent over the period and less than $2,000 to all of the others, and most of the awards are for a few hundred dollars.\n Collective bargaining was not defined by the statute which provided for it, but it generally has been considered to absorb and give statutory approval to the philosophy of bargaining as worked out in the labor movement in the United States. \n6\n From the first the position of labor with reference to the wage structure of an industry has been much like that of the carriers about rate structures. \n7\n It is insisted that exceptional situations often have an importance to the whole because they introduce competitions and discriminations that are upsetting to the entire structure. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 342, 347]\n\u00a0\n Hence effective collective bargaining has been generally conceded to include the right of the representatives of the unit to be consulted and to bargain about the exceptional as well as the routine rates, rules, and working conditions. Collective bargains need not and do not always settle or embrace every exception. It may be agreed that particular situations are reserved for individual contracting, either completely or within prescribed limits. Had this proposed rate of pay been submitted to the collective bargaining process it might have been settled thereby or might have resulted in an agreement that the company should be free to negotiate with the agents severally. But the Company did not observe the right of the representatives of the whole unit to be notified and dealt with concerning a matter which from an employee's point of view may not be exceptional or which may provide a leverage for taking away other advantages of the collective contract.\n The decision in J. I. Case Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, \n321 \nU.S. 64\n, 64 S.Ct. 576, decided today, considers more generally the relation of individual contracts to collective bargaining, and much that is said in that opinion is applicable here.\n We hold that the failure of the carrier to proceed as provided by the Railway Labor Act of 1926, then applicable, left the collective agreement in force throughout the period and that the carrier's efforts to modify its terms through individual agreements are not effective. The award, therefore, was in accordance with the law.\n\n 2. \nThe Circuit Court of Appeals held the claims barred by the state six-year statute of limitations applicable in the forum. It is true that the enforcement of the award results in entering judgment in 1942 on claims that began to accrue in 1930 and some of which ceased to accrue over six years before the suit in the District Court was commenced. It also is true that some of these have accrued in large amounts. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 342, 348]\n\u00a0\n If the action brought in 1939 had been a common-law action to recover wages, like that in Moore v. Illinois Cent. R. Co., \n312 \nU.S. 630\n, 61 S.Ct. 754, a quite different question of limitations would be presented. The action as brought, however, was not a common-law action but one of statutory origin to enforce the award of an administrative tribunal. A special two-year limitation from the time of award was prescribed by the federal statute,8 and this action was brought within that period. It is clear that as an action to enforce the award the suit was not barred, and it must therefore have been the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals that the statute barred the administrative tribunal from making an award on claims so old. There is no federal statute of limitations applicable to unadjusted claims which the Adjustment Board may consider. It is difficult to see how state statutes of limitations can restrict the power of the federal administrative tribunal to consider and adjust claims. Moreover, even if the six-year statute did apply to the claims under the collective contract, as we think it did not, proceedings on these claims were initiated before the Board well within that time.\n If, therefore, these claims are barred, it must be because the time occupied in their litigation before the Adjustment Board operates to defeat them. A state statute of limitations can hardly destroy a claim because the period of actual contest over it in a federal tribunal extends beyond the limitation period.\n Statutes of limitation, like the equitable doctrine of laches, in their conclusive effects are designed to promote justice by preventing surprises through the revival of \n\n[321 \nU.S. 342, 349]\n\u00a0\n claims that have been allowed to slumber until evidence has been lost, memories have faded, and witnesses have disappeared. The theory is that even if one has a just claim it is unjust not to put the adversary on notice to defend within the period of limitation and that the right to be free of stale claims in time comes to prevail over the right to prosecute them. Here, while the litigation shows no evidence of reckless haste on the part of either party, it cnanot be said that the claims were not timely pursued.\n Regrettable as the long delay has been it has been caused by the exigencies of the contest, not by the neglect to proceed. We find no basis for applying a state statute of limitations to cut off the right of the Adjustment Board to consider the claims or to absolve the courts from the duty to enforce an award.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS is of opinion that the judgment should be affirmed for the reasons given in the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals, 137 F.2d 46. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n]  6, 44 Stat. 582.

CONDUCTORS OF AMERICA v. PA. R. CO.(1944)\nNo. 200\nArgued: November 15, 1944Decided: December 11, 1944\n\n\n\n Mr. Rufus G. Poole, of Washington, D.C., for petitioners.\n Mr. John B. Prizer, of Philadelphia, Pa., for respondent, Pennsylvania R. Co.\n Mr. Bernard M. Savage, of Baltimore, Md., for respondent Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen. \n\n[323 \nU.S. 166, 167]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit for a declaratory judgment and for an injunction brought by the Order of Railway Conductors of America, an unincorporated association of railway employes, against the National Mediation Board, two of its members, the Pennsylvania Railroad, and a subsidiary railroad company, and the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, an unincorporated association of railway employes. For the sake of brevity, the plaintiffs will be called 'plaintiff'; the National Mediation Board and its members 'board'; the two railroads 'railroad', and the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen 'trainmen'.\n The complaint, after stating the capacity of the parties, makes the following allegations, which as will appear, are for purposes of decision, to be taken as true. The plaintiff is, and for years has been, the accredited representative and bargaining agent for the craft of road conductors of the railroad, and the trainmen the representative and agent of road brakemen, yard conductors, yard brakemen, baggagemen and switchtenders. The two associations have jointly negotiated contracts with the railroad, and such a contract was jointly negotiated effective April 1, 1927, and remains in force with respect to road conductors, except as modified concerning rates of pay. April 18, 1941, the railroad notified the two unions of its desire to alter the contract and, pursuant to the notice, the accredited representatives of the parties met in conference to adjust classifications of conductors, rates of pay for them, and the control of the so-called 'extraboard' for conductors. Due to disagreements between the two unions and the concurrence by the railroad in the attitude of the trainmen, representatives of the conductors withdrew from the joint negotiation and served notice of withdrawal on the railroad. Two weeks thereafter the railroad and the \n\n[323 \nU.S. 166, 168]\n\u00a0\n trainmen signed a new agreement covering the matters under consideration. Certain provisions agreed upon between the railroad and the trainmen were in violation of sections of the Railway Labor Act and, therefore, void, and the prior agreement between the conductors and the railroad remained in force, but, nevertheless, the railroad, since execution of the new agreement with the trainmen, has refused to bargain with the plaintiff.\n The railroad and the trainmen conspired and confederated in an unlawful programme designed to embarrass, discredit, and weaken the plaintiff and strengthen the trainmen and thus to influence, coerce, and interfere with the craft of road conductors in their choice of a bargaining representative, and the railroad and trainmen were guilty of acts intended, and effective, to that end. September 23, 1942, the trainmen filed with the board a request to be certified as the bargaining representative of the craft of road conductors.\n The plaintiff protested to the board against the holding of an election, charging that the railroad was interfering with, influencing, and coercing conductors by unlawfully bargaining with the trainmen with respect to road conductors' working conditions, in breach of the existing contract between the plaintiff and the railroad. The board illegally and wrongfully ruled that it had no jurisdiction to consider the charges, ordered an election to determine the bargaining representative for road conductors, held such election, and issued a certification based thereon that trainmen was the authorized representative of the road conductors, which election and certification are illegal, null and void, inter alia, because the board refused to perform its duties by investigating the alleged unfair labor practices.\n Based on the foregoing allegations, the relief demanded was (1) that the election and certification be annulled, vacated, and set aside; (2)(a) that the board and its mem- \n\n[323 \nU.S. 166, 169]\n\u00a0\n bers be restrained from holding any election for a bargaining representative of road conductors until it shall have considered the unfair labor practices and found that they do not amount to interference, influence or coercion, and that (b), in the alternative, the court declare the practices complained of constitute unlawful interference or coercion of the craft of road conductors, and restrain the board from holding an election until the board determines, after investigation and hearing, that such interference, influence or coercion has ceased; (3)(4) that it be declared that certain paragraphs of the agreement negotiated by the railroad and the trainmen were not negotiated with the accredited representative of the road conductors and were illegal infringements upon the exclusive right of the plaintiff, as accredited bargaining agent, to represent the conductors; (5) that it be declared that the plaintiff, as such representative, has the exclusive right to negotiate in collective bargaining for the conductors; (6) that the railroad be permanently enjoined from bargaining or making or maintaining agreements with trainmen, or any other union except the plaintiff on behalf of road conductors so long as the plaintiff is the accredited representative of that class; (7) that the railroad be directed to negotiate and bargain with the plaintiff, as representative of the road conductors, so long as the plaintiff remains such representative; (8) that the railroad be enjoined from directly or indirectly coercing, influencing, or interfering with the craft of road conductors and their choice of a representative under the Railway Labor Act; (9) further relief.\n After answers by the defendants the plaintiff moved for summary judgment on the pleadings and an affidavit which added nothing to the matters appearing in the pleadings. The District Court, though of opinion that there was no genuine issue, as to any material fact, presented under the motion for judgment, nevertheless de- \n\n[323 \nU.S. 166, 170]\n\u00a0\n nied the motion and also dismissed the complaint, because it held that the facts alleged and admitted failed to establish a cause of action.\n The plaintiff appealed to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Each appellee filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction. The motions were grounded on the decisions in Switchmen's Union of North America v. National Mediation Board, \n320 \nU.S. 297\n, 64 S.Ct. 95, and related cases,1 which were announced after the appeal had been taken. The plaintiff answered the motions. The court, being of opinion that, under the rulings in the Switchmen's Union case and others decided at the same term,2 it was without jurisdiction of the controversy, dismissed the appeal. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n The plaintiff applied to this court for certiorari to review the judgment dismissing the trainmen and the railroad. It did not seek review of the judgment granting the board's motion, and dismissing the board. That judgment is now final and beyond review here.\n The plaintiff based its claims to relief on  2, Third of the Railway Labor Act, which bans interference, influence, or coercion by either party in respect of designation of representatives by the other. The board, in denying jurisdiction, evidently relied on a portion of  2, Ninth, dealing with its function to investigate disputes concerning representation of employes, to hold elections, and to certify the authorized representative, as limiting its jurisdiction to the actual conduct of the investigation and election and precluding it from investigating prior action by any of the parties. The railroad relied upon  2, Tenth, \n\n[323 \nU.S. 166, 171]\n\u00a0\n which it asserts creates remedies for violation of  2, Third that are exclusive of all other remedies. The relevant portions of the sections thus relied on are quoted in the margin. \n4\n The contentions so made raise important questions, but we express no opinion on them since, for reasons about to be stated, we hold that we do not reach them within the framework of this case.\n The first and second prayers for relief seek the annulment and cancellation of the board's certification and an injunction against board action. Plainly no such relief should be granted, if at all, in the absence of the board as a party. Because of the failure to appeal from the order dismissing it, the board is not, and never can be, a party to this cause, either here or in the courts below.\n The third, fourth and fifth prayers in effect request a declaration that the plaintiff is the representative of the \n\n[323 \nU.S. 166, 172]\n\u00a0\n road conductors for bargaining notwithstanding the board's certification to the contrary. Since the election and certification could not be annulled without making the board a party, that result cannot be obtained by indirection by having the court substitute itself for the board, or declare, independently of the board, who is the accredited representative of the plaintiff.\n The sixth, seventh, and eighth prayers have a similar object. They ask an injunction to prevent the railroad from bargaining with trainmen and a mandatory injunction that it shall bargain with the plaintiff as representative of road conductors. Such a decree would be in the teeth of the board's certification. To grant such a decree would seem to be in contravention of the Switchmen's Union case, supra, and in any event such action should not be taken in the absence of the board.\n The eighth prayer seeks an injunction against future acts of the railroad coercive of the class of road conductors in choosing a bargaining representative. As we have seen, an election has been held, a representative chosen and the choice certified by the board. No election is now pending and there is no averment in the bill that an election is about to be held or that the railroad is about to commit any act in violation of the proscription of  2 Third. All that the bill does is to recite what the railroad has heretofore done in advance of the election already held and the certification based upon it. No case is stated requiring the entry of the injunction prayed.\n The arguments in this case covered a wide range and embodied suggestions as to possible remedies should the board act or refuse to act on charges of coercion antecedent to election and on possible remedies to deprive an employer guilty of influence and coercion of the benefits of the election and the board's certification.\n We do not reach the question reserved in General Committee v. M.-K.-T. R. Co., \n320 \nU.S. 323\n, 336, note 12, 64 S.Ct. 146, 152, \n\n[323 \nU.S. 166, 173]\n\u00a0\n whether the courts may afford relief where the board refuses or fails to perform a function delegated to it by Congress, since the board is not a party. Neither the pleadings nor the prayers disclose a situation in which the question of the availability of such remedies antecedent to, or subsequent to, the election or certification need be discussed or decided.\n The writ is accordingly dismissed.\n Writ dismissed.\n Mr. Justice RUTLEDGE concurs in the result. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] General Committee of Adjustment v.

ALLIANCE v. N.L.R.B.(1944)\nNo. 226\nArgued: Decided: June 5, 1944\n\n\n\n Mr. Ewart Harris, of Chicago, Ill., for petitioner.\n Mr. Francis C. Biddle, Atty. Gen., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The National Labor Relations Board having found that petitioner, in violation of the National Labor Rela- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 643, 644]\n\u00a0\n tions Act, had engaged in unfair labor practices, issued an order of cessation against it. 42 N.L.R.B. 1375. On a petition for review and a cross-petition of the Board for enforcement, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit sustained the order. 136 F.2d 175. Of the numerous issues before that court only two are open here, the importance of which led us to grant certiorari. \n320 \nU.S. 725\n, 64 S.Ct. 60. The questions are these: (1) In view of the petitioner's activities, is the conduct found by the Board to constitute unfair labor practices within the scope of the National Labor Relations Act; (2) if Congress has proscribed such conduct, has it exceeded its power to regulate commerce among the several States?\n The Polish National Alliance is a fraternal benefit society providing death, disability, and accident benefits to its members and their beneficiaries. Incorporated under the laws of Illinois, it is organized into 1,817 lodges scattered through twenty-seven States, the District of Columbia, and the Province of Manitoba, Canada. As the 'largest fraternal organization in the world of Americans of Polish descent', it had outstanding, in 1941, 272,897 insurance benefit certificates with a face value of nearly $160,000,000. Over 76% of these certificates were held by persons living outside of Illinois. At the end of that year, petitioner's assets totalled about $30,000,000, in cash, real estate in five States, United States Government bonds, foreign government bonds, bonds of various States and their political subdivisions, railroad, public utility, and industrial bonds, and stocks. From its organization in 1880 until the end of 1940, the Alliance spent over $7,000,000 for charitable, educational, and fraternal activities among its members. During the same period, it paid out over $38,000,000 in 'mortuary claims'.\n Petitioner directs from its home office in Chicago a staff of over 225 full and part-time organizers and field agents in twenty-six States whose traveling expenses are \n\n[322 \nU.S. 643, 645]\n\u00a0\n borne by Alliance and who receive commissions for new memberships. Since its 1939 convention Alliance has admitted no more 'social members'. Thereafter, all applicants have been required to buy insurance certificates providing various types of life, endowment, and term coverage. These policies contain the typical loan, cash surrender value, optional settlement, and dividend provisions. Petitioner spent over $10,000 for advertising outside of Illinois during 1941. It employs a Georgia credit company to report on the financial standing and character of the applicants, and reinsures substandard risks with an Indiana company.\n Alliance lodges are organized into 190 councils, 160 of which are outside the State of Illinois. The councils elect delegates to the national convention, and it in turn elects the executive and administrative officers. The Censor of Alliance is its ranking officer and he appoints an editorial staff which publishes a weekly paper distributed to members. Of the 6,857,556 copies published in 1941, about 80% were mailed to persons living outside of Illinois.\n This summary of the activities of Alliance and of the methods and facilities for their pursuit amply shows the web of money-making transactions woven across many State lines. An effective strike against such a business enterprise, centered in Chicago but radiating from it all over the country, would as a practical matter certainly burden and obstruct the means of transmission and communication across these state lines. Stoppage or disruption of the work in Chicago involves interruptions in the steady stream, into and out of Illinois, of bills, notices, and policies, the payments of commissions, the making of loans on policies, the insertion and circulation of advertising material in newspapers, and its dissemination over the radio. The effect of such interruptions on commerce is unmistakable. The load of interstate communication \n\n[322 \nU.S. 643, 646]\n\u00a0\n and transportation services is lessened, cash necessary for interstate business becomes unavailable, the business, interstate, of newspapers and radio stations suffer. Nor is this all. Alliance, it appears, plays a credit role in interstate industries, railroads, and other public utilities. In 1941, it acquired securities in an amount in excess of $11, 000,000, and sold or redeemed securities costing more than $7,500,000. Financial transactions of this magnitude cannot be impeded even temporarily without affecting to an extent not negligible the interstate enterprises in which the large assets of Alliance are invested. That such are the substantial effects on interstate commerce of dislocating labor practices by insurance companies, was established before the Labor Board in at least thirteen comparable situations. \n1\n The practical justification of such a conclusion has not heretofore been challenged. Considerations like these led the Board to find that petitioner's practices 'have a close, intimate, and substantial relation to trade, traffic, and commerce among the several States and tend to lead to labor disputes burdening and obstructing commerce', and were therefore 'unfair labor practices affecting commerce within the \n\n[322 \nU.S. 643, 647]\n\u00a0\n meaning of Section 2(6) and (7)', and as such, prohibited by  10 of the Wagner Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  160.\n By that Act, Congress in order to protect interstate commerce from adverse effects of labor disputes has undertaken to regulate all conduct having such consequences that constitutionally it can regulate. National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., \n301 \nU.S. 1, 31\n, 57 S.Ct. 615, 621, 108 A.L.R. 1352; National Labor Relations Board v. Fainblatt, \n306 \nU.S. 601\n, 607, \n307 \nU.S. 609\n, 59 S.Ct. 668, 672. With negligible exceptions, Congress did not exercise its power to regulate commerce prior to its enactment in 1887 of the Interstate Commerce Act. 24 Stat. 379, 49 U.S.C.  1 et seq., 49 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq. Since that time it has frequently chosen, as the Statutes at Large abundantly prove, to regulate only part of what it constitutionally can regulate. Again, half a dozen enactments, other than the National Labor Relations Act are sufficient to illustrate that when it wants to bring aspects of commerce within the full sweep of its constitutional authority, it manifests its purpose by regulating not only 'commerce' but also matters which 'affect', 'interrupt', or 'promote' interstate commerce. See, for example, Act of June 18, 1934,  2, 48 Stat. 979, 18 U.S.C.  420a, 18 U.S.C.A.  420a; Bituminous Coal Act, s 4-A, 50 Stat. 72, 83, 15 U.S.C.  834, 15 U.S.C.A.  834; Civil Aeronautics Act,  1(3), 52 Stat. 973, 977, 49 U.S.C.  401(3), 49 U.S.C.A.  401(3); Federal Employers' Liability Act,  1, as amended, 53 Stat. (part 2) 1404, 45 U.S.C.  51, 45 U.S.C.A.  51; Transportation Act of 1920,  307(a)(3), 41 Stat. 456, 471; Tennessee Valley Authority Act,  31, 49 Stat. 1075, 1080, 16 U.S.C.  831dd, 16 U.S.C.A.  831dd. In so describing the range of its control, Congress is not indulging stylistic preferences; it is mediating between federal and state authorities, and deciding what matters are to be taken over by the central Government and what to be left to the States. United States v. Darby, \n312 \nU.S. 100, 657\n, 61 S.Ct. 451, 132 A.L.R. 1430; Kirschbaum Co. v. Walling, \n316 \nU.S. 517\n, 62 S.Ct. 1116. And so in this Act, unlike some federal regulatory measures, see Federal Trade Comm. v. Bunte Bros., \n312 \nU.S. 349, 351\n, 61 S.Ct. 580, 581; Kirschbaum Co. v. Wal- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 643, 648]\n\u00a0\n ling, supra, 316 U.S. at pages 522, 523, 62 S.Ct. at pages 1119, 1120. Congress has explicitly regulated not merely transactions or goods in interstate commerce but activities which in isolation might be deemed to be merely local but in the interlacings of business across state lines adversely affect such commerce. By the Wagner Act, Congress gave the Board authority to prevent practices 'tending to lead to a labor dispute burdening or obstructing commerce or the free flow of commerce.'  2(7) of the National Labor Relations Act (49 Stat. 449, 450, 29 U.S.C.  152(7)), 29 U.S.C.A.  152(7). Congress therefore left it to the Board to ascertain whether proscribed practices would in particular situations adversely affect commerce when judged by the full reach of the constitutional power of Congress. Whether or no practices may be deemed by Congress to affect interstate commerce is not to be determined by confining judgment to the quantitative effect of the activities immediately before the Board. Appropriate for judgment is the fact that the immediate situation is representative of many others throughout the country, the total incidence of which if left unchecked may well become farreaching in its harm to commerce. National Labor Relations Board v. Fainblatt, supra, 306 U.S. at pages 607, 608, 59 S.Ct. at page 672\n\n\n We have said enough to indicate the ground for our conclusion that the Board was not unjustified in finding that the unfair labor practices found by it would affect commerce. And the undoubted fact that Alliance promotes, among Americans of Polish descent, interest in, and devotion to, the contributions that Pland has made to civilization does not subordinate its business activities to insignificance. Accordingly, the Board could find that its cultural and fraternal activities do not withdraw Alliance from amenability to the Wagner Act.\n In this aspect, the case we have before us presents a wholly new problem of the relation of federal authority to the business of insurance. The long series of insurance cases that have come to this Court for more than seventy- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 643, 649]\n\u00a0\n five years, from Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168, to New York Life Ins. Co. v. Deer Lodge County, \n231 \nU.S. 495\n, 34 S.Ct. 167, have invariably involved some exercise of state power resisted, in most instances, on the claim that it was impliedly forbidden by the Commerce Clause. Such was the context in which this Court decided again and again that the making of a contract of insurance is not interstate commerce and that, since the business of insurance is in effect merely a congeries of contracts, the States may, for taxing and diverse other purposes, regulate the making of such contracts and the insurance business free from the limitations imposed upon state action by the Commerce Clause. Constitutional questions that look alike often are altogether different and call for different answers because they bring into play different provisions of the Constitution or different exertions of power under it. Thus, federal regulation does not preclude state taxation and state taxation does not preclude federal regulation. Compare, for example, Heisler v. Thomas Colliery Co., \n260 \nU.S. 245\n, 43 S.Ct. 83, with Sunshine Coal Co. v. Adkins, \n310 \nU.S. 381\n, 60 S.Ct. 907.\n We have, therefore, now presented for the first time not an exercise of state but of national power in relation to the insurance business. And so the ultimate question is whether, in view of the relation between the activities of the insurance business before us and the operation of economic forces across state lines, the Constitution denies to Congress the power to say that the interplay of the insurance business and those economic forces is such that its power 'to regulate Commerce ... among the several States' Const. art. 1,  8, cl. 3, carriers with it the power to regulate the conduct here regulated by relevant legislation.\n The process of adjusting the interacting areas of national and state authority over commerce has been reflected in hundreds of cases from the very beginning of our history. Precisely the same kind of issues has plagued \n\n[322 \nU.S. 643, 650]\n\u00a0\n the two great Englishspeaking federations, the constitutions of which similarly distribute legislative power over business between central and subordinate governments. See  91 of the British North America Act, 1867, 30 & 31 Vict., c. 3, and Report of the (Canadian) Royal Commission on Dominion-Provincial Relations, (1940) Bk. II, c. IV;  51 of the Australia Constitution Act, 1900, 63 & 64 Vict., c. 12, and Report of the ( Australian) Royal Commission on the Constitution, (1929) c. XIV. These are difficulties inherent in such a federal constitutional system.\n The interpenetrations of modern society have not wiped out state lines. It is not for us to make inroads upon our federal system either by indifference to its maintenance or excessive regard for the unifying forces of modern technilogy. Scholastic reasoning may prove that no activity is isolated within the boundaries of a single State, but that cannot justify absorption of legislative power by the United States over every activity. On the other hand, the old admonition never becomes stale that this Court is concerned with the bounds of legal power and not with the bounds of wisdom in its exercise by Congress. When the conduct of an enterprise affects commerce among the States is a matter of practical judgment, not to be determined by abstract notions. The exercise of this practical judgment the Constitution entrusts primarily and very largely to the Congress, subject to the latter's control by the electorate. Great power was thus given to the Congress: the power of legislation and thereby the power of passing judgment upon the needs of a complex society. Strictly confined though far-reaching power was given to this Court: that of determining whether the Congress has exceeded limits allowable in reason for the judgment which it has exercised. To hold that Congress could not deem the activities here in question to affect what men of practical affairs would call commerce, and to deem them \n\n[322 \nU.S. 643, 651]\n\u00a0\n related to such commerce merely by gossamer threads and not by solid ties, would be to disrespect the judgment that is open to men who have the constitutional power and responsibility to legislate for the Nation.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS took no part in the consideration or disposition of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK, concurring.\n The National Labor Relations Act does not vest courts with power to review the evidence presented to the Labor Board and make independent findings of fact. 29 U.S.C.  160(e), 29 U.S.C.A.  160(e). Therefore the propriety of the Board's order in this case must be considered on the basis of the facts the Board found.\n The Board did not exercise jurisdiction and enter its order on a fact finding that petitioner's insurance activities merely affected commerce in types of interstate business other than its own. On this fact issue it made no finding at all. Its finding was that the petitioner being 'engaged in the insurance business' was 'engaged in commerce within the meaning of the Act.' This ultimate finding of fact rested on detailed subordinate findings which revealed the widespread interstate activities of the petitioner in carrying on its insurance business. As the Court's opinion points out, these insurance activities involved a 'steady stream, into and out of Illinois, of bills, notices, and policies, the payments of commissions, the making of loans on policies, the insertion and circulation of advertising material in newspapers, and its dissemination over the radio.' Only on the basis of the ultimate finding that petitioner was itself 'engaged in commerce' did the Board make the essential further finding that petitioner's refusal to bargain collectively with its employees had a 'close, intimate, and substantial relation to com- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 643, 652]\n\u00a0\n merce among the several States' and tended 'to lead to labor disputes burdening and obstructing commerce.'\n As a conclusion of law the Board stated that petitioner's unfair labor practices constituted 'unfair labor practices affecting commerce, within the meaning of Section 2(6) and (7) of the Act.' Section 2(6) defines the term 'commerce' to mean 'trade, traffic, ...'; and Section 2( 7) defines the term 'affecting commerce' to mean either 'in commerce' or 'burdening or obstructing commerce.' 49 Stat. 449, 450, 29 U.S.C. 152(6) and (7), 29 U.S.C.A.  152(6, 7). From the language of these definitions, and the Board's findings above described, it is apparent that the Board's conclusion of law that 'commerce' was 'affected' by petitioner's unfair labor practices rested upon its previous conclusion of fact that petitioner's insurance business was engaged in commerce. The Board concluded that, since the insurance business itself was engaged in commerce, petitioner's refusal to bargain, and the strike thereby provoked, would affect commerce. Compare Associated Press v. Labor Board, \n301 \nU.S. 103\n, 128-130, 57 S.Ct. 650, 653, 654, with Consolidated Edison Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, \n305 \nU.S. 197\n, 219-224, 59 S. Ct. 206, 212-214.\n The doctrine that Congress may provide for regulation of activities not themselves interstate commerce, but merely 'affecting' such commerce, rests on the premise that in certain fact situations the federal government may find that regulation of purely local and intrastate commerce is 'necessary and proper' to prevent injury to interstate commerce. Houston, E. & W. Texas Ry. v. United States, \n234 \nU.S. 342\n, 34 S. Ct. 833; Second Employers' Liability Cases, Mondou v. New York, N.H. & H.R. Co., \n223 \nU.S. 1, 46\n, 47 S., 32 S.Ct. 169, 173, 38 L.R.A.,N.S., 44; and see Wickard v. Filburn, \n317 \nU.S. 111, 121\n, 63 S.Ct. 82. In applying this doctrine to particular situations this Court properly has been cautious, and has required clear findings before subjecting local business to paramount federal regulation. City of Yonkers v. United States, \n320 \nU.S. 685\n, 64 S.Ct. 327, 330, and cases therein cited. It has insisted upon 'suitable regard to the principle that, \n\n[322 \nU.S. 643, 653]\n\u00a0\n whenever the federal power is exerted within what would otherwise be the domain of state power, the justification of the exercise of the federal power must clearly appear.' Id.; State of Florida v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 194, 211\n, 212 S., 51 S.Ct. 119, 123, 124; cf. Phelps Dodge Corp. v. Labor Board, \n313 \nU.S. 177, 196\n, 197 S., 61 S.Ct. 845, 853, 133 A.L.R. 1217; Securities and Exchange Comm'n v. Chenery Corporation, \n318 \nU.S. 80\n, 92-95, 63 S.Ct. 454, 461, 462.\n The Board not having found as a fact that petitoner's life insurance business affected interstate activities of other businesses, the first issue is whether the Board's findings that petitioner's insurance activities were conducted across state lines are supported by evidence. I think they are. This leads to the question, chiefly argued by both parties, 'Is the business of insurance commerce, and, when conducted across state lines, subject to federal regulation as such under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution?' For the reasons given in the Court's opinions in this case and in United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Association, \n322 \nU.S. 533\n, 64 S.Ct. 1162, I agree that the business of insurance is commerce, subject to federal regulation as such when conducted across state lines, and that the Board's order was proper.\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice MURPHY join in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Matter of John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co., 26 N.L.R.B. 1024; Matter of Life Insurance Co. of Virginia, 29 N.L.R.B. 246; Matter of Life Insurance Co. of Virginia, 31 N.L.R.B. 674; Matter of Supreme Liberty Life Insurance Co., 32 N.L.R.B. 94; Matter of Life Insurance Co. of Virginia, 38 N.L.R.B. 20; Matter of Colonial Life Insurance Co. of America, 42 N.L.R.

WILLIAMS(1944)\nNo. 345\nArgued: February 10, 1944Decided: April 10, 1944\n\n\n\n Appeal from the Supreme Court of the State of Florida. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 4, 5]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Raymer F. Maguire, of Orlandc, Fla., for appellant.\n Mr. John C. Wynn, of Tallahassee, Fla., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice JACKSON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellant Pollock questions the validity of a statute of the State of Florida making it a misdemeanor to induce advances with intent to defraud by a promise to perform labor and further making failure to perform labor for which money has been obtained prima facie evidence of intent to defraud. \n1\n It conflicts, he says, with the Thirteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution and with the antipeonage statute enacted by Congress thereunder. Claims also are made under the due process and equal \n\n[322 \nU.S. 4, 6]\n\u00a0\n protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment which we find it unnecessary to consider.\n Pollock was arrested January 5, 1943, on a warrant issued three days before which charged that on the 17th of October, 1942, he did 'with intent to injure and defraud under and by reason of a contract and promise to perform labor and service, procure and obtain money, to-wit: the sum of $ 5.00, as advances from one J. V. O'Albora, a corporation, contrary to the statute in such cases made and provided, and against the peace and dignity of the State of Florida.' He was taken before the county judge on the same day, entered a plea of guilty, and was sentenced to pay a fine of $100 and in default to serve sixty days in the county jail. He was immediately committed.\n On January 11, 1943, a writ of habeas corpus was issued by the judge of the circuit court, directed to the jail keeper, who is appellee here. Petition for the writ challenged the constitutionality of the statutes under which Pollock was confined and set forth that 'at the trial aforesaid, he was not told that he was entitled to counsel, and that counsel would be provided for him if he wished, and he did not know that he had such right. Petitioner was without funds and unable to employ counsel. He further avers that he did not understand the nature of the charge against him, but understood that if he owed any money to his prior employer and had quit his employment without paying the same, he was guilty, which facts he admitted.' The Sheriff's return makes no denial of these allegations, but merely sets forth that he holds the prisoner by virtue of the commitment 'based upon the judgment and conviction as set forth in the petition.' The Supreme Court of Florida has said that 'undenied allegations of the petition are taken as true.' \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[322 \nU.S. 4, 7]\n\u00a0\n The Circuit Court held the statutes under which the case was prosecuted to be unconstitutional and discharged the prisoner. The Supreme Court of Florida reversed. \n3\n It read our decisions in Bailey v. Alabama4 and Taylor v. Georgia5 to hold that similar laws are not in conflict with the Constitution in so far as they denounce the crime, but only in declaring the prima facie evidence rule. It stated that its first impression was that the entire Florida act would fall, as did that of Georgia, but on reflection it concluded that our decisions were called forth by operation of the presumption, and did not condemn the substantive part of the statute where the presumption was not brought into play. As the prisoner had pleaded guilty, the Florida court thought the presumption had played no part in this case, and therefore remanded the prisoner to custody. An appeal to this Court was taken and probable jurisdiction noted. \n 6\n\u00a0\n\n Florida advances no argument that the presumption section of this statute is constitutional, nor could it plausibly do so in view of our decisions. It contends, however, (1) that we can give no consideration to the presumption section because it was not in fact brought into play in the case, by reason of the plea of guilty; (2) that so severed the section denouncing the crime is constitutional.\n\n\n I.\n\n\n These issues emerge from an historical background against which the Florida legislation in question must be appraised.\n The Thirteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution, made in 1865, declares that involuntary servitude \n\n[322 \nU.S. 4, 8]\n\u00a0\n shall not exist within the United States and gives Congress power to enforce the article by appropriate legislation. \n7\n Congress on March 2, 1867, enacted that all laws or usages of any state 'by virtue of which any attempt shall hereafter be made to establish, maintain, or enforce, directly or indirectly, the voluntary or involuntary service or labor of any persons as peons, in liquidation of any debt or obligation, or otherwise,' are null and void, and denounced it as a crime to hold, arrest, or return a person to the condition of peonage. \n8\n Congress thus raised both a shield and a sword against forced labor because of debt.\n Clyatt v. United States was a case from Florida in which the Federal Act was used as a sword and an employer \n\n[322 \nU.S. 4, 9]\n\u00a0\n convicted under it. This Court sustained it as constitutional and said of peonage: 'It may be defined as a status or condition of compulsory service, based upon the indebtedness of the peon to the master. The basal fact is indebtedness. ... Peonage is sometimes classified as voluntary or involuntary; but this implies simply a difference in the mode of origin, but none in the character of the servitude. The one exists where the debtor voluntarily contracts to enter the service of his creditor. The other is forced upon the debtor by some provision of law. ... A clear distinction exists between peonage and the voluntary performance of labor or rendering of services in payment of a debt. In the latter case the debtor, though contracting to pay his indebtedness by labor or service, and subject, like any other contractor, to an action for damages for breach of that contract, can elect at any time to break it, and no law or force compels performance or a continuance of the service.' \n9\n\u00a0\n\n Then came the twice-considered case of Bailey v. Alabama,10 in which the Act and the Constitution were raised as a shield against conviction of a laborer under an Alabama act substantially the same as the one before us now. Bailey, a Negro, had obtained $15 from a corporation on a written agreement to work for a year at $12 per month, $10.75 to be paid him and $ 1.25 per month to apply on his debt. In about a month he quit. He was convicted, fined $30, or in default sentenced to hard labor for 20 days in lieu of the fine and 116 days on account of costs. The Court considered that the portion of the state law defining the crime would require proof of intent to defraud, and so did not strike down that part; nor was it expressly sustained, nor was it necessarily reached, for the prima facie evidence provision had been used to obtain a conviction. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 4, 10]\n\u00a0\n This Court held the presumption, in such a context, to be unconstitutional.\n Later came United States v. Reynolds and United States v. Broughton11 in which the Act of 1867 was sword again. Reynolds and Broughton were indicted under it. The Alabama Code authorized one under some circumstances to become surety for a convict, pay his fine, and be reimbursed by labor. Reynolds and Broughton each got himself a convict to work out fines and costs as a farm hand at $6.00 per month. After a time each convict refused to labor further and, under the statute, each was convicted for the refusal. This Court said, 'Thus, under pain of recurring prosecutions, the convict may be kept at labor, to satisfy the demands of his employer.' It held the Alabama statute unconstitutional and employers under it subject to prosecution.\n In Taylor v. Georgia12 the Federal Act was again applied as a shield, against conviction by resort to the presumption, of a Negro laborer, under a Georgia statute in effect like the one before us now. We made no effort to separate valid from invalid elements in the statute, although the substantive and procedural provisions were, as here, in separate, and separately numbered, sections. We said, 'We think that the sections of the Georgia Code upon which this conviction rests are repugnant to the Thirteenth Amendment and to the Act of 1867, and that the conviction must therefore be reversed.' Only recently in a case from Northern Florida a creditor-employer was indicted under the Federal Act for arresting a debtor to peonage, and we sustained the indictment. United States v. Gaskin. \n13\n\u00a0\n\n These cases decided by this Court under the Act of 1867 came either from Florida or one of the adjoining states. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 4, 11]\n\u00a0\n And these were but a part of the stir caused by the Federal Antipeonage Act and its enforcement in this same region. 14 This is not to intimate that this section, more than others, was sympathetic with peonage, for this evil has never had general approval anywhere, and its sporadic appearances have been neither sectional nor racial. It is mentioned, however, to indicate that the Legislature of Florida acted with almost certain knowledge in designing its successive 'labor fraud' acts in relation to our series of peonage decisions. The present Act is the latest of a lineage, in which its antecedents were obviously associated with the practice of peonage. This history throws some light on whether the present state act is one 'by virtue of which any attempt shall hereafter be made' to 'enforce involuntary servitude,' in which event the Federal Act declares it void.\n In 1891, the Legislature created an offense of two elements: obtaining money or property upon a false promise to perform service, and abandonment of service without just cause and without restitution of what had been obtained. \n15\n In 1905, this Court decided Clyatt v. United States, indicating that any person, including public officers, \n\n[322 \nU.S. 4, 12]\n\u00a0\n even if acting under state law, might be guilty of violating the Federal Act. In 1907, the Florida Legislature enacted a new statute, nearly identical in terms with that of Alabama. \n16\n In 1911, in Bailey v. Alabama, this Court held such an act unconstitutional. In 1913, the Florida Legislature repealed the 1907 act, but reenacted in substance the section demouncing the crime, omitting the presumption of intent from the failure to perform the service or make restitution. \n17\n In 1919, the Florida Supreme Court \n\n[322 \nU.S. 4, 13]\n\u00a0\n held this act, standing alone, void under the authority of Bailey v. Alabama. \n18\n Whereupon, at the session of 1919, the present statute was enacted, including the prima facie evidence provisions, notwithstanding these decisions by the Supreme Court of Florida and by this Court. The Supreme Court of Florida later upheld a conviction under this statute on a plea of guilty, but declined to pass on the presumption section, because, as in the present case, the plea of guilty was thought to make its consideration unnecessary. 19 The statute was re-enacted without substantial change in 1941. Again in 1943 it was re-enacted despite the fact that the year before we held a very similar Georgia statute unconstitutional in its entirety. \n20\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n II.\n\n\n The State contends that we must exclude the prima facie evidence provision from consideration because in fact it played no part in producing this conviction. Such was the holding of the State Supreme Court. We are not concluded by that holding, however, but under the circumstances are authorized to make an independent determination. \n21\n\u00a0\n\n[322 \nU.S. 4, 14]\n\u00a0\n What the prisoner actually did that constituted the crime cannot be gleaned from the record. The charge is cast in the words of the statute and is largely a conclusion. It affords no information except that Pollock obtained $5 from a corporation in connection with a promise to work which he failed to perform, and that his doing so was fraudulent. If the conclusion that the prisoner acted with intent to defraud rests on facts and not on the prima facie evidence provisions of the statute, none are stated in the warrant or appear in the record. None were so set forth that he could deny them. He obtained the money on the 14th of October, 1942, and the warrant was not sought until January 2, 1943. Whether the original advancement was more or less than $5, what he represented or promised in obtaining it, whether he worked a time and quit, or whether he never began work at all are undisclosed. About all that appears is that he obtained an advancement of $5 from a corporation and failed to keep his agreement to work it out. He admitted those facts and the law purported to supply the element of intent. He admitted the conclusion of guilt which the statute \n\n[322 \nU.S. 4, 15]\n\u00a0\n made prima facie thereon. He was fined $20 for each dollar of his debt, and in default of payment was required to atone for it by serving time at the rate of less than 9\u00f5 per day.\n Especially in view of the undenied assertions in Pollock's petition we cannot doubt that the presumption provision had a coercive effect in producing the plea of guilty. The statute laid its undivided weight upon him. The legislature had not even included a separability clause. \n22\n Of course the function of the prima facie evidence section is to make it possible to convict where proof of guilt is lacking. No one questions that we clearly have held that such a presumption is prohibited by the Constitution and the federal statute. The Florida Legislature has enacted and twice re-enacted it since we so held. We cannot assume it was doing an idle thing. Since the presumption was known to be unconstitutional and of no use in a contested case, the only explanation we can find for its persistent appearance in the statute is its extra-legal coercive effect in suppressing defenses. It confronted this defendant. There was every probability that a law so recently and repeatedly enacted by the legislature would be followed by the trial court, whose judge was not required to be a lawyer. The possibility of obtaining relief by appeal was not bright, as the event proved, for Pollock had to come all the way to this Court and was required, and quite regularly, to post a supersedeas bond of $500, a hundred times the amount of his debt. He was an illiterate Negro laborer in the toils of the law for the want of $5. Such considerations bear importantly on the decision of a prisoner even if aided by counsel, as Pollock was not, whether to plead guilty and hope for leniency or to fight. It is plain that, had his plight after conviction \n\n[322 \nU.S. 4, 16]\n\u00a0\n not aroused outside help, Pollock himself would have been unheard in any appellate court.\n In the light of its history, there is no reason to believe that the law was generally used or especially useful merely to punish deceit. Florida has a general and comprehensive statute making it a crime to obtain money or property by false pretenses23 or commit 'gross fraud or cheat at common law.' \n24\n These appear to authorize prosecution for even the petty amount involved here. 25 We can conceive reasons, even if unconstitutional ones, which might lead well-intentioned persons to apply this Act as a means to make otherwise shiftless men work,26 but if in addition to this general fraud protection employers as a class are so susceptible to imposition that they need extra legislation, or workmen so crafty and subtle as to constitute a special menace, we do not know it, nor are we advised of such facts.\n We think that a state which maintains such a law in face of the court decisions we have recited may not be heard to say that a plea of guilty under the circumstances is not due to pressure of its statutory threat to convict him on the presumption.\n As we have seen, Florida, persisted in putting upon its statute books a provision creating a presumption of fraud \n\n[322 \nU.S. 4, 17]\n\u00a0\n from the mere nonperformance of a contract for labor service three times after the courts ruled that such a provision violates the prohibition against peonage. To attach no meaning to such action, to say that legally speaking there was no such legislation, is to be blind to fact. Since the Florida Legislature deemed these repeated enactments to be important, we take the Legislature at its own word. Such a provision is on the statute books for those who are arrested for the crime, and it is on the statute books for us in considering the practical meaning of what Florida has done.\n In the view we take of the purpose and effect of this prima facie evidence provision it is not material whether as matter of state law it is regarded as an independent and severable provision.\n\n\n III.\n\n\n We are induced by the evident misunderstanding of our decisions by the Florida Supreme Court, in what we are convinced was a conscientious and pains-taking study of them, to make more explicit the basis of constitutional invalidity of this type of statute.\n The undoubted aim of the Thirteenth Amendment as implemented by the Antipeonage Act was not merely to end slavery but to maintain a system of completely free and voluntary labor throughout the United States. Forced labor in some special circumstances may be consistent with the general basic system of free labor. For example, forced labor has been sustained as a means of punishing crime,27 and there are duties such as work on \n\n[322 \nU.S. 4, 18]\n\u00a0\n highways28 which society may compel. But in general the defense against oppressive hours, pay, working conditions, or treatment is the right to change employers. When the master can compel and the laborer cannot escape the obligation to go on, there is no power below to redress and no incentive above to relieve a harsh overlordship or unwholesome conditions of work. Resulting depression of working conditions and living standards affects not only the laborer under the system, but every other with whom his labor comes in competition. Whatever of social value there may be, and of course it is great, in enforcing contracts and collection of debts, Congress has put it beyond debate that no indebtedness warrants a suspension of the right to be free from compulsory service. This congressional policy means that no state can make the quitting of work any component of a crime, or make criminal sanctions available for holding unwilling persons to labor. The federal statutory test is a practical inquiry into the utilization of an act as well as its mere form and terms.\n Where peonage has existed in the United States it has done so chiefly by virtue of laws like the statute in question. Whether the statute did or did not include the presumption seems to have made little difference in its practical effect. In 1910, in response to a resolution of the House of Representatives, the Immigration Commission reported the results of an investigation of peonage among immigrants in the United States. \n29\n It found that no general system of peonage existed, and that sentiment did not support it anywhere. On the other hand, it found sporadic cases of probable peonage in every state in the Union except Oklahoma and Connecticut. It pointed out that 'there has probably existed in Maine the most com- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 4, 19]\n\u00a0\n plete system of peonage in the entire country,' in the lumber camps. \n30\n In 1907, Maine enacted a statute, applicable only to lumber operations but in its terms very like the section of the Florida statute we are asked to sep- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 4, 20]\n\u00a0\n arate and save. The law was enforcible in local courts not of record. The Commission pointed out that the Maine statute, unlike that of Minnesota31 and the statutes of other states in the West and South, did not contain a prima facie evidence provision. But as a practical matter the statute led to the same result. \n32\n\u00a0\n\n[322 \nU.S. 4, 21]\n\u00a0\n The fraud which such statutes purport to penalize is not the concealment or misrepresentation of existing facts, such as financial condition, ownership of assets, or data relevant to credit. They either penalize promissory representations which relate to future action and conduct or they penalize a misrepresentation of the present intent or state of mind of the laborer. \n33\n In these 'a hair perhaps divides the false and true.' Of course there might be provable fraud even in such matters. One might engage for the same period to several employers, collecting an advance from each, or he might work the same trick of hiring out and collecting in advance again and again, or otherwise provide proof that fraud was his \n\n[322 \nU.S. 4, 22]\n\u00a0\n design and purpose. But in not one of the cases to come before this Court under the antipeonage statute has there been evidence of such subtlety or design. In each there was the same story, a necessitous and illiterate laborer, an agreement to work for a small wage, a trifling advance, a breach of contract to work. In not one has there been proof from which we fairly could say whether the Negro never intended to work out the advance, or quit because of some real or fancied grievance, or just got tired. If such statutes have ever on even one occasion been put to a worthier use in the records of any state court, it has not been called to our attention. If this is the visible record, it is hardly to be assumed that the off-the- record uses are more benign.\n It is a mistake to believe that in dealing with statutes of this type we have held the presumption section to be the only source of invalidity. On the contrary, the substantive section has contributed largely to the conclusion of unconstitutionality of the presumption section. The latter in a different context might not be invalid. Indeed, we have sustained the power of the state to enact an almost identical presumption of fraud, but in transactions that did not involve involuntary labor to discharge a debt. James-Dickinson Farm Mortgage Co. v. Harry. \n34\n Absent this feature any objection to prima facie evidence or presumption statutes of the state can arise only under the Fourteenth Amendment, rather than under the Thirteenth. In deciding peonage cases under the latter this Court has been as careful to point out the broad power of the state to create presumptions as it has to point out its power to punish frauds. It 'has frequently recognized the general power of every legislature to prescribe the evidence which shall be received, and the effect of that evidence, in the courts of its own government. ... In the exercise of this \n\n[322 \nU.S. 4, 23]\n\u00a0\n power numerous statutes have been enacted providing that proof of one fact shall be prima facie evidence of the main fact in issue; and where the inference is not purely arbitrary, and there is a rational relation between the two facts, and the accused is not deprived of a proper opportunity to submit all the facts bearing upon the issue, it has been held that such statutes do not violate the requirements of due process of law.' Bailey v. Alabama. \n35\n But the Court added that 'the state may not in this way interfere with matters withdrawn from its authority by the Federal Constitution, or subject an accused to conviction for conduct which it is powerless to proscribe.' \n36\n And it proceeded to hold that the presumption, when coupled with the other section, transgressed those limits, for while it appeared to punish fraud the inevitable effect of the law was to punish failure to perform labor contracts.\n In Taylor v. Georgia both sections of the Act were held unconstitutional. There the State relied on the presumption to convict. But it was not denied that a state has power reasonably to prescribe the prima facie inferences to be drawn from circumstantial evidence. It was the substance of the crime to establish which the presumption was invoked that gave a forbidden aspect to that method of short-cutting the road to conviction. The decision striking down both sections was not, as the Supreme Court of Florida thought, a casual and unconsidered use of the plural. Mr. Justice Byrnes knew whereof he spoke; unconstitutionality inhered in the substantive quite as much as in the procedural section and no part of the invalid statute could be separated to be salvaged. Where in the same substantive context the State threatens by statute to convict on a presumption, its inherent coercive power is such that we are constrained to hold that it is equally use- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 4, 24]\n\u00a0\n ful in attempts to enforce involuntary service in discharge of a debt, and the whole is invalid.\n It is true that in each opinion dealing with statutes of this type this Court has expressly recognized the right of the state to punish fraud, even in matters of this kind, by statutes which do not either in form or in operation lend themselves to sheltering the practice of peonage. Deceit is not put beyond the power of the state because the cheat is a laborer nor because the device for swindling is an agreement to labor. But when the state undertakes to deal with this specialized form of fraud, it must respect the constitutional and statutory command that it may not make failure to labor in discharge of a debt any part of a crime. It may not directly or indirectly command involuntary servitude, even if it was voluntarily contracted for.\n From what we have said about the practical considerations which are relevant to the inquiry whether any particular state act conflicts with the Antipeonage Act of 1867 because it is one by which 'any attempt shall hereafter be made to establish, maintain, or enforce' the prohibited servitude, it is apparent that we should not pass on hypothetical acts. Reservation of the question of the validity of an act unassociated with a presumption now, as heretofore, does not denote approval. The Supreme Court of Florida has held such an act standing alone unconstitutional. \n37\n A considerable recorded experience would merit examination in relation to any specific labor fraud act. \n38\n We do not enter upon the inquiry further than the Act before us. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 4, 25]\n\u00a0\n Another matter deserves notice. In Bailey v. Alabama it was observed that the law of that state did not permit the prisoner to testify to his uncommunicated intent, which handicapped him in meeting the presumption. In Taylor v. Georgia the prisoner could not be sworn, but could and did make a statement to the jury. In this Florida case appellee is under neither disability, but is at liberty to offer his sworn word as against presumptions. These distinctions we think are without consequence. As Mr. Justice Byrnes said in Taylor v. Georgia, the effect of this disability 'was simply to accentuate the harshness of an otherwise invalid statute.'\n We impute to the Legislature no intention to oppress, but we are compelled to hold that the Florida Act of 1919 as brought forward on the statutes as  817.09 and 817.10 of the Statutes of 1941, F.S.A. are, by virtue of the Thirteenth Amendment and the Antipeonage Act of the United States, null and void. The judgment of the court below is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed and remanded.\n\n Mr. Justice REED, dissenting.\n The Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States reads as follows:\n'Section 1. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.\n\n'Section 2. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.'\n\n To meet the problem of peonage, that is, 'compulsory service in payment of a debt,'1 Congress enacted the legislation set out in note 8 of the Court's opinion which de- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 4, 26]\n\u00a0\n clared invalid laws of a state by virtue of which involuntary service is enforced or attempted to be enforced in liquidation of any debt. This Court reiterates today in accordance with its previous rulings that the second section of the Florida statute,  817.10, set out in note one of today's opinion, is invalid under the Thirteenth Amendment and the Federal Act because this second section enforces labor by fear of conviction of the crime denounced in the first section. The second section provides that a refusal to perform labor for which one has contracted and been paid in advance is prima facie evidence of an intent to defraud under the first section which makes it a crime to obtain money with intent to defraud under a contract to perform labor. This conclusion is accepted as a proper interpretation of the Federal prohibitions. In the effort to obliterate compulsory labor to satisfy a debt Congress may invalidate a state law which coerces that labor by fear of a conviction obtained by a presumption of law which may be false in fact. Taylor v. Georgia, \n315 \nU.S. 25\n, 62 S.Ct. 415.\n However much peonage may offend our susceptibilities, and however great our distaste for a statute which is capable of use as a means of imposing peonage on the working man, the present statute is, in this Court, no more immune than any other which a state may enact, from the salutary requirement that its constitutionality must be presumed, and that the burden rests on him who assails it, on constitutional grounds, to show that it is either unconstitutional on its face or that it has been or will be in fact so applied as to deny his constitutional rights.\n This Court now holds, as it has held before that when the presumption section is applied in the trial of a criminal charge under the substantive section, both are invalid and a conviction thus obtained by resort to a presumption of law which may be false in fact, cannot be sustained. But the Court's opinion fails to bridge the gap between \n\n[322 \nU.S. 4, 27]\n\u00a0\n these earlier decisions of the Court and its present conclusion that the substantive provision, when resorted to alone as the basis for a sentence on an admission of guilt, is likewise invalid, because of the mere existence of the presumption section.\n Whether this conclusion rests upon the ground that the State of Florida cannot constitutionally make it a penal offense for a laborer fraudulently to procure advances of wages for which he intends to render no service or upon the ground that the presumption section has in fact operated in this case to coerce petitioner's plea of guilty, the one is plainly without support in law and the other is without support in the record.\n So far as the decision of the Court rests on the ground that the substantive section is unconstitutional on its face, the decision necessarily proceeds on the assumption that because of the Thirteenth Amendment a state is without power to punish a workman who fraudulently procures an advance of a wage when he intends not to work for it, or that the two sections in law and in fact are inseparable in their application so that the substantive section is tainted by the presumption section, although in this case it is not shown to have influenced the plea of guilty.\n We are given no constitutional reason for saying that a state may not punish the fraudulent procurement of an advance of wages as well as the giving of a check drawn on a bank account in which there are no funds, or any other course of conduct which the common law has long recognized, as the procuring of money or property by fraud or deceit. There is of course no constitutional reason why Florida should not punish fraud in labor contracts differently from fraud in other classes of contracts. Legislation need not seek to correct every abuse by a single enactment. The state may select its objective. Whitney v. California, \n274 \nU.S. 357, 370\n, 47 S.Ct. 641, 646; Tigner v. Texas, 310 U.S. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 4, 28]\n\u00a0\n 141, 149, 60 S.Ct. 879, 883, 130 A.L.R. 1321. The Constitution does not require that all persons should be treated alike but only that those in the same class shall receive equal treatment.\n Not only has the Supreme Court of Florida held as a matter of law that the two sections of the statute now before us are separable,2 but it is obvious that as a matter of law the presumption section is not called into operation where, as here, the accused does not go to trial but pleads guilty to the substantive charge. In rejecting these conclusions as to the separability of the two sections, we take it that the Court is not rejecting the Supreme Court of Florida's interpretation of the Florida statute, but rather than it concludes as a matter of fact that the presumption section is so all-pervasive in its operation that we must \n\n[322 \nU.S. 4, 29]\n\u00a0\n conclude without further proof that it so operated in petitioner's case as to coerce his plea of guilty to the charge of violating the substantive section.\n But neither the present record nor any facts of which we can take judicial notice lend support to that conclusion. For all that appears petitioner had no defense to the charge even though the substantive section had stood alone. Unless we are to presume that the statute can only be given an unconstitutional application, we cannot say that petitioner had any defense to the charge of fraud to which he pleaded guilty, and certainly we cannot treat the presumption section as depriving him of a defense which he did not have.\n The Court apparently concludes that the enactment and maintenance of the presumption section, after a determination here of its invalidity, makes the entire statute invalid on its face. This result is reached by assuming that the existence of the presumption section coerces involuntary labor under the contract by fear of conviction for violation of the first or substantive section. We cannot properly take judicial notice of such an effect. If pleaded and proven a different situation would emerge.\n The petition for habeas corpus in this case can hardly be said to go farther than object to conviction on the ground of the unconstitutionality of the Florida statute as a whole. No coercion to plead guilty is alleged. The statements in the petition as to lack of counsel and of knowledge of the elements of the offense are referred to in the Court's opinion but we do not understand that the Court relies upon them. No use was made of the presumption section at the trial. Petitioner pleaded guilty to the substantive crime. No allegations or proof appear in the record that the Florida statute was used or applied to promote peonage or involuntary servitude of petitioner or to coerce his plea of guilty. The decision is in effect that \n\n[322 \nU.S. 4, 30]\n\u00a0\n because the two sections standing together are capable of being used in violation of the Thirteenth Amendment and the peonage act, each must be taken to be invalid on its face. The presumption of constitutionality of statutes is a safeguard wisely conceived to keep courts within constitutional bounds in the exercise of their extraordinary power of judicial review. It should not be disregarded here.\n We cannot conclude that a statute which merely punishes a fraud in a contract, as the first section does if considered alone, violates the provision of the Thirteenth Amendment against involuntary servitude or is null and void under 8 U.S.C.  56, 8 U.S.C.A.  56, because it is an attempt to enforce compulsory service for a debt. Conviction under the statute results not in peonage, work for a debt, but in punishment for crime, probably in the county work house. Cf. United States v. Reynolds, \n235 \nU.S. 133, 149\n, 35 S.Ct. 86, 90. The conception embodied in the Court's opinion that the fear of conviction for his fraud might compel the defendant to work as agreed is without basis in the record. At any rate fear of punishment is supposed to be a deterrent to crime.\n The conviction should be affirmed.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE joins in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Florida statute under which Pollock is held was enacted as Chapter 7917 of the Acts of 1919.

No. 747, 61st Cong., 3d Sess. \n\n[\nFootnote 30\n] The operation of the system is described as follows:\n'In late years the natives who formerly supplied the labor for the logging concerns in that State have been engaged in the paper mills, and the lumber companies have been compelled to import laborers, largely foreigners, from other States. Boston is the chief labor market for the Maine forests. The employment agents misrepresent conditions in the woods, and frequently tell the laborers that the camps will be but a few miles from some town where they can go from time to time for recreation and enjoyment. Arriving at the outskirts of civilization the laborers are driven in wagons a short distance into the forests and then have to walk sometimes 60 or 70 miles into the interior, the roads being impassable for vehicles. The men will then be kept in the heart of the forest for months throughout the winter, living in a most rugged fashion and with no recreation whatever. A great many of them have rebelled against this treatment, and they have left their employers by the score. The lumbermen having advanced transportation and supplies have appealed to the legislature for protection. In February, 1907, a bill became a law making it a crime for a person to 'enter into an agreement to labor for any lumbering operation or in driving logs and in consideration thereof receive any advances of goods, money, or transportation, and unreasonably and with intent to defraud, fail to enter into said employment as agreed and labor a sufficient length of time to reimburse his employer for said advances and expenses.' Judges in municipal courts and trial justices were given jurisdiction to try cases under this law, and the act provided that it would take effect immediately upon approval. When this bill was before the legislature, requests were made by citizens interested in factories and other industries that the provisions of the statute be made to protect all employers of labor. The attorney who introduced the bill on behalf of the lumber interests which he represented, has stated that he had refused to accede to these requests, inasmuch as he believed the provision should not be extended. The protection granted by the statute, therefore, was restricted to a favored class, persons interested in 'lumbering operations and in driving logs.\" Peonage Report, supra note 29, p. 447. \n\n\n[\nFootnote 31\n] Minnesota Stat., 1941,  620.64. \n[\nFootnote 32\n] 'There is no provision in the Maine statute that 'the failure or refusal of any employee to perform such labor or render such services in accordance with his contract or to pay in money the amount for such transportation or such advancement shall be prima facie evidence of his intent to defraud; as appears in the contract-labor law of Minnesota and in the statutes of other States in the West and the South. However, justices of the peace in Maine have decided indiscriminately that, in order to obtain a conviction under the law of that State, it is necessary to show only that the laborer obtained the 'advances' and failed 'to labor a sufficient length of time to reimburse his employer.'\n'A justice at Houlton, Maine, who is a lawyer by profession, told the attorney representing the peonage committee that he decided in cases brought under the contract-labor law that 'the burden of proof is upon the defendant,' who must show to the court 'beyond a reasonable doubt that he had no intent to defraud.' This justice added that once in a while if a laborer has a really good excuse he will let him off, as he believes 'every man has some rights, although he may be poor.' Another justice of the peace at Patten, Maine, stated that if it was shown that a laborer had obtained the advances and had not worked sufficiently to settle for them he found the defendant guilty without considering the question of intent to defraud. This seems to be the general attitude of the rural justices of Maine toward the contract-labor law.\n\n'Considerable peonage has resulted from this statute. The law has been vigorously enforced. Soon after its passage prosecutions were commenced in the lumber regions, and the jail at Dover, the county seat of one of the large lumber counties of Maine, was crowded with laborers convicted of defrauding their employers out of 'advances of goods, money or transportation.'\n\n'Involuntary servitude results in utilizing this statute to intimidate laborers to work against their will. On account of the vigorous methods pursued in enforcing the above-described law, it soon became known throughout the lumber region of Maine that any laborer was liable to imprisonment who refused to work according to the provisions of his contract until he had settled for all advances, no matter what misrepresentations may have been made to induce him to enter into the agreement. The contract-labor law has become a club which the foremen and superintendents draw upon the laborers who refuse to go to work or to continue at work. If a man leaves his employer before settling for advances, he will be pursued and apprehended, or someone will telephone to the constable, who will arrest the laborer. He will then be brought before the justice, and 'sent down the river,' to prison; or if he consents to labor until he shall have reimbursed for all advances and the fine and cost of the prosecution, the employer will settle with the court and constable and will take the laborer back into the forest. No doubt many of the laborers never attempt to escape, although they may consider that they have been basely deceived about the conditions of labor.' Peonage Report, supra note 29, pp. 448-49. \n\n\n[\nFootnote 33\n] The Court at one time said, 'The law gives a different effect to a representation of existing facts, from that given to a representation of facts to come into existence. To make a false representation the subject of an indictment, or of an action, two things are generally necessary, viz ., that it should be a statement likely to impose upon one exercising common prudence and caution, and that it should be the statement of an existing fact. A promissory statement is not, ordinarily, the subject either of an indictment or of an action.' Sawyer v. Prickett, 19 Wall. 146, 160. \n\n[\nFootnote 34\n] \n273 \nU.S. 119\n, 47 S.Ct. 308. \n\n[\nFootnote 35\n] \n219 \nU.S. 219, 238\n, 31 S.Ct. 145, 150. \n[\nFootnote 36\n] \n219 \nU.S. 219, 239\n, 31 S.Ct. 145, 151. \n\n[\nFootnote 37\n] Goode v.

Alabama, \n219 \nU.S. 219, 242\n, 31 S.Ct. 145, 152. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The Supreme Court of Florida said (14 So.2d 700): 'This is not the first challenge of the act which has appeared in this court. The identical matter was considered in Phillips v. Bell, 84 Fla. 225, 94 So. 699, where the court concluded that the portion of the law defining the crime was harmonious with the Thirteenth Amendment and observed, without deciding the point, that if the part referring to the prima facie character of certain evidence should be pronounced unconstitutional the ruling would not affect the remainder.'\n The court then took up Bailey v. Alabama, \n211 \nU.S. 452\n, 29 S.Ct. 141, and noted as to it: 'We think it very significant that the court remarked upon the lack of doubt that the offenses defined could be made a crime. Gist of the decision, as we understand it, was, summarizing, that the part of the law describing the crime and the one providing for the presumption were not interdependent and that if, in the prosecution, the state did not resort to the latter the validity of the former would be unaffected.'\n Later, speaking of our opinion in the Taylor case, the Florida court said:\n'The section anent presumptive evidence had been relied upon to secure a conviction so the court again had for determination the question of the constitutionality of the first section when the second was brought into play. Not being faced with that problem here we conclude that the first Bailey decision and ours in Phillips v. Bell are in accord and that they in turn are not in conflict with the rulings in the Second Bailey case and Taylor v. State of Georgia, supra.' \n\n\n\n\n\n","84":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPOPE v. UNITED STATES(1944)\nNo. 26\nArgued: October 16, 1944Decided: November 6, 1944\n\n\n\n\n[323 \nU.S. 1, 2]\n\u00a0\n Mr. George R. Shields, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[323 \nU.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Francis M. Shea, Asst. Atty. Gen., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question for decision is whether Congress exceeded its constitutional authority in enacting the Special Act of February 27, 1942, 56 Stat. 1122,1 by which, 'not- \n\n[323 \nU.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n withstanding any prior determination' or 'any statute of limitations', it purported to confer jurisdiction on the Court of Claims to 'hear (and) determine', and directed it to 'render judgment' upon, certain claims of petitioner against the Government in conformity to directions given in the Act.\n Petitioner brought the present proceeding in the Court of Claims to recover upon his claims as specified and sanctioned by the Special Act. The court dismissed the proceeding on the ground that the Act was unconstitutional. 53 F.Supp. 570, 100 Ct.Cl. 375. It thought that in requiring the court to make a mathematical calculation of the amount of petitioner's claims upon the basis of data enumerated in the Act and to give judgment for the amount so ascertained, notwithstanding the rejection of those claims in an earlier suit in the Court of Claims, the Act was an unconstitutional encroachment by Congress upon the judicial function of the court. Holding that it was free to ignore the congressional command because given without constitutional authority, the court gave judgment dismissing the proceeding.\n The case comes here on petition for certiorari which assigns as error the ruling below that the Congressional mandate was without constitutional authority. Because of the importance of the questions involved we issued the \n\n[323 \nU.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n writ, \n321 \nU.S. 761\n, 64 S.Ct. 846. For reasons which will presently appear, we hold that we have jurisdiction to review the judgment below.\n Several years before the enactment of the Special Act, petitioner brought suit in the Court of Claims to recover amounts alleged to be due upon his contract with the Government for the construction of a tunnel as a part of the water system of the District of Columbia. The construction involved certain excavation and certain filling of the excavated space, in part with concrete and in part with dry packing and grout. Dry packing consists of closely packed broken rock, into which is pumped the grout, a thin liquid mixture of sand, cement and water, which, when it hardens, serves to solidify and strengthen the dry packing.\n Included in the demands for which the suit was brought were certain claims which are now asserted in this proceeding. They comprise a claim for additional excavation and concrete work alleged to have been required because of certain orders of the contracting officer, and a claim for dry packing and grout furnished by petitioner and placed by him in certain excavated space outside the so-called 'B' line shown on the contract drawings. The 'B' line marked the outer limits of the tunnel beyond which, by the terms of the contract, petitioner was not to be paid for excavation.\n In the first suit it appeared that petitioner sought recovery for excavation, for which he had not been paid, of the space at the top of the tunnel where the contracting officer had lowered the 'B' line by three inches, thus decreasing the space for the excavation for which the contract authorized payment to be made. The Court of Claims denied recovery of this item. The contracting officer had also directed the omission of certain timber supports or lagging required by the contract to be placed on the side walls of certain sections of the tunnel. Cave-ins from the sides resulted, making it necessary that the caved-in \n\n[323 \nU.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n material be removed and that the resulting space be filled with concrete, all at increased expense to petitioner. The Court of Claims made findings showing the amount of the additional excavation and concrete work claimed, but denied recovery on these items because the order of the contracting officer for the additional work involved a change in the contract which was not in writing as the contract required.\n The Court of Claims also denied petitioner's claim for dry packing and grout. It was of opinion that the Government had received the benefit of and was liable for whatever dry packing petitioner had done and for so much of the grout as had actually found its way into the dry packed space and had remained there. But it denied recovery because of deficiency in the proof as to the extent of this space. The only proof offered was the 'liquid method' of computation, based on the number of bags of cement used in the preparation of all the grout furnished by petitioner, the cement constituting a fixed proportion of the grout. The court held, with the Government, that the seepage of the grout into areas outside that dry packed rendered the liquid method an unreliable measure for determining either the volume of the dry packing or the amount of the grout required for it. The court gave judgment accordingly, while allowing to petitioner other claims upon his contract with which we are not here concerned. Petitioner's motions for a new trial were denied by the Court of Claims, and this Court denied certiorari. \n303 \nU.S. 654\n, 58 S.Ct. 761\n\n\n The Special Act of Congress directed the Court of Claims to 'render judgment at contract rates upon the claims' of petitioner for 'certain work performed for which he has not been paid, but of which the Government has received the use and benefit', and gave jurisdiction to this Court to review the judgment by certiorari. Section 2 of the Act defined the work to be compensated as 'the excavation and concrete work found by the court to \n\n[323 \nU.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n have been performed by the said Pope in complying with certain orders of the contracting officer, whereby the plans for the work were so changed as to lower the upper 'B' or 'pay' line three inches, and as to omit the timber lagging from the side walls of the tunnel; and for the work of excavating materials which caved in over the tunnel arch and for filling such caved-in spaces with dry packing and grout, as directed by the contracting officer, the amount of dry packing to be determined by the liquid method as described by the court and based on the volume of grout actually used, and the amount of grout to be as determined by the court's previous findings based on the number of bags of cement used in the grout actually pumped into the dry packing.' The Act further directed that the court should consider as evidence in the case 'any or all evidence' taken by either party in the earlier suit, 'together with any additional evidence which may be taken.'\n The Court of Claims in construing the Special Act said (53 F.Supp. page 571, 100 Ct.Cl. page 379): 'A rereading of Section 2 of the act will show that the task which the court is directed to perform is a small and unimportant one. It is directed to refer to its previous findings, take certain cubic measurements and certain numbers of bags of cement which are recited there by reference, multiply those figures by the several unit prices stipulated in the contract for the several kinds of work, add the results, and render judgment for the plaintiff for the sum. If this reading of Section 2 is correct, not only does the special act purport to confer upon the plaintiff the unusual privilege of litigating the same case a second time in a court which once finally decided it, and applying a second time for a review in the Supreme Court of the United States, which once considered and denied such a review. The special act also purports to decide the ques- \n\n[323 \nU.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n tions of law which were in the case upon its former trial and would, but for the act, be in it now, and to decide all questions of fact except certain simple computations.' So construed it thought the Special Act directed the Court of Claims to decide again the case or controversy which it had decided in the first suit, 'to decide it for the plaintiff, and give him a judgment for an amount' determined by a 'simple computation, based upon data referred to in the special act.' This it concluded Congress could not 'effectively direct'.\n For this conclusion it relied upon United States v. Klein, 13 Wall. 128, in which this Court ruled that Congress was without constitutional power to prescribe a rule of decision for a case pending on appeal in this Court so as to require it to order dismissal of the suit in which the Court of Claims had given judgment for the claimant. Decision was rested upon the ground that the judicial power over the pending appeal resided with this Court in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, and that Congress was without constitutional authority to control the exercise of its judicial power and that of the court below by requiring this Court to set aside the judgment of the Court of Claims by dismissing the suit.\n As the opinion in the Klein case pointed out, pages 144, 145 of 13 Wall., the Act of March 17, 1866, 14 Stat. 9, conferred on the Court of Claims judicial power by giving it authority to render final judgments in those cases and controversies which, pursuant to existing statutes, had been previously litigated before it. By later statutes this authority was extended to future cases and the Court has since exercised the judicial power thus conferred upon it. See Ex parte Bakelite Corp'n, \n279 \nU.S. 438, 454\n, 49 S.Ct. 411, 414; United States v. Jones, \n119 \nU.S. 477\n, 7 S.Ct. 283. We do not consider just what application the principles announced in the Klein case could rightly be given to a case in which Congress sought, pendente lite, to set aside a judgment of the Court of Claims in favor \n\n[323 \nU.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n of the Government and to require relitigation of the suit. For we do not construe the Special Act as requiring the Court of Claims to set aside the judgment in a case already decided or as changing the rules of decision for the determination of a pending case.\n Before the Special Act the claims of petitioner on his contract with the Government had been passed upon judicially and merged in a judgment which was final. United States v. Jones, supra; In re Sanborn, \n148 \nU.S. 222, 225\n, 13 S.Ct. 577, 578; Luckenbach S.S. Co. v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 533\n, 536 et seq., 47 S.Ct. 186, 187. This Court denied certiorari, and the judgment, which remains undisturbed by any subsequent legislative or judicial action, conclusively established that petitioner was not entitled to recover on his claims. The Special Act did not purport to set aside the judgment or to require a new trial of the issues as to the validity of the claims which the Court had resolved against petitioner. While inartistically drawn the Act's purpose and effect seem rather to have been to create a new obligation of the Government to pay petitioner's claims where no obligation existed before. And such being its effect, the Act's impact upon the performance by the Court of Claims of its judicial duties seems not to be any different than it would have been if petitioner's claims had not been previously adjudicated there.\n We perceive no constitutional obstacle to Congress's imposing on the Government a new obligation where there had been none before, for work performed by petitioner which was beneficial to the Government and for which Congress thought he had not been adequately compensated. The power of Congress to provide for the payment of debts, conferred by  8 of Article I of the Constitution, is not restricted to payment of those obligations which are legally binding on the Government. It extends to the creation of such obligations in recognition of claims which are merely moral or honorary. Roberts v. United \n\n[323 \nU.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n States, \n92 \nU.S. 41\n; United States v. Realty Company, \n163 \nU.S. 427\n, 16 S.Ct. 1120; United States v. Cook, \n257 \nU.S. 523\n, 42 S.Ct. 200; Cincinnati Soap Co. v. United States, \n301 \nU.S. 308, 314\n, 57 S.Ct. 764, 767. Congress, by the creation of a legal, in recognition of a moral, obligation to pay petitioner's claims plainly did not encroach upon the judicial function which the Court of Claims had previously exercised in adjudicating that the obligation was not legal. 2 Nor do we think it did so by directing that court to pass upon petitioner's claims in conformity to the particular rule of liability prescribed by the Special Act and to give judgment accordingly. State of Pennsylvania v. Wheeling & Belmont Bridge Co., 18 How. 421; Roberts v. United States, supra; see Cherokee Nation v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 476, 486\n, 46 S.Ct. 428, 432; cf. Klamath Indians v. United States, \n296 \nU.S. 244\n, 56 S.Ct. 212; United States v. Klamath Indians, \n304 \nU.S. 119\n, 58 S.Ct. 799.\n Congress having exercised its constitutional authority to impose on the Government a legally binding obligation, the decisive question is whether it invaded the judicial province of the Court of Claims by directing it to determine the extent of the obligation by reference, as directed, to the specified facts, and to give judgment for that amount. In answering, it is important that the Act contemplated that petitioner should bring suit on his claims in the usual manner, that the court was given jurisdiction to decide it, and that petitioner by bringing the suit has invoked, for its decision, whatever judicial power the court possesses. Cf. United States v. Realty Company, supra. In this posture of the case it is pertinent to inquire what, if any- \n\n[323 \nU.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n thing, Congress added to or subtracted from the judicial duties of the Court of Claims by directing that it consider the case and give judgment for the amount found to be due. Stripped of all complexities of detail the case is one in which, simply stated, petitioner has sought to enforce the obligation, which the Government has assumed, to pay him for work done and not paid for. Congress has in effect consented to judgment in an amount to be ascertained by reference to the specified data.\n When a plaintiff brings suit to enforce a legal obligation it is not any the less a case or controversy upon which a court possessing the federal judicial power may rightly give judgment, because the plaintiff's claim is uncontested or incontestable. Nor is it any the less so because the amount recoverable depends upon a mathematical computation based upon data to be ascertained which by the terms of the obligation are its measure. For in any case the court is called on to sanction, by its judgment, an alleged obligation in a proceeding in which the existence, validity and extent of the obligation, the existence of the data, and the correctness of the computation may be put in issue.\n The court below seems to have assumed that its only function under the Special Act was to make a calculation based upon data to be found in the Act and in the findings of the earlier suit. In view of the provisions of the Special Act for taking evidence and for considering the evidence in the first suit, we cannot say that all the earlier findings are to be deemed conclusive and that the court could not have been called on in this proceeding to determine judicially whether they are so. Whether the Act makes them conclusive, and if not, whether the evidence would establish the facts on which the Act predicates liability, are judicial questions. But if the facts be ascertained by proof or by stipulation, it is still a part of the judicial function to determine whether there is a legally binding obligation \n\n[323 \nU.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n and, if so, to give judgment for the amount due even though the amount depends upon mere computation.\n It is a judicial function and an exercise of the judicial power to render judgment on consent. A judgment upon consent is 'a judicial act.' United States v. Swift & Co., \n286 \nU.S. 106, 115\n, 52 S.Ct. 460, 462; Swift & Co. v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 311, 324\n, 48 S.Ct. 311, 314; see also Pacific R.R. v. Ketchum, \n101 \nU.S. 289\n; United States v. Babbitt, \n104 \nU.S. 767\n; Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis Ry. v. United States, \n113 \nU.S. 261\n, 5 S.Ct. 460; Thompson v. Maxwell Land-Grant Co., \n168 \nU.S. 451\n, 18 S.Ct. 121. It is likewise a judicial act to give judgment on a legal obligation which the court finds to be established by stipulated facts; J. I. Case Co. v. Labor Board, \n321 \nU.S. 332, 333\n, 64 S.Ct. 576, 578; Johnson v. Yellow Cab Co., \n321 \nU.S. 383, 388\n, 64 S.Ct. 622, 625; Equitable Society v. Com'r, \n321 \nU.S. 560, 561\n, 64 S.Ct. 722, 723; or when the defendant is in default. Voorhees v. Bank of the United States, 10 Pet. 449; Randolph v. Barrett, 16 Pet. 138; Clements v. Berry, 11 How. 398; Cooper v. Reynolds, 10 Wall. 308; Rio Grande Irrigation Co. v. Gildersleeve, \n174 \nU.S. 603\n, 19 S. Ct. 761; Fidelity & Deposit Co. v. United States, \n187 \nU.S. 315\n, 23 S.Ct. 120; Christianson v. King County, \n239 \nU.S. 356, 372\n, 36 S.Ct. 114, 120. It is a familiar practice and an exercise of judicial power for a court upon default, by taking evidence when necessary or by computation from facts of record, to fix the amount which the plaintiff is lawfully entitled to recover and to give judgment accordingly. Renner & Bussard v. Marshall, 1 Wheat. 215; City of Aurora v. West, 7 Wall. 82, 104; Clements v. Berry, supra; cf. Mayhew v. Thatcher, 6 Wheat. 129. In all these cases the court determines that the unchallenged facts shown of record establish a legally binding obligation; it adjudicates the plaintiff's right of recovery and the extent of it, both of which are essential elements of the judgment.\n We conclude that the effect of the Special Act was to authorize petitioner to invoke the judicial power of the Court of Claims, and that he has done so. It is true that \n\n[323 \nU.S. 1, 13]\n\u00a0\n Congress has imposed on that court, as it has on the courts of the District of Columbia, nonjudicial duties of an administrative or legislative character. See In re Sanborn, supra; Federal Radio Comm'n v. Nelson Co., \n289 \nU.S. 266, 275\n, 53 S.Ct. 627, 632, 89 A.L.R. 406. Those imposed on the Court of Claims are such as it has traditionally exercised ever since its original organization as a mere agency of Congress to aid it in the performance of its constitutional duty to provide for payment of the debts of the Government. Such administrative duties coexist with its judicial functions. See Ex Parte Bakelite Corp'n, supra, \n279 \nU.S. 452\n et seq., 49 S.Ct. 413. Its decisions rendered in its administrative capacity are not judicial acts, and their review, even though sanctioned by Congress, is not within the appellate jurisdiction of this Court. Gordon v. United States, 2 Wall. 561; and see the views expressed by Taney, C.J., in \n117 \nU.S. 697\n; In re Sanborn, supra. But notwithstanding the retention of such administrative duties by the Court of Claims, as in the case of the courts of the District of Columbia, Congress has provided for appellate review of the judgments of both courts rendered in their judicial capacity. And this Court has held by an unbroken line of decisions, that its appellate jurisdiction, conferred by Art. III, Sec. 2, Cl. 2 of the Constitution, extends to the review of such judgments of the Court of Claims; De Groot v. United States, 5 Wall. 419; United States v. Jones, supra; Nashville, C. & St. L. Ry. v. Wallace, \n288 \nU.S. 249, 263\n, 53 S.Ct. 345, 348, 87 A.L.R. 1191; and of the courts of the District of Columbia; Federal Radio Comm'n v. Nelson Bros. Co., supra, and cases cited.\n We have no occasion to consider what effect the imposition of non- judicial duties on the Court of Claims may have affecting its constitutional status as a court and the permanency of tenure of its judges. Cf. Williams v. United States, \n289 \nU.S. 553\n, 53 S.Ct. 751. It is enough that, although the Court of Claims, like the courts of the District of Columbia, exercises non-judicial duties, Congress has also \n\n[323 \nU.S. 1, 14]\n\u00a0\n authorized it as an inferior court to perform judicial functions whose exercise is reviewable here. The problem presented here is no different than if Congress had given a like direction to any district court to be followed as in other Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C.A.  41(20), cases. Its possession of non-judicial functions by direction of Congress presents no more obstacle to appellate review of its judicial determinations by this Court, than does the performance of like functions by the courts of the District of Columbia or by state courts whose exercise of judicial power, in the cases specified in Article III, Sec. 2, Cl. 1, of the Constitution, is reviewable here by virtue of Cl. 2 of Sec. 2. Compare Southwestern Bell Tel. Co. v. Oklahoma, \n303 \nU.S. 206\n, 58 S.Ct. 528, with Barnett v. Rogers, \n302 \nU.S. 655\n, 58 S.Ct. 363. See also, Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Co., \n211 \nU.S. 210, 225\n, 226 S., 29 S.Ct. 67, 69; Oklahoma Gas Co. v. Russell, \n261 \nU.S. 290\n, 43 S.Ct. 353.\n The Court of Claims' determination that the Special Act conferred upon it only non-judicial functions and hence that it had no judicial duty to perform was itself an exercise of judicial power reviewable here. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Brimson, \n154 \nU.S. 447\n, 14 S.Ct. 1125. The case is not one where the court below has made merely an administrative decision not subject to judicial review, without purporting to act judicially or to rule as to the extent of its judicial authority as the ground of its action or refusal to act. Postum Cereal Co. v. Calif. Fig Nut Co., \n272 \nU.S. 693\n, 47 S.Ct. 284. Jurisdiction to decide is jurisdiction to make a wrong as well as a right decision. Fauntleroy v.

Covington, of Brooklyn, N.Y., for appellant.\n Mr. R. T. Bushnell, of Boston, Mass., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice RUTLEDGE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The case brings for review another episode in the conflict between Jehovah's Witnesses and state authority. This time Sarah Prince appeals from convictions for violating Massachusetts' child labor laws, by acts said to be a rightful exercise of her religious convictions.\n When the offenses were committed she was the aunt and custodian of Betty M. Simmons, a girl nine years of age. Originally there were three separate complaints. They \n\n[321 \nU.S. 158, 160]\n\u00a0\n were, shortly, for (1) refusal to disclose Betty's identity and age to a public officer whose duty was to enforce the statutes; (2) furnishing her with magazines, knowing she was to sell them unlawfully, that is, on the street; and (3) as Betty's custodian, permitting her to work contrary to law. The complaints were made, respectively, pursuant to Sections 79, 80 and 81 of Chapter 149, Gen.Laws of Mass. (Ter.Ed.). The Supreme Judicial Court reversed the conviction under the first complaint on state grounds;1 but sustained the judgments founded on the other two.2 313 Mass. 223, 46 N. E.2d 755. They present the only questions for our decision. These are whether Sections 80 and 81, as applied, contravene the Fourteenth Amendment by denying or abridging appellant's freedom of religion and by denying to her the equal protection of the laws.\n Sections 80 and 81 form parts of Massachusetts' comprehensive child labor law. 3 They provide methods for enforcing the prohibitions of Section 69, which is as follows:\n'No boy under twelve and no girl under eighteen shall sell, expose or offer for sale any newspapers, magazines, periodicals or any other articles of merchandise of any \n\n[321 \nU.S. 158, 161]\n\u00a0\n description, or exercise the trade of bootblack or scavenger, or any other trade, in any street or public place.'\n\n Section 80 and 81, so far as pertinent, read:\n'Whoever furnishes or sells to any minor any article of any description with the knowledge that the minor intends to sell such article in violation of any provision of sections sixty-nine to seventy-three, inclusive, or after having received written notice to this effect from any officer charged with the enforcement thereof, or knowingly procures or encourages any minor to violate any provisions of said sections, shall be punished by a fine of not less than ten nor more than two hundred dollars or by imprisonment for not more than two months, or both.' (Section 80)\n\n'Any parent, guardian or custodian having a minor under his control who compels or permits such minor to work in violation of any provision of sections sixty to seventy-four, inclusive, ... shall for a first offence be punished by a fine of not less than two nor more than ten dollars or by imprisonment for not more than five days, or both; ....' (Section 81)\n\n The story told by the evidence has become familiar. It hardly needs repeating, except to give setting to the variations introduced through the part played by a child of tender years. Mrs. Prince, living in Brockton, is the mother of two young sons. She also has legal custody of Betty Simmons who lives with them. The children too are Jehovah's Witnesses and both Mrs. Prince and Betty testified they were ordained ministers. The former was accustomed to go each week on the streets of Brockton to distribute 'Watchtower' and 'Consolation,' according to the usual plan. \n4\n She had permitted the children to \n\n[321 \nU.S. 158, 162]\n\u00a0\n engage in this activity previously, and had been warned against doing so by the school attendance officer, Mr. Perkins. But, until December 18, 1941, she generally did not take them with her at night.\n That evening, as Mrs. Prince was preparing to leave her home, the children asked to go. She at first refused. Childlike, they resorted to tears and, motherlike, she yielded. Arriving downtown, Mrs. Prince permitted the children 'to engage in the preaching work with her upon the sidewalks.' That is, with specific reference to Betty, she and Mrs. Prince took positions about twenty feet apart near a street intersection. Betty held up in her hand, for passersby to see, copies of 'Watch Tower' and 'Consolation.' From her shoulder hung the usual canvas magazine bag, on which was printed 'Watchtower and Consolation 5\u00f5 per copy.' No one accepted a copy from Betty that evening and she received no money. Nor did her aunt. But on other occasions, Betty had received funds and given out copies.\n Mrs. Prince and Betty remained until 8:45 p.m. A few minutes before this Mr. Perkins approached Mrs. Prince. A discussion ensued. He inquired and she refused to give Betty's name. However, she stated the child attended the Shaw School. Mr. Perkins referred to his previous warnings and said he would allow five minutes for them to get off the street. Mrs. Prince admitted she supplied Betty with the magazines and said, '(N)either you nor anybody else can stop me .... This child is exercising her God- given right and her constitutional right to preach the gospel, and no creature has a right to interfere with God's commands.' However, Mrs. Prince and Betty departed. She remarked as she went, 'I'm not going through this any more. We've been through it time and time again. I'm going home and put the little girl to bed.' It may be added that testimony, by Betty, her aunt and others, was offered at the trials, and was ex- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 158, 163]\n\u00a0\n cluded, to show that Betty believed it was her religious duty to perform this work and failure would bring condemnation 'to everlasting destruction at Armageddon.'\n As the case reaches us, the questions are no longer open whether what the child did was a 'sale' or an 'offer to sell' within Section 695 or was 'work' within Section 81. The state court's decision has foreclosed them adversely to appellant as a matter of state law. \n6\n The only question remaining therefore is whether, as construed and applied, the statute is valid. Upon this the court said: 'We think that freedom of the press and of religion is subject to incidental regulation to the slight degree involved in the prohibition of the selling of religious literature in streets and public places by boys under twelve and girls under eighteen and in the further statutory provisions herein considered, which have been adopted as a means of enforcing \n\n[321 \nU.S. 158, 164]\n\u00a0\n that prohibition.' 313 Mass. 223, 229, 46 N.E.2d 755, 758.\n Appellant does not stand on freedom of the press. Regarding it as secular, she concedes it may be restricted as Massachusetts has done. \n7\n Hence, she rests squarely on freedom of religion under the First Amendment, applied by the Fourteenth to the states. She buttresses this foundation, however, with a claim of parental right as secured by the due process clause of the latter Amendment. \n8\n Cf. Meyer v. Nebraska, \n262 \nU.S. 390\n, 43 S. Ct. 625, 29 A.L.R. 1446. These guaranties, she thinks, guard alike herself and the child in what they have done. Thus, two claimed liberties are at stake. One is the parent's, to bring up the child in the way he should go, which for appellant means to teach him the tenets and the practices of their faith. The other freedom is the child's, to observe these; and among them is 'to preach the gospel ... by public distribution' of 'Watchtower' and 'Consolation,' in conformity with the scripture: 'A little shall lead them.'\n If by this position appellant seeks for freedom of conscience a broader protection than for freedom of the mind, it may be doubted that any of the great liberties insured by the First Article can be given higher place than the others. All have preferred position in our basic scheme. Schneider v. State, \n308 \nU.S. 147\n, 60 S.Ct. 146; Cantwell v. Connecticut, \n310 \nU.S. 296\n, 60 S.Ct. 900, 128 A. L.R. 1352. All are interwoven there together. Differences there are, in them and in the modes appropriate for their exercise. But they have unity in the charter's prime place because they have unity in their human sources and \n\n[321 \nU.S. 158, 165]\n\u00a0\n functionings. Heart and mind are not identical. Intuitive faith and reasoned judgment are not the same. Spirit is not always thought. But in the everyday business of living, secular or otherwise, these variant aspects of personality find inseparable expression in a thousand ways. They cannot be altogether parted in law more than in life.\n To make accommodation between these freedoms and an exercise of state authority always is delicate. It hardly could be more so than in such a clash as this case presents. On one side is the obviously earnest claim for freedom of conscience and religious practice. With it is allied the parent's claim to authority in her own household and in the rearing of her children. The parent's conflict with the state over control of the child and his training is serious enough when only secular matters are concerned. It becomes the more so when an element of religious conviction enters. Against these sacred private interests, basic in a democracy, stand the interests of society to protect the welfare of children, and the state's assertion of authority to that end, made here in a manner conceded valid if only secular things were involved. The last is no mere corporate concern of official authority. It is the interest of youth itself, and of the whole community, that children be both safeguarded from abuses and given opportunities for growth into free and independent well-developed men and citizens. Between contrary pulls of such weight, the safest and most objective recourse is to the lines already marked out, not precisely but for guides, in narrowing the no man's land where this battle has gone on.\n The rights of children to exercise their religion, and of parents to give them religious training and to encourage them in the practice of religious belief, as against preponderant sentiment and assertion of state power voicing it, have had recognition here, most recently in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U.S. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 158, 166]\n\u00a0\n 624, 63 S.Ct. 1178. Previously in Pierce v. Society of Sisters, \n268 \nU.S. 510\n, 45 S.Ct. 571, 39 A.L.R. 468, this Court had sustained the parent's authority to provide religious with secular schooling, and the child's right to receive it, as against the state's requirement of attendance at public schools. And in Meyer v. Nebraska, \n262 \nU.S. 390\n, 43 S. Ct. 625, 29 A.L.R. 1446, children's rights to receive teaching in languages other than the nation's common tongue were guarded against the state's encroachment. It is cardinal with us that the custody, care and nurture of the child reside first in the parents, whose primary function and freedom include preparation for obligations the state can neither supply nor hinder. Pierce v. Society of Sisters, supra. And it is in recognition of this that these decisions have respected the private realm of family life which the state cannot enter.\n But the family itself is not beyond regulation in the public interest, as against a claim of religious liberty. Reynolds v. United States, \n98 \nU.S. 145\n; Davis v. Beason, \n133 \nU.S. 333\n, 10 S.Ct. 299. And neither rights of religion nor rights of parenthood are beyond limitation. Acting to guard the general interest in youth's well being, the state as parens patriae may restrict the parent's control by requiring school attendance,9 regulating or prohibiting the child's labor,10 and in many other ways. 11 Its authority is not nullified merely because the parent grounds his claim to control the child's course of conduct on religion or conscience. Thus, he cannot claim freedom from compulsory vaccination for the child more than for himself on religious grounds. \n12\n The right to practice religion freedly does not include liberty to expose the community or the child \n\n[321 \nU.S. 158, 167]\n\u00a0\n to communicable disease or the latter to ill health or death. People v. Pierson, 176 N.Y. 201, 68 N.E. 243, 63 L.R.A. 187, 98 Am.St.Rep. 666.13 The catalogue need not be lengthened. It is sufficient to show what indeed appellant hardly disputes, that the state has a wide range of power for limiting parental freedom and authority in things affecting the child's welfare; and that this includes, to some extent, matters of conscience and religious conviction.\n But it is said the state cannot do so here. This, first, because when state action impinges upon a claimed religious freedom, it must fall unless shown to be necessary for or conducive to the child's protection against some clear and present danger, cf. Schenck v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 47\n, 39 S.Ct. 247; and, it is added, there was no such showing here. The child's presence on the street, with her guardian, distributing or offering to distribute the magazines, it is urged, was in no way harmful to her, nor in any event more so than the presence of many other children at the same time and place, engaged in shopping and other activities not prohibited. Accordingly, in view of the preferred position the freedoms of the First Article occupy, the statute in its present application must fall. It cannot be sustained by any presumption of validity. Cf. Schneider v. State, \n308 \nU.S. 147\n, 60 S.Ct. 146. And, finally, it is said, the statute is, as to children, an absolute prohibition, not merely a reasonable regulation, of the denounced activity.\n Concededly a statute or ordinance identical in terms with Section 69, except that it is applicable to adults or all persons generally, would be invalid. Young v. California, \n308 \nU.S. 147\n, 60 S.Ct. 146; Nichols v. Massachusetts, \n308 \nU.S. 147\n, 60 S.Ct. 146; Jamison v. Texas, \n318 \nU.S. 413\n, 63 S.Ct. 669; Murdock v. Pennsylvania, \n319 \nU.S. 105\n, 63 S.Ct. 870, 146 A.L.R. 82; Martin v. City of Struthers, \n319 \nU.S. 141\n, 63 S.Ct. 862.14 \n\n[321 \nU.S. 158, 168]\n\u00a0\n But the mere fact a state could not wholly prohibit this form of adult activity, whether characterized locally as a 'sale' or otherwise, does not mean it cannot do so for children. Such a conclusion granted would mean that a state could impose no greater limitation upon child labor than upon adult labor. Or, if an adult were free to enter dance halls, saloons, and disreputable places generally, in order to discharge his conceived religious duty to admonish or dissuade persons from frequenting such places, so would be a child with similar convictions and objectives, if not alone then in the parent's company, against the state's command.\n The state's authority over children's activities is broader than over like actions of adults. This is peculiarly true of public activities and an matters of employment. A democratic society rests, for its continuance, upon the healthy, well-rounded growth of young people into full maturity as citizens, with all that implies. It may secure this against impeding restraints and dangers, within a broad range of selection. Among evils most appropriate for such action are the crippling effects of child employment,15 more especially in public places, and the possible harms arising from other activities subject to all the diverse influences of the street. \n16\n It is too late now to doubt \n\n[321 \nU.S. 158, 169]\n\u00a0\n that legislation appropriately designed to reach such evils is within the state's police power, whether against the parents claim to control of the child or one that religious scruples dictate contrary action.\n It is true children have rights, in common with older people, in the primary use of highways. But even in such use streets afford dangers for them not affecting adults. And in other uses, whether in work or in other things, this difference may be magnified. This is so not only when children are unaccompanied but certainly to some extent when they are with their parents. What may be wholly permissible for adults therefore may not be so for children, either with or without their parents' presence.\n Street preaching, whether oral or by handing out literature, is not the primary use of the highway, even for adults. While for them it cannot be wholly prohibited, it can be regulated within reasonable limits in accommodation to the primary and other incidental uses. \n17\n But, for obvious reasons, notwithstanding appellant's contrary view,18 the validity of such a prohibition applied to children not accompanied by an older person hardly would seem open to question. The case reduces itself therefore to the question whether the presence of the child's guardian puts a limit to the state's power. That fact may lessen the likelihood that some evils the legislation seeks to avert will occur. But it cannot forestall all of them. The zealous though lawful exercise of the right to engage in propagandizing the community, whether in religious, political or other matters, may and at times does create situa- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 158, 170]\n\u00a0\n tions difficult enough for adults to cope with and wholly inappropriate for children, especially of tender years, to face. Other harmful possibilities could be stated, of emotional excitement and psychological or physical injury. Parents may be free to become martyrs themselves. But it does not follow they are free, in identical circumstances, to make martyrs of their children before they have reached the age of full and legal discretion when they can make that choice for themselves. Massachusetts has determined that an absolute prohibition, though one limited to streets and public places and to the incidental uses proscribed, is necessary to accomplish its legitimate objectives. Its power to attain them is broad enough to reach these peripheral instances in which the parent's supervision may reduce but cannot eliminate entirely the ill effects of the prohibited conduct. We think that with reference to the public proclaiming of religion, upon the streets and in other similar public places, the power of the state to control the conduct of children reaches beyond the scope of its authority over adults, as is true in the case of other freedoms, and the rightful boundary of its power has not been crossed in this case.\n In so ruling we dispose also of appellant's argument founded upon denial of equal protection. It falls with that based on denial of religious freedom, since in this instance the one is but another phrasing of the other. Shortly, the contention is that the street, for Jehovah's Witnesses and their children, is their church, since their conviction makes it so; and to deny them access to it for religious purposes as was done here has the same effect as excluding altar boys, youthful choristers, and other children from the edifices in which they practice their religious beliefs and worship. The argument hardly needs more than statement, after what has been said, to refute it. However Jehovah's Witnesses may conceive them, the public highways have not become their religious prop- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 158, 171]\n\u00a0\n erty merely by their assertion. And there is no denial of equal protection in excluding their children from doing there what no other children may do.\n Our ruling does not extend beyond the facts the case presents. We neither lay the foundation 'for any (that is, every) state intervention in the indoctrination and participation of children in religion' which may be done 'in the name of their health and welfare' nor give warrant for 'every limitation on their religious training and activities.' The religious training and indoctrination of children may be accomplished in many ways, some of which, as we have noted, have received constitutional protection through decisions of this Court. These and all others except the public proclaiming of religion on the streets, if this may be taken as either training or indoctrination of the proclaimer, remain unaffected by the decision.\n The judgment is affirmed.\nAFFIRMED.\n This attempt by the state of Massachusetts to prohibit a child from exercising her constitutional right to practice her religion on the public streets cannot, in my opinion, be sustained.\n The record makes clear the basic fact that Betty Simmons, the nine- year old child in question, was engaged in a genuine religious, rather than commercial, activity. She was a member of Jehovah's Witnesses and had been taught the tenets of that sect by her guardian, the appellant. Such tenets included the duty of publicly distributing religious tracts on the street and from door to door. Pursuant to this religious duty and in the company of the appellant, Betty Simmons on the night of December 18, 1941, was standing on a public street corner and offering to distribute Jehovah's Witness literature to passersby. There was no expectation of pecuniary profit to \n\n[321 \nU.S. 158, 172]\n\u00a0\n herself or to appellant. It is undisputed, furthermore, that she did this of her own desire and with appellant's consent. She testified that she was motivated by her love of the Lord and that He commanded her to distribute this literature; this was, she declared, her way of worshipping God. She was occupied, in other words, in 'an age-old form of missionary evangelism' with a purpose 'as evangelical as the revival meeting.' Murdock v. Pennsylvania, \n319 \nU.S. 105, 108\n, 109 S., 63 S.Ct. 870, 872, 873, 146 A.L.R. 82.\n Religious training and activity, whether performed by adult or child, are protected by the Fourteenth Amendment against interference by state action, except insofar as they violate reasonable regulations adopted for the protection of the public health, morals and welfare. Our problem here is whether a state, under the guise of enforcing its child labor laws, can lawfully prohibit girls under the age of eighteen and boys under the age of twelve from practicing their religious faith insofar as it involves the distribution or sale of religious tracts on the public streets. No question of freedom of speech or freedom of press is present and we are not called upon to determine the permissible restraints on those rights. Nor are any truancy or curfew restrictions in issue. The statutes in question prohibit all children within the specified age limits from selling or offering to sell 'any newspapers, magazines, periodicals or any other articles of merchandise of any description ... in any street or public place.' Criminal sanctions are imposed on the parents and guardians who compel or permit minors in their control to engage in the prohibited transactions. The state court has construed these statutes to cover the activities here involved, cf. State v. Richardson, 92 N.H. 178, 27 A.2d 94, thereby imposing an indirect restraint through the parents and guardians on the free exercise by minors of their religious beliefs. This indirect restraint is no less effective than a direct one. A square conflict between the con- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 158, 173]\n\u00a0\n stitutional guarantee of religious freedom and the state's legitimate interest in protecting the welfare of its children is thus presented.\n As the opinion of the Court demonstrates, the power of the state lawfully to control the religious and other activities of children is greater than its power over similar activities of adults. But that fact is no more decisive of the issue posed by this case than is the obvious fact that the family itself is subject to reasonable regulation in the public interest. We are concerned solely with the reasonableness of this particular prohibition of religious activity by children.\n In dealing with the validity of statutes which directly or indirectly infringe religious freedom and the right of parents to encourage their children in the practice of a religious belief, we are not aided by any strong presumption of the constitutionality of such legislation. United States v. Carolene Products Co., \n304 \nU.S. 144, 152\n, 58 S.Ct. 778, 783, note 4. On the contrary, the human freedoms enumerated in the First Amendment and carried over into the Fourteenth Amendment are to be presumed to be invulnerable and any attempt to sweep away those freedoms is prima facie invalid. It follows that any restriction or prohibition must be justified by those who deny that the freedoms have been unlawfully invaded. The burden was therefore on the state of Massachusetts to prove the reasonableness and necessity of prohibiting children from engaging in religious activity of the type involved in this case.\n The burden in this instance, however, is not met by vague references to the reasonableness underlying child labor legislation in general. The great interest of the state in shielding minors from the evil vicissitudes of early life does not warrant every limitation on their religious training and activities. The reasonableness that justifies the prohibition of the ordinary distribution of literature in the public streets by children is not necessarily the rea- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 158, 174]\n\u00a0\n sonableness that justifies such a drastic restriction when the distribution is part of their religious faith. Murdock v. Pennsylvania, supra, \n319 \nU.S. 111\n, 63 S.Ct. 874, 146 A.L.R. 82. If the right of a child to practice its religion in that manner is to be forbidden by constitutional means, there must be convincing proof that such a practice constitutes a grave and immediate danger to the state or to the health, morals or welfare of the child. West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, \n319 \nU.S. 624, 639\n, 63 S.Ct. 1178, 1186. The vital freedom of religion, which is 'of the very essence of a scheme of ordered liberty,' Palko v. Connecticut, \n302 \nU.S. 319, 325\n, 58 S.Ct. 149, 152, cannot be erased by slender references to the state's power to restrict the more secular activities of children.\n The state, in my opinion, has completely failed to sustain its burden of proving the existence of any grave or immediate danger to any interest which it may lawfully protect. There is no proof that Betty Simmons' mode of worship constituted a serious menace to the public. It was carried on in an orderly, lawful manner at a public street corner. And 'one who is rightfully on a street which the state has left open to the public carries with him there as elsewhere the constitutional right to express his views in an orderly fashion. This right extends to the communication of ideas by handbills and literature as well as by the spoken word.' Jamison v. Texas, \n318 \nU.S. 413, 416\n, 63 S.Ct. 669, 672. The sidewalk, no less than the cathedral or the evangelist's tent, is a proper place, under the Constitution, for the orderly worship of God. Such use of the streets is as necessary to the Jehovah's Witnesses, the Salvation Army and others who practice religion without benefit of conventional shelters as is the use of the streets for purposes of passage.\n It is claimed, however, that such activity was likely to affect adversely the health, morals and welfare of the child. Reference is made in the majority opinion to 'the crippling effects of child employment, more especially in pub- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 158, 175]\n\u00a0\n lic places, and the possible harms arising from other activities subject to all the diverse influences of the street.' To the extent that they flow from participation in ordinary commercial activities, these harms are irrelevant to this case. And the bare possibility that such harms might emanate from distribution of religious literature is not, standing alone, sufficient justification for restricting freedom of conscience and religion. Nor can parents or guardians be subjected to criminal liability because of vague possibilities that their religious teachings might cause injury to the child. The evils must be grave, immediate, substantial. Cf. Bridges v. California, \n314 \nU.S. 252, 262\n, 62 S.Ct. 190, 193. Yet there is not the slightest indication in this record, or in sources subject to judicial notice, that children engaged in distributing literature pursuant to their religious beliefs have been or are likely to be subject to any of the harmful 'diverse influences of the street.' Indeed, if probabilities are to be indulged in, the likelihood is that children engaged in serious religious endeavor are immune from such influences. Gambling, truancy, irregular eating and sleeping habits, and the more serious vices are not consistent with the high moral character ordinarily displayed by children fulfilling religious obligations. Moreover, Jehovah's Witness children invariably make their distributions in groups subject at all times to adult or parental control, as was done in this case. The dangers are thus exceedingly remote, to say the least. And the fact that the zealous exercise of the right to propagandize the community may result in violent or disorderly situations difficult for children to face is no excuse for prohibiting the exercise of that right.\n No chapter in human history has been so largely written in terms of persecution and intolerance as the one dealing with religious freedom. From ancient times to the present day, the ingenuity of man has known no limits in its ability to forge weapons of oppression for use againstrights of those \n\n[321 \nU.S. 158, 176]\n\u00a0\n those who dare to express or practice unorthodox religious beliefs. And the Jehovah's Witnesses are living proof of the fact that even in this nation, conceived as it was in the ideals of freedom, the right to practice religion in unconventional ways is still far from secure. Theirs is a militant and unpopular faith, pursued with a fanatical zeal. They have suffered brutal beatings; their property has been destroyed; they have been harassed at every turn by the resurrection and enforcement of little used ordinances and statutes. See Mulder and Comisky, 'Jehovah's Witnesses Mold Constitutional Law,' 2 Bill of Rights Review, No. 4, p. 262. To them, along with other present-day religious minorities, befalls the burden of testing our devotion to the ideals and constitutional guarantees of religious freedom. We should therefore hesitate before approving the application of a statute that might be used as another instrument of oppression. Religious freedom is too sacred a right to be restricted or prohibited in any degree without convincing proof that a legitimate interest of the state is in grave danger.\n Mr. Justice JACKSON.\n The novel feature of this decision is this: the Court holds that a state may apply child labor laws to restrict or prohibit an activity of which, as recently as last term, it held: 'This form of religious activity occupies the same high estate under the First Amendment as do worship in the churches and preaching from the pulpits. It has the same claim to protection as the more orthodox and conventional exercises of religion.' ' ... the mere fact that the religious literature is 'sold' by itinerant preachers rather than 'donated' does not transform evangelism into a commercial enterprise. If it did, then the passing of the collection plate in church would make the church service a commercial project. The constitutional danger.by holding public dinners and entertainments, by various kindsspreading their religious beliefs through the spoken \n\n[321 \nU.S. 158, 177]\n\u00a0\n and printed word are not to be gauged by standards governing retailers or wholesalers of books.' Murdock v. Pennsylvania, \n319 \nU.S. 105, 109\n, 111 S., 63 S.Ct. 870, 873, 874, 146 A.L.R. 82.\n It is difficult for me to believe that going upon the streets to accost the public is the same thing for application of public law as withdrawing to a private structure for religious worship. But if worship in the churches and the activity of Jehovah's Witnesses on the streets 'occupy the same high estate' and have the 'same claim to protection' it would seem that child labor laws may be applied to both if to either. If the Murdock doctrine stands along with today's decision, a foundation is laid for any state intervention in the indoctrination and participation of children in religion, provided it is done in the name of their health or welfare.\n This case brings to the surface the real basis of disagreement among members of this Court in previous Jehovah's Witness cases. Murdock v. Pennsylvania, \n319 \nU.S. 105\n, 63 S.Ct. 870, 146 A.L.R. 82; Martin v. Struthers, \n319 \nU.S. 141\n, 63 S.Ct. 862; Jones v. Opelika, \n316 \nU.S. 584\n, 141 A.L.R. 514; Id., \n319 \nU.S. 103\n, 63 S.Ct. 890; Douglas v. Jeannette, \n319 \nU.S. 157\n, 63 S.Ct. 877, 882. Our basic difference seems to be as to the method of establishing limitations which of necessity bound religious freedom.\n My own view may be shortly put: I think the limits begin to operate whenever activities begin to affect or collide with liberties of others or of the public. Religious activities which concern only members of the faith are and ought to be free-as nearly absolutely free as anything can be. But beyond these, many religious denominations or sects engage in collateral and secular activities intended to obtain means from unbelievers to sustain the worshippers and their leaders. They raise money, not merely by passing the plate to those who voluntarily attend services or by contributions by their own people, but by solicitations and drives addressed to the public \n\n[321 \nU.S. 158, 178]\n\u00a0\n of sales and Bingo games and lotteries. All such money-raising activities on a public scale are, I think, Caesar's affairs and may be regulated by the state so long as it does not discriminate against one because he is doing them for a religious purpose, and the regulation is not arbitrary and capricious, in violation of other provisions of the Constitution.\n The Court in the Murdock case rejected this principle of separating immune religious activities from secular ones in declaring the disabilities which the Constitution imposed on local authorities. Instead, the Court now draws a line based on age that cuts across both true exercise of religion and auxiliary secular activities. I think this is not a correct principle for defining the activities immune from regulation on grounds of religion, and Murdock overrules the grounds on which I think affirmance should rest. I have no alternative but to dissent from the grounds of affirmance of a judgment which I think was rightly decided, and upon right grounds, by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts. 313 Mass. 223, 46 N.E.2d 755.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS and Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER join in this opinion.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY, dissenting. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The court found there was no evidence that appellant was asked Betty's age. It then held that conviction for refusal to disclose the child's name, based on the charge under Section 79, would violate Article 12 of the Declaration of Rights of the Commonwealth, which provides in part: 'No subject shall be held to answer for any crimes or offence, until the same is fully and plainly, substantially and formally, described to him; or be compelled to accuse, or furnish evidence against himself.' \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Appellant received moderate fines on each complaint, first in the District Court of Brockton, then on pleas of not guilty by trial de novo without a jury in the Superior Court for Plymouth County. Motions to dismiss and quash the complaints, for directed findings, and for rulings, were made seasonably and denied by the Superior Court. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Mass.Gen.

The judge was not required to accept the defendant's characterization of that transaction as a 'contribution.' He could believe that selling the literature played a more prominent part in the enterprise than giving it way. He could find that the defendant furnished the magazines to Betty, knowing that the latter intended to sell them, if she could, in violation of section 69. ... The judge could find that the defendant permitted Betty to 'work' in violation of section 81. ... (W)e cannot say that the evils at which the statutes were directed attendant upon the selling by children of newspapers, magazines, periodicals, and other merchandise in streets and public places do not exist where the publications are of a religious nature.' 313 Mass. 223, 227, 228, 46 N.E.2d 755, 757. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Appellant's brief says: 'The purpose of the legislation is to protect children from economic exploitation and keep them from the evils of such enterprises that contribute to the degradation of children.' And at the argument counsel stated the prohibition would be valid as against a claim of freedom of the press as a nonreligious activity. \n[\nFootnote 8\n] The due process claim, as made and perhaps necessarily, extends no further than that to freedom of religion, since in the circumstances all that is comprehended in the former is included in the latter. \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] State v.

SIMPSON & CO. v. COM'R OF INTERNAL REVENUE(1944)\nNo. 52\nArgued: January 12, 1944Decided: February 14, 1944\n\n\n\n Rehearing Denied Mar. 13, 1944\n\n\n See \n321 \nU.S. 804\n, 64 S.Ct. 778.\n Mr. Gerald Donovan, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. J. Louis Monarch, of Washington, D.C., for respondent. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 225, 226]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice JACKSON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n For the years 1934, 1935, and 1936 the taxpayer, a corpoation, filed complete income and excess-profits tax returns on Form 1120 of the Treasury Department. Each of these included a question whether the corporation was a personal holding company within the meaning of  351 of the applicable revenue act, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, pages 757, 936, and stated that if it was, an additional return on Form 1120H was required. The taxpayer answered the question in the negative and did not in any year file personal holding company returns on Form 1120H.\n The Commissioner imposed personal holding company surtaxes for each year and under the authority of  406 of the Revenue Act of 1935, 26 U.S.C. A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 811, and  291 of the Revenue Acts of 1934 and 1936, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code,  291, imposed a 25 per cent penalty for failure to file the personal holding company return.\n The president, who executed the income tax returns, did not file personal holding company returns because he thought the taxpayer was not a personal holding company within the meaning of the Act. It was actively engaged in the pawnshop business. However, more than 50 per cent of its capital stock was owned by less than five stockholders, and more than 80 per cent of its gross income was derived from interest. The taxpayer filed information returns showing dividends of over $300 paid to each stockholder during those years and its books and records made available to the Commissioner during audit disclosed the facts. No fraud or had faith is suggested.\n The Board of Tax Appeals affirmed the penalties,1 and its decision was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[321 \nU.S. 225, 227]\n\u00a0\n There appearing to be no conflict of decision between circuits, we on November 9, 1942 denied certiorari. \n3\n The 25-day period allowed by our rule in which to file petition for rehearing expired. In February 1943 a conflict developed through decision of Lane-Wells Co. v. Commissioner by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. \n4\n Petitioner asked leave to file out of time a petition for rehearing and we consented. On June 7, 1943, we granted petition for rehearing, vacated the order denying certiorari, and granted certiorari limited to the penalty question. \n5\n We asked counsel in view of  1140 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code,  1140, and Helvering v. Northern Coal Co., \n293 \nU.S. 191\n, 55 S.Ct. 3, to discuss our jurisdiction to grant a petition for rehearing in the case.\n Section 1140 of the Internal Revenue Code, in relevant part, provides:\n'The decision of the Tax Court shall become final-\n\n'(b) Decision affirmed or petition for review dismissed\n\n'(2) Petition for certiorari denied. Upon the denial of a petition for certiorari, if the decision of the Tax Court has been affirmed or the petition for review dismissed by the Circuit Court of Appeals; or\n\n'(3) After mandate of (the) Supreme Court. Upon the expiration of 30 days from the date of issuance of the mandate of the Supreme Court, if such Court directs that the decision of the Board be affirmed or the petition for review dismissed.'\n\n There are other provisions dealing with the situations where the Board's decision is modified or reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals or by this Court, the purpose be- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 225, 228]\n\u00a0\n ing to determine definitely the date on which the statute of limitations, suspended during appeal, begins to run again and assessment may be made by the Commissioner. The Revenue Act of 1926 had identical provisions. 6 In reporting upon the provision in the Revenue Bill of 1926, the Senate committee said: 'Section 1005 prescribes the date on which a decision of the Board (whether or not review thereof is had) is to become final. Inasmuch as the statute of limitations upon assessments and suits for collection, both of which are suspended during review of the Commissioner's determination, commences to run upon the day upon which the Board's decision becomes final, it is of utmost importance that this time be specified as accurately as possible. In some instances in order to achieve this result the usual rules of law applicable in court procedure must be changed. For example, the power of the court of review to recall its mandate is made to expire 30 days from the date of issuance of the mandate.' Sen.Rep. No. 52, 69th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 37.\n In Helvering v. Northern Coal Co., supra, we considered the provision of the 1926 Act corresponding to  1140(b)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code  1140(b)(3), dealing with issuance of mandate by this Court. The question was whether notwithstanding the lapse of more than thirty days after mandate we could grant a petition for rehearing, and it was urged that this statute did not qualify the inherent power of the Court to reconsider its judgments throughout the term in which they are entered. Quoting the statute, we held: 'In view of the authoritative and explicit requirement of the statute and of its application to these cases, the petitions for rehearing are severally denied.'\n While it appears that we have a number of times granted certiorari to review decisions in cases originating with the \n\n[321 \nU.S. 225, 229]\n\u00a0\n Tax Court after once denying the petitions, Duquesne Steel Foundry Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 3 Cir., 41 F.2d 995, certiorari denied \n282 \nU.S. 878\n, 51 S.Ct. 82, certiorari granted, \n282 \nU.S. 830\n, 51 S.Ct. 89; Neuberger v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 104 F.2d 649, certiorari denied \n308 \nU.S. 623\n, 60 S.Ct. 379, certiorari granted \n310 \nU.S. 655\n, 60 S.Ct. 1085; Crane-Johnson Co. v. Commissioner, 8 Cir., 105 F.2d 740, certiorari denied \n308 \nU.S. 627\n, 60 S. Ct. 386, certiorari granted \n309 \nU.S. 692\n, 60 S.Ct. 708; Helvering v. Cement Investors, Inc., 10 Cir., 122 F.2d 380, certiorari denied \n315 \nU.S. 802\n, 62 S.Ct. 630, certiorari granted \n315 \nU.S. 825\n, 62 S.Ct. 802, in all but one of these cases the petition for rehearing was filed within 25 days after the denial of certiorari. In the other, the question of jurisdiction was not raised or considered, and therefore it does not establish a construction of the statute. United States v. More, 3 Cranch 159, 172; Snow v. United States, \n118 \nU.S. 346, 354\n, 6 S.Ct. 1059, 1063; Cross v. Burke, \n146 \nU.S. 82, 86\n, 13 S.Ct. 22, 23; Louisville Trust Co. v. Knott, \n191 \nU.S. 225, 236\n, 24 S.Ct. 119, 123; United States ex rel. Arant v. Lane, \n245 \nU.S. 166, 170\n, 38 S.Ct. 94, 96.\n It sometimes is desirable in the light of events to grant a previously denied writ of certiorari, as where it appears the question must later be taken because of conflict. A grant in such a case not only enables us to do justice to the party if it appears that he has the right of the controversy, but also it gives us the benefit of argument and examination of the additional or contrary aspects of the question presented by the case. Our rules provide for petitions for rehearing as matter of right within 25 days after judgment,7 and this rule has been applied to petitions for rehearings of orders denying certiorari. We have applied it to cases falling within the purview of Section 1140(b)(2). No mandate issues on denial of certiorari, and after a final decision the mandate does not issue until expiration of the 25-day period within which petition for rehearing may be filed. \n8\n If, therefore, we follow the practice heretofore observed, by which we regard denials of certiorari \n\n[321 \nU.S. 225, 230]\n\u00a0\n as qualified until the 25-day period expires, we put the denial and the decision on a generally equal basis except as Congress has seen fit to give the latter an additional thirty days before finality. The government after consideration of the practical aspects of the question advises that in its view our practice in these matters has been 'salutary and in accordance with sound policy.' There appears to be no good reason, therefore, to hold that the rule as to rehearings, in so far as it permits as matter of right the filing of petition therefor within 25 days, may not apply to this class of cases. But when under our rules our denial has become final, this statute deprives us of jurisdiction over the case.\n Accordingly the writ of certiorari is dismissed for want of jurisdiction.\n Writ dismissed.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice MURPHY and Mr. Justice RUTLEDGE concur, dissenting.\n I can find no warrant in  1140 of the Internal Revenue Code 26 U.S.C. A. Int.Rev. Code,  1140, for saying that the decision of the Tax Court becomes 'final' only after the expiration of the 25-day period within which a petition for rehearing may be filed. The section contains no such provision. The 25-day period for rehearings is prescribed by our Rule 33, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 354. But our authority to grant petitions for rehearing during the Term rises from the same source. See Wayne United Gas Co. v. Owens-Illinois Glass Co., \n300 \nU.S. 131, 136\n, 137 S., 57 S.Ct. 382, 385, 386; Art Metal Construction Co. v. United States, \n289 \nU.S. 706\n, 53 S.Ct. 692; Bronson v. Schulten, \n104 \nU.S. 410\n, 415. Hence I see no basis for saying that one, but not the other, qualifies that provision of  1140 which states that the decision of the Tax Court becomes final 'upon the denial of a petition for certiorari.' \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 44 B.T.A. 498. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 2 Cir., 128 F.2d 742. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] \n317 \nU.S. 677\n, 63 S.Ct. 158. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] 134 F.2d 977. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] \n319 \nU.S. 778\n, 63 S.Ct. 1323. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n]  1005(a)(3, 4), 44 Stat. 110, 26 U.S.C.A.

STATE OF KANSAS EX REL. MITCHELL(1944)\nNo. 34\nArgued: October 17, 1944Decided: November 6, 1944\n\n\n\n\n[323 \nU.S. 32, 33]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Samuel H. Kaufman, of New York City, for petitioner, Carolene products co.\n Mr. Thomas M. Lillard, of Topeka, Kan., for petitioner, Sage Stores Co.\n Mr. C. Glenn Morris, of Topeka, Kan., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n An original action in quo warranto in the Supreme Court of the State of Kansas was begun against The Sage Stores, a Kansas corporation, and Carolene Products Company, a Michigan corporation, by the State of Kansas on the relation of its Attorney General. The purpose of the proceeding was to stop the sale or offering for sale in Kansas of filled milk, manufactured by the Michigan corporation and sold by the Kansas corporation. A judgment granting this relief was entered by the Supreme Court of Kansas. 157 Kan. 404, 141 P.2d 655.\n A petition for a writ of certiorari was filed by both corporations and granted by this Court, \n321 \nU.S. 762\n, 64 S.Ct. 937, to examine a single issue presented by the petition, to wit, whether the Kansas statute, which prohibits the selling or keeping for sale of the products of the Carolene Products Co., was an arbitrary, unreasonable and discriminatory interference with petitioners' rights of liberty and property in violation of the due process and equal protection of law clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. A similar question as to the federal Filled Milk Act, 21 U.S.C.A.  61-63, under the Fifth Amendment is decided today by this Court. Carolene Products Co. et al. v. \n\n[323 \nU.S. 32, 34]\n\u00a0\n United States, \n323 \nU.S. 18\n, 65 S.Ct. 1. Little need be added to that opinion.\n The Kansas statute was first passed in 1923. Rev.Stat.Kans.1923  65- 713. It was reenacted as it now stands in 1927. Laws of Kans.1927, c. 242, sec. 8(F)(2). It reads as follows:\n'It shall be unlawful to manufacture, sell, keep for sale, or have in possession with intent to sell or exchange, any milk, cream, skim milk, buttermilk, condensed or evaporated milk, powdered milk, condensed skim milk, or any of the fluid derivatives of any of them to which has been added any fat or oil other than milk fat, either under the name of said products, or articles or the derivatives thereof, or under any fictitious or trade name whatsoever.' Sec. 65-707(F)(2), Gen.Stat.Kan.1935.\n\n The compounds which petitioners manufacture and sell are covered by this statute. They are the same compounds which are described in Carolene Products Co. v. United States, supra. Petitioners' defense is that the compounds are sanitary and healthful. They assert that the canned compound is properly labeled and that no fraud is practiced upon the buying public to induce it to use petitioners' compound instead of whole milk products. It is admitted that the ordinary consumer cannot distinguish between the compounds and evaporated whole milk by odor, taste, consistency or other means short of chemical analysis. State v. Sage Stores Co., 157 Kan. 404, 443, 141 P.2d 655, Finding 33.\n In these circumstances, it is petitioners' contention that Kansas' prohibition of the sale, or keeping for sale, of this healthful product violates the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n Apparently the objection under the equal protection clause is that the Kansas statute permits the sale of skimmed milk which has less calories and fewer vitamins than petitioners' compound and yet forbids the sale of \n\n[323 \nU.S. 32, 35]\n\u00a0\n the compound despite its higher nutritive value. Such an objection is governed by the same standards of legislation as objections under the due process clause. It is a matter of classification and the power of the legislature to classify is as broad as its power to prohibit. A violation of the Fourteenth Amendment in either case would depend upon whether there is any rational basis for the action of the legislature. United States v. Carolene Products Co., \n304 \nU.S. 144, 153\n, 154 S., 58 S.Ct. 778, 784, 785; Carmichael v. Southern Coal Co., \n301 \nU.S. 495, 509\n, 57 S.Ct. 868, 872, 109 A.L.R. 1327\n\n\n This writ of certiorari brings to us only the question of the violation by the Kansas legislation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The coverage of the Kansas statute is a matter solely for the determination of Kansas. Allen-Bradley Local v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Board, \n315 \nU.S. 740, 747\n, 62 S.Ct. 820, 824; United States v. Texas, \n314 \nU.S. 480, 487\n, 62 S.Ct. 350, 353. In this case evidence was introduced as to the deficiencies in certain particulars of petitioners' compounds as compared with whole milk products. The findings of the commissioner who acted for the Supreme Court of Kansas appear in State v. Sage Stores Co., 157 Kan. 430, 141 P.2d 655. His conclusions which were accepted by the court as to the properties of petitioners' compound may be gauged by his finding 53, State v. Sage Stores Co., 157 Kan. at pages 449, 450, 141 P.2d at page 681.\n'Defendant's product is wholesome, nutritious and harmless, in the sense that it contains nothing of a toxic nature, but it is inferior to evaporated whole milk in the content of fatty acids, phospholipins, sterols and Vitamins E and K, all of which are essential in human nutrition, with the probable exception of Vitamin E in the diet of infants. In addition, evaporated whole milk contains a superior growthpromoting property, found in butterfat and not in cottonseed oil, essential to the optimum growth of infants.\n\n'These deficiencies in defendant's product, as compared to evaporated whole milk, are largely made up from other \n\n[323 \nU.S. 32, 36]\n\u00a0\n sources when the product is used as a substitute for whole milk or evaporated whole milk in the diet of adults who consume a varied diet. When defendant's product is used as a substitute for whole milk or evaporated whole milk in the diet of infants and children who do not consume a varied diet, such deficiencies are not made up, and the diet is partially inadequate. Defendant's product does 'get into the channels of infant nutrition.\"\n\n It was also determined by the commissioner and approved by the court that one purpose of the legislature was the prevention of fraud and deception in the sale of these compounds. State v. Sage Stores Co., 157 Kan. 404, 412, 413, 141 P.2d 655.\n As a consequence of this evidence, findings of fact and conclusions of law, the rational basis for the action of the legislature in prohibiting the sale, or keeping for sale, of the compounds is even more definite and clear than in Carolene Products Co. v. United States, decided today. Since petitioners' products had the taste, consistency, color and appearance of whole milk products, we need not consider the validity of the Kansas act as applied to compounds which are readily distinguishable from whole milk compounds. Reference is made to part 'Third' of the Carolene opinion for a discussion as to whether or not a prohibition of these products violates due process.\n In our opinion the Kansas legislation did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice BLACK and Mr. Justice, DOUGLAS concur in the result. \n\n\n\n","88":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSARTOR v. ARKANSAS NATURAL GAS CORP.(1944)\nNo. 232\nArgued: February 3, 1944Decided: March 27, 1944\n\n\n\n Rehearing Denied April 24, 1944\n\n\n See \n322 \nU.S. 767\n, 64 S.Ct. 941.\n Mr. Gilbert P. Bullis, of Ferriday, La., for petitioners.\n Mr. Elias Goldstein, of Shreveport, La., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice JACKSON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This litigation, begun a decade ago, has been terminated by a summary judgment, and whether rightly so is the issue. The suit has weathered four adjudications, including two trials, in District Court and four decisions by the Court of Appeals. \n1\n We will recite only such of its \n\n[321 \nU.S. 620, 621]\n\u00a0\n history as bears on the issues as to summary judgment, since we consider no other question.\n Sartors are landowners in Richland Parish, Louisiana, who in March of 1927 leased their lands for natural gas development. The lease, so far as here important, provides that '... the grantor shall be paid one-eighth ( 1\/8) of the value of such gas calculated at the rate of market price and no less than three cents per thousand cubic feet, corrected to two pounds above atmospheric pressure ....' For many years the lessee made settlement at the 3\u00f5 rate. The suit was based upon the contention that during all of the years from 1927 to 1932 inclusive such market price was considerably above 3\u00f5. At the last trial the court held that the claims for gas produced prior to the 20th of March, 1930 were barred by the statute of limitations or, as it is called in Louisiana, by prescription. The issues as to gas produced between March 20, 1930 and the commencement of the action were submitted to the jury, which returned a verdict: 'We, the Jury, find for the Plaintiffs that the average price of gas at the well in Richland Parish, Louisiana, field during the period beginning March 20, 1930, and ending March 20, 1933, to be .0445 per 1000 cu. ft. at 8 oz. pressure.' The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed 'so far as the verdict of the jury fixed the market value of the gas upon which plaintiff is entitled to recover royalties.' (98 F.2d 530.) However, it reversed the ruling that part of petitioner's claims were barred by the statute of limitations and remanded the case for trial of the same issues as to market price of gas produced prior to March 20, 1930. The respondent- defendant then filed a motion for summary judgment under Rule 56, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c. The motion was granted and the Court of Appeals affirmed. \n2\n The importance of questions raised under the summary judgment rule led us to grant certiorari. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[321 \nU.S. 620, 622]\n\u00a0\n The controversy, both as to whether there is a cause of action and, if so, in what amount, turns on whether the 'rate of market price' during this period before March 20, 1930 was above 3\u00f5 per m.c.f., as it is conclusively adjudged in this case to have been thereafter. It is held in Louisiana that the market price under such leases is to be ascertained at the wellhead, if there is an established market price at that point. Unfortunately, this rule requires that the price for royalty purposes be ascertained at a place and time at which few commercial sales of gas occur. The lessees who market this royalty gas along with their own production do not customarily make their deliveries at the wellhead but transmit gas from the several wells some distance in gathering lines, turning it over to large buyers at points somewhat removed, and under conditions of delivery different from wellhead deliveries. The price producers receive at these delivery stations often is substantially above the 3\u00f5 price to the landowner. The practice of fixing the price of landowner's royalty gas at one time and place and of marketing his gas for a different price at another delivery point raises the dissatisfaction and problems which produce this case.\n The Court of Appeals, correctly we think, followed the Louisiana substantive rule that the inquiry in a case of this kind shall determine ( 1) the market price at the well, or (2) if there is no market price at the well for the gas, what it is actually worth there, and 'in determining this actual value ... every factor properly bearing upon its establishment should be taken into consideration. Included in these are the fixed royalties obtaining in the leases in the field considered in the light of their respective dates, the prices paid under the pipe-line contracts, and what elements, besides the value as such of the gas, were included in those prices, the conditions existing when they were made, and any changes of conditions, the end and aim of the whole inquiry, where there was no market price \n\n[321 \nU.S. 620, 623]\n\u00a0\n at the well, being to ascertain, upon a fair consideration of all relevant factors, the fair value at the well of the gas produced and sold by defendant.' \n4\n\u00a0\n\n The defendant asked a summary judgment because it averred 'there exists no reasonable basis for dispute' that during the period in question there was a market price at the wells and that it did not exceed 3\u00f5 per m. c.f. To sustain this position it filed affidavits, a stipulation of facts, and several exhibits. The plaintiffs resisted on the ground that the motion was inadequately supported on the face of defendant's papers. An affidavit by plaintiffs' counsel analyzed defendant's affidavits in the light of testimony given by the witnesses at prior trials; asserted that all were interested witnesses whose testimony was rejected on previous occasions; recited previous verdicts in the case; and setting forth affiant's experience in ten trials of this character arising out of leases in this field, asserted his knowledge of the market prices there and declared it to be more than 5\u00f5 per m.c.f. at the wellhead.\n It should be observed that the entire controversy here turns on questions of valuation. The only issue relates to market price or value of plaintiffs' gas at the time and place of delivery. If there has been no damage in the sense of failure to pay the full market price, then there is no cause of action, and if there has been damage in such sense, there is a cause of action.\n The summary judgment rule provides that 'The judgment sought shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that, except as to the amount of damages, there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.' Rule 56(c). ( Emphasis supplied.) Where the undisputed facts leave the existence of a cause of action depending on \n\n[321 \nU.S. 620, 624]\n\u00a0\n questions of damage which the rule has reserved from the summary judgment process, it is doubtful whether summary judgment is warranted on any showing. But at least a summary disposition of issues of damage should be on evidence which a jury would not be at liberty to disbelieve and which would require a directed verdict for the moving party.\n The defendant undertook to establish the absence of a triable issue by the affidavits of eight persons. It may be assumed for the purposes of the case that the witnesses offered admissible opinion evidence which, if it may be given conclusive effect, would sustain the motion. It will serve no purpose to review it in detail, and we recite only the facts which made it inconclusive. Affiant Harris was the vice president and general manager of the defendant, clearly an interested witness. Hunter was a lessee and the producer of gas with interests apparently similar to those of the defendant. Hargrove was vice president of a gas pipeline company, owning leases and producing gas, which the plaintiffs' attorney by affidavit avers is defending on similar cases brought by these plaintiffs and others. Florsheim is an executive officer of two gas producing companies with similar interests to the defendant, and he avers that the price in the Richland field was never in excess of 3\u00f5, although in this very case it is adjudged at one time to have been more. Stokes is the chief clerk of a producing company and recites that the records of his company show that 'after deducting from the gross price realized by these various corporations for gas produced from the Richland gas field during the period 1928-1930 inclusive, the actual average unit cost of gathering and delivering the aforesaid gas, the net realization of those corporations from the sale of gas during aforesaid period did not exceed 3\u00f5 per MCF.' Waiving the question whether the contents of written records can thus be proved, it would hardly seem that a conclusion, based on so complicated and indefinite a \n\n[321 \nU.S. 620, 625]\n\u00a0\n calculation, should be accepted from an employee of a corporation with an interest in the market price of gas similar to the defendant's without opportunity to cross-examine. Feazel is another producer of oil and gas from many leases, who avers that the price paid never exceeded 3\u00f5, notwithstanding the jury verdicts. McHenry is a lawyer and executive officer of a company operating gas properties with interests similar to the defendant's. Taylor is an officer of a similar producing company.\n Apart from these, and contracts and leases useful only in connection with the testimony of these witnesses, defendant offered a bulletin of the Federal Bureau of Mines, which included a table showing the estimated value at the wells of gas produced in Louisiana to be 3\u00f5 per m.c.f. in 1927 and 3.3\u00f5 in 1928. In so far as state-wide statistics could have any value in proving the local market, this would seem to sustain the plaintiffs' contention that the price was over 3\u00f5. Defendant also relied on a stipulation of facts. This stipulation recited a number of contracts for the sale of gas under various conditions, at various prices, some considerably in excess of 3\u00f5. It also showed the cost of delivery from the wells to the point where these sales were made to be 0.3\u00f5 per m.c.f. Much of the controversy, as will be seen from the prior history of the case,5 is over the question whether these contract prices may be used in aid of the plaintiffs' case. Defendant uses these contracts only to explain their prices away by showing differences in market conditions. They do not establish the claim that there is a wellhead market price. The \n\n[321 \nU.S. 620, 626]\n\u00a0\n stipulation also recites that about one-third of the leases in this area specify the royalty in substantially the same terms as the lease in suit, the rest providing for a fixed royalty of 3\u00f5 per m.c.f. About 90 per cent of the payments to be based on market price have been made on the basis of 3\u00f5, and the remaining 10 per cent at 4\u00f5 per m.c.f. We certainly cannot rule as matter of law that the 4\u00f5 price paid for 10 per cent of such royalty gas is not a factor to be considered by a fact-finding tribunal in fixing the market value, and is, or may be, some evidence to sustain plaintiffs' contentions.\n To summarize the features of the defendant's motion papers:\n\n 1. \nThe only evidence in support of defendant's contention as to the wellhead market price is opinion testimony of experts.\n\n 2. \nEach of them either is an officer of the defendant or is a lessee, or is an employee or officer of a lessee corporation, engaged like defendant in gas production, and each certainly is open to inquiry as to the truth of plaintiffs' attorney's sworn statements that each has interest in or bias as to the subject matter of this litigation.\n\n 3. \nEvery one of defendant's witnesses had testified to the same general effect on the trial of the claim wherein the jury found against the testimony and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the verdict.\n\n 4. \nDefendant undertook by its motion to show that it was beyond controversy that the 3\u00f5 price prevailed constantly and not as a matter of averages for the entire period ended March 19, 1930, although prior trial had conclusively adjudged that on March 20, 1930 and thereafter the price or value averaged 4.45\u00f5 as recited in the jury verdict. No evidence is presented of any sudden change, and no fact is offered to explain any change in the market and price of such gas. In fact any change is inconsistent with defend- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 620, 627]\n\u00a0\n ants' position in the former trial, which was that at no time in either period had the market exceeded 3\u00f5.\n The Court of Appeals below heretofore has correctly noted that Rule 56 authorizes summary judgment only where the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, where it is quite clear what the truth is, that no genuine issue remains for trial, and that the purpose of the rule is not to cut litigants off from their right of trial by jury if they really have issues to try. American Insurance Co. v. Gentile Brothers Co., 109 F.2d 732; Whitaker v. Coleman, 115 F.2d 305. In the very proper endeavor to terminate a litigation before it for the fourth time, we think it overlooked considerations which make the summary judgment an inappropriate means to that very desirable end.\n In considering the testimony of expert witnesses as to the value of gas leases, this Court through Mr. Justice Cardozo has said: 'If they have any probative effect, it is that of expressions of opinion by men familiar with the gas business and its opportunities for profit. But plainly opinions thus offered, even if entitled to some weight, have no such conclusive force that there is error of law in refusing to follow them. This is true of opinion evidence generally, whether addressed to a jury ... or to a judge ... or to a statutory board.' Dayton Power & Light Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, \n292 \nU.S. 290, 299\n, 54 S.Ct. 647, 652. Cf. Halliday v. United States, \n315 \nU.S. 94, 97\n, 62 S.Ct. 438, 440; Forsyth v. Doolittle, \n120 \nU.S. 73, 77\n, 7 S.Ct. 408, 410; McGowan v. American Pressed Tan Bark Co., \n121 \nU.S. 575, 609\n, 7 S.Ct. 1315, 1334; Quock Ting v.

The rule has been stated 'that if the court admits the testimony, then it is for the jury to decide whether any, and if any what, weight is to be given to the testimony.' Spring Co. v. Edgar, \n99 \nU.S. 645\n, 658. '... the jury, even if such testimony \n\n[321 \nU.S. 620, 628]\n\u00a0\n be uncontradicted, may exercise their independent judgment.' The Conqueror, \n166 \nU.S. 110, 131\n, 17 S.Ct. 510, 518. '... the mere fact that the witness is interested in the result of the suit is deemed sufficient to require the credibility of his testimony to be submitted to the jury as a question of fact.' Sonnentheil v. Christian Moerlein Brewing Co., \n172 \nU.S. 401, 408\n, 19 S.Ct. 233, 236.\n This Court has said: 'The jury were the judges of the credibility of the witnesses ... and in weighing their testimony had the right to determine how much dependence was to be placed upon it. There are many things sometimes in the conduct of a witness upon the stand, and sometimes in the mode in which his answers are drawn from him through the questioning of counsel, by which a jury are to be guided in determining the weight and credibility of his testimony. That part of every case, such as the one at bar, belongs to the jury, who are presumed to be fitted for it by their natural intelligence and their practical knowledge of men and the ways of men; and, so long as we have jury trials, they should not be disturbed in their possession of it, except in a case of manifest and extreme abuse of their function.' AEtna Life Insurance Co. v. Ward, \n140 \nU.S. 76, 88\n, 11 S.Ct. 720, 724.\n We think the defendant failed to show that it is entitled to judgment as matter of law. In the stipulation, the bulletin, the affidavit of the plaintiffs' attorney and the admission of its witnesses, there is some, although far from conclusive, evidence of a market price or a value, under the rules laid down by the Court of Appeals, that supports plaintiffs' case. It may well be that the weight of the evidence would be found on a trial to be with defendant. But it may not withdraw these witnesses from cross-examination, the best method yet devised for testing trustworthiness of testimony. And their credibility and the weight to be given to their opinions is to be deter- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 620, 629]\n\u00a0\n mined, after trial, in the regular manner. The judgment accordingly is reversed.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE, dissenting.\n It is not denied that the two courts below have correctly applied the state law governing the right to recover royalties on the particular type of gas lease here in question. By that law, in order to recover further royalty payments in excess of the 3 cents per 1,000 cubic feet of gas, which petitioners have already received, they must sustain the burden of showing that during the relevant period, the market price or value of the gas at the wellhead exceeded 3 cents. By Louisiana law also and upon principles of proof which it is also not denied that the courts below correclty applied, the 'pipe line' price of gas, without qualifications and supplementary proof wholly lacking in this case, is not evidence of market price or value at the wellhead. Consequently, on the motion for summary judgment, the single issue was whether petitioners had any evidence by which they could sustain the burden resting on them of showing that during the relevant period, there was a market price or value of gas in excess of 3 cents at the wellhead.\n True, Rule 56(c) of the Rules of Civil Procedure excludes from the summary judgment procedure any issue as to the 'amount of damages', where there is an admitted right of recovery but the amount of damages is in dispute. But the rule does not exclude from that procedure the issue of damage vel non when that is decisive of the right to recover. This is made plain by subdivision (d) of Rule 56, which provides for a partial summary judgment and declares that the order shall specify the 'facts that appear without substantial controversy, including the extent to which the amount of damages or other relief is not in \n\n[321 \nU.S. 620, 630]\n\u00a0\n controversy'. Obviously, if it appears that there is no evidence of damage, the 'amount of damages' is not in controversy and the court is not precluded from giving summary judgment for the defendant.\n On the single issue here presented, whether petitioners' right to recover can be established by a showing of market price or value of the gas at the wellhead, in excess of 3 cents, respondent's affidavits and documentary evidence and a stipulation of facts show that all such sales of gas during the relevant period were at 3 cents or less. The affidavits also showed by opinion evidence of qualified experts, the disinterestedness of some of whom is not, on the present record, open to challenge, that the market price and value of the gas at the wellhead did not exceed 3 cents. To meet the prima facie case thus made out by respondent's papers, petitioners tendered only proof of pipe line prices, each of which the state or federal courts had held in earlier cases to be no evidence of market price or value of the gas at the wellhead. See Sartor v. United Gas Pub. Serv. Co., 186 La. 555, 559-569, 173 So. 103,1 and cases cited.\n It is irrelevant to any issue now presented that as to a later period, as the field more nearly approached exhaustion, a jury had returned a verdict sustained by the court below, by which it was found that the average market price or value at the wellhead was in excess of 3 cents. Since this was the average for a three year period, it does not indicate any sudden advance in price, and is without probative force to show a market price or value in excess of 3 cents during the earlier period here in issue for which \n\n[321 \nU.S. 620, 631]\n\u00a0\n petitioners have tendered no probative evidence of a higher price.\n Nor is it sufficient to raise a genuine issue here that it appears with respect to 3 1\/3% of the approximately 900 leases in the gas field, that settlements were made for royalties of 4 cents. Respondent's motion papers show, without contradiction, that these settlements 'in almost every case' were compromises of disputes as to whether the lease in question had been properly developed, whether the lessor was entitled to a further royalty on gasoline recovered from the gas, or whether the lessee or lessor should bear the burden of a local severance tax. Such compromises of issues not present here furnish no indication of the market price or value at the well-head, which alone is the issue decisive of this case.\n Further, in the circumstances of this case, it is unduly restrictive of the summary judgment procedure to say that respondent's motion for summary judgment must be denied because it is supported in part by affidavits of interested expert witnesses who are not subject to cross- examination by the plaintiffs. Such an interpretation of the rule can hardly be invoked in behalf of petitioners here, who tender no probative evidence to challenge either the proof of actual sales at wellhead at 3 cents or less or the testimony of the experts, and who have not sought to avail themselves of the privilege afforded by Rule 56(e) and (f) to take the experts' depositions or to offer the cross-examination of these witnesses at the former trials of this action. The summary judgment procedure serves too useful a function in terminating groundless litigation to warrant its limitation in a way which Rule 56 does not admit and on grounds so insubstantial.\n On this state of the record both courts below have held that the issue whether petitioners have any proof tending to support the burden which rests on them to show \n\n[321 \nU.S. 620, 632]\n\u00a0\n market price or value at the wellhead in excess of 3 cents, must be resolved against them. I think that the courts' conclusion is correct; that they properly applied the summary judgment procedure, and that the judgment should be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice REED joins in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Arkansas Natural Gas Co. v.

Eberhardt, both of Wichita, Kan., for petitioners.\n Mr. J. Louis Monarch, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals has held1 that the Board of Tax Appeals erred in deciding2 that the petitioner was entitled, in reporting its income tax for the year 1935, to deduct payments made by it in 1936, 1937, and 1938. Because of a conflict of decision3 we granted certiorari. \n320 \nU.S. 724\n, 64 S.Ct. 69.\n The petitioner, which conducts a flour mill, reports its net income on the accrual basis. As a first domestic processor of wheat it was subject to the processing tax levied under the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, 7 U.S.C.A.  601 et seq. In the early months of 1935 it paid processing taxes, and claimed, and was allowed, the amount so paid as a deduction from gross income in its federal income tax return for 1935. The amount thus paid is not involved.\n Petitioner instituted a suit to enjoin the collection of processing taxes, and obtained a temporary injunction enjoining further collection on the condition that pendente \n\n[321 \nU.S. 281, 283]\n\u00a0\n lite it file information returns and pay the amount of the tax into a depository. From May 1 to December 31, 1935 petitioner so paid $93,000 and accrued over $9,000 additional upon its books for processing tax for the last month. It also accrued about $1,000 as a reserve for possible increases in taxes earlier paid. On January 6, 1936, the taxing provisions of the Agricultural Adjustment Act were held unconstitutional by this court. Certain of the petitioner's vendees attempted to intervene in the injunction suit and to have impounded moneys returned to them. Petitioner resisted and the court denied the intervention and made an order directing the depository to pay to the petitioner the impounded money, which was done February 28, 1936\n\n\n The petitioner set up on its books a suspense account covering the items above mentioned under the title 'Reserve for Processing Tax, Claims, etc.' The petitioner refunded various sums to its customers, totaling over $ 45,000 in 1936, 1937, and 1938 to reimburse customers for processing tax included in the sales price of flour sold them in 1935 and not paid to the Collector of Internal Revenue as processing taxes. In its 1935 tax return petitioner deducted from gross income the total of the amounts impounded and accrued but not paid the Collector in the year 1935 as accrued tax liability. The Commissioner found a deficiency by disalllowing the petitioner's deduction for taxes accrued but not paid in 1935.\n The propriety of the claimed deduction depends upon the construction of Sections 23(a), 41 and 43 of the Revenue Act of 1934.4 Section 23 permits the deduction of ordinary and necessary expenses 'paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business'. Section 41 declares the general rule that the taxpayer's annual accounting period shall be the fiscal year or calendar \n\n[321 \nU.S. 281, 284]\n\u00a0\n year, depending upon the method of accounting regularly employed, provided such method clearly reflects income. Section 43, on which the petitioner relies, provides:\n'The deductions and credits provided for in this title shall be taken for the taxable year in which 'paid or accrued' or paid or incurred', dependent upon the method of accounting upon the basis of which the net income is computed, unless in order to clearly reflect the income the deductions or credits should be taken as of a different period.'\n\n It is settled by many decisions that a taxpayer may not accrue an expense the amount of which is unsettled or the liability for which is contingent, and this principle is fully applicable to a tax, liability for which the taxpayer denies, and payment whereof he is contesting. \n5\n Here the petitioner, in figuring its costs and its sales price to consumers, added the amount of the processing tax, but it collected its purchase price as such and designated no part of it as representing the tax. The petitioner received the purchase price as such. Its tax liability, if any, to the United States did not differ from other debts. Since it denied liability for, and failed to pay, the tax during the taxable year 1935, it was not in a position in its tax accounting to treat the Government's claim as an accrued liability. As it admittedly received the money in question in 1935 and could not deduct from gross income and accrued liability to offset it, the receipt, it would seem, must constitute income for that year.\n Petitioner nevertheless insists that Section 43 of the Revenue Act, which requires that deductions be taken for the taxable year in which the amount was paid or accrued, creates an exception applicable to this case by its concluding clause, 'unless in order to clearly reflect the income the \n\n[321 \nU.S. 281, 285]\n\u00a0\n deductions or credits should be taken as of a different period.' In short, the petitioner's position is that the Commissioner and the Board of Tax Appeals are authorized and required to make exceptions to the general rule of accounting by annual periods wherever, upon analysis of any transaction, it is found that it would be unjust or unfair not to isolate the transaction and treat it on the basis of the long term result. We think the position is not maintainable.\n The Revenue Act of 1921, in Sections 214(a)(6) and 234(a)(4)6 authorized the Commissioner to allow the deduction of losses in a year other than that in which sustained when, in his opinion, that was necessary clearly to reflect income. The qualifying clause of Section 43 was first added as Section 200(d) of the Revenue Act of 1924.7 The reports of both House and Senate Committees concerning this change said:\n'The proposed bill extends that theory to all deductions and credits. The necessity for such a provision arises in cases in which a taxpayer pays in one year interest or rental payments or other items for a period of years. If he is forced to deduct the amount in the year in which paid, it may result in a distortion of his income which will cause him to pay either more or less taxes than he properly should.'8\n\n From these reports it is clear that the purpose of inserting the qualifying clause was to take care of fixed liabilities payable in fixed installments over a series of years. For example, a tenant would not be compelled to accrue, in the first year of a lease, the rental liability covering the entire term nor would he be permitted, if he saw fit to pay all the rent in advance, to deduct the whole payment as an expense of the current year. But we think it was not intended to upset the well understood and consistently \n\n[321 \nU.S. 281, 286]\n\u00a0\n applied doctrine that cash receipts or matured accounts due on the one hand, and cash payments or accrued definite obligations on the other, should not be taken out of the annual accounting system and, for the benefit of the Government or the taxpayer, treated on a basis which is neither a cash basis nor an accrual basis, because so to do would, in a given instance, work a supposedly more equitable result to the Government or to the taxpayer.\n The question is not whether the Board, within its discretion, made a determination of fact. Compare Dobson v. Helvering, \n320 \nU.S. 489\n, 64 S.Ct. 239. It is rather whether, as matter of law, the Board misconstrued the extent of the power conferred by the Revenue Act.\n'All the revenue acts which have been enacted since the adoption of the Sixteenth Amendment have uniformly assessed the tax on the basis of annual returns showing the net result of all the taxpayer's transactions during a fixed accounting period, either the calendar year, or, at the option of the taxpayer, the particular fiscal year which he may adopt.'9\n\n The rationale of the system is this: 'It is the essence of any system of taxation that it should produce revenue ascertainable, and payable to the government, at regular intervals. Only by such a system is it practicable to produce a regular flow of income and apply methods of accounting, assessment, and collection capable of practical operation.' \n10\n\u00a0\n\n This legal principle has often been stated and applied. \n11\n The uniform result has been denial both to government and to taxpayer of the privilege of allocating income or \n\n[321 \nU.S. 281, 287]\n\u00a0\n outgo to a year other than the year of actual receipt or payment, or, applying the accrual basis, the year in which the right to receive, or the obligation to pay, has become final and definite in amount. \n 12\n\u00a0\n\n But the petitioner urges that Section 43 has altered the rule so that a hybrid system, partly annual and partly transactional, may, within administrative discretion, be substituted for that of annual accounting periods. It urges that the change was due to the desire of Congress to prevent distortion of true income. This must mean distortion of true income, not of a given year, but, in the light of ultimate gain, from a series of transactions over a period of years, growing out of, or in some way related to, an initial transaction in the taxable year. The very section on which petitioner relies, however, reiterates the adherence of Congress to the system of annual periods of computation.\n As we said in Dixie Pine Products Co. v. Commissioner, supra (\n320 \nU.S. 518\n, 64 S.Ct. 365), referring to a section identical with Section 43 now under consideration, 'The provisions of the Revenue Act of 1936 worked no significant change over earlier Acts respecting the permissible basis of calculating annual taxable income.'\n We are of opinion that the purpose of the language which Congress used was not to substitute, whenever in the discretion of an administrative officer or tribunal such a course would seem proper, a divided and inconsistent method of accounting not properly to be denominated either a cash or an accrual system.\n The judgment is affirmed.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice JACKSON, are of opinion that the case is governed by Dobson v. Helvering, \n320 \nU.S. 489\n, 64 S.Ct. 239, and that the judgment should, for the reasons therein stated, be reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 135 F.2d 165. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 45 B.T.A. 671. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Helvering v.

HARTFORD-EMPIRE CO.(1944)\nNo. 423\nArgued: Decided: May 15, 1944\n\n\n\n Rehearing Denied June 12, 1944\n\n\n See \n322 \nU.S. 772\n, 64 S.Ct. 1281. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 271, 272]\n\u00a0\n Mr. William B. Jaspert, of Pittsburgh, Pa., for petitioners.\n Mr. Francis W. Cole, of Hartford, Conn., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Here as in Hazel-Atlas Glass Company v. Hartford-Empire Company, \n322 \nU.S. 238\n, 64 S.Ct. 997, decided today, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has declined to set aside judgments entered at a prior term. 137 F.2d 764. Both this case and the Hazel-Atlas case involve the validity of judgments obtained by Hartford-Empire adjudicating infringement of the 'gob feeding' patent No. 1,655,391 owned by Hartford. In the Hazel-Atlas case, supra, we have held Hartford's proven frauds in connection with obtaining and enforcing that patent were of such nature that the decree of infringement against Hazel-Atlas should be set aside, and have directed that appropriate orders be entered to accomplish that purpose. Nevertheless, it is argued that the decrees rendered against Shawkee and others should be allowed to stand because of certain differences between their situation and that of Hazel-Atlas. These are the differentiating facts:\n Hartford's infringement suit against Shawkee and the other petitioners was not begun until 1933 after the decision of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals the previous year holding Hartford's 'gob feeding' patent valid and \n\n[322 \nU.S. 271, 273]\n\u00a0\n infringed by Hazel-Atlas. The District Court, having been reversed by that previous decision, held Shawkee and the others guilty of infringement. On appeal to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, that court did not again quote from the spurious Clarke article but, like the District Court, simply held in favor of Hartford on the authority of the 1932 decision. 68 F.2d 726. While the appeal was pending final disposition in the Circuit Court, Shawkee's counsel communicated with Judge Buffington charging that the Clarke article was spurious; but at that time Shawkee had no direct proof of its charge. That proof, as pointed out in our Hazel-Atlas opinion, supra, was available only after the United States offered its evidence in the anti-trust suit in 1941.\n None of these facts, we think, should deprive Shawkee and the others of relief against Hartford's fraudulent conduct. To obtain its judgment against them, Hartford successfully used the judgment against Hazel-Atlas without disclosing its previous misconduct. Keystone Co. v. General Excavator Co., \n290 \nU.S. 240, 246\n, 247 S., 54 S.Ct. 146. Hartford can derive no aid from the fact that Shawkee reported to the Circuit Court its belief as to the deceptive authorship of the Clarke article. With that charge on the record, honest dealing with the Court required that Hartford should make a full disclosure of its fraudulent conspiracy. Its failure to do so under these circumstances aggravated the previous deception it had practiced on the Patent Office and the courts.\n The prayer for relief of Shawkee and the others was that the court adjudge that Hartford did not come into court with clean hands, and that they be fully freed from further obligations under the judgments against them. This relief should be granted. They further prayed that a master be appointed by the Circuit Court of Appeals to render an accounting of costs incurred in these and former proceedings, moneys paid by them to Hartford pursuant to the \n\n[322 \nU.S. 271, 274]\n\u00a0\n challenged judgments, and damages sustained by them because of Hartford's unlawful use of its patent. Whether this type of relief will be granted must depend upon further proceedings in the District Court which entered the judgment of infringement.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed. The cause is remanded to it with directions to set aside its 1934 judgment, recall the mandate, and dismiss the appeal; and issue mandate to the District Court with directions to set aside its judgment finding Hartford's patent valid and infringed, deny Hartford all relief against infringement of this patent and permit Shawkee and the others to bring such further proceedings as may be appropriate in accordance with their prayer for relief.\n It is so ordered.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS.\n For the reasons given in my dissent in Hazel-Atlas Glass Company v. Hartford-Empire Company, \n322 \nU.S. 238\n, 64 S.Ct. 997, I think that the decree should be reversed and the cause remanded, with directions to the court below to grant the petitioners leave to file a bill of review in the District Court.\n Mr. Justice REED and Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER join in this opinion.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE agrees with the result suggested in this dissent. \n\n\n\n","91":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSKIDMORE v. SWIFT & CO.(1944)\nNo. 12\nArgued: October 13, 1944Decided: December 4, 1944\n\n\n\n\n[323 \nU.S. 134, 135]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Curtis McBroom, of Fort Worth, Tex., for petitioners.\n Mr. Beverly V. Thompson, of Fort Worth, Tex., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice JACKSON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Seven employees of the Swift and Company packing plant at Fort Worth, Texas, brought an action under the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  201 et seq., to recover overtime, liquidated damages, and attorneys' fees, totalling approximately $77,000. The District Court rendered judgment denying this claim wholly, and the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. 136 F.2d 112.\n It is not denied that the daytime employment of these persons was working time within the Act. Two were engaged in general fire hall duties and maintenance of fire-fighting equipment of the Swift plant. The others operated elevators or acted as relief men in fire duties. They worked from 7:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., with a half-hour lunch period, five days a week. They were paid weekly salaries.\n Under their oral agreement of employment, however, petitioners undertook to stay in the fire hall on the Company premises, or within hailing distance, three and a half to four nights a week. This involved no task except to answer alarms, either because of fire or because the sprinkler was set off for some other reason. No fires occurred during the period in issue, the alarms were rare, and the time required for their answer rarely exceeded an hour. For each alarm answered the employees were \n\n[323 \nU.S. 134, 136]\n\u00a0\n paid in addition to their fixed compensation an agreed amount, fifty cents at first, and later sixty-four cents. The Company provided a brick fire hall equipped with steam heat and air-conditioned rooms. It provided sleeping quarters, a pool table, a domino table, and a radio. The men used their time in sleep or amusement as they saw fit, except that they were required to stay in or close by the fire hall and be ready to respond to alarms. It is stipulated that 'they agreed to remain in the fire hall and stay in it or within hailing distance, subject to call, in event of fire or other casualty, but were not required to perform any specific tasks during these periods of time, except in answering alarms.' The trial court found the evidentiary facts as stipulated; it made no findings of fact as such as to whether under the arrangement of the parties and the circumstances of this case, which in some respects differ from those of the Armour case (Armour & Co. v. Wantock et al., \n323 \nU.S. 126\n, 65 S.Ct. 165), the fire hall duty or any part thereof constituted working time. It said, however, as a 'conclusion of law' that 'the time plaintiffs spent in the fire hall subject to call to answer fire alarms does not constitute hours worked, for which overtime compensation is due them under the Fair Labor Standards Act, as interpreted by the Administrator and the Courts,' and in its opinion (53 F.Supp. 1020, 1021) observed, 'of course we know pursuing such pleasurable occupations or performing such personal chores does not constitute work.' The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed.\n For reasons set forth in the Armour case, \n323 \nU.S. 126\n, 65 S.Ct. 165, decided herewith we hold that no principle of law found either in the statute or in Court decisions precludes waiting time from also being working time. We have not attempted to, and we cannot, lay down a legal formula to resolve cases so varied in their facts as are the many situations in which employment involves waiting time. Whether in a concrete case such time falls within or without the Act is a question of fact to be resolved by appropriate findings of the trial \n\n[323 \nU.S. 134, 137]\n\u00a0\n court. Walling v. Jacksonville Paper Co., \n317 \nU.S. 564, 572\n, 63 S.Ct. 332. This involves scrutiny and construction of the agreements between the particular parties, appraisal of their practical construction of the working agreement by conduct, consideration of the nature of the service, and its relation to the waiting time, and all of the surrounding circumstances. Facts may show that the employee was engaged to wait, or they way show that he waited to be engaged. His compensation may cover both waiting and task, or only performance of the task itself. Living quarters may in some situations be furnished as a facility of the task and in another as a part of its compensation. The law does not impose an arrangement upon the parties. It imposes upon the courts the task of finding what the arrangement was.\n We do not minimize the difficulty of such an inquiry where the arrangements of the parties have not contemplated the problem posed by the statute. But it does not differ in nature or in the standards to guide judgment from that which frequently conronts courts where they must find retrospectively the effect of contracts as to matters which the parties failed to anticipate or explicitly to provide for.\n Congress did not utilize the services of an administrative agency to find facts and to determine in the first instance whether particular cases fall within or without the Act. Instead, it put this responsibility on the courts. Kirschbaum v. Walling, \n316 \nU.S. 517, 523\n, 62 S.Ct. 1116, 1120. But it did create the office of Administrator, impose upon him a variety of duties, endow him with powers to inform himself of conditions in industries and employments subject to the Act, and put on him the duties of bringing injunction actions to restrain violations. Pursuit of his duties has accumulated a considerable experience in the problems of ascertaining working time in employments involving periods of inactivity and a knowledge of the customs \n\n[323 \nU.S. 134, 138]\n\u00a0\n prevailing in reference to their solution. From these he is obliged to reach conclusions as to conduct without the law, so that he should seek injunctions to stop it, and that within the law, so that he has no call to interfere. He has set forth his views of the application of the Act under different circumstances in an interpretative bulletin and in informal rulings. They provide a practical guide to employers and employees as to how the office representing the public interest in its enforcement will seek to apply it. Wage and Hour Division, Interpretative Bulletin No. 13.\n The Administrator thinks the problems presented by inactive duty require a flexible solution, rather than the all-in or all-out rules respectively urged by the parties in this case, and his Bulletin endeavors to suggest standards and examples to guide in particular situations. In some occupations, it says, periods of inactivity are not properly counted as working time even though the employee is subject to call. Examples are an operator of a small telephone exchange where the switchboard is in her home and she ordinarily gets several hours of uninterrupted sleep each night; or a pumper of a stripper well or watchman of a lumber camp during the off season, who may be on duty twenty-four hours a day but ordinarily 'has a normal night's sleep, has ample time in which to eat his meals, and has a certain amount of time for relaxation and entirely private pursuits.' Exclusion of all such hours the Administrator thinks may be justified. In general, the answer depends 'upon the degree to which the employee is free to engage in personal activities during periods of idleness when he is subject to call and the number of consecutive hours that the employee is subject to call without being required to perform active work.' 'Hours worked are not limited to the time spent in active labor but include time given by the employee toi the employer. ...' \n\n[323 \nU.S. 134, 139]\n\u00a0\n The facts of this case do not fall within any of the specific examples given, but the conclusion of the Administrator, as expressed in the brief amicus curiae, is that the general tests which he has suggested point to the exclusion of sleeping and eating time of these employees from the work-week and the inclusion of all other on-call time: although the employees were required to remain on the premises during the entire time, the evidence shows that they were very rarely interrupted in their normal sleeping and eating time, and these are pursuits of a purely private nature which would presumably occupy the employees' time whether they were on duty or not and which apparently could be pursued adequately and comfortably in the required circumstances; the rest of the time is different because there is nothing in the record to suggest that, even though pleasurably spent, it was spent in the ways the men would have chosen had they been free to do so.\n There is no statutory provision as to what, if any, deference courts should pay to the Administrator's conclusions. And, while we have given them notice, we have had no occasion to try to prescribe their influence. The rulings of this Administrator are not reached as a result of hearing adversary proceedings in which he finds facts from evidence and reaches conclusions of law from findings of fact. They are not, of course, conclusive, even in the cases with which they directly deal, much less in those to which they apply only by analogy. They do not constitute an interpretation of the Act or a standard for judging factual situations which binds a district court's processes, as an authoritative pronouncement of a higher court might do. But the Administrator's policies are made in pursuance of official duty, based upon more specialized experience and broader investigations and information than is likely to come to a judge in a particular case. They do determine the policy which will guide applications for enforcement \n\n[323 \nU.S. 134, 140]\n\u00a0\n by injunction on behalf of the Government. Good administration of the Act and good judicial administration alike require that the standards of public enforcement and those for determining private rights shall be at variance only where justified by very good reasons. The fact that the Administrator's policies and standards are not reached by trial in adversary form does not mean that they are not entitled to respect. This Court has long given considerable and in some cases decisive weight to Treasury Decisions and to interpretative regulations of the Treasury and of other bodies that were not of adversary origin.\n We consider that the rulings, interpretations and opinions of the Administrator under this Act, while not controlling upon the courts by reason of their authority, do constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance. The weight of such a judgment in a particular case will depend upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those factors which give it power to persuade, if lacking power to control.\n The courts in the Armour case weighed the evidence in the particular case in the light of the Administrator's rulings and reached a result consistent therewith. The evidnece in this case in some respects, such as the understanding as to separate compensation for answering alarms, is different. Each case must stand on its own facts. But in this case, although the District Court referred to the Administrator's Bulletin, its evaluation and inquiry were apparently restricted by its notion that waiting time may not be work, an understanding of the law which we hold to be erroneous. Accordingly, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings consistent herewith.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","92":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSMITH v.

The refusal is alleged to have been solely because of the race and color of the proposed voter.\n The actions of respondents are said to violate Sections 31 and 43 of Title 81 of the United States Code, 8 U.S.C.A.  31 and 43, in that petitoner was deprived of rights secured by Sections 2 and 4 of Article I2 and the Fourteenth, Fifteenth and Seventeenth Amend- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 649, 652]\n\u00a0\n ments to the United States Constitution. \n3\n The suit was filed in the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of Texas, which had jurisdiction under Judicial Code Section 24, subsection 14, 28 U.

Constitution of Texas, Article VI, Section 2 Vernon's Ann.St.; Vernon's Civil Statutes (1939 ed.), Article 2955. Primary elections for United States Senators, Congressmen and state officers are provided for by Chapters Twelve and Thirteen of the statutes. Under these chapters, the Democratic Party was required to hold the primary which was the occasion of the alleged wrong to petitioner. A summary of the state statutes regulating primaries appears in the footnote. \n6\n These nominations are to be made by the qualified voters of the party. Art. 3101. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 649, 654]\n\u00a0\n The Democratic Party of Texas is held by the Supreme Court of that state to be a 'voluntary association,' Bell v. Hill, 123 Tex. 531, 534, 74 S.W.2d 113, protected by Section 27 of the Bill of Rights, Art. 1, Constitution of Texas, from interference by the state except that:\n'In the interest of fair methods and a fair expression by their members of their preferences in the selection of their \n\n[321 \nU.S. 649, 655]\n\u00a0\n nominees, the State may regulate such elections by proper laws.' Page 545 of 123 Tex., page 120 of 74 S.W.2d. That court stated further:\n\n'Since the right to organize and maintain a political party is one guaranteed by the Bill of Rights of this state, it necessarily follows that every privilege essential or reasonably appropriate to the exercise of that right is likewise \n\n[321 \nU.S. 649, 656]\n\u00a0\n guaranteed, including, of course, the privilege of determining the policies of the party and its membership. Without the privilege of determining the policy of a political association and its membership, the right to organize such an association would be a mere mockery. We think these rights, that is, the right to determine the membership of a political party and to determine its policies, of necessity are to be exercised by the State Convention of such party, and cannot, under any circumstances, be conferred upon a state or governmental agency.' Page 546 of 123 Tex., page 120 of 74 S.W.2d Cf. Waples v. Marrast, 108 Tex. 5, 184 S.W. 180, L.R.A.1917A, 253.\n\n The Democratic party on May 24, 1932, in a State Convention adopted the following resolution, which has not since been 'amended, abrogated, annulled or avoided':\n'Be it resolved that all white citizens of the State of Texas who are qualified to vote under the Constitution and laws of the State shall be eligible to membership in the \n\n[321 \nU.S. 649, 657]\n\u00a0\n Democratic party and, as such, entitled to participate in its deliberations.' It was by virtue of this resolution that the respondents refused to permit the petitioner to vote.\n\n Texas is free to conduct her elections and limit her electorate as she may deem wise, save only as her action may be affected by the prohibitions of the United States Constitution or in conflict with powers delegated to and exercised by the National Government. \n7\n The Fourteenth Amendment forbids a state from making or enforcing any law which abridges the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States and the Fifteenth Amendment specifically interdicts any denial or abridgement by a state of the right of citizens to vote on account of color. Respondents appeared in the District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals and defended on the ground that the Democratic party of Texas is a voluntary organization with members banded together for the purpose of selecting individuals of the group representing the common political beliefs as candidates in the general election. As such a voluntary organization, it was claimed, the Democratic party is free to select its own membership and limit to whites participation in the party primary. Such action, the answer asserted, does not violate the Fourteenth, Fifteenth or Seventeenth Amendment as officers of government cannot be chosen at primaries and the Amendments are applicable only to general elections where governmental officers are actually elected. Primaries, it is said, are political party affairs, handled by party not governmental officers. No appearance for respondents is made in this Court. Arguments presented here by the Attorney General of Texas and the Chairman of the State Democratic Executive Committee of Texas, as amici \n\n[321 \nU.S. 649, 658]\n\u00a0\n curiae, urged substantially the same grounds as those advanced by the respondents.\n The right of a Negro to vote in the Texas primary has been considered heretofore by this Court. The first case was Nixon v. Herndon, \n273 \nU.S. 536\n, 47 S.Ct. 446. At that time, 1924, the Texas statute, Art. 3093a, Acts 1923, 2d Called Sess., c. 32, afterwards numbered Art. 3107, Rev.Stat.1925, declared 'in no event shall a Negro be eligible to participate in a Democratic party primary election ... in the State of Texas.' Nixon was refused the right to vote in a Democratic primary and brought a suit for damages against the election officers under R.S.  1979 and 2004, the present sections 43 and 31 of Title 8, U.S.C., 8 U.S.C.A.  43 and 31, respectively. It was urged to this Court that the denial of the franchise the Nixon violated his Constitutional rights under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. Without consideration of the Fifteenth, this Court held that the action of Texas in denying the ballot to Negroes by statute was in violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and reversed the dismissal of the suit.\n The legislature of Texas reenacted the article but gave the State Executive Committee of a party the power to prescribe the qualifications of its members for voting or other participation. This article remains in the statutes. The State Executive Committee of the Democratic party adopted a resolution that white Democrats and none other might participate in the primaries of that party. Nixon was refused again the privilege of voting in a primary and again brought suit for damages by virtue of Section 31, Title 8 U.S.C., 18 U.S.C.A.  31. This Court again reversed the dismissal of the suit for the reason that the Committee action was deemed to be State action and invalid as discriminatory under the Fourteenth Amendment. The test was said to be whether the Committee operated as representative of the State in the discharge of the State's authority. Nixon v. Condon, \n286 \nU.S. 73\n, 52 S.Ct. 484, 88 A. L.R. 458. The question of the inherent power \n\n[321 \nU.S. 649, 659]\n\u00a0\n of a political party in Texas 'without restraint by any law to determine its own membership' was lift open. Id., \n286 \nU.S. 83, 84\n, 85 S., 52 S.Ct. 485.\n In Grovey v. Townsend, \n295 \nU.S. 45\n, 55 S.Ct. 622, 97 A. L.R. 680, this Court had before it another suit for damages for the refusal in a primary of a county clerk, a Texas officer with only public functions to perform, to furnish petitioner, a Negro, an absentee ballot. The refusal was solely on the ground of race. This case differed from Nixon v. Condon, supra, in that a state convention of the Democratic party had passed the resolution of May 24, 1932, hereinbefore quoted. It was decided that the determination by the state convention of the membership of the Democratic party made a significant change from a determination by the Executive Committee. The former was party action, voluntary in character. The latter, as had been held in the Condon case, was action by authority of the State. The managers of the primary election were therefore declared not to be state officials in such sense that their action was state action. A state convention of a party was said not to be an organ of the state. This Court went on to announce that to deny a vote in a primary was a mere refusal of party membership with which 'the state need have no concern,' 295 U.S. loc.cit. 55, 55 S.Ct.loc.cit. 626, while for a state to deny a vote in a general election on the ground of race or color violated the Constitution. Consequently, there was found no ground for holding that the county clerk's refusal of a ballot because of racial ineligibility for party membership denied the petitioner any right under the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments.\n Since Grovey v. Townsend and prior to the present suit, no case from Texas involving primary elections has been before this Court. We did decide, however, United States v. Classic, \n313 \nU.S. 299\n, 61 S.Ct. 1031. We there held that Section 4 of Article I of the Constitution authorized Congress to regulate primary as well as general elections, 313 U.S. at pages 316, 317, 61 S.Ct. at page 1038, \n\n[321 \nU.S. 649, 660]\n\u00a0\n 'where the primary is by law made an integral part of the election machinery.' 313 U.S. at page 318, 61 S.Ct. at page 1039. Consequently, in the Classic case, we upheld the applicability to frauds in a Louisiana primary of  19 and 20 of the Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C.A.  51, 52 Thereby corrupt acts of election officers were subjected to Congressional sanctions because that body had power to protect rights of Federal suffrage secured by the Constitution in primary as in general elections. 313 U.S. at page 323, 61 S.Ct. at page 1041. This decision depended, too, on the determination that under the Louisiana statutes the primary was a part of the procedure for choice of Federal officials. By this decision the doubt as to whether or not such primaries were a part of 'elections' subject to Federal control, which had remained unanswered since Newberry v. United States, \n256 \nU.S. 232\n, 41 S.Ct. 469, was erased. The Nixon cases were decided under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment without a determination of the status of the primary as a part of the electoral process. The exclusion of Negroes from the primaries by action of the State was held invalid under that Amendment. The fusing by the Classic case of the primary and general elections into a single instrumentality for choice of officers has a definite bearing on the permissibility under the Constitution of excluding Negroes from primaries. This is not to say that the Classic case cuts directly into the rationale of Grovey v. Townsend. This latter case was not mentioned in the opinion. Classic bears upon Grovey v. Townsend not because exclusion of Negroes from primaries is any more or less state action by reason of the unitary character of the electoral process but because the recognition of the place of the primary in the electoral scheme makes clear that state delegation to a party of the power to fix the qualifications of primary elections is delegation of a state function that may make the party's action the action of the state. When Grovey v. Townsend was written, the Court looked upon the denial of a vote in a primary as a \n\n[321 \nU.S. 649, 661]\n\u00a0\n mere refusal by a party of party membership. 295 U.S. at page 55, 55 S.Ct. at page 626, 97 A.L.R. 680. As the Louisiana statutes for holding primaries are similar to those of Texas, our ruling in Classic as to the unitary character of the electoral process calls for a reexamination as to whether or not the exclusion of Negroes from a Texas party primary was state action.\n The statutes of Texas relating to primaries and the resolution of the Democratic party of Texas extending the privileges of membership to white citizens only are the same in substance and effect today as they were when Grovey v. Townsend was decided by a unanimous Court. The question as to whether the exclusionary action of the party was the action of the State persists as the determinative factor. In again entering upon consideration of the inference to be drawn as to state action from a substantially similar factual situation, it should be noted that Grovey v. Townsend upheld exclusion of Negroes from primaries through the denial of party membership by a party convention. A few years before this Court refused approval of exclusion by the State Executive Committee of the party. A different result was reached on the theory that the Committee action was state authorized and the Convention action was unfettered by statutory control. Such a variation in the result from so slight a change in form influences us to consider anew the legal validity of the distinction which has resulted in barring Negroes from participating in the nominations of candidates of the Democratic party in Texas. Other precedents of this Court forbid the abridgement of the right to vote. United States v. Reese, \n92 \nU.S. 214\n, 217; Neal v. Delaware, \n103 \nU.S. 370\n, 388; Guinn v. United States, \n238 \nU.S. 347, 361\n, 35 S.Ct. 926, 930, L.R.A.1916A, 1124; Myers v. Anderson, \n238 \nU.S. 368, 379\n, 35 S. Ct. 932, 934, 59 L.ed. 1349; Lane v. Wilson, \n307 \nU.S. 268\n, 59 S.Ct. 872.\n It may now be taken as a postulate that the right to vote in such a primary for the nomination of candidates without discrimination by the State, like the right to vote \n\n[321 \nU.S. 649, 662]\n\u00a0\n in a general election, is a right secured by the Constitution. United States v. Classic, 313 U.S. at page 314, 61 S.Ct. at page 1037; Myers v. Anderson, \n238 \nU.S. 368\n, 35 S.Ct. 932; Ex parte Yarbrough, \n110 \nU.S. 651\n, 663 et seq., 4 S.Ct. 152, 158. By the terms of the Fifteenth Amendment that right may not be abridged by any state on account of race. Under our Constitution the great privilege of the ballot may not be denied a man by the State because of his color.\n We are thus brought to an examination of the qualifications for Democratic primary electors in Texas, to determine whether state action or private action has excluded Negroes from participation. Despite Texas' decision that the exclusion is produced by private or party action, Bell v. Hill, supra, Federal courts must for themselves appraise the facts leading to that conclusion. It is only by the performance of this obligation that a final and uniform interpretation can be given to the Constitution, the 'supreme Law of the Land.' Nixon v. Condon, \n286 \nU.S. 73, 88\n, 52 S.Ct. 484, 88 A.L.R. 458; Standard Oil Co. v. Johnson, \n316 \nU.S. 481, 483\n, 62 S.Ct. 1168, 1169; Bridges v. California, \n314 \nU.S. 252\n, 62 S.Ct. 190; Lisenba v. California, \n314 \nU.S. 219, 238\n, 62 S.Ct. 280, 290; Union Pacific R. Co. v. United States, \n313 \nU.S. 450, 467\n, 61 S.Ct. 1064, 1074; Milk Wagon Drivers Union v. Meadowmoor Dairies, \n312 \nU.S. 287, 294\n, 61 S.Ct. 552, 555, 132 A.L.R. 1200; Chambers v. Florida, \n309 \nU.S. 227, 228\n, 60 S.Ct. 472, 473. Texas requires electors in a primary to pay a poll tax. Every person who does so pay and who has the qualifications of age and residence is an acceptable voter for the primary. Art. 2955. As appears above in the summary of the statutory provisions set out in note 6, Texas requires by the law the election of the county officers of a party. These compose the county executive committee. The county chairmen so selected are members of the district executive committee and choose the chairman for the district. Precinct primary election officers are named by the county executive committee. Statutes provide for the election by the voters of precinct \n\n[321 \nU.S. 649, 663]\n\u00a0\n delegates to the county convention of a party and the selection of delegates to the district and state conventions by the county convention. The state convention selects the state executive committee. No convention may place in platform or resolution any demand for specific legislation without endorsement of such legislation by the voters in a primary. Texas thus directs the selection of all party officers.\n Primary elections are conducted by the party under state statutory authority. The county executive committee selects precinct election officials and the county, district or state executive committees, respectively, canvass the returns. These party committees or the state convention certify the party's candidates to the appropriate officers for inclusion on the official ballot for the general election. No name which has not been so certified may appear upon the ballot for the general election as a candidate of a political party. No other name may be printed on the ballot which has not been placed in nomination by qualified voters who must take oath that they did not participate in a primary for the selection of a candidate for the office for which the nomination is made.\n The state courts are given exclusive original jurisdiction of contested elections and of mandamus proceedings to compel party officers to perform their statutory duties.\n We think that this statutory system for the selection of party nominees for inclusion on the general election ballot makes the party which is required to follow these legislative directions an agency of the state in so far as it determines the participants in a primary election. The party takes its character as a state agency from the duties imposed upon it by state statutes; the duties do not become matters of private law because they are performed by a political party. The plan of the Texas primary follows substantially that of Louisiana, with the exception that in \n\n[321 \nU.S. 649, 664]\n\u00a0\n Louisiana the state pays the cost of the primary while Texas assesses the cost against candidates. In numerous instances, the Texas statutes fix or limit the fees to be charged. Whether paid directly by the state or through state requirements, it is state action which compels. When primaries become a part of the machinery for choosing officials, state and national, as they have here, the same tests to determine the character of discrimination or abridgement should be applied to the primary as are applied to the general election. If the state requires a certain electoral procedure, prescribes a general election ballot made up of party nominees so chosen and limits the choice of the electorate in general elections for state offices, practically speaking, to those whose names appear on such a ballot, it endorses, adopts and enforces the discrimination against Negroes, practiced by a party entrusted by Texas law with the determination of the qualifications of participants in the primary. This is state action within the meaning of the Fifteenth Amendment. Guinn v. United States, \n238 \nU.S. 347, 362\n, 35 S.Ct. 926, 930, L.R.A. 1916A, 1124.\n The United States is a constitutional democracy. Its organic law grants to all citizens a right to participate in the choice of elected officials without restriction by any state because of race. This grant to the people of the opportunity for choice is not to be nulified by a state through casting its electoral process in a form which permits a private organization to practice racial discrimination in the election. Constitutional rights would be of little value if they could be thus indirectly denied. Lane v. Wilson, \n307 \nU.S. 268, 275\n, 59 S.Ct. 872, 876.\n The privilege of membership in a party may be, as this Court said in Grovey v. Townsend, \n295 \nU.S. 45, 55\n, 55 S.Ct. 622, 626, 97 A.L.R. 680, no concern of a state. But when, as here, that privilege is also the essential qualification for voting in a primary to select nominees for a general election, the state makes the action \n\n[321 \nU.S. 649, 665]\n\u00a0\n of the party the action of the state. In reaching this conclusion we are not unmindful of the desirability of continuity of decision in constitutional questions. \n8\n However, when convinced of former error, this Court has never felt constrained to follow precedent. In constitutional questions, where correction depends upon amendment and not upon legislative action this Court throughout its history has freely exercised its power to reexamine the basis of its constitutional decisions. This has long been accepted practice,9 and this practice has continued to this day. 10 This is particularly true when the decision believed erroneous is the application of a constitutional principle rather \n\n[321 \nU.S. 649, 666]\n\u00a0\n than an interpretation of the Constitution to extract the principle itself. 11 Here we are applying, contrary to the recent decision in Grovey v. Townsend, the well established principle of the Fifteenth Amendment, forbidding the abridgement by a state of a citizen's right to vote. Grovey v. Townsend is overruled.\n Judgment reversed.\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER concurs in the result.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS.\n In Mahnich v. Southern Steamship Co., \n321 \nU.S. 96\n, 64 S.Ct. 455, I have expressed my views with respect to the present policy of the court freely to disregard and to overrule considered decisions and the rules of law announced in them. This tendency, it seems to me, indicates an intolerance for what those who have composed this court in the past have conscientiously and deliberately concluded, and involves an assumption that knowledge and wisdom reside in us which was denied to our predecessors. I shall not repeat what I there said for I consider it fully applicable to the instant decision, which but points the moral anew.\n A word should be said with respect to the judicial history forming the background of Grovey v. Townsend, \n295 \nU.S. 45\n, 55 S.Ct. 622, 97 A.L.R. 680, which is now overruled.\n In 1923 Texas adopted a statute which declared that no negro should be eligible to participate in a Democratic Primary election in that State. A negro, a citizen of the United States and of Texas, qualified to vote, except for the provisions of the statute, was denied the opportunity to vote in a primary election at which candidates were to be chosen for the offices of senator and representative in the Congress of the United States. He brought action against the judges of election in a United States court for \n\n[321 \nU.S. 649, 667]\n\u00a0\n damages for their refusal to accept his ballot. This court unanimously reversed a judgment dismissing the complaint and held that the judges acted pursuant to State law and that the State of Texas, by its statute, had denied the voter the equal protection secured by the Fourteenth Amendment. Nixon v. Herndon, 1927, \n273 \nU.S. 536\n, 47 S.Ct. 446.\n In 1927 the legislature of Texas repealed the provision condemned by this court and enacted that every political party in the State might, through its Executive Committee, prescribe the qualifications of its own members and determine in its own way who should be qualified to vote or participate in the party, except that no denial of participation could be decreed by reason of former political or other affiliation. Thereupon the State Executive Committee of the Democratic Party in Texas adopted a resolution that white Democrats, and no other, should be allowed to participate in the party's primaries.\n A negro, whose primary ballot was rejected pursuant to the resolution, sought to recover damages from the judges who had rejected it. The United States District Court dismissed his action, and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed; but this court reversed the judgment and sustained the right of action by a vote of 5 to 4. Nixon v. Condon, 1932, \n286 \nU.S. 73\n, 52 S.Ct. 484, 486, 88 A.L.R. 458.\n The opinion was written with care. The court refused to decide whether a political party in Texas had inherent power to determine its membership. The court said, however: 'Whatever inherent power a state political party has to determine the content of its membership resides in the state convention', and referred to the statutes of Texas to demonstrate that the State had left the Convention free to formulate the party faith. Attention was directed to the fact that the statute under attack did not leave to the party convention the definition of party membership but placed it in the party's State Executive Committee which could not, by any stretch of reasoning, be \n\n[321 \nU.S. 649, 668]\n\u00a0\n held to constitute the party. The court held, therefore, that the State Executive Committee acted solely by virtue of the statutory mandate and as delegate of State power, and again struck down the discrimination against negro voters as deriving force and virtue from State action,-that is, from statute.\n In 1932 the Democratic Convention of Texas adopted a resolution that 'all white citizens of the State of Texas who are qualified to vote under the Constitution and laws of the state shall be eligible to membership in the Democratic party and as such entitled to participate in its deliberations.'\n A negro voter qualified to vote in a primary election, except for the exclusion worked by the resolution, demanded an absentee ballot which he was entitled to mail to the judges at a primary election except for the resolution. The county clerk refused to furnish him a ballot. He brought an action for damages against the clerk in a state court. That court, which was the tribunal having final jurisdiction under the laws of Texas, dismissed his complaint and he brought the case to this court for review. After the fullest consideration by the whole court1 an opinion was written representing its unanimous views and affirming the judgment. Grovey v. Townsend, 1935, \n295 \nU.S. 45\n, 55 S.Ct. 622, 97 A.L.R. 680.\n I believe it will not be gainsaid the case received the attention and consideration which the questions involved demanded and the opinion represented the views of all the justices. It appears that those views do not now commend themselves to the court. I shall not restate them. They are exposed in the opinion and must stand or fall on their merits. Their soundness, however, is not a matter which presently concerns me. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 649, 669]\n\u00a0\n The reason for my concern is that the instant decision, overruling that announced about nine years ago, tends to bring adjudications of this tribunal into the same class as a restricted railroad ticket, good for this day and train only. I have no assurance, in view of current decisions, that the opinion announced today may not shortly be repudiated and overruled by justices who deem they have new light on the subject. In the present term the court has overruled three cases.\n In the present case, as in Mahnich v. Southern S.S. Co., the court below relied, as it was bound to, upon our previous decision. As that court points out, the statutes of Texas have not been altered since Grovey v. Townsend was decided. The same resolution is involved as was drawn in question in Grovey v. Townsend. Not a fact differentiates that case from this except the names of the parties.\n It is suggested that Grovey v. Townsend was overruled sub silentio in United States v. Classic, \n313 \nU.S. 299\n, 61 S.Ct. 1031. If so, the situation is even worse than that exhibited by the outright repudiation of an earlier decision, for it is the fact that, in the Classic case, Grovey v. Townsend was distinguished in brief and argument by the Government without suggestion that it was wrongly decided, and was relied on by the appellees, not as a controlling decision, but by way of analogy. The case is not mentioned in either of the opinions in the Classic case. Again and again it is said in the opinion of the court in that case that the voter who was denied the right to vote was a fully qualified voter. In other words, there was no question of his being a person entitled under state law to vote in the primary. The offense charged was the fraudulent denial of his conceded right by an election officer because of his race. Here the question is altogether different. It is whether, in a Democratic primary, he who tendered his vote was a member of the Democratic Party. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 649, 670]\n\u00a0\n I do not stop to call attention to the material differences between the primary election laws of Louisiana under consideration in the Classic case and those of Texas which are here drawn in question. These differences were spelled out in detail in the Government's brief in the Classic case and emphasized in its oral argument. It is enough to say that the Louisiana statutes required the primary to be conducted by State officials and made it a State election, whereas, under the Texas statute, the primary is a party election conducted at the expense of members of the party and by officials chosen by the party. If this court's opinion in the Classic case discloses its method of overruling earlier decisions, I can only protest that, in fairness, it should rather have adopted the open and frank way of saying what it was doing than, after the event, characterize its past action as overruling Grovey v. Townsend though those less sapient never realized the fact.\n It is regrettable that in an era marked by doubt and confusion, an era whose greatest need is steadfastness of thought and purpose, this court, which has been looked to as exhibiting consistency in adjudication, and a steadiness which would hold the balance even in the face of temporary ebbs and flows of opinion, should now itself become the breeder of fresh doubt and confusion in the public mind as to the stability of our institutions. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 8 U.S.C.  31, 8 U.S.C.A.  31:\n'All citizens of the United States who are otherwise qualified by law to vote at any election by the people in any State, Territory, district, county, city, parish, township, school district, municipality, or other territorial subdivision, shall be entitled and allowed to vote at all such elections, without distinction of race, color, or previous condition of servitude; any constitution, law, custom, usage, or regulation of any State or Territory, or by or under its authority, to the contrary notwithstanding.'\n\n  43: 'Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.' \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Constitution, Art.

The judgment entered declared the denial was constitutional. This phase of the case is not considered further as the decision on the merits determines the legality of the action of the respondents. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] Smith v. Allwright, 5 Cir., 131 F.2d 593. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The extent to which the state controls the primary election machinery appears from the Texas statutes, as follows: Art. 3118, Vernon's Texas Statutes, provides for the election of a county chairman for each party holding a primary by the 'qualified voters of the whole county,' and of one member of the party's county executive committee by the 'qualified voters of their respective election precincts.' These officers have direct charge of the primary. There is in addition statutory provision for a party convention: the voters in each precinct choose delegates to a county convention, and the latter chooses delegates to a state convention. Art. 3134. The state convention has authority to choose the state executive committee and its chairman. Art. 3139, 1939 Supp. Condidates for offices to be filled by election are required to be nominated at a primary election if the nominating party cast over 100,000 votes at the preceding general election. Art. 3101. The date of the primary is fixed at the fourth Saturday in July; a majority is required for nomination, and if no candidate receives a majority, a run-off primary between the two highest standing candidates is held on the fourth Saturday in August. Art. 3102. Polling places may not be within a hundred yards of those used by the opposite party. Art. 3103. Each precinct primary is to be conducted by a presiding judge and the assistants he names. These officials are selected by the county executive committee. Art. 3104. Absentee voting machinery provided by the state for general elections is also used in primaries. Art. 2956. The presiding judges are given legal authority similar to that of judges at general elections. Compare Art. 3105 with Art. 3002. The county executive committee may decide whether county officers are to be nominated by majority or plurality vote. Art. 3106. The state \n executive committee is given power to fix qualifications of party membership, Art. 3107; Art. 2955, 1942 Supp., requires payment of a poll tax by voters in primary elections, and Art. 3093(3) deals with political qualifications of candidates for nomination for United States Senator. But cf. Bell v. Hill, 123 Tex. 531, 74 S.W.2d 113. Art. 3108 empowers the county committee to prepare a budget covering the cost of the primary and to require each candidate to pay a fair share. The form of the ballot is prescribed by Art. 3109. Art. 3101 provides that the nominations be made by the qualified voters of the party. Cf. Art. 3091. Art. 3110 prescribes a test for voters who take part in the primary. It reads as follows:\n'No official ballot for primary election shall have on it any symbol or device or any printed matter, except a uniform primary test, reading as follows: 'I am a . . . (inserting name of political party or organization of which the voter is a member) and pledge myself to support the nominee of this primary;' and any ballot which shall not contain such printed test above the names of the candidates thereon, shall be void and shall not be counted.' This appears, however, to be a morally rather than a legally enforcible pledge. See Love v. Wilcox, 119 Tex. 256, 28 S.W.2d 515, 70 A.L. R. 1484.\n\n Arts. 3092 and 3111 to 3114 deal with the mechanics of procuring a place on the primary ballot for federal, state, district, or county office. The request for a place on the ballot may be made to the state, district, or county party chairman, either by the person desiring nomination or by twenty-five qualified voters. The ballot is prepared by a subcommittee of the county executive committee. Art. 3115. A candidate must pay his share of the expenses of the election before his name is placed on the ballot. Art. 3116. Art. 3116, however, limits the sum that may be charged candidates for certain posts, such as the offices of district judge, judge of the Court of Civil Appeals, and senator and representative in the state and federal legislatures, and for some counties fees are fixed by Arts. 3116a-3116d, 1939 Supp., and 3116e, 3116f, 1942 Supp. Supplies for the election are dis- \n tributed by the county committee, Art. 3119, and Art. 3120 authorizes the use of voting booths, ballot boxes and guard rails, prepared for the general election, 'for the organized political party nominating by primary election that cast over one hundred thousand votes at the preceding general election.' The county tax collector must supply lists of qualified voters by precincts; and these lists must be used at the primary. Art. 3121. The same precautions as to secrecy and the care of the ballots must be observed in primary as in general elections. Art. 3122. Arts. 3123-3125 cover the making of returns to the county and state chairmen and convass of the result by the county committee. By Art. 3127, a statewide canvass is required of the state executive committee for state and district officers and a similar canvass by the state convention, with respect to state officers, is provided by Art. 3138. The nominations for district offices are certified to the county clerks, and for state officers to the Secretary of State. Arts. 3127, 3137, 3138. Ballot boxes and ballots are to be returned to the county clerk, Art. 3128, 1942 Supp., and upon certification by the county committee, the county clerk must publish the result. Art. 3129, 1942 Supp. If no objection is made within five days, the name of the nominee is then to be placed on the official ballot by the county clerk. Art. 3131, 1942 Supp. Cf. Arts. 2978, 2984, 2992, 2996. Arts. 3146-3153, 1942 Supp., provide for election contests. The state district courts have exclusive original jurisdiction, and the Court of Civil Appeals has appellate jurisdiction. The state courts are also authorized to issue writs of mandamus to require executive committees, committeemen, and primary officers to discharge the duties imposed by the statute. Art. 3142; cf. Art. 3124.\n The official ballot is required to contain parallel columns for the nominees of the respective parties, a column for independent candidates, and a blank column for such names as the voters care to write in. Arts. 2978, 2980. The names of nominees of a party casting more than 100,000 votes at the last preceding general election may not be printed on the ballot unless they were chosen at a primary \n election. Art. 2978. Candidates who are not party nominees may have their names printed on the ballot by complying with Arts. 3159-62. These sections require applications to be filed with the Secretary of State, county judge, or mayor, for state and district, county, and city offices, respectively. The applications must be signed by qualified voters to the number of from one to five per cent of the ballots cast at the preceding election, depending on the office. Each signer must take an oath to the effect that he did not participate in a primary at which a candidate for the office in question was nominated. While this requirement has been held to preclude one who has voted in the party primary from appearing on the ballot as an independent, Westerman v. Mims, 111 Tex. 29, 227 S.W. 178; see Cunningham v. McDermett, Tex.Civ.App., 277 S.W. 218, one who lost at the primary may still be elected at the general election by a write-in vote. Cunningham v. McDermett, supra.\n The operations of the party are restricted by the state in one other important respect. By Act. 3139, 1939 Supp., the state convention can announce a platform of principles, but its submission at the primary is a prerequisite to party advocacy of specific legislation. Art. 3133. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Cf. Parker v. Brown, \n317 \nU.S. 341, 359\n, 360 S., 63 S.Ct. 307, 317, 318. \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Cf. Pollock v.

DAVIS(1944)\nNo. 23\nArgued: October 16, 1944Decided: December 4, 1944\n\n\n\n\n[323 \nU.S. 111, 112]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Ben H. Sullivan, of Washington, D.C., for petitioners.\n Mr. W. S. Northcutt, of Atlanta, Ga., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioners are partners engaged in the contracting and construction business. They claim that on January 1, 1942, the United States owed them a balance of $29,831.10. This amount was due under the terms of two contracts for work, labor and materials furnished in connection with the construction of two airports for the use of the United States Army. Petitioners state that this balance 'was in the nature of an open account and represented an account receivable' in their hands.\n The respondent tax officials of Fulton County, Georgia, sought to assess this open account for state and county ad valorem tax purposes. \n1\n Petitioners brought this action in \n\n[323 \nU.S. 111, 113]\n\u00a0\n a state court to enjoin such assessment, claiming that the open account was an instrumentality of the United States and hence was immune from state or county taxation. The Supreme Court of Georgia overruled the trial court's dismissal of respondents' general demurrer and directed that the petition be dismissed. 197 Ga. 95, 28 S.E.2d 148. We granted certiorari because of the important constitutional and statutory problems inherent in the case.\n I. Petitioners claim that the proposed tax on the open account claim against the United States is a tax upon the credit of the federal government and upon its power to raise money to carry on military and civil operations. Hence, it is argued, such a tax is unconstitutional under the rule, first enunciated in McCulloch v. State of Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, that without Congressional action there is immunity from state and local taxation, implied from the Constitution itself, of all properties, functions and instrumentalities of the federal government. \n2\n We think otherwise.\n In the first place, an open account claim against the United States does not represent a credit instrumentality of the federal government within the meaning of this constitutional immunity. The record here reveals only that petitioners claim that the United States owes them $29, 831.10, which amount is carried by them as an account receivable and 'is in the nature of an open account.' There are the usual provisions of standard form government construction contracts calling for progress payments by the United States, with final payment being made after completion and acceptance of the work. There is no evidence of any bargaining for a credit extension of $29,831.10 or any provisions for the payment of interest \n\n[323 \nU.S. 111, 114]\n\u00a0\n on amounts due under the contracts. Nor is there any indication that any conditions precedent needed to be fulfilled or that, on the supposition that the amount was conceded to be correct by the United States, anything other than the formal mechanics of payment needed to be performed. We can only assume, therefore, that this is an ordinary open account as generally defined in the commercial world. \n3\n In other words, it is an unsettled claim or demand made by the creditor which appears in his account books. It is not evidenced by any written document whereby the United States, the debtor, has promised to pay this claim at a certain time in the future; nor is there any binding acknowledgement by the United States of the correctness of the claim. Conceivably the amount claimed to be due is incorrect or is subject to certain defenses or counterclaims by the United States, necessitating further settlement or adjustment. Such a unilateral, unliquidated creditor's claim, which by itself does not bind the United States and which in no way increases or affects the public debt, cannot be said to be a credit instrumentality of the United States for purposes of tax immunity.\n In these respects a mere open account claim differs vitally from the type of credit instrumentalities which this Court in the past has recognized as constitutionally exempt from state and local taxation. \n4\n Such instrumentali- \n\n[323 \nU.S. 111, 115]\n\u00a0\n ties in each instance have been characterized by (1) written documents, (2) the bearing of interest, (3) a binding promise by the United States to pay specified sums at specified dates and (4) specific Congressional authorization, which also pledged the faith and credit of the United States in support of the promise to pay. Thus in Banks v. Mayor and Controller of City of New York, 7 Wall. 16, immunity was granted to interest-bearing certificates of indebtedness issued to public creditors pursuant to the Act of March 1, 1862, 12 Stat. 352, and the Act of March 17, 1862, 12 Stat. 370. United States stock, bearing interest of 6% and 7%, issued pursuant to the Act of April 20, 1822, 3 Stat. 663, was declared immune in Weston v. City Council of Charleston, 2 Pet. 449. See also Bank of Commerce v. New York City, 2 Black 620, holding immune interest-bearing stock of the United States authorized by various acts of Congress,5 and Bank of Commonwealth v. Commissioner of Taxes, 2 Black 635, note, declaring immune United States stock, bearing not over 5% interest, authorized by the Act of June 14, 1858, 11 Stat. 365. Interest-bearing bonds of the federal government authorized by law have consistently been held immune from state and local taxation. See, for example, Home Sav. Bank v. City of Des Moines, \n205 \nU.S. 503\n, 27 S.Ct. 571. None of these cases is authority for placing an open account claim under the protective umbrella of constitutional immunity.\n It is clear, moreover, that the proposed taxation of this open account will not affect or embarrass in any substantial measure the power of the United States to secure credit or to secure aid from independent contractors for necessary military and civil construction projects. The tax here is a uniform, non-discriminatory levy upon an unliquidated asset of the creditor and not upon a credit \n\n[323 \nU.S. 111, 116]\n\u00a0\n instrumentality of the United States. That this asset involves a claim against the federal government is no more fatal to the validity of the tax than the fact that in James v. Dravo Contracting Co., \n302 \nU.S. 134\n, 58 S. Ct. 208, 114 A.L.R. 318, the tax was levied on the contractor's gross receipts from the United States or the fact that in State of Alabama v. King & Boozer, \n314 \nU.S. 1\n, 62 S.Ct. 43, the sales tax was placed on the sale of property to a contractor for use in a federal government project. The assets of an independent contractor that are derived from the profits of a government contract stand in no preferred constitutional position so far as taxation is concerned. They too must bear their fair share of the tax burden. And as long as that burden is non-discriminatory, there is no basis for assuming that contractors will be any less willing to enter into construction contracts with the United States. Nor is such a tax likely to affect or impair in any way their ability to discharge their duties efficiently. There is thus no practical reason for immunizing open accounts of this nature from taxation.\n II. The claim that an open account is an obligation exempt from taxation under the provisions of Section 3701 of the Revised Statutes, 31 U.S.C.  742, 31 U.S.C.A.  742, is also without merit. Congress by this section has provided that 'All stocks, bonds, Treasury notes, and other obligations of the United States, shall be exempt from taxation by or under State or municipal or local authority.' The plain meaning of these words and their legislative background dispel any doubt as to their inapplicability to an open account claim of a creditor of the United States.\n Section 3701 on its face applies only to written interest-bearing obligations issued pursuant to Congressional authorization. Stocks, bonds and Treasury notes6 are \n\n[323 \nU.S. 111, 117]\n\u00a0\n obviously of that nature. And, under the rule of ejusdem generis, it is reasonable to construe the general words 'other obligations,' which allegedly cover open accounts, as referring only to obligations or securities of the same type as those specifically enumerated. Hibernia Savings & Loan Soc. v. City and County of San Francisco, \n200 \nU.S. 310\n, 26 S.Ct. 265, 4 Ann.Cas. 934. Cf. Helvering v. Stockholms, &c., Bank, \n293 \nU.S. 84\n, 55 S.Ct. 50. This interpretation is in accord with the long established Congressional intent to prevent taxes which diminish in the slightest degree the market value or the investment attractiveness of obligations issued by the United States in an effort to secure necessary credit. It is unnecessary to extend such tax exemption, at least through statutory interpretation, to non-interest-bearing claims or obligations which the United States does not use or need for credit purposes. Tax exemptions being the exception rather than the rule, much clearer language evidencing an intent to immunize open account claims under Section 3701 is necessary under these circumstances.\n The seven statutory exemption provisions7 from which Section 3701 was derived further confirm the conclusion that Congress at no time intended to exempt open account claims. In all seven instances the exemption provisions appeared in statutes authorizing the issuance of interest- \n\n[323 \nU.S. 111, 118]\n\u00a0\n -bearing bonds or Treasury notes. Five of the seven statutes specifically limited tax exemptions to the securities issued under those enactments; one extended exemption to 'all stocks, bonds, and other securities of the United States;'8 and the other granted exemption to 'all bonds, Treasury notes, and other obligations of the United States.' \n9\n Thus, if the rule of ejusdem generis be applied to the two latter provisions, all seven exemptions were limited by their terms to interest-bearing securities or obligations authorized by Congress, for the payment of which the credit and faith of the United States was pledged. Full effect must also be given to the subsequent statutory provision allowing states to tax 'legal tender notes and other notes and certificates of the United States payable on demand and circulating or intended to circu- \n\n[323 \nU.S. 111, 119]\n\u00a0\n late as currency.' 10 All of these related statutes are a clear indication of an intent to immunize from state taxation only the interest-bearing obligations of the United States which are needed to secure credit to carry on the necessary functions of government. That intent, which is largely codified in Section 3701, should not be expanded or modified in any degree by the judiciary.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of Georgia is affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Georgia Code (1933)  92-101 subjects all real and personal property to taxation, except as otherwise provided by law, and  92-102 includes within the definition of personal property 'money due on open account or evidenced by notes, contracts, bonds, or other obligations, secured or unsecured.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] People ex rel. Astoria Light, Heat & Power Co. v. Cantor, 236 N.Y. 417, 141 N.E. 901, 30 A.L.R. 1458, is cited in support of this argument. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See Paton, Accountants' Handbook 229-30 (2d ed., 1934); Olson and Hallman, Credit Management 36 (1925); Jamison, Finance 56 ff (1927); Kramer v.

Supervisors, 7 Wall. 26, this Court held that Congress had the constitutional power, and exercised it, to exempt non-interest-bearing United States legal tender notes, called 'greenbacks.' The decision did not rest on a finding that these notes were constitutionally exempt in and of themselves. Congress thereafter enacted a statute which in effect reversed this decision and allowed such notes to be taxed by states.

Petitioner was one of several candidates at the April 9, 1940, Republican primary election held in the Third Senatorial District of Illinois pursuant to Ill.Rev.Stat.1943 ( State Bar Ass'n Ed.), Ch. 46, Art. 8 for nominees for the office of representative in the Illinois General Assembly. By reason of appropriate action taken respectively by the Republican and Democratic Senatorial Committees of the Third Senatorial District in conformity to the scheme of proportional representation authorized by Ill.Rev.Stat., Ch. 46,  8-13, two candidates for representative in the General Assembly were to be nominated on the Republican ticket and one on the Democratic ticket. Since three representatives were to be elected, Ill.Const., Art. IV,  7 and 8, Smith-Hurd Stats. and only three were to be nominated by the primary election, election at the primary as one of the two Republican nominees was, so the complaint alleges, tantamount to election to the office of representative.\n The votes cast at the primary election were duly canvassed by the Canvassing Board of Cook County, which, as required by Ill.Rev.Stat., Ch. 46,  8-15, certified and forwarded to the Secretary of State a tabulation showing the results of the primary election in the Third Senatorial District. By this tabulation the Board certified that petitioner and another had received respectively the second highest and highest number of votes for the Republican nominations. Ill.Rev.Stat., Ch. 46,  8-13 requires that the candidates receiving the highest votes shall be declared nominated.\n Respondents Hughes and Lewis and Henry Horner whose executors were joined as defendants and are re- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n spondents here, constituted the State Primary Canvassing Board for the election year 1940. By Ill.Rev.Stat., Ch. 46,  8-15 it was made their duty to receive the certified tabulated statements of votes cast, including that prepared by the Canvassing Board of Cook County, to canvass the returns, to proclaim the results and to issue certificates of nomination to the successful candidates. such a certificate is a prerequisite to the inclusion of a candidate's name on the ballot. Ill.Rev. Stat., Ch. 46,  10-14. Acting in their official capacity as State Primary Canvassing Board they issued, on April 29, 1940, their official proclamation which designated only one nominee for the office of representative in the General Assembly from the Third Senatorial District on the Republican ticket and excluded from the nomination petitioner, who had received the second highest number of votes for the Republican nomination.\n After setting out these facts the complaint alleges that Horner and respondents Hughes and Lewis, 'willfully, maliciously and arbitrarily' failed and refused to file with the Secretary of State a correct certificate showing that petitioner was one of the Republican nominees, that they conspired and confederated together for that purpose, and that their action constituted 'an unequal, unjust and oppressive administration' of the laws of Illinois. It alleges that Horner, Hughes and Lewis, acting as state officials under color of the laws of Illinois, thereby deprived petitioner of the Republican nomination for representative in the General Assembly and of election to that office, to his damage in the amount of $50,000, and by so doing deprived petitioner, in contravention of 8 U.S.C.  41, 43 and 47(3), 8 U.S.C.A.  41, 43, 47( 3), of rights, privileges and immunities secured to him as a citizen of the United States, and of the equal protection of the laws, both guaranteed to him by the Fourteenth Amendment. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n The District Court granted motions by respondents to strike the complaint and dismiss the suit upon the grounds, among others, that the facts alleged did not show that the plaintiff had been deprived of any right, privilege or immunity secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States, and that, the alleged cause of action being predicated solely upon a claim that state officers had failed to perform duties imposed upon them by state law, their failure was not state action to which the prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment are alone directed, and hence was not sufficient to establish an infringement of rights secured to petitioner by the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed, 132 F.2d 476, holding on authority of Barney v. City of New York, \n193 \nU.S. 430\n, 24 S.Ct. 502, that the action of the members of the State Board, being contrary to state law, was not state action and was therefore not within the prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n In substance petitioner's alleged cause of action is that the members of the State Primary Canvassing Board, acting as such but in violation of state law, have by their false certificate or proclamation and by their refusal to file a true certificate deprived petitioner of nomination and election as representative in the state assembly. To establish a cause of action arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States within the jurisdiction of the District Court as prescribed by 28 U.S.C.  41(1), ( 12) and (14), 28 U.S.C.A.  41(1, 12, 14), he relies particularly on the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment supplemented by two sections of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 8 U.S.C.  43, 47(3), 8 U.S.C.A.  43, 47(3).1 \n\n[321 \nU.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n Section 43 provides that: 'Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State ... subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person ... to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law ... for redress.' Section 47(3), so far as now relevant, gives an action for damages to any person 'injured in his person or property, or deprived of having and exercising any right or privilege of a citizen of the United States', by reason of a conspiracy of two or more persons entered into 'for the purpose of depriving ... any person ... of the equal protection of the laws, or of equal privileges and immunities under the laws'. It is the contention of petitioner that the right conferred on him by state law to become a candidate for and to be elected to the office of representative upon receipt of the requisite number of votes in the primary and general elections, is a right secured to him by the Fourteenth Amendment, and that the action of the State Primary Canvassing Board deprived him of that right and of the equal protection of the laws for which deprivation the Civil Rights Act authorizes his suit for damages.\n Three distinct provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee rights of persons and property. It declares that 'No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State drprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.'\n The protection extended to citizens of the United States by the privileges and immunities clause includes those rights and privileges which, under the laws and Constitution of the United States, are incident to citizenship of the United States, but does not include rights pertaining \n\n[321 \nU.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n to state citizenship and derived solely from the relationship of the citizen and his state established by state law. In re Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 74, 79; Maxwell v. Bugbee, \n250 \nU.S. 525, 538\n, 40 S.Ct. 2, 5; Prudential Ins. Co. v. Cheek, \n259 \nU.S. 530, 539\n, 42 S.Ct. 516, 520, 27 A.L.R. 27; Madden v. Commonwealth of Kentucky, \n309 \nU.S. 83\n, 90-93, 61 S.Ct. 406, 409, 410, 125 A.L.R. 1383. The right to become a candidate for state office, like the right to vote for the election of state officers, Minor v. Happersett, 21 Wall. 162, 170-178; Pope v. Williams, \n193 \nU.S. 621, 632\n, 24 S.Ct. 573, 575; Breedlove v. Suttles, \n302 \nU.S. 277, 283\n, 58 S.Ct. 205, 208, is a right or privilege of state citizenship, not of national citizenship which alone is protected by the privileges and immunities clause.\n More than forty years ago this Court determined that an unlawful denial by state action of a right to state political office is not a denial of a right of property or of liberty secured by the due process clause. Taylor and Marshall v. Beckham, \n178 \nU.S. 548\n, 20 S.Ct. 1009. Only once since has this Court had occasion to consider the question and it then reaffirmed that conclusion, Cave v. State of Missouri ex rel. Newell, \n246 \nU.S. 650\n, 38 S.Ct. 334, as we reaffirm it now.\n Nor can we conclude that the action of the State Primary Canvassing Board, even though it be regarded as state action within the prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment, was a denial of the equal protection of the laws. The denial alleged is of the right of petitioner to be a candidate for and to be elected to public office upon receiving a sufficient number of votes. The right is one secured to him by state statute and the deprivation of right is alleged to result solely from the Board's failure to obey state law. There is no contention that the statutes of the state are in any respect inconsistent with the guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment. There is no allegation of any facts tending to show that in refusing to certify petitioner as a nominee, the Board was making any intentional or purposeful discrimination between persons or classes. On the argument before us petitioner \n\n[321 \nU.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n disclaimed any contention that class or racial discrimination is involved. The insistence is rather that the Board, merely by failing to certify petitioner as a duly elected nominee, has denied to him a right conferred by state law and has thereby denied to him the equal protection of the laws secured by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n But not every denial of a right conferred by state law involves a denial of the equal protection of the laws, even though the denial of the right to one person may operate to confer it on another. Where, as here, a statute requires official action discriminating between a successful and an unsuccessful candidate, the required action is not a denial of equal protection since the distinction between the successful and the unsuccessful candidate is based on a permissible classification. And where the official action purports to be in conformity to the statutory classification, an erroneous or mistaken performance of the statutory duty, although a violation of the statute, is not without more a denial of the equal protection of the laws.\n The unlawful administration by state officers of a state statute fair on its face, resulting in its unequal application to those who are entitled to be treated alike, is not a denial of equal protection unless there is shown to be present in it an element of intentional or purposeful discrimination. This may appear on the face of the action taken with respect to a particular class or person, cf. McFarland v. American Sugar Refining Co., \n241 \nU.S. 79, 86\n, 87 S., 36 S.Ct. 498, 501, or it may only be shown by extrinsic evidence showing a discriminatory design to favor one individual or class over another not to be inferred from the action itself, Yick Wo v. Hopkins, \n118 \nU.S. 356, 373\n, 374 S., 6 S.Ct. 1064, 1072, 1073. But a discriminatory purpose is not presumed, Tarrance v. State of Florida, \n188 \nU.S. 519, 520\n, 23 S.Ct. 402, 403; there must be a showing of 'clear and intentional discrimination', Gundling v. City of Chicago, \n177 \nU.S. 183, 186\n, 20 S.Ct. 633, 635; see Ah Sin v. Wittman, \n198 \nU.S. 500, 507\n, 508 S., 25 S.Ct. 756, 758, 759; Bailey v. State of Alabama, \n219 \nU.S. 219, 231\n, 31 S.Ct. 145, 147. Thus the denial of equal protection by \n\n[321 \nU.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n the exclusion of negroes from a jury may be shown by extrinsic evidence of a purposeful discriminatory administration of a statute fair on its face. Neal v. Delaware, \n103 \nU.S. 370, 394\n, 397 S.; Norris v. State of Alabama, \n294 \nU.S. 587, 589\n, 55 S.Ct. 579, 580; Pierre v. State of Louisiana, \n306 \nU.S. 354, 357\n, 59 S.Ct. 536, 538; Smith v. State of Texas, \n311 \nU.S. 128, 130\n, 131 S., 61 S.Ct. 164, 165; Hill v. State of Texas, \n316 \nU.S. 400, 404\n, 62 S.Ct. 1159, 1161. But a mere showing that negroes were not included in a particular jury is not enough; there must be a showing of actual discrimination because of race. State of Virginia v. Rives, \n100 \nU.S. 313, 322\n, 323 S.; Martin v. State of Texas, \n200 \nU.S. 316, 320\n, 321 S., 26 S.Ct. 338, 339; Thomas v. State of Texas, \n212 \nU.S. 278, 282\n, 29 S.Ct. 393, 394; cf. Williams v. State of Mississippi, \n170 \nU.S. 213, 225\n, 18 S.Ct. 583, 588.\n Another familiar example is the failure of state taxing officials to assess property for taxation on a uniform standard of valuation as required by the assessment laws. It is not enough to establish a denial of equal protection that some are assessed at a higher valuation than others. The difference must be due to a purposeful discrimination, which may be evidenced, for example, by a systematic under-valuation of the property of some taxpayers and a systematic over-valuation of the property of others, so that the practical effect of the official breach of law is the same as though the discrimination were incorporated in and proclaimed by the statute. Coulter v. Louisville & N.R. Co., \n196 \nU.S. 599, 607\n, 609 S., 640, 25 S.Ct. 342, 343, 344, 345; Chicago B. & Q.R. Co. v. Babcock, \n204 \nU.S. 585, 597\n, 27 S.Ct. 326, 328; Sunday Lake Iron Co. v. Township of Wakefield, \n247 \nU.S. 350, 353\n, 38 S.Ct. 495; Southern R. Co. v. Watts, \n260 \nU.S. 519, 526\n, 43 S.Ct. 192, 195.2 Such discrimination may also be shown to be purposeful, and hence a denial of equal protection, even though it is neither sys- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n tematic nor long-continued. Cf. McFarland v. American Sugar Refining Co., supra.\n The lack of any allegations in the complaint here, tending to show a purposeful discrimination between persons or classes of persons is not supplied by the opprobrious epithets 'willful' and 'malicious' applied to the Board's failure to certify petitioner as a successful candidate, or by characterizing that failure as an unequal, unjust, and oppressive administration of the laws of Illinois. These epithets disclose nothing as to the purpose or consequence of the failure to certify, other than that petitioner has been deprived of the nomination and election, and therefore add nothing to the bare fact of an intentional deprivation of petitioner's right to be certified to a nomination to which no other has been certified. Cf. United States v. Illinois Cent. R. Co., \n303 \nU.S. 239, 243\n, 58 S.Ct. 533, 535. So far as appears the Board's failure to certify petitioner was unaffected by and unrelated to the certification of any other nominee. Such allegations are insufficient under our decisions to raise any issue of equal protection of the laws or to call upon a federal court to try questions of state law in order to discover a purposeful discrimination in the administration of the laws of Illinois which is not alleged. Indeed on the allegations of the complaint, the one Republican nominee certified by the Board was entitled to be certified as the nominee receiving the highest number of votes, and the Board's failure to certify petitioner, so far as appears, was unaffected by and unrelated to the certification of the other, successful nominee. While the failure to certify petitioner for one nomination and the certification of another for a different nomination may have involved a violation of state law, we fail to see in this a denial of the equal protection of the laws more than if the Illinois statutes themselves had provided that one candidate should be certified and no other. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n If the action of the Board is official action it is subject to constitutional infirmity to the same but no greater extent than if the action were taken by the state legislature. Its illegality under the state statute can neither add to nor subtract from its constitutional validity. Mere violation of a state statute does not infringe the federal Constitution. Compare Owensboro Water Works Co. v. City of Owensboro, \n200 \nU.S. 38, 47\n, 26 S.Ct. 249, 252. And state action, even though illegal under state law, can be no more and no less constitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment than if it were sanctioned by the state legislature. Nashville, C. & St. L. Ry. v. Browning, \n310 \nU.S. 362, 369\n, 370 S., 60 S.Ct. 668, 972. See also Coulter v. Louisville & N. R. Co., supra, 196 U.S. at pages 608, 609, 25 S.Ct. at page 344; Hayman v. City of Galveston, \n273 \nU.S. 414, 416\n, 47 S.Ct. 363; Iowa-Des Moines Nat. Bank v. Bennett, \n284 \nU.S. 239, 244\n, 52 S.Ct. 133, 135. A state statute which provided that one nominee rather than two should be certified in a particular election district would not be unconstitutional on its face and would be open to attack only if it were shown, as it is not here, that the exclusion of one and the election of another were invidious and purposely discriminatory. Compare Missouri v. Lewis, \n101 \nU.S. 22, 30\n, 32 S.; Yick Wo v. Hopkins, supra.\n Where discrimination is sufficiently shown, the right to relief under the equal protection clause is not diminished by the fact that the discrimination relates to political rights. McPherson v. Blacker, \n146 \nU.S. 1, 23\n, 24 S., 13 S.Ct. 3, 6; Nixon v. Herndon, \n273 \nU.S. 536, 538\n, 47 S.Ct. 446; Nixon v. Condon, 286, U.S. 73, 52 S.Ct. 484, 88 A.L.R. 458; see Pope v. Williams, supra, 193 U.S. at page 634, 24 S.Ct. at page 576. But the necessity of a showing of purposeful discrimination is no less in a case involving political rights than in any other. It was not intended by the Fourteenth Amendment and the Civil Rights Acts that all matters formerly within the exclusive cognizance of the states should become matters of national concern.\n A construction of the equal protection clause which would find a violation of federal right in every departure \n\n[321 \nU.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n by state officers from state law is not to be favored. And it is not without significance that we are not cited to and have been unable to find a single instance in which this Court has entertained the notion that an unlawful denial by state authority of the right to state office is without more a denial of any right secured by the Fourteenth Amendment. See Taylor and Marshall v. Beckham, supra, and authorities cited; Cave v. State of Missouri ex rel. Newell, supra. Only once has it been contended here that an unlawful denial by state executive, administrative or legislative authority of the right to state office is for that reason alone a denial of equal protection. Wilson v. State of North Carolina, \n169 \nU.S. 586\n, 18 S. Ct. 435.3 In rejecting that contention this Court said at pages 594, 595 of 169 U.S., 18 S.Ct. at pages 438, 439:\n'In its internal administration the state (so far as concerns the federal government) has entire freedom of choice as to the creation of an office for purely state purposes and of the terms upon which it shall be held by the person filling the office. ...\n\n'Upon the case made by the plaintiff in error, the federal question which he attempts to raise is so unfounded in substance that we are justified in saying that it does \n\n[321 \nU.S. 1, 13]\n\u00a0\n not really exist; that there is no fair color for claiming that his rights under the federal constitution have been violated, either by depriving him of his property without due process of law or by denying him the equal protection of the laws.'\n\n As we conclude that the right asserted by petitioner is not one secured by the Fourteenth Amendment and affords no basis for a suit brought under the sections of the Civil Rights Acts relied upon, we find it unnecessary to consider whether the action by the State Board of which petitioner complains is state action within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. The authority of Barney v. City of New York, supra, on which the court below relied, has been so restricted by our later decisions, see Raymond v. Chicago Union Traction Co., \n207 \nU.S. 20, 37\n, 28 S.Ct. 7, 13, 12 Ann.Cas. 757; Home Tel. & Tel. Co. v. City of Los Angeles, \n227 \nU.S. 278, 294\n, 33 S.Ct. 312, 317; Iowa-Des Moines Nat. Bank v. Bennett, supra, 284 U.S. at pages 246, 247, 52 S.Ct. at page 136; cf. United States v. Classic, \n313 \nU.S. 299, 326\n, 61 S.Ct. 1031, 1043, that our determination may be more properly and more certainly rested on petitioner's failure to assert a right of a nature such as the Fourteenth Amendment protects against state action.\n The judgment is accordingly affirmed for failure of the complaint to state a cause of action within the jurisdiction of the District Court.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice RUTLEDGE concurs in the result.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER, concurring.\n The plaintiff brought this action in a district court to recover damages claimed to have been suffered at the hands of the defendants as members of the State Primary Canvassing Board of Illinois. The theory of his claim is that the defendants, being in legal effect the State of Illinois, denied to the plaintiff the equal protection of its laws. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 1, 14]\n\u00a0\n The crucial allegations charging such a denial are in the following paragraph of the complaint:\n'11. That notwithstanding the clear and plain mandates of section 454 and section 456, chapter 46, Illinois Revised Statutes, the defendants Edward J. Hughes and Louie E. Lewis, and the decedent Henry Horner, acting as the State Primary Canvassing Board of Illinois, entered into an understanding and agreement and combined, conspired and confederated together to willfully, maliciously and arbitrarily refuse to designate plaintiff as one of the nominees of the Republican Party for the office of Representative in the General Assembly from the Third Senatorial District of Illinois and to issue their Official Proclamation designating plaintiff as one of the said nominees and to file their proper and correct certificate in the office of the Secretary of State of Illinois showing that plaintiff was one of the nominees of the Republican Party for the Office of Representative in the General Assembly from the Third Senatorial District of Illinois.'\n\n I should be silent were the Court merely to hold that as a matter of pleading these allegations are not sufficiently explicit to charge as an arbitrary act of discrimination the concerted and purposeful use by the defendants of their official authority over the election machinery of the State so as to withhold from the plaintiff the opportunity to present himself to the voters of that State 'as one of the nominees of the Republican Party' for election to the General Assembly of Illinois. I should be silent even though it were avowed that such a constrained reading of the complaint reflected the most exacting attitude against drawing into the federal courts controversies over state elections. Unless I mistake the tenor of the Court's opinion, the decision is broader than mere inadequacy of pleading.\n All questions pertaining to the political arrangements of state governments are, no doubt, peculiarly outside the \n\n[321 \nU.S. 1, 15]\n\u00a0\n domain of federal authority. The disposition of state offices, the manner in which they should be filled and contests concerning them, are solely for state determination, always provided that the equality of treatment required by the Civil War Amendments is respected. And so I appreciate that there are strong considerations of policy which should make federal courts inhospitable toward litigation involving the enforcement of state election laws. But I do not think that the criteria for establishing a denial of the equal protection of the laws are any different in cases of discrimination in granting opportunities for presenting oneself as a candidate for office 'as one of the nominees of the Republican Party' than those that are relevant when claim is made that a state has discriminated in regulating the pursuit of a private calling. It appears extremely unlikely that the plaintiff could establish his case. The sole question now is whether, assuming he can make good his allegations, he should be denied the opportunity of a trial to do so.\n The Constitution does not assure uniformity of decisions or immunity from merely erroneous action, whether by the courts or the executive agencies of a state. See McGovern v. City of New York, \n229 \nU.S. 363, 370\n, 371 S., 33 S.Ct. 876, 877, 46 L.R.A.,N.S., 391. However, in forbidding a state to 'deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws,' the Fourteenth Amendment does not permit a state to deny the equal protection of its laws because such denial is not wholesale. The talk in some of the cases about systematic discrimination is only a way of indicating that in order to give rise to a constitutional grievance a departure from a norm must be rooted in design and not derived merely from error or fallible judgment. Speaking of a situation in which conscious discrimination by a state touches 'the plaintiff alone', this Court tersely expressed the governing principle by observing that 'we suppose that no one would contend that the plaintiff was given the \n\n[321 \nU.S. 1, 16]\n\u00a0\n equal protection of the laws.' McFarland v. American Sugar Refining Co., \n241 \nU.S. 79, 86\n, 87 S., 36 S.Ct. 498, 501. And if the highest court of a state should candidly deny to one litigant a rule of law which it concededly would apply to all other litigants in similar situations, could it escape condemnation as an unjust discrimination and therefore a denial of the equal protection of the laws? See Backus v. Fort St. Union Depot Co., \n169 \nU.S. 557, 571\n, 18 S.Ct. 445, 451.\n But to constitute such unjust discrimination the action must be that of the state. Since the state, for present purposes, can only act through functionaries, the question naturally arises what functionaries, acting under what circumstances, are to be deemed the state for purposes of bringing suit in the federal courts on the basis of illegal state action. The problem is beset with inherent difficulties and not unnaturally has had a fluctuating history in the decisions of the Court. Compare Barney v. City of New York, \n193 \nU.S. 430\n, 24 S.Ct. 502, with Raymond v. Chicago Union Traction Co., \n207 \nU.S. 20\n, 28 S.Ct. 7, 12 Ann. Cas. 757, City of Memphis v. Cumberland Tel. & Tel. Co., \n218 \nU.S. 624\n, 31 S.Ct. 115, with Home Tel. & Tel. Co. v. City of Los Angeles, \n227 \nU.S. 278\n, 33 S.Ct. 312. It is not to be resolved by abstract considerations such as the fact that every official who purports to wield power conferred by a state is pro tanto the state. Otherwise every illegal discrimination by a policeman on the beat would be state action for purpose of suit in a federal court.\n Our question is not whether a remedy is available for such an illegality, but whether it is available in the first instance in a federal court. Such a problem of federal judicial control must be placed in the historic context of the relationship of the federal courts to the states, with due regard for the natural sensitiveness of the states and for the appropriate responsibility of state courts to correct the action of lower state courts and state officials. See, e.g., Ex parte Royall, \n117 \nU.S. 241, 251\n, 6 S.Ct. 734, 740. Take the present case. The plaintiff complains that he has been denied the equal \n\n[321 \nU.S. 1, 17]\n\u00a0\n protection of the laws of Illinois precisely because the defendants, constituting the State Canvassing Board, have willfully, with set purpose to withdraw from him the privileges afforded by Illinois, disobeyed those laws. To adapt the language of an earlier opinion, I am unable to grasp the principle on which the State can here be said to deny the plaintiff the equal protection of the laws of the State when the foundation of his claim is that the Board had disobeyed the authentic command of the State. Holmes, J., dissenting, in Raymond v. Chicago Union Traction Co., supra, 207 U.S. at page 41, 28 S.Ct. at page 14, 12 Ann.Cas. 757.\n I am clear, therefore, that the action of the Canvassing Board taken, as the plaintiff himself acknowledges, in defiance of the duty of that Board under Illinois law, cannot be deemed the action of the State, certainly not until the highest court of the State confirms such action and thereby makes it the law of the State. I agree, in a word, with the court below that Barney v. City of New York, \n193 \nU.S. 430\n, 24 S.Ct. 502, is controlling. See Isseks, Jurisdiction of the Lower Federal Courts to Enjoin Unauthorized Action of State Officials, 40 Harv.L. Rev. 969. Neither the wisdom of its reasoning nor its holding has been impaired by subsequent decisions. A different problem is presented when a case comes here on review from a decision of a state court as the ultimate voice of state law. See for instance Iowa-Des Moines Nat. Bank v. Bennett, \n284 \nU.S. 239\n, 52 S.Ct. 133. And the case is wholly unlike Lane v. Wilson, \n307 \nU.S. 268\n, 59 S.Ct. 872, in which the election officials acted not in defiance of a statute of a state but under its authority.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice MURPHY concurs, dissenting.\n My disagreement with the majority of the Court is on a narrow ground. I agree that the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment should not be distorted to make the federal courts the supervisor of the state elec- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 1, 18]\n\u00a0\n tions. That would place the federal judiciary in a position 'to supervise and review the political administration of a state government by its own officials, and through its own courts' (Wilson v. State of North Carolina, \n169 \nU.S. 586, 596\n, 18 S.Ct. 435, 439)-matters on which each State has the final say. I also agree that a candidate for public office is not denied the equal protection of the law in the constitutional sense merely because he is the victim of unlawful administration of a state election law. I believe, as the opinion of the Court indicates, that a denial of equal protection of the laws requires an invidious, purposeful discrimination. But I depart from the majority when it denies Snowden the opportunity of showing that he was in fact the victim of such discriminatory action. His complaint seems to me to be adequate to raise the issue. He charges a conspiracy to wilfully, maliciously and arbitrarily refuse to designate him as one of the nominees of the Republican party, that such action was an 'unequal' administration of the Illinois law and a denial to him of the equal protection of the laws, and that the conspiracy had that purpose. While the complaint could have drawn the issue more sharply, I think it defines it sufficiently to survive the motion to dismiss.\n No doubt unconstitutional discriminations against a class, such as those which we have recently condemned in Lane v. Wilson, \n307 \nU.S. 268\n, 59 S.Ct. 872, and Skinner v. State of Oklahoma, \n316 \nU.S. 535\n, 62 S.Ct. 1110, may be more readily established than a discrimination against an individual per se. But though the proof is exacting, the latter may be shown as in Cochran v. State of Kansas, \n316 \nU.S. 255\n, 62 S.Ct. 1068, where a prisoner was prevented from profecting an appeal. The criteria are the same whether one has been denied the opportunity to be a candidate for public office, to enter private business, or to have the protection of the courts. If the law is 'applied and administered by public authority with an evil eye and an unequal \n\n[321 \nU.S. 1, 19]\n\u00a0\n hand, so as practically to make unjust and illegal discriminations between persons in similar circumstances' (Yick Wo v. Hopkins, \n118 \nU.S. 356, 373\n, 374 S., 6 S.Ct. 1064, 1072, 1073), it is the same as if the invidious discrimination were incorporated in the law itself. If the action of the Illinois Board in effect were the same as an Illinois law that Snowden could not run for office, it would run afoul of the equal protection clause whether that discrimination were based on the fact that Snowden was a Negro, Catholic, Presbyterian, Free Mason, or had some other characteristic or belief which the authorities did not like. Snowden should be allowed the opportunity to make that showing no matter how thin his chances of success may seem. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 8 U.S.C.  41, 8 U.S.C.A.  41, on which petitioner also relies, guaranties to all persons within the United States 'the same right ... to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens'. As pointed out later in this opinion, no claim of discrimination based on race is made. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See also Raymond v.

The holding in that case that a refusal to count votes cast, and the consequent false certification of candidates, was a denial of a right or privilege 'secured ... by the Constitution ... of the United States' was rested on the ground that the right to vote for a federal officer, whether or not it be deemed a privilege of citizens of the United States, see Twining v. State of New Jersey, \n211 \nU.S. 78, 97\n, 29 S.Ct. 14, 18, 19, is a right secured by Art. 1,  2 and 4 of the Constitution. See United States v.

The Court pointed out that 'the indictment on its face does not purport to charge a deprivation of equal protection to voters or candidates,' 313 U.S. at page 329, 61 S.Ct. at page 1044, and declined to consider whether the facts alleged could constitute such a denial. \n\n\n\n\n","95":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSOUTHERN RY. CO. v. UNITED STATES(1944)\nNo. 578\nArgued: Decided: April 24, 1944\n\n\n\n Mr. Sidney S. Alderman, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Francis M. Shea, Asst. Atty. Gen., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In 1933 petitioner, a common carrier, entered into a 'Freight-Land- Grant Equalization Agreement' with the Quartermaster General, acting for the United States. This agreement was made under the authority of  22 of the Interstate Commerce Act, 24 Stat. 387, 49 U.S.C.  22, 49 U.S.C.A.  22. So far as material here, petitioner agreed to accept for the transportation of property shipped for account of the Government of the United States and for which the Government of the United States is lawfully entitled to reduced rates over land-grant roads, the lowest net rates lawfully available, as derived through deductions account of land- grant distance from the lawful \n\n[322 \nU.S. 72, 73]\n\u00a0\n rates filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission applying from point of origin to destination at time of movement. (Italics added.)\n From the point of view of the carrier the purpose of the agreement was to give it a portion of government business which might have been routed over land-grant routes. \n1\n Land-grant roads were under an obligation to furnish transportation to the government free of charge or at reduced rates. See Public Aids to Transportation, Federal Coordinator of Transportation (1938), Vol., II, pp. 3-42 for a review of the various Acts of Congress. At the time when this agreement was made land-grant roads were required to allow the United States 50% deductions from the commercial rate for the transportation of property or troops of the United States. \n2\n 43 Stat. 477, 486, 10 U.S.C.  1375, 10 U.S.C.A.  1375. 'Railroads which compete with the reduced-rate lines found themselves unable to participate, not only in the local transportation of Federal troops and property between the termini of the reduced-rate lines, but also in through movements from and to points beyond such termini.' Public Aids to Transportation, supra, p. 42. Accordingly most of those roads entered into land- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 72, 74]\n\u00a0\n grant equalization agreements with the United States in order to get as large a share of the business as possible. \n3\n See Southern Pacific Co. v. United States, \n307 \nU.S. 393, 394\n, 59 S.Ct. 923, 924. The one involved in the present case is an example.\n This suit involves 374 shipments of government property over petitioner's lines and its connections made between 1934 and 1938 whild this agreement was in force. \n4\n There were available in case of each shipment several routes between the point of origin and the point of destination. Petitioner's route was in general the shortest. But there were other routes containing land grants of varying percentages which it was possible to use for these shipments. And the rates shown by tariffs on file with the Interstate Commerce Commission for freight shipments between the points in question were the same (with exceptions not important here) for each of the alternative routes regardless of the mileage. Petitioner computed its charges so as to allow the rate reductions to which the United States would have been entitled had it actually made the shipments by one of the available, alternative land-grant routes. The United States, however, claimed greater deductions. It showed a longer and more circuitous route which could have been used5 and which contained more landgrant mileage than the alternative route chosen by \n\n[322 \nU.S. 72, 75]\n\u00a0\n petitioner. Since the tariff rates over either alternative route were the same, the greater landgrants included in the route selected by the United States resulted in lower rates than those which were computed on the basis of the land-grant route selected by petitioner. The United States paid the lower rates. Petitioner brought suit in the Court of Claims for the difference between the amount paid and the rates computed on the basis of the tariffs for the route which it had selected. The Court of Claims denied recovery. 100 Ct.Cl. 175. The case is here on a petition for a writ of certiorari which we granted because of the public importance of the problem.\n The Court of Claims found that the circuitous routes on which the United States based its computations could have been used for the shipments in question. But petitioner contends that such an interpretation of the word 'available' is unreasonable in the present context and that it should be construed to mean 'capable of being employed or made use of with advantage'. In that connection, petitioner argues that it would have been improvident and uneconomical to ship livestock on such circuitous routes and that those routes would never in fact have been used by the United States. It is argued, moreover, that the equalization agreement properly construed requires petitioner to equalize rates computed by land-grant routes which are competitive for government traffic. Its purpose, according to that contention, was to secure for petitioner traffic which in its absence would be likely to move over competing land-grant routes, as distinguished from traffic which was possible of routing over the cheapest land-grant route.\n We agree, however, with the Court of Claims. In this context the 'lowest net rates lawfully available' mean to us the lowest net rates which could have been obtained on the basis of tariffs on file with the Interstate Commerce \n\n[322 \nU.S. 72, 76]\n\u00a0\n Commission. Whether such circuitous routes as were employed in the present computation would have been actually used for these shipments in absence of the equalization agreement is of course unknown. But circuitous routing by the United States in order to obtain the benefits of its earlier land- grants to railroads was apparently a common practice. See Public Aids to Transportation, supra, p. 42. The records show that the privilege of obtaining the benefit of rates on land-grant routes is a valuable privilege indeed. \n6\n We cannot assume that the United States intended to surrender any of those benefits by granting the equalizing carriers more favorable rates than those to which it was lawfully entitled on the land- grant routes, unless the purpose to do so was plainly expressed. It must be remembered that the equalization agreement was a rate-making agreement. Its object was to divert shipments to the non-land-grant route. The land- grant route was chosen merely for the purpose of computing the rate. The fact that in a given case the shipment probably would not have moved over the land-grant route is immaterial. The United States was bargaining for low rates for the shipment of its property. It did not differentiate between the types of property shipped. It did not in terms state that land- grant routes, though actually available, would not be used in computing the rate unless they would in fact have been convenient or practicable to use for the particular shipment. The standard it prescribes is 'the lowest net rates lawfully available.' We may not resolve any ambiguities which may linger in that phrase against the United States. Cf. Southern Pacific Co. v. United States, supra, 307 U.S. at page 401, 59 S.Ct. at page 928. We are not warranted in assuming that the United States was more generous to this carrier than the \n\n[322 \nU.S. 72, 77]\n\u00a0\n language of the contract requires. We must assume that the contracting officers for the United States drove as provident a bargain as a reading of the agreement fairly permits.\n At times the United States has made equalization agreements which were more favorable to the equalizing carriers than the instant one appears to be. Thus in 1917 a passenger land-grant equalization agreement was made with petitioner and other carriers7 whereby they agreed to accept the lowest net fare 'lawfully available, as derived, through deductions account land-grant distance via a usually traveled route for military traffic, from a lawful fare filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission as applying from point of origin to destination via such route at time of movement.' (Italics added.) That agreement suggests that when the United States desired to give equalizing carriers more favorable rates than the lowest rates to which it was lawfully entitled on land-grant routes, it chose apt words to express its purpose. It also gives added significance to the omission of any such qualification in the present agreement. It suggests that if we read into the agreement the qualification which the petitioner desires, we would remake the contract.\n Much material bearing on administrative construction of various types of equalization agreements has been pressed upon us. But we have not relied on it as we found it inconclusive.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Court of Claims made the following finding in this case: 'The purpose and effect of the freight equalization agreements of the defendant with plaintiff and with other common carriers was to equalize rates on Government property over various routes serving the same point of origin and destination, where one or more of those routes had been aided in whole or in part by grant of public lands, rates over all routes from point of origin to destination being brought down to the level of that over the route producing the lowest net rate on account of land-grant deduction. This arrangement was designed to give the equalizing carrier a portion of the Government business that was possible of routing over the governing land-grant route, and to give the Government a greater range in choice of routes where considerations of economy entered into the selection.' \n[\nFootnote 2\n] But see  321 of the Transportation Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 898, 954, 49 U.S.C.A.  65. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Petitioner's road includes 145 miles of land-grants. But as pointed out in Public Aids to Transportation, supra, p. 42, 'The land-grant railroads are parties to these agreements for the reason that, in many instances, a non-aided portion of a land-grant railroad competes with a reduced-rate portion of another land-grant railroad.' \n[\nFootnote 4\n] These consisted of 147 shipments of livestock by the Federal Surplus Relief Corporation from midwestern points to southeastern points; and 227 shipments of property by the Tennessee Valley Authority. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] Thus in case of the shipments of livestock the routes on which the United States made its computation of rates were from 137 to almost 700 miles longer than the ones actually used. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] See Public Aids to Transportation, supra, pp. 43-45; Kenny, Land- Grant Railroads and the Government (1933), 9 Journal of Land & Public Utility Economics 368. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] See Manual for the Quartermaster Corps, 1916 (1917), vol. 2, pp. 223, 230. \n\n\n\n\n","96":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSPECTOR MOTOR SERVICE v. MCLAUGHLIN(1944)\nNo. 62\nArgued: November 9, 1944Decided: December 4, 1944\n\n\n\n Messrs. J. Ninian Beall, of Washington, D.C., and Cyril Coleman, of Hartford, Conn., for petitioner.\n Mr. Frank J. Di Sesa, of Stamford, Conn., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit brought in a United States district court to enjoin the enforcement of a State tax and for a deciaratory judgment.\n The Connecticut Corporation Business Tax Act of 1935, as amended, imposed on every corporation, not otherwise specially taxed, carrying on or having the right to carry \n\n[323 \nU.S. 101, 102]\n\u00a0\n on business within the State 'a tax or excise upon its franchise for the privilege of carrying on or doing business within the state ....' Conn. Gen.Stat.Cum.Supp.1935,  418c, as amended by Conn.Gen.Stat.Supp.1939,  354e. Petitioner, a Missouri corporation with its principal place of business in Illinois, is engaged exclusively in the interstate trucking business. It is neither authorized by Connecticut to do intrastate trucking nor in fact does it engage in it. It maintains two leased terminals in Connecticut solely for the purpose of carrying on its interstate business. At the request of its lessor, it has filed with the Secretary of State in Connecticut a certificate of its incorporation in Missouri, has designated an agent in Connecticut for service of process, and has paid the statutory fee. On this state of facts the State Tax Commissioner determined that petitioner was subject to the Act of 1935, as amended, and assessed the tax against Spector for the years 1937 to 1940. Whereupon petitioner brought this suit in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut to free itself from liability for the tax. Alleging appropriate grounds for equitable relief, petitioner claims that the 'tax or excise' levied by the Act does not apply to it; and in the alternative that, if it should be deemed within the scope of the statute, the tax offends provisions of the Connecticut Constitution as well as the Commerce and Due Process Clauses of the United States Constitution, art. 1 ,  8, cl. 3, and amend. 14.\n The District Court construed the statute to be 'a tax upon the exercise of a franchise to carry on intrastate commerce in the state' and therefore not applicable to petitioner. Spector Motor Service v. Walsh, 47 F.Supp. 671, 675. On appeal the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit construed the statute to reach all corporations having activity in Connecticut, whether doing or authorized to do intrastate business or, like the petitioner, engaged exclusively in interstate commerce. It further decided all contentions under the Con- \n\n[323 \nU.S. 101, 103]\n\u00a0\n necticut Constitution against the petitioner. And so, the court below found itself compelled 'to face directly the main issue whether the tax is in fact an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce.' 139 F.2d 809, 813. The dissenting judge thus phrased the issue: '(W)e have before us in the barest possible form the effort of a state to levy an excise directly upon the privilege of carrying on an activity which is neither derived from the state, nor within its power to forbid.' 139 F.2d at page 822. It was conceded below that if the Connecticut tax was construed to cover petitioner it would run afoul the Commerce Clause, were this Court to adhere to what Judge Learned Hand called 'an unbroken line of decisions.' On the basis of what it deemed foreshadowing 'trends', the majority ventured the prophecy that this Court would change its course, and accordingly sustained the tax. In view of the far-reaching import of such a disposition by the Circuit Court of Appeals we brought the case here. \n322 \nU.S. 720\n, 64 S.Ct. 1155\n\n\n Once doubts purely local to the Constitution and laws of Connecticut are resolved against the petitioner there are at stake in this case questions of moment touching the taxing powers of the States and their relation to the overriding national interests embodied in the Commerce Clause. This is so whether the issue be as broad and as bare as the District Court and Judge Learned Hand formulated it, or whether the Connecticut statute carries a more restricted meaning. If Connecticut in fact sought to tax the right to engage in interstate commerce, a long course of constitutional history and 'an unbroken line of decisions' would indeed be brought into question. But even if Connecticut seeks merely to levy a tax on the net income of this interstate trucking business for activities attributed to Connecticut, questions under the Commerce Clause still remain if only because of what the court below called 'ingenious provisions as to allocation of net income in the case of business carried on partly without the state.' 139 F.2d 809, 812. \n\n[323 \nU.S. 101, 104]\n\u00a0\n We would not be called upon to decide any of these questions of constitutionality, with their varying degrees of defficulty, if, as the District Court held, the statute does not at all apply to one, like petitioner, not authorized to do intrastate business. Nor do they emerge until all other local Connecticut issues are decided against the petitioner. But even if the statute hits aspects of an exclusively interstate business, it is for Connecticut to decide from what aspect of interstate business she seeks an exaction. It is for her to say what is the subject matter which she has sought to tax and what is the calculus of the tax she seeks. Every one of these questions must be answered before we reach the constitutional issues which divided the court below.\n Answers to all these questions must precede consideration of the Commerce Clause. To none have we an authoritative answer. Nor can we give one. Only the Supreme Court of Errors of Connecticut can give such an answer. But this tax has not yet been considered or construed by the Connecticut courts. We have no authoritative pronouncements to guide us as to its nature and application. That the answers are not obvious is evidenced by the different conclusions as to the scope of the statute reached by the two lower courts. The Connecticut Supreme Court may disagree with the District Court and agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals as to the applicability of the statute. But this is an assumption and at best 'a forecast rather than a determination.' Railroad Comm. v. Pullman Co., \n312 \nU.S. 496, 499\n, 61 S.Ct. 643, 645. Equally are we without power to pass definitively on the other claims urged under Articles I and II of the Connecticut Constitution. \n1\n If any should prevail, our constitutional \n\n[323 \nU.S. 101, 105]\n\u00a0\n issues would either fall or, in any event, may be formulated in an authoritative way very different from any speculative construction of how the Connecticut courts would view this law and its application. Watson v. Buck, \n313 \nU.S. 387, 401\n, 402 S., 61 S.Ct. 962, 966, 967.\n If there is one doctrine more deeply rooted than any other in the process of constitutional adjudication, it is that we ought not to pass on questions of constitutionality-here the distribution of the taxing power as between the State and the Nation-unless such adjudication is unavoidable. And so, as questions of federal constitutional power have become more and more intertwined with preliminary doubts about local law, we have insisted that federal courts do not decide questions of constitutionality on the basis of preliminary guesses regarding local law. Railroad Comm. v. Pullman Co., supra; City of Chicago v. Fieldcrest Dairies, \n316 \nU.S. 168\n, 62 S.Ct. 986; In re Central R. Co. of New Jersey, 3 Cir., 136 F.2d 633. See also Burford v. Sun Oil Co., \n319 \nU.S. 315\n, 63 S.Ct. 1098; Meredith v. Winter Haven, \n320 \nU.S. 228, 235\n, 64 S.Ct. 7, 11; Green v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 8 Cir., 119 F. 2d 466; Findley v. Odland, 6 Cir., 127 F.2d 948; United States v. 150.29 Acres of Land, 7 Cir., 135 F.2d 878. Avoidance of such guesswork, by holding the litigation in the federal courts until definite determinations on local law are made by the state courts, merely heeds this time-honored canon of constitutional adjudication.\n We think this procedure should be followed in this case. The District Court had jurisdiction to entertain this bill and to give whatever relief is appropriate despite the Johnson Act2 and Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co. v. Huff- \n\n[323 \nU.S. 101, 106]\n\u00a0\n man, \n319 \nU.S. 293\n, 63 S.Ct. 1070, because of the uncertainty surrounding the adequacy of the Connecticut remedy. See Waterbury Savings Bank v. Lawler, 46 Conn. 243; Wilcox v. Town of Madison, 106 Conn. 223, 137 A. 742. But there is no doubt that Connecticut makes available an action for declaratory judgment for the determination of those issues of Connecticut law involved here. Charter Oak Council, Inc., v. Town of New Bedford, 121 Conn. 466, 185 A. 575; Conzelman v. City of Bristol, 122 Conn. 218, 188 A. 659; Walsh v. City of Bridgeport, 2 Conn.

We granted certiorari because of the importance of the question to the administration of this Act. \n320 \nU.S. 723\n, 64 S.Ct. 58.\n The petitioners are producers of milk, who assert that by  904.7(b)( 5) and 904.9 of his Order, the Secretary is unlawfully diverting funds that belong to them. The courts below dismissed the action on the ground that the Act vests no legal cause of action in milk producers, and since the decision below and the argument here were lim- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 288, 290]\n\u00a0\n ited to that point, we shall confine our consideration to it.\n The district court for the District of Columbia has a general equity jurisdiction authorizing it to hear the suit;1 but in order to recover, the petitioners must go further and show that the act of the Secretary amounts to an interference with some legal right of theirs. \n2\n If so, the familiar principle that executive officers may be restrained from threatened wrongs in the ordinary courts in the absence of some exclusive alternative remedy will enable the petitioners to maintain their suit; but if the complaint does not rest upon a claim of which courts take cognizance, then it was properly dismissed. The petitioners place their reliance upon such rights as may be expressly or impliedly created by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 and the Order issued thereunder.\n Although this Court has previously reviewed the provisions of that statute at length and upheld its constitutionality,3 some further reference to it is necessary to an understanding of the producer's interest in the funds dealt with by the Order. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n[321 \nU.S. 288, 291]\n\u00a0\n The immediate object of the Act is to fix minimum prices for the sale of milk by producers to handlers. It does not forbid sales at prices above the minimum. It contains \n__________ state commerce as will establish prices to farmers at a level that will give agricultural commodities a purchasing power with respect to articles that farmers buy, equivalent to the purchasing power of agricultural commodities in the base period; and, in the case of all commodities for which the base period is the prewar period, August 1909 to July 1914, will also reflect current interest payments per acre on farm indebtedness secured by real estate and tax payments per acre on farm real estate, as contrasted with such interest payments and tax payments during the base period. The base period in the case of all agricultural commodities except tobacco and potatoes shall be the prewar period, August 1909-July 1914. In the case of tobacco and potatoes, the base period shall be the postwar period, August 1919-July 1929\n\n\n'(2) To protect the interest of the consumer by (a) approaching the level of prices which it is declared to be the policy of Congress to establish in subsection (1) of this section by gradual correction of the current level at as rapid a rate as the Secretary of Agriculture deems to be in the public interest and feasible in view of the current consumptive demand in domestic and foreign markets, and (b) authorizing no action under this title which has for its purpose the maintenance of prices to farmers above the level which it is declared to be the policy of Congress to establish in subsection (1) of this section.'\n\n'Sec. 8a(5) Any person willfully exceeding any quota or allotment fixed for him under this title by the Secretary of Agriculture, and any other person knowingly participating, or aiding, in the exceeding of said quota or allotment, shall forfeit to the United States a sum equal to three times the current market value of such excess, which forfeiture shall be recoverable in a civil suit brought in the name of the United States.\n\n'(6) The several district courts of the United States are hereby vested with jurisdiction specifically to enforce, and to prevent and restrain any person from violating any order, regulation, or agreement, heretofore or hereafter made or issued pursuant to this title, in any proceeding now pending or hereafter brought in said courts.\n\n'(7) Upon the request of the Secretary of Agriculture, it shall be the duty of the several district attorneys of the United States, in their respective districts, under the directions of the Attorney General, to institute proceedings to enforce the remedies and to collect the for- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 288, 292]\n\u00a0\n Footnote 4--Continued.\n\nfeitures provided for in, or pursuant to, this title. Whenever the Secretary, or such officer or employee of the Department of Agriculture as he may designate for the purpose, has reason to believe that any handler has violated, or is violating, the provisions of any order or amendment thereto issued pursuant to this title, the Secretary shall have power to institute an investigation and, after due notice to such handler, to conduct a hearing in order to determine the facts for the purpose of referring the matter to the Attorney General for appropriate action.\n'(8) The remedies provided for in this section shall be in addition to, and not exclusive of, any of the remedies or penalties provided for elsewhere in this title or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity.\n\n'(9) The term 'person' as used in this title includes an individual, partnership, corporation, association, and any other business unit.'\n\n'Sec. 8c(3) Whenever the Secretary of Agriculture has reason to believe that the issuance of an order will tend to effectuate the declared policy of this title with respect to any commodity or product thereof specified in subsection (2) of this section, he shall give due notice of and an opportunity for a hearing upon a proposed order.\n\n'(4) After such notice and opportunity for hearing, the Secretary of Agriculture shall issue an order if he finds, and sets forth in such order, upon the evidence introduced at such hearing (in addition to such other findings as may be specifically required by this section) that the issuance of such order and all of the terms and conditions thereof will tend to effectuate the declared policy of this title with respect to such commodity.\n\n'(5) In the case of milk and its products, orders issued pursuant to this section shall contain one or more of the following terms and conditions, and (except as provided in subsection (7)) no others:\n\n'(A) Classifying milk in accordance with the form in which or the purpose for which it is used, and fixing, or providing a method for fixing, minimum prices for each such use classification which all handlers shall pay, and the time when payments shall be made, for milk purchased from producers or associations of producers. Such prices shall be uniform as to all handlers, subject only to adjustments for (1) volume, market, and production differentials customarily applied by the handlers subject to such order, (2) the grade or quality of the milk purchased, and (3) the locations at which delivery of such milk, or any use classification thereof, is made to such handlers.\n\n'(B) Providing:\n\n'(i) for the payment to all producers and associations of producers delivering milk to the same handler of uniform prices for all milk \n\n[321 \nU.S. 288, 293]\n\u00a0\n Footnote 4--Continued.\n\ndelivered by them: Provided, That, except in the case of orders covering milk products only, such provision is approved or favored by at least three-fourths of the producers who, during a representative period determined by the Secretary of Agriculture, have been engaged in the production for market of milk covered in such order or by producers who, during such representative period, have produced at least three-fourths of the volume of such milk produced for market during such period; the approval required hereunder shall be separate and apart from any other approval or disapproval provided for by this section; or\n'(ii) for the payment to all producers and associations of producers delivering milk to all handlers of uniform prices for all milk so delivered, irrespective of the uses made of such milk by the individual handler to whom it is delivered; subject, in either case, only to adjustments for (a) volume, market, and production differentials customarily applied by the handlers subject to such order, (b) the grade or quality of the milk delivered, (c) the locations at which delivery of such milk is made, and (d) a further adjustment, equitably to apportion the total value of the milk purchased by any handler, or by all handlers, among producers and associations of producers, on the basis of their marketings of milk during a representative period of time.\n\n'(C) In order to accomplish the purposes set forth in paragraphs (A) and (B) of this subsection (5), providing a method for making adjustments in payments, as among handlers (including producers who are also handlers), to the end that the total sums paid by each handler shall equal the value of the milk purchased by him at the prices fixed in accordance with paragraph (A) hereof.'\n\n Among the provisions of subsection (7), referred to in Section 8c(5), is authorization for terms described as follows:\n'Sec. 8c(7)(D) Incidental to, and not inconsistent with, the terms and conditions specified in subsections (5), (6), and (7) and necessary to effectuate the other provisions of such order.'\n\n Sections 8c(8) and 8c(9) provide, with exceptions not here relevant that a marketing order must have the approval of the handlers of at least 50% of the volume of the commodity subject to the order unless the Secretary, with the approval of the President, determines that the proposed order is necessary to effectuate the declared policy of the Act and 'is the only practical means of advancing the interests of the producers of such commodity pursuant to the declared policy ....' Section 8c(9)(B). Whether the handlers agree or not, an order must be \n\n[321 \nU.S. 288, 294]\n\u00a0\n\n\n[321 \nU.S. 288, 295]\n\u00a0\n\nan appropriate declaration of policy,5 and it provides that the Secretary of Agriculture shall hold a hearing when he has reason to believe that a marketing order would tend to effectuate the purposes of the Act. \n6\n If he finds that an order would be in accordance with the declared policy, he must then issue it. \n7\n Sections 8c(5) and 8c(7) enumerate the provisions that the order may contain. Section 8c(5)(A) authorizes the Secretary to classify milk in accordance with the form or purpose of its use, and to fix minimum prices for each classification. These minima are the use value of the milk. This method of fixing prices was adopted because the economic value of milk depends upon the particular use made of it. \n8\n It is apparent that serious inequities as among producers might arise if the prices each received depended upon the use the handler might happen to mke of his milk; accordingly, Section 8c(5)(B) authorizes provision to be made for the payment to producers of a uniform price9 for the milk delivered irrespective of the use to which the milk is put by the individual handler. Section 8c(5)(C) authorizes the Secretary to set up the necessary machinery to accomplish these purposes. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 288, 296]\n\u00a0\n By Order No. 4,10 the Secretary of Agriculture did fix minimum prices for each class of milk and required each \n\n[321 \nU.S. 288, 297]\n\u00a0\n handler in the Boston area to pay not less than those minima to producers, 7 C.F.R. 1941 Supp.,  904.4, less \n\n[321 \nU.S. 288, 298]\n\u00a0\n specified deductions.  904.7(b), 904.8. In addition, the order exercised the authority granted by the statute to \n\n[321 \nU.S. 288, 299]\n\u00a0\n require the use of a weighted average in reaching the uniform price to be paid producers, as described in the preceding paragraph.  904.7, 904.8. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 288, 300]\n\u00a0\n Under the Order, the handler does not make final settlement with the producer until the blended price11 has been set, although he must make a part payment on or before the tenth of each month.  904.8. But within eight days after the end of each calendar month-the so-called 'delivery period',  904.1(9)-the handler must report his sales and deliveries, classified by use value,  904,5, to a 'market administrator.'  904.1(8). On the basis of these reports, the administrator computes the blended price and announces it on the twelfth day following the end of the delivery period.  904.7(b). On the twenty-fifth day, the handlers are required to pay the balance due of the blended price so fixed to the producers.  904.8(b).\n Were no administrative deductions necessary, the blended price per hundredweight of milk could readily be determined by dividing the total value of the milk used in the marketing area at the minimum prices for each classification by the number of hundredweight of raw milk used in the area. 12 However, the Order requires several adjustments for purposes admittedly authorized by statute, so that the determination of the blended price as actually made is drawn from the total use value less a sum which the administrator is direction to retain to meet various incidental adjustments. 13 In practice, each handler \n\n[321 \nU.S. 288, 301]\n\u00a0\n discharges his obligation to the producers of whom he bought milk by making two payments: one payment, the blended price, is apportioned from the values at the minimum price for the respective classes less administrative deductions and is made to the producer himself;14 the other payment is equal to these deductions and is made, in the language of the Order, 'to the producer, through the market administrator,' in order to enable the administrator to cover the differentials and deductions in question. \n15\n It is the contention of the petitioners that by  904.7(b)(6) 16 of the Order the Secretary has directed the administrator to deduct a sum for the purpose of meeting payments to cooperatives as required by  904.9, and that the Act does not authorize the Secretary to include in his order provision for payments of that kind or for deductions to meet them. Apparently, this deduction for payments to cooperatives is the only deduction that is an unrecoverable charge against the producers. The other items deducted under  904.7(b) are for a revolving fund or to meet differentials in price because of location, seasonal delivery, et cetera.\n These producer petitioners allege that they have delivered milk to handlers in the 'Greater Boston,' Massachusetts, marketing area under the provisions of the Order. They state that they are not members of a cooperative association entitled under the Order to the contested payments and that, as producers, many of them voted against the challenged amendment on the producers' referendum under  8c(9) and 8c(19) of the Act. These allegations \n\n[321 \nU.S. 288, 302]\n\u00a0\n are admitted by the defense upon which dismissal was based, namely, that the petition fails to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. From the preceding summary of the theory and plan of the statutory regulation of minimum prices for milk affecting interstate commerce, it is clear that these petitioners have exercised the right granted them by the statute and Order to deliver their milk to 'Greater Boston' handlers at the guaranteed minimum prices fixed by the Secretary of Agriculture in the Order. Sec. 904.4. Upon accepting that delivery the handler was required by the Order to pay to these producers their minimum prices in the manner set forth in  904.8. Simply stated, this section required the handler to pay directly to the producer the blended price as determined by the administrator and to pay to the producers through the administrator for use in meeting the deductions authorized by the order of the Secretary and approved by two-thirds of the producers,  8c(9)(B), the difference between the blended price and the minimum price. The Order directed the administrator to deduct from the funds coming into his hands from the producers' sale price the payments to cooperatives.  904.9.\n It is this deduction which the producers challenge as beyond the Secretary's statutory power. The respondents answer that the petitioners have not such a legal interest in this expenditure or in the administrator's settlement fund as entitles them to challenge the action of the Secretary in directing the disbursement. The Government says that as the producers pay nothing into the settlement fund and receive nothing from it, they have no legally protected right which gives them standing to sue. There is, of course, no question but that the challenged deduction reduces pro tanto the amount actually received by the producers for their milk.\n By the statute and Order, the Secretary has required all area handlers dealing in the milk of other producers to \n\n[321 \nU.S. 288, 303]\n\u00a0\n pay minimum prices as just described.  904.1(6), 904.4; Act,  8c(14). The producer is not compelled by the Order to deliver (Act  8c(13)(B) but neither can he be required to market elsewhere and if he finds a dealer in the area who will buy his product, the producer by delivery of milk comes within the scope of the Act and the Order. The Order fixing the minimum price obviously affects by direct Governmental action the producer's business relations with handlers. Columbia Broad-casting System v. United States, \n316 \nU.S. 407, 422\n, 62 S.Ct. 1194, 1202. Cf. Chicago Junction Case, \n264 \nU.S. 258, 267\n, 44 S.Ct. 317, 320. The fact that the producer may sell to the handler for any price above the minimum is not of moment in determining whether or not the statute and Order secure to him a minimum price. Should the producer sell his milk to a handler at prices in excess of the minimum, the handler would nevertheless be compelled to pay into the fund the same amount. The challenged deduction is a burden on every area sale.  904.7(a), 904.8(b). In substance petitioners' allegation is that in effect the Order directed without statutory authority a deduction of a sum to pay the United States a sales tax on milk sold. The statute and Order create a right in the producer to avail himself of the protection of a minimum price afforded by Governmental action. Such a right created by statute is mandatory in character and obviously capable of judicial enforcement. \n17\n For example the Order could not bar any qualified producers in the milk shed from selling to area handlers. Like the instances just cited \n\n[321 \nU.S. 288, 304]\n\u00a0\n from railway labor cases, supra, n. 17, the petitioners here voluntarily bring themselves within the coverage of the Act. It cannot be fairly said that because producers may choose not to sell in the area, those who do choose to sell there necessarily must sell, without a right of challenge, in accordance with unlawful requirements of administrators. Upon purchase of his milk by a handler, the statute endows the producer with other rights, e.g., the right to be paid a minimum price. Order,  904.4.\n The mere fact that Governmental action under legislation creates an opportunity to receive a minimum price does not settle the problem of whether or not the particular claim made here is enforceable by the District Court. The deduction for cooperatives may have detrimental effect on the price to producers and that detriment be damnum absque injuria. \n18\n It is only when a complainant possesses something more than a general interest in the proper execution of the laws that he is in a position to secure judicial intervention. His interest must rise to the dignity of an interest personal to him and not possessed by the people generally. \n19\n Such a claim is of that character which constitutionally permits adjudication by courts under their general powers. \n20\n\u00a0\n\n[321 \nU.S. 288, 305]\n\u00a0\n We deem it clear that on the allegations of the complaint these producers have such a personal claim as justifies judicial consideration. It is much more definite and personal than the right of complainants to judicial consideration of their objections to regulations, which this Court upheld in Columbia Broadcasting System v. United States, \n316 \nU.S. 407\n, 62 S.Ct. 1194. In the present case a reexamination of the preceding statement of facts and summary of the statute and Order will show that delivering producers are assured minimum prices for their milk.  904.4. The Court directs the handler to pay that minimum as follows:\n A. By  904.8(a) the handler is to make a preliminary part payment of the blended price and later,  904.8(b)(1) the handler makes the final payment to the producer of the blended price computed as the Order directs. It is clear that the Order compels the handler to pay not only the blended price, which is always less than the uniform minimum price, but the entire minimum price, because  904.8(b) directs the handler's payment of the entire minimum value as ascertained by  904.7(a)(1) and (2). The blended price is reached by subtracting among other items the cooperative payment, here in question, from the minimum price.  904.7(b)(5).\n B. The balance of the minimum price, which the handler owes to the producer, he must pay 'to the producer, through the market administrator' by payment into the settlement or equalization fund two days ahead of the final date for payment of the blended price.  904.8(b)(3). This balance of the minimum purchase price is then partly used by the administrator to pay the cooperatives.  904.9(b). The handler is simply a conduit from the administrator who receives and distributes the minimum prices. The situation would be substantially the same if an administrator received as trustee for the producers the purchase price of their milk, paid expenses incurred in the \n\n[321 \nU.S. 288, 306]\n\u00a0\n operation, and paid the balance to the producers. Under such circumstances we think the producers have legal standing to object to illegal provisions of the Order.\n However, even where a complainant possesses a claim to executive action beneficial to him, created by federal statute, it does not necessarily follow that actions of administrative officials, deemed by the owner of the right to place unlawful restrictions upon his claim, are cognizable in appropriate federal courts of first instance. When the claims created are against the United States, no remedy through the courts need be provided. United States v. Babcock, \n250 \nU.S. 328, 331\n, 39 S.Ct. 464, 465, and cases cited; Work v. United States ex rel. Rives, \n267 \nU.S. 175, 181\n, 45 S.Ct. 252, 254; Butte, A. & P. Ry. v. United States, \n290 \nU.S. 127, 142\n, 143 S., 54 S.Ct. 108, 112. To reach the dignity of a legal right in the strict sense, it must appear from the nature and character of the legislation that Congress intended to create a statutory privilege protected by judicial remedies. Under the unusual circumstances of the historical development of the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C.A.  151, this Court has recently held that an administrative agency's determination of a controversy between unions of employees as to which is the proper bargaining representative of certain employees is not justiciable in federal courts. General Committee v. M.-K.- T.R. Co., \n320 \nU.S. 323\n, 64 S.Ct. 146. Under the same Act it was held on the same date that the determination by the National Mediation Board of the participants in an election for representatives for collective bargaining likewise was not subject to judicial review. Switchmen's Union v. Mediation Board, \n320 \nU.S. 297\n, 64 S.Ct. 95. This result was reached because of this Court's view that jurisdictional disputes between unions were left by Congress to mediation rather than adjudication. \n320 \nU.S. 302\n and 337, 64 S.Ct. 97 and 152. That is to say, no personal right of employees, enforcible in the courts, was created in the particular instances under consideration. \n320 \nU.S. 337\n, 64 S.Ct. 152. But where rights of collective bargaining, created by the \n\n[321 \nU.S. 288, 307]\n\u00a0\n same Railway Labor Act, contained definite prohibitions of conduct or were mandatory in form, this Court enforced the rights judicially. \n320 \nU.S. 330, 331\n, 64 S.Ct. 149, 150. Cf. Texas & N.O.R. Co. v. Brotherhood of R. & S.S. Clerks, \n281 \nU.S. 548\n, 50 S.Ct. 427; Virginian Ry. v. System Federation, \n300 \nU.S. 515\n, 57 S.Ct. 592.\n It was pointed out in the Switchmen's case that:\n'If the absence of jurisdiction of the federal courts meant a sacrifice or obliteration of a right which Congress had created, the inference would be strong that Congress intended the statutory provisions governing the general jurisdiction of those courts to control.' 320 U.S. at page 300, 64 S.Ct. at page 97.\n\n The only opportunity these petitioners had to complain of the contested deduction was to appear at hearings and to vote for or against the proposed order. Act,  8c(3), 8c(9) and 8c(19); Order, preamble. So long as the provisions of the Order are within the statutory authority of the Secretary such hearings and balloting furnish adequate opportunity for protest. Morgan v. United States, \n298 \nU.S. 468, 480\n, 56 S.Ct. 906, 911. But where as here the issue is statutory power to make the deduction required by Order,  904.9, under the authority of  8c(7)(D) of the Act, a mere hearing or opportunity to vote cannot protect minority producers against unlawful exactions which might be voted upon them by majorities. It can hardly be said that opportunity to be heard on matters within the Secretary's discretion would foreclose an attack on the inclusion in the Order of provisions entirely outside of the Secretary's delegated powers.\n Without considering whether or not Congress could create such a definite personal statutory right in an individual against a fund handled by a Federal agency, as we have here, and yet limit its enforceability to administrative determination, despite the existence of federal courts of general jurisdiction established under Article III of the Constitution, the Congressional grant of jurisdiction of this proceeding appears plain. There is no \n\n[321 \nU.S. 288, 308]\n\u00a0\n direct judicial review granted by this statute for these proceedings. The authority for a judicial examination of the validity of the Secretary's action is found in the existence of courts and the intent of Congress as deduced from the statutes and precedents as hereinafter considered.\n The Act bears on its face the intent to submit many questions arising under its administration to judicial review.  8a(6), 8c(15)(A) and (B). It specifically states that the remedies specifically provided in  8a are to be in addition to any remedies now existing at law or equity.  8a(8). This Court has heretofore construed the Act to grant handlers judicial relief in addition to the statutory review specifically provided by  8c( 15). On complaint by the United States, the handler was permitted by way of defense to raise issues of a want of statutory authority to impose provisions on handlers which directly affect such handlers. United States v. Rock Royal Co-op., \n307 \nU.S. 533, 560\n, 561 S., 59 S.Ct. 993, 1006, 1007. In the Rock Royal case the Government had contended that the handlers had no legal standing in the suit for enforcement to attack provisions of the order relating to handlers. While we upheld the contention of the Government as to the lack of standing of handlers to object to the operation of the producer settlement fund on the ground that the handlers had no 'financial interest' in that fund, we recognized the standing of a proprietary handler to question the alleged discrimination shown in favor of the co-operative handlers. The producer settlement fund is created to meet allowable deductions by the payment of a part of the minimum price to producers through the market administrator. See note 15, supra. Rock Royal pointed out that handlers were without standing to question the use of the fund, because handlers had no financial interest in the fund or its use. It is because every dollar of deduction comes from the producer that he may challenge the use of the fund. The petitioners' complaint is not \n\n[321 \nU.S. 288, 309]\n\u00a0\n that their blended price is too low, but that the blended price has been reduced by a misapplication of money deducted from the producers' minimum price.\n With this recognition by Congress of the applicability of judicial review in this field, it is not to be lightly assumed that the silence of the statute bars from the courts an otherwise justiciable issue, United States v. Griffin, \n303 \nU.S. 226, 238\n, 58 S.Ct. 601, 607; Shields v. Utah Idaho R. Co., \n305 \nU.S. 177, 182\n, 59 S.Ct. 160, 163; cf. American Federation of Labor v. Labor Board, \n308 \nU.S. 401, 404\n, 412 S., 60 S.Ct. 300, 301, 305. The ruling in Texas & Pac. Ry. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co., \n204 \nU.S. 426\n, 27 S.Ct. 350, 9 Ann.Cas. 1075, is not authority to the contrary. It was there held that the statute placed the power in the Interstate Commerce Commission to hear the complaint stated, not in the state court where it was brought. The Commission award was then to be enforced in court. Page 438 of 204 U.S., page 354 of 27 S.C t., 9 Ann.Cas. 1075. Here, there is no forum, other than the ordinary courts, to hear this complaint. When, as we have previously concluded in this opinion, definite personal rights are created by federal statute, similar in kind to those customarily treated in courts of law,21 the silence of Congress as to judicial review is, at any rate in the absence of an administrative remedy, not to be construed as a denial of authority to the aggrieved person to seek appropriate relief in the federal courts in the exercise of their general jurisdiction. When Congress passes an Act empowering administrative agencies to carry on governmental activities, the power of those agencies is circumscribed by the authority granted. \n22\n This permit the \n\n[321 \nU.S. 288, 310]\n\u00a0\n courts to participate in law enforcement entrusted to administrative bodies only to the extent necessary to protect justiciable individual rights against administrative action fairly beyond the granted powers. The responsibility of determining the limits of statutory grants of authority in such instances is a judicial function entrusted to the courts by Congress by the statutes establishing courts and marking their jurisdiction. Cf. United States v. Morgan, \n307 \nU.S. 183, 190\n, 191 S., 59 S.Ct. 795, 799. This is very far from assuming that the courts are charged more than administrators or legislators with the protection of the rights of the people. Congress and the Executive supervise the acts of administrative agents. The powers of departments, boards and administrative agencies are subject to expansion, contraction or abolition at the will of the legislative and executive branches of the government. These branches have the resources and personnel to examine into the working of the various establishments to determine the necessary changes of function or management. But under Article III, Congress established courts to adjudicate cases and controversies as to claims of infringement of individual rights whether by unlawful action of private persons or by the exertion of unauthorized administrative power.\n It is suggested that such a ruling puts the agency at the mercy of objectors, since any provisions of the Order may be attacked as unauthorized by each producer. To this objection there are adequate answers. The terms of the Order are largely matters of administrative discretion as to which there is no justiciable right or are clearly authorized by a valid act. United States v. Rock Royal Co-op., \n307 \nU.S. 533\n, 59 S.Ct. 993. Technical details of the milk business are left to the Secretary and his aides. The expenses of litigation deter frivolous contentions. If numerous parallel cases are filed, the courts have ample authority to stay useless litigation until the determination of a test case. Cf. Landis v. North American Co., \n299 \nU.S. 248\n, 57 S.Ct. 163. Should \n\n[321 \nU.S. 288, 311]\n\u00a0\n some provisions of an order be held to exceed the statutory power of the Secretary, it is well within the power of a court of equity to so mold a decree as to preserve in the public interest the operation of the portion of the order which is not attacked pending amendment.\n It hardly need be added that we have not considered the soundness of the allegations made by the petitioners in their complaint. The trial court is free to consider whether the statutory authority given the Secretary is a valid answer to the petitioners' contention. We merely determine the petitioners have shown a right to a judicial examination of their complaint.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice BLACK is of the view that the judgment should be affirmed for the reasons given in the opinion of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.\n Mr. Justice JACKSON took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER, dissenting.\n The immediate issue before us is whether these plaintiffs, milk producers, can in the circumstances of this case go to court to complain of an order by the Secretary of Agriculture fixing rates for the distribution of milk within the Greater Boston marketing area. The solution of that question depends, however, upon a proper approach toward such a scheme of legislation as that formulated by Congress in the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937.\n Apart from legislation touching the revenue, the public domain, national banks and patents, not until the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, 49 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq., did Congress begin to place economic enterprise under systems of administrative control. These regulatory schemes have varied in the range \n\n[321 \nU.S. 288, 312]\n\u00a0\n of control exercised by government; they have varied no less in the procedures by which the control was exercised. More particularly, these regimes of national authority over private enterprise reveal great diversity in the allotment of power by Congress as between courts and administrative agencies. Congress has not made uniform provisions in defining who may go to court, for what grievance, and under what circumstances, in seeking relief from administrative determinations. Quite the contrary. In the successive enactments by which Congress has established administrative agencies as major instruments of regulation, there is the greatest contrariety in the extent to which, and the procedures by which, different measures of control afford judicial review of administrative action.\n Except in those rare instances, as in a claim of citizenship in deportation proceedings, when a judicial trial becomes a constitutional requirement because of 'The difference of security of judicial over administrative action,' Ng Fung Ho. v. White, \n259 \nU.S. 276, 285\n, 42 S.Ct. 492, 495, whether judicial review is available at all and, if so, who may invoke it, under what circumstances, in what manner, and to what end, are questions that depend for their answer upon the particular enactment under which judicial review is claimed. Recognition of the claim turns on the provisions dealing with judicial review in a particular statute and on the setting of such provisions in that statute as part of a scheme for accomplishing the purposes expressed by that statute. Apart from the text and texture of a particular law in relation to which judicial review is sought 'judicial review' is a mischievous obstruction. There is no such thing as a common law of judicial review in the federal courts. The procedural provisions in more than a score of these regulatory measures prove that the manner in which Congress has distributed responsibility for the enforcement of its laws between courts and administrative agencies runs a gamut all the way from authorizing a \n\n[321 \nU.S. 288, 313]\n\u00a0\n judicial trial de novo of a claim determined by the administrative agency to denying all judicial review and making administrative action definitive.\n Congress has not only devised different schemes of enforcement for different Acts. It has from time to time modified and restricted the scope of review under the same Act. Compare  16 of the Act to Regulate Commerce, February 4, 1887, c. 104, 24 Stat. 379, 384, 385, with  13 of the Commerce Court Act, June 18, 1910, c. 309, 36 Stat. 539, 554, 555, and 49 U.S.C.  16(12), 49 U.S.C.A.  16(12), and the latter with enforcement of reparation orders, 49 U.S.C.  16(2), 49 U.S.C.A.  16(2). Moreover the same statute, as is true of the Interstate Commerce Act, may make some orders not judicially reviewable for any purpose, see e.g., United States v. Los Angeles R.R., \n273 \nU.S. 299\n, 47 S.Ct. 413, or reviewable by some who are adversely affected and not by others, e.g., Singer & Sons v. Union Pacific Co., \n311 \nU.S. 295\n, 305-308, 61 S.Ct. 254, 258-260. The oldest scheme of administrative control-our customs revenue legislation-shows in its evolution all sorts of permutations and combinations in using available administrative and judicial remedies. See, for instance, Elliott v. Swartwout, 10 Pet. 137; Cary v. Curtis, 3 How. 236; Den ex dem. Murray's Lessee et al. v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co., 18 How. 272; Hilton v. Merritt, \n110 \nU.S. 97\n, 38 S.Ct. 548; for a general survey, see Freund, Administrative Powers over Persons and Property,  260-62. And only the other day we found the implications of the Railway Labor Act, c. 347, 44 Stat. (part 2) 577, as amended, c. 691, 48 Stat. 1185, 45 U.S.C.  151 et seq., 45 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq. to be such that courts could not even exercise the function of keeping the National Mediation Board within its statutory authority. Switchmen's Union v. National Mediation Board, \n320 \nU.S. 297\n, 64 S.Ct. 95. Were this list of illustrations extended and the various regulatory schemes thrown into a hotchpot, the result would be hopeless discord. And to do so would be to treat these legislative schemes as though they were part of a single body of law instead of each being a self-contained scheme. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 288, 314]\n\u00a0\n The divers roles played by judicial review in the administration of regulatory measures other than the Agricultural Marketing Act cannot tell us when and for whom judicial review of administrative action can be had under that Act. The fact that certain classes of individuals adversely affected by a ruling of the Interstate Commerce Commission can and other classes cannot obtain redress in court, does not tell us what classes may and what classes may not obtain judicial redress for action by the Secretary of Agriculture which affects these respective classes adversely. And to cite the Switchmen's case, supra, in support of this case is to treat our decisions too lightly. In the numerous cases either granting or denying judicial review, grant or denial were reached not by applying some 'natural law' of judicial review nor on the basis of some general body of doctrines for construing the diverse provisions of the great variety of federal regulatory statutes. Judicial review when recognized-its scope and its incidence-was derived from the materials furnished by the particular statute in regard to which the opportunity for judicial review was asserted. This is the lesson to be drawn from the prior decisions of this Court on judicial review, and not any doctrinaire notions of general applicability to statutes based on different schemes of administration and conveying different purposes by Congress in the utilization of administrative and judicial remedies for the enforcement of law. However useful judicial review may be, it is for Congress and not for this Court to decide when it may be used-except when the Constitution commands it. In this case there is no such command. Common-law remedies withheld by Congress and unrelated to a new scheme for enforcing new rights and duties should not be engrafted upon remedies which Congress saw fit to particularize. To do so impliedly denies to Congress the constitutional right of choice in the selection of remedies, and turns common-law reme- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 288, 315]\n\u00a0\n dies into constitutional necessities simply because they are old and familiar.\n When recently the Agricultural Marketing Act was in litigation before us, we sustained its constitutionality and defined its scope in the light of its history, its purposes and its provisions. United States v. Rock Royal Co-op., \n307 \nU.S. 533\n, 59 S.Ct. 993. We held in that case that a milk handler cannot challenge in court such an order as the one which is now assailed. Again we must turn to the history, the purposes and the provisions of the Act to determine whether Congress gave the producer the right of judicial relief here sought.\n In 1931 and 1932, prices of manufactured dairy products reached the lowest level in twenty-five years. Because of their relatively weak bargaining position, milk producers suffered most seriously. See Mortenson, Milk Distribution as a Public Utility, p. 6; Black, The Dairy Industry and the AAA, c. III; State Milk and Dairy Legislation (U.S. Gov't Printing Office, 1941) p. 3. Accordingly, Congress decided that the public interest in the handling of milk in interstate commerce could no longer be left to the haggling of a disorderly market, mitigated by inadequate organization within the industry. The Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, c. 25, 48 Stat. 31, was the result. The 'essential purpose' of the series of enactments thus initiated was to raise the producer's prices. Sen.Rep. No. 1011, 74th Cong., 3d Sess., p. 3. The Act of 1933 was amended in 1935, c. 641, 49 Stat. 750, and partially reenacted and amended by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, with which we are here concerned. Chapter 296, 50 Stat. 246, c. 567, 50 Stat. 563, 7 U.S.C.  601 et seq., 7 U.S.C.A .  601 et seq.\n An elaborate enactment like this, devised by those who know the needs of the industry and drafted by legislative specialists, is to be treated as an organism. Every part \n\n[321 \nU.S. 288, 316]\n\u00a0\n must be related to the scheme as a whole. The legislation is a self- contained code, and within it must be found whatever remedies Congress saw fit to afford. For the Act did not give new remedies for old rights. It created new rights and new duties, and precisely defined the remedies for the enforcement of duties and the vindication of rights. Of course the statute concerns the interests of producers, handlers and consumers. But it does not define or create any legal interest for the consumer, and it specifically provides that 'No order issued under this title shall be applicable to any producer in his capacity as a producer.'  8c(13) (B).\n The statute as an entirety makes it clear that obligations are imposed on handlers alone. Section 8c(5)(A) authorizes the Secretary to classify milk according to the form in which or the purpose for which it is used. Section 8c(5)(B)(ii) directs the Secretary to provide for the payment to producers of a uniform price 'irrespective of the uses made of such milk by the individual handler to whom it is delivered'. This latter, known as the 'blended price', is computed under the Secretary's Order No. 4 of July 28, 1941, by multiplying the use value of the milk by the total quantity, making specified deductions and additions, and then dividing the resulting sum by the total quantity of the milk.  904.7(b). A deduction for payments to cooperatives which enters into this computation is the object of petitioners' attack.\n It is apparent that the minimum 'blended price' which the producer receives may be different than the minimum 'use value' fixed by the Secretary or his Administrator which the handler must pay. Thus  8c(5)(C) authorizes provision for necessary adjustments. The mechanics of these adjustments are described in the Secretary's Order No. 4. In short, the handler who sells or uses his milk so that its value is more than the minimum 'blended price' he pays the producer, must pay the excess to a settlement \n\n[321 \nU.S. 288, 317]\n\u00a0\n fund, and the handler who puts his milk to a lower value use than the minimum 'blended price' he pays in turn receives the difference out of the fund.  904.8(b).\n Violation of any order by a handler makes him subject to criminal proceedings.  8c(14). Thus, while the Act and the Order may affect the interests of producers as well as those of handlers, legally they operate directly against handlers only. The corrective processes provided by the Act reflect this situation. Section 8c(15) permits a handler to challenge an order before the Secretary, and if dissatisfied, he may bring suit in equity before a district court. Provision for judicial remedies for consumers and producers is significantly absent. Such omission is neither inadvertent nor surprising. It would be manifestly incongruous for an Act which specifically provides that no order shall be directed at producers to give to producers the right to attack the validity of such an order in court.\n To create a judicial remedy for producers when the statute gave none is to dislocate the Congressional scheme of enforcement. For example,  8c( 15)(B) provides that the pendency of a proceeding for review instituted by a handler shall not impede or delay proceedings brought under  8a(6) for compliance with an order. Because there is no provision for court review of an order on a producer's petition, naturally there is no corresponding provision to guard against such interference with enforcement of an order. By giving producers the right to sue although Congress withheld that right, the suspension of a milk order pending disposition of a producer's suit will now depend upon the discretion of trial judges. And technical details concerning the milk industry that were committed to the Secretary of Agriculture are now made subjects of litigation before ill-equipped courts.\n By denying them access to the courts Congress has not left producers to the mercy of the Secretary of Agriculture. Congress merely has devised means other than judicial \n\n[321 \nU.S. 288, 318]\n\u00a0\n for the effective expression of producers' interests in the terms of an order. Before the Secretary may issue an order he is required to 'give due notice of and an opportunity for a hearing upon a proposed order.'  8c(3). At such a hearing all interested persons may submit relevant evidence, and the procedure makes adequate provision for notice to those who may be affected by an order. See Administrative Procedure and Practice in the Department of Agriculture under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1939) p. 11 et seq. Nor are these the only or the most effective means for safeguarding the producer's interest. While an order may be issued despite the objection of handlers of more than 50% of the volume of the commodity covered by the order, no order may issue when not approved by at least two-thirds-either numerically or according to volume of production-of the producers.  8c(9).\n The fact that Congress made specific provision for submission of some defined questions to judicial review would hardly appear to be an argument for inferring that judicial review even of broader scope is also open as to other questions for which Congress did not provide judicial review. The obvious conclusion called for is that as to such other questions, judicial review was purposefully withheld. In the frame of this statute such an omission should not be treated as having no meaning, or rather as meaning that an omission is to be given the same effect as an inclusion. Nor does  8a(8) referring to remedies 'existing at law or in equity' touch our problem. That only adds to the remedies in  8a(5)-(7) for the enforcement of the Act. It in no way qualifies or expands the express provisions of the Statute in  8c(15) for judicial review of such an order as the present-specification of the class of persons who are given the right to resort to courts and narrow limitation of the scope of judicial review. The remedy of review here sought by producers is by  8c(15) explicitly \n\n[321 \nU.S. 288, 319]\n\u00a0\n restricted to handlers; and such review is not like that before the Court, a conventional suit in equity, but is a procedure for review of an adverse ruling in a price proceeding before the Secretary of Agriculture. It is a review of an administrative review, not an independent judicial determination.\n An elaborate process of implications should not be invented to escape the plain meaning of  8c(15), and to dislocate a carefully formulated scheme of enforcement. That is not the way to construe such legislation, that is, if Chief Justice Taft was right in characterizing as 'a conspicuous instance of his (Chief Justice White's) unusual and remarkable power and facility in statesmanlike interpretation of statute law', 257 U. S. xxv, the doctrine established in Texas & Pac. Ry. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co., \n204 \nU.S. 426\n, 27 S.Ct. 350, 9 Ann.Cas. 1075, and more particularly the way in which  22 of the Act to Regulate Commerce, 49 U.S. C.A.  22, was therein construed to effectuate the purposes of that Act. 204 U.S. at pages 446, 447, 27 S.Ct. at pages 357, 358, 9 Ann.Cas. 1075.\n The Court is thus adding to what Congress has written a provision for judicial relief of producers. And it sanctions such relief in a case in which petitioners have no standing to sue on any theory. The only effect of the deduction which is challenged by the producers is to fix a minimum price to which they are entitled perhaps lower than that which might otherwise have been determined. But the Act does not prevent their bargaining for a price higher than the minimum, and we are advised by the Government of what is not denied by petitioners, that such arrangements are by no means unusual. This Court has held that a consumer has no standing to challenge a minimum price order like the one before us. City of Atlanta v. Ickes, \n308 \nU.S. 517\n, 60 S.Ct. 170; cf. Sprunt & Son v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 249\n, 50 S.Ct. 315. Surely a producer who may bargain for prices above the minimum is in no better legal position than a consumer who urges that too high a minimum has \n\n[321 \nU.S. 288, 320]\n\u00a0\n been improperly fixed. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts which purchased milk for its public institutions valued at $105,232.97 in 1940, and $117, 584.50 in 1941, has hardly a less substantial interest in the minimum price than that of the petitioners. And yet Massachusetts has no standing to object to the minimum fixed by an order.\n The alleged lower minimum 'blended price' is the sum and substance of petitioners' complaint. If that gives them no standing to sue nothing does. An attack merely on the method by which the blended price was reduced may present an interesting abstract question but furnishes no legal right to sue. The producers have nothing to do with the settlement fund. They receive the blended price in any event. Even assuming that the Administrator may have fixed a blended price in ways that may argue an inconsistency between what he has done and what Congress told him to do, any resulting disadvantage to a producer is wholly unrelated to the settlement fund. That fund is contributed by handlers and paid by handlers. If handlers may not attack payments to cooperatives, as this Court held in United States v. Rock Royal Co-op., supra, 307 U.S. at page 561, 59 S.Ct. at page 1007, with all deference I am unable to see how producers can be in a better position to attack such payments. This suit was rightly dismissed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See 18 D.C.Code  41, as amended, 49 Stat. 1921.

Section 8c(19) authorizes the Secretary to hold a referendum to determine whether producers approve.\n'Sec. 8c(13)(B) No other issued under this title shall be applicable to any producer in his capacity as a producer.'\n\n'Sec. 8c(14) Any handler subject to an order issued under this section, or any officer, director, agent, or employee of such handler, who violates any provision of such order (other than a provision calling for payment of a pro rata share of expenses) shall, on conviction, be fined not less than $50 or more than $500 for each such violation, and each day during which such violation continues shall be deemed a separate violation: Provided, That if the court finds that a petition pursuant to subsection ( 15) of this section was filed and prosecuted by the defendant in good faith and not for delay, no penalty shall be imposed under this subsection for such violations as occurred between the date upon which the defendant's petition was filed with the Secretary, and the date upon which notice of the Secretary's ruling thereon was given to the defendant in accordance with regulations prescribed pursuant to subsection (15).'\n\n'Sec. 8c(15) (A) Any handler subject to an order may file a written petition with the Secretary of Agriculture, stating that any such order or any provision of any such order or any obligation imposed in connection therewith is not in accordance with law and praying for a modification thereof or to be exempted therefrom. He shall thereupon be given an opportunity for a hearing upon such petition, in accordance with regulations made by the Secretary of Agriculture, with the approval of the President. After such hearing, the Secretary shall make a ruling upon the prayer of such petition which shall be final, if in accordance with law.\n\n'(B) The District Courts of the United States (including the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia) in any district in which such handler is an inhabitant, or has his principal place of business, are hereby vested with jurisdiction in equity to review such ruling, provided a bill in equity for that purpose is filed within twenty days from the date of the entry of such ruling. Service of process in such proceedings may be had upon the Secretary by delivering to him a copy of the bill of complaint. If the court determines that such ruling is not in accordance with law, it shall remand such proceedings to the Secretary with directions either (1) to make such ruling as the court shall determine to be in accordance with law, or (2) to \n\n take such further proceedings as, in its opinion, the law requires. The pendency of proceedings instituted pursuant to this subsection (15) shall not impede, hinder, or delay the United States or the Secretary of Agriculture from obtaining relief pursuant to section 8a(6) of this title. Any proceedings brought pursuant to section 8a(6) of this title (except where brought by way of counterclaim in proceedings instituted pursuant to this subsection (15)) shall abate whenever a final decree has been rendered in proceedings between the same parties, and covering the same subject matter, instituted pursuant to this subsection (15).' 5 Section 2, n. 4, supra. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] Section 8c(3), n. 4, supra. \n[\nFootnote 7\n] Section 8c(4), n. 4, supra. \n[\nFootnote 8\n] See United States v.

Section 904.0 of the Order contains the Secretary's findings and Section 904.1 the definitions of terms.\n'Sec. 904.1(6) The term 'handler' means any person, irrespective of whether such person is a producer or an association of producers, wherever located or operating, who engages in such handling of milk, which is sold as milk or cream in the marketing area, as is in the current of interstate or foreign commerce, or which directly burdens, obstructs, or affects interstate or foreign commerce in milk and its products.'\n\n Section 904.2 enumerates the duties of the market administrator. Section 904.3 classifies milk into Class I milk and Class II milk according to its utilization. Generally speaking, Class I milk is that which is utilized for sale as milk containing from 1\/2 to 1% to 16% butterfat or as chocolate or flavored milk, while Class II includes all other uses.\n Section 904.4 provides:\n'Sec. 904.4 Minimum Prices. (a) Class I prices to producers. Each handler shall pay producers, in the manner set forth in Sec. 904.8, for Class I milk delivered by them, not less than the following prices:\n\n'(b) Class II prices. Each handler shall pay producers, in the manner set forth in Sec. 904.8, for Class II milk delivered by them not less than the following prices per hundred weight: ....'\n\n Section 904.5 provides for necessary informational reports by handlers, and Section 904.6 deals with the application of the Order to exceptional types of handlers. Section 904.7, dealing with computation of the weighted average, read in its applicable portions as of July 28, 1941, as follows:\n'Sec. 904.7 Determination of Uniform Prices to Producers. (a) Computation of value of milk for each handler. For each delivery period the market administrator shall compute, ... the value of milk sold, distributed, or used by each handler ... in the following manner:\n\n'(1) Multiply the quantity of milk in each class by the price applicable pursuant to paragraphs (a), (b), and (c), of Sec. 904.4; and\n\n'(2) Add together the resulting value of each class.\n\n'(b) Computation and announcement of uniform prices. The market administrator shall compute and announce the uniform prices \n\n per hundredweight of milk delivered during each delivery period in the following manner:\n'(1) Combine into one total the respective value of milk, computed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, for each handler from whom the market administrator has received at his office, prior to the 11th day after the end of such delivery period, the report for such delivery period and the payments required by Sec. 904.8(b)(3) and (g) and (h) for milk received during each delivery period since the effective date of the most revent amendment hereof;\n\n'(4) Subtract the total amount to be paid to producers pursuant to Sec. 904.8(b)(2);\n\n'(5) Subtract the total of payments required to be made for such delivery period pursuant to Sec. 904.9(b);\n\n'(6) Divide by the total quantity of milk which is included in these computations. ...\n\n'(7) Subtract not less than 4 cents nor more than 5 cents for the purpose of retaining a cash balance in connection with the payments set forth in Sec. 904.8(b)(3);\n\n'(9) On the 12th day after the end of each delivery period, mail to all handlers and publicly announce (a) such of these computations as do not disclose information confidential pursuant to the act, (b) the blended price per hundredweight which is the result of these computations, (c) the names of the handlers whose milk is included in the computations, and (d) the Class II price.'\n\n As of October 28, 1941, Subsection (5) was revoked and the subsections following it were renumbered, and the deduction theretofore required by it was effected by amending Subsection (7) (new Subsection (6)) to read as follows:\n'(6) Subtract not less than 5 1\/2 cents nor more than 6 1\/2 cents for the purpose of retaining a cash balance in connection with the payments set forth in  904.8(b)(3) and 909.9(b);'\n\n See n. 16, infra.\n Section 904.8(a) and (b), dealing with the method of making payment, reads:\n'Sec. 904.8 Payments for Milk. (a) Advance payments. On or before the 10th day after the end of each delivery period, each handler shall make payment to producers for the approximate value of milk \n\n received during the first 15 days of such delivery period. In no event shall such advance payment be at a rate less than Class II price for such delivery.\n'(b) Final payments. On or before the 25th day after the end of each delivery period, each handler shall make payment, subject to the butterfat differential set forth in paragraph (d) of this section, for the total value of milk received during such delivery period as required to be computed pursuant to Sec. 904.7(a), as follows:\n\n'(1) To each producer, except as set forth in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph at not less than the blended price per hundredweight, computed pursuant to Sec. 904.7(b), subject to the differentials set forth in paragraph (e) of this section, for the quantity of milk delivered by such producer;\n\n'(2) To any producer, who did not regularly sell milk for a period of 30 days prior to February 9, 1936, to a handler or to persons within the marketing area, at not less than the Class II price in effect for the plant at which such producer delivered milk, except that during the May, June, and September delivery periods the price pursuant to Sec. 904.4(b)(3) shall apply, for all the milk delivered by such producer during the period beginning with the first regular delivery of such producer and continuing until the end of 2 full calendar months following the first day of the next succeeding calendar month; and\n\n'(3) To producers, through the market administrator, by paying to, on or before the 23rd day after the end of each delivery period, or receiving from the market administrator on or before the 25th day after the end of each delivery period, as the case may be, the amount by which the payments required to be made pursuant to subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph are less than or exceed the value of milk as required to be computed for such handler pursuant to Sec. 904.7(a), as shown in a statement rendered by the market administrator on or before the 20th day after the end of such delivery period.'\n\n Other clauses of Section 904.8 deal with price differentials not here pertinent.\n Section 904.9 authorizes the payments to cooperatives which are questioned here. Eligibility requirements are set out in  904.9(a), which then provides:\n'(1) Any such cooperative association shall receive an amount computed at not more than the rate of 1 1\/2 cents per hundredweight \n\n of milk marketed by it on behalf of its members in conformity with the provision of this order, the value of which is determined pursuant to Sec. 904.7(a), and with respect to which a handler has made payments as required by Sec. 904.8(b)(3) and Sec. 904.10: Provided, That the amount paid shall not exceed the amount which handlers are obligated to deduct from payments to members under subsection (e) hereof and are not used in paying patronage dividends or other payments to members with respect to milk delivered except in fulfilling the guarantee of payments to producers; and that in cases where two or more associations participate in the marketing of the same milk, payment under this paragraph shall be available only to the association which the individual producer has made his exclusive agent in the marketing of such milk.\n'(2) Any such cooperative association shall receive an amount computed at the rate of 5 cents per hundredweight on Class I milk received from producers at a plant operated under the exclusive control of member producers, which is sold to proprietary handlers. This amount shall not be received on milk sold to stores, to handlers, in which the cooperative has any ownership, or to a handler with which the cooperative has such sales arrangements that its milk not sold as Class I milk to such handler is not available for sale as Class I milk to other handlers.'\n\n Section 904.9(b) contains the direction for payment out of the cash balance created by  904.7(b)(6), as amended, supra.\n Section 904.9:\n'(b) Payment to Qualified Cooperative Associations. The market administrator shall, upon claim submitted in form as prescribed by him, make payments authorized under paragraph (a), or issue credit therefor out of the cash balance credited pursuant to Sec. 904.7(b)(5), on or before the 25th day after the end of each delivery period, subject to verification of the receipts and other items on which the amount of such payment is based.'\n\n The deductions from payments by handlers to cooperative member producers, referred to in Section 904.9(a)(1), quoted supra, are authorized by  904.9(e), as follows:\n'(e) Authorized member deductions. In the case of producers whose milk is received at a plant not operated by a cooperative association of which such producers are members and which is receiving payments \n\n pursuant to this section, each handler shall make such deductions from the payments to be made to such producers pursuant to Sec. 904.8 as may be authorized by such producers and, on or before the 25th day after the end of each delivery period, pay over such deductions to the association in whose favor such authorizations were made.'\n Section 904.10 requires each handler to pay to the market administrator not more than 2 cents per hundredweight of milk delivered to him in order to meet costs of administration. Section 904.11 covers the effective time, suspension, or termination of the order. \n[\nFootnote 11\n] 'Blended price' means the uniform price less administrative deductions. \n[\nFootnote 12\n] Cf. 7 C.F.R.1941 Supp.  904.7(a). \n[\nFootnote 13\n] See 7 C.F.R.1941 Supp.  904.7(b). \n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] 7 C.F.R.1941 Supp.  904.7(b), 904.8(b)(1). \n[\nFootnote 15\n] 7 C.F.R.1941 Supp.  904.8(b)(3).

Two of the terminal operators in the San Francisco Bay area were the State of California and the City of Oakland. They brought these proceedings to set aside the Commission's order in so far as it applied to them. A district court of three judges denied relief. 46 F.Supp. 474. The case is here on direct appeal under  31 of the Shipping Act (c. 451, 39 Stat. 738, Ex.Ord. No. 6166, c. 858, 49 Stat. 1987, 2016, 46 U.S.C.  830, 46 U.S.C.A.  830) in connection with the Urgent Deficiencies Act of 1913 (c. 32, 38 Stat. 220, 28 U.S.C.  47 and 47a, 28 U.S.C.A.  47, 47a) and the Judiciary Act of 1925 (c. 229, 43 Stat. 938, 28 U.S.C.  345(4), 28 U.S.C.A.  345(4)). California and Oakland denied the power of the Commission to issue the kind of order that it did, and in any event they urged that the authority under which the Commission acted does not or, if it does, cannot constitutionally cover their operations.\n The legal issues depend for their solution upon an understanding of the situation to which the Commission addressed itself-the circumstances as the Commission found them and the appropriate way of dealing with them. What follows is a rapid summary of a voluminous record.\n Through its Board of State Harbor Commissioners, California provides facilities for the handling of freight and passengers on the San Francisco waterfront, under a statute which prohibits the Board from making charges beyond the cost of furnishing such facilities and administering them. California Harbors and Navigation Code,  3080, 3084, St.1937, p. 856. Pier and office space is assigned by the Board to various steamship lines, and charges fixed by the Board are collected by these assignees for the Board. Except at two piers, the assignees handle the cargo, but the Board employs a staff of men to check all cargo and vessel movements and collect its charges. Oakland, through its Board of Port Commissioners, operates \n\n[320 \nU.S. 577, 580]\n\u00a0\n piers and terminals which, like those of California, are designed to accommodate vessels in coastwise, intercoastal, offshore, and foreign trade. Whether the facilities are operated by the City directly or leased to another, the City prescribes and collects the charges.\n In thus providing facilities for waterborne traffic, Oakland and California have for many years competed with privately owned terminals in San Francisco Bay. Cut-throat competition ensued, with the inevitable chaos following abnormally low rates. In an attempt to remedy the situation, the California Railroad Commission investigated the operations of terminals in San Francisco Bay, and, more particularly pertinent for present purposes, the prevalent discrimination among users of the terminal services. The conclusions from this inquiry were embodied in an order issued by the Railroad Commission in 1936. 40 Calif. R.R. Comm. Decisions 107. But publicly-owned terminals, and therefore those of California and Oakland, are not subject to the jurisdiction of the Railroad Commission. Since these public bodies operated the major portion of the dock facilities in the area, the Railroad Commission naturally found it impossible to order adjustments in the practices of the private terminals unless the competing public bodies agreed to make similar adjustments. The order of the Commission was so conditioned. California and Oakland acceded to the recommendations in some respects but failed to do so as to practices now to be described.\n When cargo is brought to a wharf for shipment or removed to a wharf from a ship, it is the custom to allow a period of 'free time' during which the cargo may rest on the wharf without charge. The length of the free time is fixed, broadly speaking, by determining the period reasonably necessary for the shipper to assemble or to remove his goods and for the ship to load or to discharge. When cargo is left on the wharf beyond the free time \n\n[320 \nU.S. 577, 581]\n\u00a0\n period, a charge called 'wharf demurrage or storage' is assessed. The Railroad Commission recommended free time periods shorter than was the practice of California and Oakland, and wharf demurrage charges greater in many instances than those collected by them. These recommendations California and Oakland rejected. This impasse, due to the immunity of California and Oakland from state regulation, was followed by the proceedings before the United States Maritime Commission which resulted in the order now before us. Extended hearings were held before the Commission's examiner, at which the principal witnesses were officials of the Board and Oakland and an expert of the Railroad Commission. After full submission of the controversy, the examiner made his report and findings. On exceptions to some of his findings, the issues were again thoroughly canvassed before the Commission, and on September 11, 1941, it made its order.\n The Commission found that there was a marked lack of uniformity in the free time periods allowed by the various terminals, and that to the extent that appellants' free time allowances were greater than those recommended by the Railroad Commission they were unreasonable and led to discrimination against those persons who did not and could not use extended free time. After consideration of the cost studies submitted by its experts as well as of the data introduced by appellants, the Commission further found that appellants' demurrage charges were less than the cost of the services and the carrying charges of the facilities which furnished them. It concluded that unless those who took advantage of wharf storage supplied revenue sufficient to meet the cost of the service, the burden would be shifted to those who paid appellants for other terminal services, such as docking of vessels, loading and unloading, and transportation privileges over and through the terminals. Accordingly, \n\n[320 \nU.S. 577, 582]\n\u00a0\n the Commission ordered appellants to cease and desist from allowing greater periods of free time than those found reasonable by the Railroad Commission, and to abstain from collecting wharf demurrage and storage rates less than those prescribed by the California authority for private terminals. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n Having found violations of  16 and 17, the Commission was charged by law with the duty of devising appropriate means for their correction. It could have issued an order generally prohibiting further preferential and unreasonable practices, leaving the parties to translate such a generality into concreteness and to devise their own remedies. The Commission chose to do otherwise. It can hardly be suggested that the protection of the national interest in interstate and foreign commerce or even the convenience of the parties would, as a matter of sensible and economic administration, limit the Commission to such negative means of dealing with the evils revealed on this record in one of our greatest ports. Cf. Phelps Dodge Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board, \n313 \nU.S. 177, 194\n, 61 S.Ct. 845, 852, 133 A.L.R. 1217. Explicit formulation of duties owed by a business subject to legal regulation is desirable if indeed not necessary. Only thus can it avoid the hazards of uncertainty whether its attempted compliance with an undefined requirement of law is in fact compliance. Neither industry nor the community which it serves is benefitted by the explosion of intermittent lawsuits for determining the relative rights \n\n[320 \nU.S. 577, 583]\n\u00a0\n of conflicting interests. What more natural for the Commission, having found disobedience of the law against discriminatory and unreasonable practices, than to define the outer bounds of practices that would not be unreasonable nor discriminatory. \n3\n And so the Commission fixed a schedule of maximum free time and another schedule for avoiding discrimination through non-compensatory charges. It acted on authoritative information and fully canvassed testimony in fixing the minimum charges that would reflect cost. It was proper to choose the cost standard, because just as unreasonably long free time tends to be parasitic on rates for other services, non-compensatory demurrage results in the same mischief. Cf. Baltimore & O.R. Co. v. United States, \n305 \nU.S. 507, 524\n, 59 S.Ct. 284, 290.\n Appellants' objection is that while  17 and 18 specifically give the Commission rate-making power over common carriers by water,4 no such power is given over those \n\n[320 \nU.S. 577, 584]\n\u00a0\n who like California and Oakland, are not common carriers by water. We fully agree that no rate-making power such as the Commission has been given over water carriers is conferred over other persons subject to the Shipping Act. But the order of the Commission, though it pertains to demurrage charges, is not an exercise of conventional rate-making. By  17 all those who are subject to the Act are under a duty to 'establish, observe, and enforce just and reasonable regulations and practices relating to or connected with the receiving, handling, storing, or delivering of property.' When the Commission finds a breach of this duty, the same section authorizes it to 'determine, prescribe, and order enforced a just and reasonable regulation or practice.' The withholding of rate-making power for services other than water carriage does not qualify the unlimited grant to the Commission of the power to stop effectively all unjust and unreasonable practices in receiving, handling, storing or delivering property. Finding a wrong which it is duty-bound to remedy, the Maritime Commission, as the expert body established by Congress for safeguarding this specialized aspect of the national interest, may, within the general framework of the Shipping Act, fashion the tools for so doing. Cf. United States Nav. Co. v. Cunard S.S. Co., \n284 \nU.S. 474, 487\n, 52 S.Ct. 247, 251; Merchants' Warehouse Co. v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 501, 513\n, 51 S.Ct. 505, 510. The only way to correct the preferential and unreasonable results of non-compensatory charges was to require compensatory charges. All that the Commission did was to translate that requirement from a generality into dollars and cents. That the phrase \n\n[320 \nU.S. 577, 585]\n\u00a0\n 'regulation or practice' extends to such discrimination as that which resulted from non-compensatory demurrage charges is amply demonstrated by the application of the concept 'practice' in comparable situations under the Interstate Commerce Act. Adams v. Mills, \n286 \nU.S. 397, 409\n, 52 S.Ct. 589, 592; Baltimore & O.R. Co. v. United States, \n305 \nU.S. 507, 524\n, 59 S.Ct. 284, 290.\n We have disposed of the only serious question raised. The numerous other questions call for only summary treatment.\n Since Oakland and California are not common carriers by water they are subject to the authority of the Commission only if they come within the designation 'other person subject to this Act' as defined in  1 of the Shipping Act. c. 451, 39 Stat. 728, c. 152, 40 Stat. 900, 46 U.S.C.  801, 46 U.S.C.A.  801. The phrase covers 'any person not included in the term 'common carrier by water,' carrying on the business of forwarding or furnishing wharfage, dock, warehouse, or other terminal facilities in connection with a common carrier by water'. And 'person' 'includes corporations, partnerships, and associations ....' We need not waste time on useless generalities about statutory construction in order to conclude that entities other than technical corporations, partnerships and associations are 'included' among the 'persons' to whom the Shipping Act applies if its plain purposes preclude their exclusion. The crucial question is whether the statute, read in the light of the circumstances that gave rise to its enactment and for which it was designed, applies also to public owners of wharves and piers. California and Oakland furnished precisely the facilities subject to regulation under the Act, and with so large a portion of the nation's dock facilities, as Congress knew (53 Cong.Rec. 8276), owned or controlled by public instrumentalities, it would have defeated the very purpose for which Congress framed the scheme for regulating waterfront terminals to exempt \n\n[320 \nU.S. 577, 586]\n\u00a0\n those operated by governmental agencies. We need not rest on inference to avoid a construction that would have such dislocating consequences. The manager of the bill which became the Shipping Act of 1916, speaking on the floor of the House, left no doubt that the legislation was designed to prevent discrimination no less by public than by private owners. 53 Cong. Rec. 8276. And whatever may be the limitations implied by the phrase 'in connection with a common carrier by water' which modifies the grant of jurisdiction over those furnishing 'wharfage, dock, warehouse, or other terminal facilities', there can be no doubt that wharf storage facilities provided at shipside for cargo which has been unloaded from water carriers are subject to regulation by the Commission. Finally, it is too late in the day to question the power of Congress under the Commerce Clause to regulate such an essential part of interstate and foreign trade as the activities and instrumentalities which were here authorized to be regulated by the Commission, whether they be the activities and instrumentalities of private persons or of public agencies. United States v. State of California, \n297 \nU.S. 175, 184\n, 185 S., 56 S.Ct. 421, 424.\n Due consideration has been given to other objections, referring to the sufficiency of the evidence before the Commission, the adequacy of its findings, and its competence, but they require no discussion.\n Judgment affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS\n I dissent. I pass the contentions of the appellants respecting the power of Congress to regulate the State's activities under consideration, the scope of the term 'person' as used in the Shipping Act, and the alleged absence of any grant of power to the Commission to fix minimum rates for water carriers or others. This for the reason that, in my opinion, Congress has withheld from the Com- \n\n[320 \nU.S. 577, 587]\n\u00a0\n mission authority to fix or regulate the rates or charges of those furnishing wharfage facilities.\n The Shipping Act of 1916, in all parts here relevant, has remained as it was originally adopted, though amended in other respects by later legislation. In  1,1 after defining carriers by water, which are the primary subject of its regulatory provisions, the Act adds:\n'The term 'other person subject to this Act' means any person not included in the term 'common carrier by water,' carrying on the business of forwarding or furnishing wharfage, dock, warehouse, or other terminal facilities in connection with a common carrier by water.'\n\n Section 162 provides:\n'That it shall be unlawful for any common carrier by water, or other person subject to this Act, either alone or in conjunction with any other person, directly or indirectly-\n\n'First. To make or give any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to and particular person, locality, or description of traffic in any respect whatsoever, or to subject any particular person, locality, or description of traffic to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage in any respect whatsoever.' (Italics supplied.)\n\n Section 173 in pertinent part, provides:\n'No common carrier by water in foreign commerce shall demand, charge, or collect any rate, fare, or charge which is unjustly discriminatory between shippers or ports, or unjustly prejudicial to exporters of the United States as compared with their foreign competitors. Whenever the commission finds that any such rate, fare, or charge is demanded, charged, or collected it may alter the same to the extent necessary to correct such unjust discrimination \n\n[320 \nU.S. 577, 588]\n\u00a0\n or prejudice and make an order that the carrier shall discontinue demanding, charging, or collecting any such unjustly discriminatory or prejudicial rate, fare, or charge. (Italics supplied.)\n\n'Every such carrier and every other person subject to this Act shall establish, observe, and enforce just and reasonable regulations and practices relating to or connected with the receiving, handling, storing, or delivering of property. Whenever the commission finds that any such regulation or practice is unjust or unreasonable it may determine, prescribe, and order enforced a just and reasonable regulation or practice.' (Italics supplied.)\n\n Section 18,4 so far as relevant, is:\n'Every common carrier by water in interstate commerce shall establish, observe, and enforce just and reasonable rates, fares, charges, classifications, and tariffs, and just and reasonable regulations and practices relating thereto and to the issuance, form, and substance of tickets, receipts, and bills of lading, the manner and method of presenting, marking, packing, and delivering property for transportation, the carrying of personal, sample, and excess baggage, the facilities for transportation, and all other matters relating to or connected with the receiving, handling, transporting, storing, or delivering of property.' ( Italics supplied.)\n\n The Commission concedes, as it must, that whereas the Act definitely deals with the rates of water carriers, and places those rates under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Commission, it contains no such specific mandate to the Commission concerning the rates or charges of wharfingers. It must equally be conceded that the order of the Commission under review does establish minimum rates and charges for services rendered by those maintaining and operating wharves used by water carriers. In the absence of specific authority in this behalf, the Commission truned to that portion of  16 which prohibits not only water carriers but other persons subject to the Act from \n\n[320 \nU.S. 577, 589]\n\u00a0\n granting preferences or practicing discrimination, and that portion of  17 which comprehends both water carriers and other persons subject to the Act and enjoins just and reasonable regulations and practices respecting receiving, handling, storage or delivery of property.\n The over simplified argument in support of this position is that a rate or charge is, in a broad sense, a regulation or practice. The difficulty with the argument is that, in the Interstate Commerce Act, and elsewhere, Congress has always sharply distinguished, as it did in the present Act, between rates and charges on the one hand, and regulations and practices on the other. The legislative history of the Shipping Act indicates that Congress well understood that states and municipalities, in order to encourage the flow of commerce through their ports, had established public wharves and that Congress intended that, as respects such public facilities, preferences and discriminations should not be permitted. But there is nothing in the legislative history to indicate that, in the teeth of the plain words of the statute as enacted, Congress had in mind conferring power to regulate the rates and charges for such publicly owned facilities; much less that if a state or its agency deemed it advisable and in the public interest to operate such facilities at low rates, to encourage the flow of commerce through its ports, the Commission could put a floor under its rates and compel it in effect to aid competing private enterprise.\n Little need be, or can be, added to the clearly expressed words of the statute. It speaks for itself, and I think the court ought not to permit the use of a prohibition against practices to be availed of to write additional provisions into the section dealing with rates and charges.\n The attempt to bolster this process, on the part of the Commission, by reference to the decisions of this court seems to me futile. The Commission and the Government rely principally upon Baltimore & O.R. Co. v. \n\n[320 \nU.S. 577, 590]\n\u00a0\n United States, \n305 \nU.S. 507\n, 59 S.Ct. 284. The case obviously not only fails to support the order but seems to me to be an authority against it. The case arose under the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq. It dealt with a practice of carriers which was to maintain warehouses in respect of which low cost storage was afforded to persons who would ship over the carrier's lines. In essence the practice of warehousing at such low rates operated as a rebate or discrimination in the carrier's transportation rate favoring any shipper who would use the carrier's lines and disfavoring those who would not, or could not, do so. Here we are not concerned with water carriers' rates, fares or charges. The Commission's order is directed at services rendered by privately and publicly owned wharves, applicable to all seeking to avail themselves of the services which are proffered to all alike. If any discrimination by the appellants as between shippers were pointed out in may well be that the Commission might order the discontinuance of such discrimination. That is not this case. The Commission purports to order the discontinuance of a discrimination but, in reality, orders a rise in the level of rates applicable without discrimination to all those who can and do use the proffered services. Its order is a thinly veiled attempt to cloak a rate order under the guise of a regulation. I think it plain that Congress granted no such power.\n I would reverse the judgment.\n Mr. Justice BLACK, Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, and Mr. Justice MURPHY join in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 16, so far as here relevant, provides: 'That it shall be unlawful for any common carrier by water, or other person subject to this Act, either alone or in conjunction with any other person, directly or indirectly-First.

STATE OF MISSOURI(1944)\n\nArgued: Decided: May 8, 1944\n\n\n\n Mr. Joseph E. Schroeder, of Kansas City, Kan., for complainant.\n Messrs. Tyre W. Burton and Frank W. Hayes, both of Jefferson City, Mo ., for defendant.\n\n Mr. Justice RUTLEDGE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Kansas brings this original suit against Missouri to have determined their common boundary from the mouth of the Kaw or Kansas River northwardly, over a distance of approximately 128 miles, along the channel of the Missouri River to its intersection with Kansas' north boundary line.\n At the time of Kansas' admission to the Union, January 29, 1861, the western boundary of Missouri followed the \n\n[322 \nU.S. 213, 214]\n\u00a0\n thread of the Missouri River, that is, the middle line of its main navigable channel, between these points. \n1\n This line then became the common boundary of the two states. \n2\n The bill of complaint was filed in 1940. It alleged that the thread of the stream had shifted frequently, sometimes suddenly, sometimes gradually, and that these changes had caused controversies concerning the true boundary. When the proceeding began it was in dispute at a number of places. \n3\n But during pendency of the suit the parties have settled all differences except one. This relates to the section of the boundary in the Forbes Bend region. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n After the filing of the suit a master was appointed. Extensive hearings were held. Both documentary and oral evidence was presented. The master has filed his report, which makes findings and conclusions in favor of Missouri. Kansas says these are contrary to the law and to the weight of the evidence.\n The land in dispute consists of about 2000 acres. This now lies on the Missouri side of the river toward the lower end of Forbes Bend. Kansas claims this land was at one time soil accreted to the Kansas bank, which an avulsive change in the course of the main channel has put back on the Missouri side; or, in the alternative, that the tract \n\n[322 \nU.S. 213, 215]\n\u00a0\n formed as an island on the Kansas side of the main channel and, as a result of a sudden shift in that channel to the other side of the island and the drying up of the old course, it has become physically attached to Missouri. In either event, Kansas urges, it follows that the boundary remains at the center of the river's former main channel. Missouri denies that the land accreted to Kansas, that there was avulsion, or that the island ever lay on the Kansas side of the main channel.\n The states are not in dispute about the applicable law. They agree that when changes take place by the slow and gradual process of accretion the boundary moves with the shifting in the main channel's course. \n5\n Likewise, they agree that a sudden or avulsive change in that course does not move the boundary, but leaves it where the channel formerly had run. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n However, the parties are sharply at odds over the facts and the conclusions to be drawn from the evidence. In view of this and since we think the facts as presented by the evidence are conclusive of the controversy, it becomes necessary to sketch them and to refer to portions of the evidence in order to give an understanding of the issues and the basis for our conclusions.\n\n\n I.\n\n\n Forbes Bend lies between Doniphan County, Kansas, and Holt County, Missouri. The disputed boundary, according to the master's findings, extends along the main channel of the river as it now flows for a distance of about five miles bending southeasterly from Channel Mileage Station 515 to Station 510 (as measured and marked in \n\n[322 \nU.S. 213, 216]\n\u00a0\n 1890). As the river enters Forbes Bend from the north it flows east of south. Near the point of entrance it is joined by Wolf Creek. This comes into the river from the Kansas side in an easterly direction. The mouth of Wolf Creek is roughly adjacent to Station 515. From this point the Kansas bluffs swing in a gradual convex curve southeasterly until they reach a point above Station 510. On the Missouri side the bluffs run, as they do on the Kansas side, generally southeasterly. Throughout the Forbes Bend region the distance as the crow flies from the Kansas bluffs to the Missouri bluffs is four miles more or less. Adjacent to and parallel with the Missouri bluffs, but between them and the river, lie tracks of the Burlington Railroad.\n The Missouri River is a vagrant, turbulent stream. Its name reflects this character. The Big Muddy is said to carry more silt than any other river except the Yellow River in China. It is constantly changing its course within the region between its bluffs, shifting from side to side as natural forces work upon its flow. Expert testimony is that a change of conditions in one bend produces changes as great, or nearly so, in the next bend below.\n The river flows around a big bend, known as Wolf Creek Bend, just before it reaches the mouth of Wolf Creek. Here it runs almost due south. It is conceded by all that in 1900 the river flowed southeasterly in a single channel from the mouth of Wolf Creek, hugging the Kansas bluffs throughout the entire course of flow to Station 510. As it presently flows, the river makes a wide arc, first to the left or Missouri bank in a course almost due east or north of east, before it turns sharply to the south again at a point midway between the bluffs, and follows this southerly course until it strikes the old main channel at the Kansas bluffs above Station 510. This bend now is in the form of a bow, with the river proper forming the bow and the old channel along the Kansas bank its string. Roughly, \n\n[322 \nU.S. 213, 217]\n\u00a0\n therefore, the difference between the present flow through Forbes Bend and the flow in 1900 is the difference between the bow and the string. At the center of the bow the distance between the old channel and the present one appears to be at most one mile.\n However, as will appear, the channel's present location results from more complex changes than merely a movement of the river north and east over the distance lying between these two channels. According to the greatly preponderant though not undisputed evidence, there was a division of channels in Forbes Bend from about 1914 or 1917 to 1927 or 1928. During this time the more westerly or Kansas channel lay slightly west of where the present channel runs. The Missouri or easterly channel lay on the other side of the area in dispute, which then formed part of a bar or island. At one time, probably about 1922 or 1923, during the period of greatest erosion of the Missouri bank, this channel came within half a mile or less of the Burlington tracks. The Missouri channel, with the river above it, then followed a course almost due east or slightly north of east from below the mouth of Wolf Creek to the point of its closest approach to the railroad. Then it swung sharply to the south and in a curving line came back to join the original channel near the Kansas bluffs above Station 510.\n From the recital thus far it is clear that in 1900 the land which then lay where the disputed tract now lies was Missouri land. This is undisputed. Likewise, the tract now is attached to Missouri on the easterly bank of the river. This is because the Missouri channel dried up during some five to eight years beginning around 1927 or earlier. But, before that process began, for many years the land in question lay between the two channels. And it is from conflicting views concerning whether, how and when these major changes took place the parties derive their respective claims to sovereignty over this soil. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 213, 218]\n\u00a0\n Kansas first claims that the land in dispute became hers by accretion. Her principal theory is that beginning in 1900 and during a period extending to 1917 or to 1927 the river channel, dur to changes upstream, gradually moved out from the Kansas bluffs over a distance of some three to three and a half miles to the north and cast. \n7\n As Missouri soil thus was being cut away, it is said the land in question was built up gradually on the Kansas side. In any event, if it was not connected firmly to the Kansas shore it was separated only by narrow and irregular chutes and sloughs, not by any sort of regular channel. Then either in 19178 or in 19279 ice jams forming in the river caused it suddenly to leave its channel near the Missouri bluffs and to open a new one near where the present channel runs. Relying upon accretion from 1900 to 1917 or 1927 for acquisition of the disputed area, Kansas relies upon avulsion in 1917 or 1927 to prevent losing the area again to Missouri. Her alternative theory of island formation is relied on in case that of accretion and avulsion fails on the proof. By this, the island formed on her side of the main channel and the subsequent shift of the main \n\n[322 \nU.S. 213, 219]\n\u00a0\n flow to the Kansas channel and drying up of the Missouri channel did not affect her jurisdiction.\n Missouri meets all of Kansas' claims with denial on the facts. She says first that the land in question has been at no time accreted soil of Kansas. On the contrary, she claims that the disputed area formed as an island in the river bed beginning about 1910 or 1912, and from then until 1927 or 1928 there was a divided flow around this island, a Missouri channel running north and east of it with a Kansas channel to the south and west. She insists that the Kansas channel always remained the main channel of the stream and only a minor one reached proximity to the railroad tracks. Accordingly, she says the island formed as Missouri land and always remained Missouri territory. Missouri thus opposes her view of island formation, both to Kansas' view of that process and to her claim of accretion and avulsion.\n However, Missouri adds a further argument even if the Kansas theory of accretion is conceded. According to this, the effect of the accretion to the Kansas bank is counteracted by the fact that at no time was there an avulsive change, whether in 1917 or in 1927. On the contrary the river moved back gradually as it came. In this veiw the accretive process working against Missouri ended in 1923 or 1924, when the Missouri channel reached greatest proximity to the railroad tracks. Beginning in those years and continuing gradually until 1933 or 1934, the river moved slowly back to a point beyond the location of the present channel. Thus purporting to follow the accretion theory in both directions, Missouri claims the land in question.\n It may be noted that crucial to Kansas' case, whether on her theory of accretion and avulsion or on that of island formation, is the need for showing that the main channel followed the course of the Missouri channel. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 213, 220]\n\u00a0\n II.\n Roughly the history of the Bend, for our purposes, may be divided into three periods, namely, from 1900 to 1917; from 1917 to 1928; and from 1928 to 1940, when this suit was begun. There is documentary evidence as well as oral testimony for the period prior to 1900. There is little or no documentary evidence in the form of maps, photographs, drawings or other materials from 1900 to 1923. There is a considerable amount of documentary material from 1923 on.\n Perhaps the most important documentary item is a map of the Forbes Bend region compiled from the field in 1923 by the United States Engineer Office at Kansas City, designated as complainant's Exhibit 46 in this record. Another map of considerable assistance, with information penciled on it by two witnesses who testified at the hearings, is complainant's Exhibit 47. This purports to show in less detail than Exhibit 46 conditions in the Bend in 1926. The witnesses' penciled additions, placing channels and other landmarks, with their testimony, give considerable information about conditions in the Bend from 1921 or 1922 on to 1926 and later. Assistance also is derived from complainant's Exhibit 56. This is an aerial survey photograph of the Forbes Bend region made in 1941, showing conditions when this suit was begun. Reference to these exhibits will be made as the testimony of some of the witnesses is referred to.\n It is clearly established that sometime around 1900, fixed by some older witnesses variously as beginning earlier and by others later, the river began a northerly and eastward movement, cutting away the Missouri bank and filling in on the Kansas bank. \n10\n Neighborhood testimony attributes the beginning of this movement to some change \n\n[322 \nU.S. 213, 221]\n\u00a0\n in conditions upstream, taking place apparently around the mouth of Wolf Creek or in Wolf Creek Bend above. \n11\n Whatever this change may have been, it apparently threw the current of the stream against the solid rock formation on what is known as Lookout Mountain. This is a point on the Kansas bluffs about a mile or a mile and a half below the mouth of Wolf Creek. The current, striking this rock with force, was thrown over to the north or Missouri bank.\n The soil composition of the north bank is a common formation in the Missouri River valley. Underneath the surface soil is sand or quicksand. This is covered by a layer of gumbo soil. Testimony in the record discloses there is no great erosion when the water is very high or very low. But when it is at an intermediate stage the water comes in contact with the underlying sand, washes it out, and the topsoil falls into the river in great chunks, often twenty feet long by ten feet wide. As the current was forced from the Kansas rock to the Missouri sand, it undercut more and more of the Missouri soil. Evidence in the record also shows that between 1900 and 1920, or a little later, from 4000 to 5000 acres of Missouri soil was washed into the river by this process. On this stood houses, barns, a school building known as the Baker schoolhouse, and other structures, which either went into the river as the soil was undermined or were moved to prevent their falling in. The Baker schoolhouse, which in 1900 was a mile or more northeast from the river bank, was moved about 1915 to prevent its going into the river. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n[322 \nU.S. 213, 222]\n\u00a0\n By that time the erosion was moving at great speed and this continued until the farthest point was reached, a half mile or less from the Burlington railroad, about 1923 to 1925.13\n The clear weight of the evidence is that there was only a single channel of the river until about 1912 or 1914. Witnesses for both Kansas and Missouri substantiate this. \n14\n The evidence also clearly establishes that there was a divided flow from 1917 or earlier to 1927. This too is substantiated by both Kansas and Missouri witnesses. \n15\n The evidence, however, is conflicting concerning when the division first took place and whether, while it remained, the Kansas channel or the Missouri channel was the main one.\n Witnesses for Missouri, and some for Kansas, testify that the division occurred before 1917 and that the two channels remained substantially equal or the Kansas channel was the larger in the volume of water carried between the time of the division and sometime between 1922 and 1927 or 1928.16 The Missouri witnesses fairly uniformly agree that the flow in the two channels was at \n\n[322 \nU.S. 213, 223]\n\u00a0\n least 'fifty-fifty' and some of them say the Kansas channel always carried the heavier volume of water. \n17\n They also generally agree that the Missouri channel began to decrease and the Kansas channel to increase in volume at some time before 1927. Some place the beginning of this process as early as 1921 or 1922.18 The evidence is substantial that the decrease in the Missouri flow and the increase in the Kansas flow began before 1927 and it is almost unanimous that from 1928 on the Missouri channel contained no current or only the flow of Mill Creek Drainage Ditch, which by that time had been diverted into the Missouri channel. Witnesses for Missouri attribute a substantial portion of the filling up of the Missouri channel to deposits made by the Mill Creek Ditch. \n19\n They agree, and the evidence for Kansas hardly contradicts this,20 that between 1928 and 1934 the Missouri channel \n\n[322 \nU.S. 213, 224]\n\u00a0\n almost completely dried up. The great preponderance of the evidence as a whole is that this occurred gradually over a period of years, varying according to different witnesses from two or three to eight or ten years.\n On the other hand, Kansas witnesses are not in accord among themselves as to what occurred in the Bend between 1912 and 1928. Some of them say there was a divided flow. \n21\n Others deny this but qualify their denials by asserting that, although the main channel of the river ran over into Missouri close to the Burlington tracks until 1927, there were chutes on the island and particularly there was one chute running from about the mouth of Mill Creek Ditch as it was in 1917 (directly across northerly from the northern end of the bar or island) due south to the Kansas bluffs at about Station 510.22 However, they maintain generally that this was a small chute, or smaller than the Missouri channel, at any rate up to 1922 or 1923. A few say it was small until 1927, when the alleged ice jam occurred. \n23\n\u00a0\n\n Some witnesses for Kansas maintain that there were big ice jams in 191724 and in 1927.25 Different witnesses testify to the two alleged jams. Those who say one occurred in 1917 assert that it threw the main flow back from the Missouri channel into the Kansas channel. Likewise some of those who say there was a jam in 1927\n\n\n\n\n[322 \nU.S. 213, 225]\n\u00a0\n accredit the same consequence to that jam. The two Kansas theories of avulsion therefore are entirely inconsistent, though each is supported by some evidence. If there was avulsion in 1917, there hardly could have been avulsion, on this record, in 1927. On the other hand, several Kansas witnesses, familiar with the territory during one or both of the two years in question, testify they saw no ice jams in those years. \n26\n Others say they saw ice but not in large or unusually large quantities or with unusual effects on the flow of the river. \n27\n Nearly all of the Missouri witnesses deny that there were ice jams either in those years or at other times, although some refer to ice in the river as not uncommon in winter or early spring. The Missouri witnesses are fairly unanimous in saying that at no time had ice conditions or others caused a sudden change in the river's course28 and in this they are supported by a number of Kansas witnesses. \n29\n\u00a0\n\n When we turn to complainant's Exhibit 46 we find very substantial support for Missouri's view that during the controverted period the flow of the river was divided and that the Kansas channel equalled or exceeded the Missouri channel in the flow or volume of water carried. This map, compiled by the Corps of Engineers of the United States Army, who had charge of the river's development, shows conditions in 1923. Two channels appear, with a large sand bar or island between them. The map places the Missouri channel within less than a half mile of the Burlington tracks. It shows a width of about 1250 feet at the narrowest point. Soundings, read from the \n\n[322 \nU.S. 213, 226]\n\u00a0\n south end of the island around the curve to its north end, disclose that the deepest water ran from point to point as follows: 15 feet, 16 feet, 25 feet, 13 feet, 14 feet. On the westerly side of the island the Kansas channel was a little wider at its narrowest point. Its soundings from south to north at appropriate intervals were 31 feet, 12 feet, 12 feet and 13 feet. The Missouri channel meandered from the south to the east and north and then back around the north end of the island or bar in a due westerly direction. On the other hand, the Kansas channel was much shorter, running straight north from the south end of the island along its western shore to its northern end. The map shows that the higher portion of the island was covered with willows and a small part at the lower end was under cultivation. Furthermore, it is significant that at the north end of the island, just opposite the mouth of Mill Creek Ditch, the water in the Missouri channel was comparatively shallow.\n Exhibit 46 furnishes the most reliable evidence in the record of conditions in Forbes Bend at a given time. If only this exhibit and the facts it discloses were considered, clearly it could not be ruled that the main navigable channel of the river was the Missouri channel. For purposes of navigation, the Kansas channel was much the shorter and more direct and, from the soundings as well as the shorter flow, it apparently carried at least an equal volume of water.\n Exhibit 47, which is described as a revision from airplane photographs shows in general a somewhat similar though less detailed picture for 1926. However, two witnesses for Kansas, Kenneth Robinson and Joseph H. Gray, who hunted in the region from 1920 to 1927 or 1928, testified concerning this exhibit and marked on it in penciled lines their recollections of the channels' respective courses in 1922. Their testimony gives perhaps the strongest support to Kansas' case that the main channel \n\n[322 \nU.S. 213, 227]\n\u00a0\n during a portion of the disputed period was on the Missouri side. But, apart from its inconsistency as to the location and direction of the Kansas chute,30 it does not accord with the more reliable evidence given concerning conditions in the Bend at the same time by complainant's Exhibit 46 and it is contradicted by numerous witnesses for Missouri as well as by some for Kansas in allocating a larger flow to the Missouri channel. It cannot therefore be accepted as controlling.\n\n\n III.\n\n\n The evidence need not be stated in further detail. In our opinion it fully supports the master's ultimate findings and conclusions. It was his view, first, that there was no avulsive change, whether in 1917, 1927, or at any time. He found there was some evidence of an ice jam in 1917 and more to substantiate such a claim for 1927. But he also found, and the evidence, though not undisputed, fully substantiates his conclusion that neither of these jams was sufficient to cause a sudden change in the river's course.\n There is very considerable doubt, on the record as a whole whether the alleged jam in 1917 occurred at all. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 213, 228]\n\u00a0\n In any event, the preponderant evidence is that it amounted to little, if anything, more than the normal piling of ice on the heads of bars and islands during the spring breakup. \n31\n There is evidence that this occurred each year. The proof therefore to sustain avulsion in 1917 is not sufficient and this phase of the case may be put aside.\n We agree with the master that the evidence to show a more unusual piling up of ice at the head of the island in 1927 is somewhat stronger. \n32\n But we also agree with him that the evidence as a whole is clearly preponderating that this did not cause an avulsive change. As has been stated, there is some evidence that the alleged 1927 jam caused the main channel of the river to shift then and suddenly from the Missouri channel to the Kansas channel as the latter flowed from 1927 or 1928 until the government's revetment work on the river forced the channel to its present location after 1935. But this is not enough to sustain Kansas' case.\n Both by virtue of her position as complainant and on the facts, Kansas has the burden of proof in this case. Cf. State of Oklahoma v. State of Texas, \n260 \nU.S. 606\n, 43 S.Ct. 221. The disputed location was in Missouri in 1900. It lies on the Missouri side now and has done so, by practically all the evidence, since at least 1927 or 1928. These facts put upon Kansas the burden of showing that in the meantime the land lay on the Kansas side of the main channel by virtue of natural changes which were effective to change the jurisdiction. Kansas has shown beyond doubt that one branch of the river eroded to a point or points north and east of this land, probably as early as 1920, possibly earlier. But beyond this fact, whether on her theory of accretion and avulsion or on that of island formation, the weight of the evidence is against her view of what occurred. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 213, 229]\n\u00a0\n Kansas' main difficulty perhaps is that by attempting to prove one theory of what happened in Forbes Bend she divides the weight of her evidence and thus goes far to disprove her other theory. To show accretion and avulsion she was required to prove that the river's main channel moved gradually from the Kansas bluffs in 1900 to the farthest erosion point in Missouri in 1927, and then suddenly shifted back to a new channel cut then through the middle of the accreted soil, leaving the old one from that time on a minor or dry one. To show sovereignty by island formation it was necessary to prove that the island formed on the Kansas side of the main channel, in which event a subsequent shift in the main flow to the other side of the island would not affect her jurisdiction,33 although Missouri's alternative contention seems to be to the contrary. \n34\n By proving the formation of the island, Kansas in effect disproves that the disputed area became accreted soil attached firmly to the Kansas bank. Her own evidence in this respect, added to that given by Missouri, far outweighs the evidence she presented to show accretion beyond where the present channel lies and creates an overwhelming preponderance that the flow was divided from 1912 or at any rate 1917 to 1927 or 1928; that the island formed in this period; and thus that the soil in question was not at any time attached firmly to the Kansas bank by accretion. If it was formed as island soil, it was not accreted soil.\n Kansas' evidence concerning the division of flow and formation of the island, together with that concerning \n\n[322 \nU.S. 213, 230]\n\u00a0\n the drying up of the Missouri channel, also proves not that the river suddenly cut a new channel through accreted soil in 1927, but that it merely shifted the volume of flow from one channel to another preexisting one. In other words it goes to disprove both accretion and avulsion. Missouri and Kansas witnesses are agreed that the main flow was in the Kansas channel from 1927 on and there is substantial agreement that by 1933 or 1935 the Missouri channel had dried up, except for the flow of Mill Creek Ditch, and largely had filled up by deposits from that stream and other forces. Missouri witnesses say this drying up began before 1927, some as early as 1922 or 1923, and therefore continued for ten or twelve years. Kansas witnesses generally say it began in 1927 and continued for from three to seven or eight years. Only a few of them say the ice jam that year cut a new channel. More testify that the main flow then shifted from one channel to the other, and some join the witnesses for Missouri in saying that this shift began earlier. Except for the few witnesses who testify to the sudden cutting of a new channel, the great weight of the testimony is that whatever change occurred in reduction of the flow in the Missouri channel required several years to complete. It was a gradual process, and therefore not the sudden shift necessary to show avulsion. We need not decide what the effect would be if the evidence had shown this was a gradual cutting of a new channel. It was at most a gradual shifting from one to another. Kansas clearly has failed to prove that there was a single channel of the river which gradually moved over to the farthest erosion point, meanwhile accreting this land to her soil, then suddenly moved back, either in 1917 or in 1927, to a new channel cut through the accreted soil. Only by accepting the evidence given by the few witnesses who supported this theory, which was contradicted both by the weight of her own evidence concerning island for- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 213, 231]\n\u00a0\n mation and by substantially all that was offered for Missouri, could a finding in Kansas' favor be made under the theory of accretion and avulsion.\n Kansas' stronger case upon the proof is on the theory of island formation. On this, as under that of accretion and avulsion, it was necessary for her to show that the Missouri channel was the river's main channel and thus the island, which is now part of the disputed land, was formed on her side of the river's thread. On this crucial issue Kansas' case is stronger perhaps than in any other respect. She presented substantial evidence to show that while the river was divided or during some part of that period, more especially from 1921 or 1922 to 1927, the Missouri channel was the main one, both in volume of water carried and, less clearyly, in availability for navigation. There is, however, at least an equal weight of evidence, given both by Missouri witnesses and by some for Kansas, that the Kansas channel remained the main navigable channel throughout the period of division.\n The evidence on this controlling issue unfortunately is not as free from conflict or doubt as we might wish. But it cannot be said, when account is taken of all the evidence, both oral and documentary, that a preponderance sustains Kansas' view that the main channel ever changed to the Missouri side. Kansas' burden required preponderant proof. She has not made it.\n As the case has been made, both the master and this Court have had to rely upon the inadequate and inconclusive documentary evidence and the conflicting and often vague recollections of neighborhood witnesses. The sum does not add up to the weight of proof Kansas was required to establish in order to prevail. The master saw and heard the witnesses. His conclusions in all respects were in favor of Missouri. We find no basis in the record for any conclusion that he performed his task with other than fair, disinterested, painstaking effort and attitude. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 213, 232]\n\u00a0\n His judgment accords with the conclusions we make from our own independent examination of the record. It is not necessary for us to decide more than that Kansas has failed to show that the main channel of the river shifted at any time in question from a course such as the river now follows, or one slightly closer to the Kansas bluffs, to one following the course of the Missouri channel when the flow was divided.\n It follows the land in dispute must be awarded to Missouri and the boundary will be fixed as the master has recommended in his report. A decree will be entered accordingly.\n Decree for defendant. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Cf. State of Missouri v. State of Kansas, \n213 \nU.S. 78\n, 29 S.Ct. 417; State of Missouri v.

This chute previously had cut across the allegedly accreted land a little to the west of where the present channel now lies. The complaint alleges that the ice jam occurred 'on or about February 1918.' The scanty testimony in the record if completely accepted would establish the ice jam in 1917 rather than in 1918; cf. note 24 infra. \n[\nFootnote 9\n] The complaint alleges that the ice jam occurred 'during the year 1927.'

A few Kansas witnesses maintain there was only one channel through this period. \n[\nFootnote 16\n] See note 14 supra. Kansas' witnesses testified variously that there always had been a channel on the Kansas side, that it was swifter than the Missouri channel (J. H. Simpson), that the Kansas channel was the 'main river' (Mrs. J. Coufal), that the Kansas channel was much the larger in 1918 (R. E. Simpson), that most of the water was on the Kansas side in 1920 (P. Bottiger); cf. C. B. Caton, that the river was just about evenly divided in 1917 (C. Baskins). Missouri witnesses said that there was always a substantial flow in the Kansas channel and that it was about as large or larger than the Missouri channel (e.g., Ralph Dyer, B. Hudgins, C. Dinwiddie, J. Fitzgerald, C. Harper, Raymond Dyer). They placed boats in the Kansas rather than the Missouri channel (E. McCoy); in 1918 (W. L. Moore); 1916 to 1929 (H. H. Hall); and in 1927 (C. Hudgins). \n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] See note 16 supra. \n[\nFootnote 18\n] W. Metcalf: 1917; W. L. Moore: 1918; C. Dinwiddie: 1920-22; C. Harrison: 1921; J. Fitzgerald: 1923-1925; cf. P.

Coufal, E. A. Cole), or 1935 or 1936 when it dried up as a result of government diking and revetment work upstream (e.g., J.

They also agreed that the Kansas channel was a chute. But they differed concerning its direction and location. Robinson placed it as running almost due south across the center of the island in a straight course. Gray placed the Kansas chute more to the west and with a curving course. Both testified that the Missouri channel was the main channel at that time. The inconsistency between Exhibit 46 and the testimony and drawings of Robinson and Gray may be accounted for in part, though not altogether, by the fact they were in the Bend for hunting and fishing purposes, chiefly in the fall, whereas Exhibit 46 was made from surveys in June and July. The difference in time, however, is hardly enough to account for the difference either in width or depth of the Kansas channel as shown by the exhibit and by their testimony. \n\n[\nFootnote 31\n] Cf. notes 27-29 supra. \n[\nFootnote 32\n] Cf. note 25 supra. \n\n[\nFootnote 33\n] State of Missouri v.

LOUISVILLE & N.R. CO.(1944)\nNo. 45\nArgued: Decided: December 18, 1944\n\n\n\n\n[323 \nU.S. 192, 193]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Charles H. Houston, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Charles H. Eyster, of Decatur, Ala., for respondent Louisville and N.R. Co.\n Mr. James A. Simpson, of Birmingham, Ala., for respondents brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen et al.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question is whether the Railway Labor Act, 48 Stat. 1185, 45 U.S. C.  151 et seq., 45 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq., imposes on a labor organi- \n\n[323 \nU.S. 192, 194]\n\u00a0\n zation, acting by authority of the statute as the exclusive bargaining representative of a craft or class of railway employees, the duty to represent all the employees in the craft without discrimination because of their race, and, if so, whether the courts have jurisdiction to protect the minority of the craft or class from the violation of such obligation.\n The issue is raised by demurrer to the substituted amended bill of complaint filed by petitioner, a locomotive fireman, in a suit brought in the Alabama Circuit Court against his employer, the Louisville & Nashville Railroad Company, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen, an unincorporated labor organization, and certain individuals representing the Brotherhood. The Circuit Court sustained the demurrer, and the Supreme Court of Alabama affirmed. 245 Ala. 113, 16 So.2d 416. We granted certiorari, \n322 \nU.S. 722\n, 64 S.Ct. 1260, the question presented being one of importance in the administration of the Railway Labor Act.\n The allegations of the bill of complaint, so far as now material, are as follows: Petitioner, a Negro, is a locomotive fireman in the employ of respondent railroad, suing on his own behalf and that of his fellow employees who, like petitioner, are Negro firemen employed by the Railroad. Respondent Brotherhood, a labor organization, is, as provided under  2, Fourth of the Railway Labor Act, the exclusive bargaining representative of the craft of firemen employed by the Railroad and is recognized as such by it and the members of the craft. The majority of the firemen employed by the Railroad are white and are members of the Brotherhood, but a substantial minority are Negroes who, by the constitution and ritual of the Brotherhood, are excluded from its membership. As the membership of the Brotherhood constitutes a majority of all firemen employed on respondent Railroad, and as under  2, Fourth, the members because they are the ma- \n\n[323 \nU.S. 192, 195]\n\u00a0\n jority have the right to choose and have chosen the Brotherhood to represent the craft, petitioner and other Negro firemen on the road have been required to accept the Brotherhood as their representative for the purposes of the Act.\n On March 28, 1940, the Brotherhood, purporting to act as representative of the entire craft of firemen, without informing the Negro firemen or giving them opportunity to be heard, served a notice on respondent Railroad and on twenty other railroads operating principally in the southeastern part of the United States. The notice announced the Brotherhood's desire to amend the existing collective bargaining agreement in such manner as ultimately to exclude all Negro firemen from the service. By established practice on the several railroads so notified only white firemen can be promoted to serve as engineers, and the notice proposed that only 'promotable', i.e., white, men should be employed as firemen or assigned to new runs or jobs or permanent vacancies in established runs or jobs.\n On February 18, 1941, the railroads and the Brotherhood, as representative of the craft, entered into a new agreement which provided that not more than 50% of the firemen in each class of service in each seniority district of a carrier should be Negroes; that until such percentage should be reached all new runs and all vacancies should be filled by white men; and that the agreement did not sanction the employment of Negroes in any seniority district in which they were not working. The agreement reserved the right of the Brotherhood to negotiate for further restrictions on the employment of Negro firemen on the individual railroads. On May 12, 1941, the Brotherhood entered into a supplemental agreement with respondent Railroad further controlling the seniority rights of Negro firemen and restricting their employment. The Negro firemen were not given notice or opportunity to be \n\n[323 \nU.S. 192, 196]\n\u00a0\n heard with respect to either of these agreements, which were put into effect before their existence was disclosed to the Negro firemen.\n Until April 8, 1941, petitioner was in a 'passenger pool', to which one white and five Negro firemen were assigned. These jobs were highly desirable in point of wages, hours and other considerations. Petitioner had performed and was performing his work satisfactorily. Following a reduction in the mileage covered by the pool, all jobs in the pool were, about April 1, 1941, declared vacant. The Brotherhood and the Railroad, acting under the agreement, disqualified all the Negro firemen and replaced them with four white men, members of the Brotherhood, all junior in seniority to petitioner and no more competent or worthy. As a consequence petitioner was deprived of employment for sixteen days and then was assigned to more arduous, longer, and less remunerative work in local freight service. In conformity to the agreement, he was later replaced by a Brotherhood member junior to him, and assigned work on a switch engine, which was still harder and less remunerative, until January 3, 1942. On that date, after the bill of complaint in the present suit had been filed, he was reassigned to passenger service.\n Protests and appeals of petitioner and his fellow Negro firemen, addressed to the Railroad and the Brotherhood, in an effort to secure relief and redress, have been ignored. Respondents have expressed their intention to enforce the agreement of February 18, 1941, and its subsequent modifications. The Brotherhood has acted and asserts the right to act as exclusive bargaining representative of the firemen's craft. It is alleged that in that capacity it is under an obligation and duty imposed by the Act to represent the Negro firemen impartially and in good faith; but instead, in its notice to and contracts with the railroads, it has been hostile and disloyal to the Negro firemen, has deliberately discriminated against them, and has sought \n\n[323 \nU.S. 192, 197]\n\u00a0\n to deprive them of their seniority rights and to drive them out of employment in their craft, all in order to create a monopoly of employment for Brotherhood members.\n The bill of complaint asks for discovery of the manner in which the agreements have been applied and in other respects; for an injunction against enforcement of the agreements made between the Railroad and the Brotherhood; for an injunction against the Brotherhood and its agents from purporting to act as representative of petitioner and others similarly situated under the Railway Labor Act, so long as the discrimination continues, and so long as it refuses to give them notice and hearing with respect to proposals affecting their interests; for a declaratory judgment as to their rights; and for an award of damages against the Brotherhood for its wrongful conduct.\n The Supreme Court of Alabama took jurisdiction of the cause but held on the merits that petitioner's complaint stated no cause of action. \n1\n It pointed out that the Act places a mandatory duty on the Railroad to treat with the Brotherhood as the exclusive representative of the employees in a craft, imposes heavy criminal penalties for willful failure to comply with its command, and provides \n\n[323 \nU.S. 192, 198]\n\u00a0\n that the majority of any craft shall have the right to determine who shall be the representative of the class for collective bargaining with the employer, see Virginian R. Co. v. System Federation, \n300 \nU.S. 515, 545\n, 57 S.Ct. 592, 598. It thought that the Brotherhood was empowered by the statute to enter into the agreement of February 18, 1941, and that by virtue of the statute the Brotherhood has power by agreement with the Railroad both to create the seniority rights of petitioner and his follow Negro employees and to destroy them. It construed the statute, not as creating the relationship of principal and agent between the members of the craft and the Brotherhood, but as conferring on the Brotherhood plenary authority to treat with the Railroad and enter into contracts fixing rates of pay and working conditions for the craft as a whole without any legal obligation or duty to protect the rights of minorities from discrimination or unfair treatment, however gross. Consequently it held that neither the Brotherhood nor the Railroad violated any rights of petitioner or his fellow Negro employees by negotiating the contracts discriminating against them.\n If, as the state court has held, the Act confers this power on the bargaining representative of a craft or class of employees without any commensurate statutory duty toward its members, constitutional questions arise. For the representative is clothed with power not unlike that of a legislature which is subject to constitutional limitations on its power to deny, restrict, destroy or discriminate against the rights of those for whom it legislates and which is also under an affirmative constitutional duty equally to protect those rights. If the Railway Labor Act purports to impose on petitioner and the other Negro members of the craft the legal duty to comply with the terms of a contract whereby the representative has discriminatorily restricted their employment for the benefit and advantage of the Brotherhood's own members, we \n\n[323 \nU.S. 192, 199]\n\u00a0\n must decide the constitutional questions which petitioner raises in his pleading.\n But we think that Congress, in enacting the Railway Labor Act and authorizing a labor union, chosen by a majority of a craft, to represent the craft, did not intend to confer plenary power upon the union to sacrifice, for the benefit of its members, rights of the minority of the craft, without imposing on it any duty to protect the minority. Since petitioner and the other Negro members of the craft are not members of the Brotherhood or eligible for membership, the authority to act for them is derived not from their action or consent but wholly from the command of the Act. Section 2, Fourth, provides: 'Employees shall have the right to organize and bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing. The majority of any craft or class of employees shall have the right to determine who shall be the representative of the craft or class for the purposes of this Act ....' Under  2, Sixth and Seventh, when the representative bargains for a change of working conditions, the latter section specifies that they are the working conditions of employees 'as a class.' Section 1, Sixth, of the Act defines 'representative' as meaning 'Any person or ... labor union ... designated either by a carrier or a group of carriers or by its or their employees, to act for it or them.' The use of the word 'representative,' as thus defined and in all the contexts in which it is found, plainly implies that the representative is to act on behalf of all the employees which, by virtue of the statute, it undertakes to represent.\n By the terms of the Act,  2, Fourth, the employees are permitted to act 'through' their representative, and it represents them 'for the purposes of' the Act. Sections 2, Third, Fourth, Ninth. The purposes of the Act declared by  2 are the avoidance of 'any interruption to commerce or to the operation of any carrier engaged therein,' and this aim is sought to be achieved by encouraging 'the \n\n[323 \nU.S. 192, 200]\n\u00a0\n prompt and orderly settlement of all disputes concerning rates of pay, rules, or working conditions.' Compare Texas & N.O.R. Co. v. Brotherhood of Railway & S. S. Clerks, \n281 \nU.S. 548, 569\n, 50 S.Ct. 427, 433. These purposes would hardly be attained if a substantial minority of the craft were denied the right to have their interests considered at the conference table and if the final result of the bargaining process were to be the sacrifice of the interests of the minority by the action of a representative chosen by the majority. The only recourse of the minority would be to strike, with the attendant interruption of commerce, which the Act seeks to avoid.\n Section 2, Second, requiring carriers to bargain with the representative so chosen, operates to exclude any other from representing a craft. Virginian R. Co. v. System Federation, supra, \n300 \nU.S. 545\n, 57 S. Ct. 598. The minority members of a craft are thus deprived by the statute of the right, which they would otherwise possess, to choose a representative of their own, and its members cannot bargain individually on behalf of themselves as to matters which are properly the subject of collective bargaining. Order of Railroad Telegraphers v. Railway Express Agency, \n321 \nU.S. 342\n, 64 S.Ct. 582, and see under the like provisions of the National Labor Relations Act J. I. Case Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, \n321 \nU.S. 332\n, 64 S.Ct. 576, and Medo Photo Supply Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board, \n321 \nU.S. 678\n, 64 S.Ct. 830.\n The labor organization chosen to be the representative of the craft or class of employees is thus chosen to represent all of its members, regardless of their union affiliations or want of them. As we have pointed out with respect to the like provision of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq., in J. I. Case Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, supra, \n321 \nU.S. 338\n, 64 S.Ct. 580, 'The very purpose of providing by statute for the collective agreement is to supersede the terms of separate agreements of employees with terms which reflect the strength and bargaining power and serve the welfare of the group. Its benefits and advantages are open to every employee of the repre- \n\n[323 \nU.S. 192, 201]\n\u00a0\n sented unit ....' The purpose of providing for a representative is to secure those benefits for those who are represented and not to deprive them or any of them of the benefits of collective bargaining for the advantage of the representative or those members of the craft who selected it.\n As the National Mediation Board said in In The Matter of Representation of Employees of the St. Paul Union Depot Company, Case No. R-635: 'Once a craft or class has designated its representative, such representative is responsible under the law to act for all employees within the craft or class, those who are not members of the represented organizations, as well as those who are members.' \n2\n\u00a0\n\n Unless the labor union representing a craft owes some duty to represent non-union members of the craft, at least to the extent of not discriminating against them as such in the contracts which it makes as their representative, the minority would be left with no means of protecting their intersts, or indeed, their right to earn a livelihood by pursuing the occupation in which they are employed. \n\n[323 \nU.S. 192, 202]\n\u00a0\n While the majority of the craft chooses the bargaining representative, when chosen it represents, as the Act by its terms makes plain, the craft or class, and not the majority. The fair interpretation of the statutory language is that the organization chosen to represent a craft is to represent all its members, the majority as well as the minority, and it is to act for and not against those whom it represents. \n3\n It is a principle of general application that the exercise of a granted power to act in behalf of others involves the assumption toward them of a duty to exercise the power in their interest and behalf, and that such a grant of power will not be deemed to dispense with all duty toward those for whom it is exercised unless so expressed.\n We think that the Railway Labor Act imposes upon the statutory representative of a craft at least as exacting a duty to protect equally the interests of the members of the craft as the Constitution imposes upon a legislature to give equal protection to the interests of those for whom it legislates. Congress has seen fit to clothe the bargaining representative with powers comparable to those possessed by a legislative body both to create and restrict the rights of those whom it represents, cf. J.I. Case Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, supra, \n321 \nU.S. 335\n, 64 S.Ct. 579, but it has also imposed on the representative a corresponding duty. We hold that the language of the Act to which we have referred, read in the light of the purposes of the Act, expresses the aim of Congress to impose on the bargaining representative of a craft \n\n[323 \nU.S. 192, 203]\n\u00a0\n or class of employees the duty to exercise fairly the power conferred upon it in behalf of all those for whom it acts, without hostile discrimination against them.\n This does not mean that the statutory representative of a craft is barred from making contracts which may have unfavorable effects on some of the members of the craft represented. Variations in the terms of the contract based on differences relevant to the authorized purposes of the contract in conditions to which they are to be applied, such as differences in seniority, the type of work performed, the competence and skill with which it is performed, are within the scope of the bargaining representation of a craft, all of whose members are not identical in their interest or merit. Cf. Carmichael v. Southern Coal & Coke Co., \n301 \nU.S. 495, 509\n, 510 S., 512, 57 S.Ct. 868, 872, 873, 874, 109 A.L.R. 1327, and cases cited; State of Washington v. Superior Court, \n289 \nU.S. 361, 366\n, 53 S.Ct. 624, 627, 89 A.L.R. 653; Metropolitan Casualty Ins. Co. v. Brownell, \n294 \nU.S. 580, 583\n, 55 S.Ct. 538, 540. Without attempting to mark the allowable limits of differences in the terms of contracts based on differences of conditions to which they apply, it is enough for present purposes to say that the statutory power to represent a craft and to make contracts as to wages, hours and working conditions does not include the authority to make among members of the craft discriminations not based on such relevant differences. Here the discriminations based on race alone are obviously irrelevant and invidious. Congress plainly did not undertake to authorize the bargaining representative to make such discriminations. Cf. Yick Wo v. Hopkins, \n118 \nU.S. 356\n, 6 S.Ct. 1064; Yu Cong Eng v. Trinidad, \n271 \nU.S. 500\n, 46 S.Ct. 619; State of Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada, \n305 \nU.S. 337\n, 59 S.Ct. 232; Hill v. Texas, \n316 \nU.S. 400\n, 62 S.Ct. 1159\n\n\n The representative which thus discriminates may be enjoined from so doing, and its members may be enjoined from taking the benefit of such discriminatory action. No more is the Railroad bound by or entitled to take the benefit of a contract which the bargaining representative \n\n[323 \nU.S. 192, 204]\n\u00a0\n is prohibited by the statute from making. In both cases the right asserted, which is derived from the duty imposed by the statute on the bargaining representative, is a federal right implied from the statute and the policy which it has adopted. It is the federal statute which condemns as unlawful the Brotherhood's conduct. 'The extent and nature of the legal consequences of this condemnation, though left by the statute to judicial determination, are nevertheless to be derived from it and the federal policy which it has adopted.' Deitrick v. Greaney, \n309 \nU.S. 190, 200\n, 201 S., 60 S.Ct. 480, 485; Board of Commissioners of Jackson County v. United States, \n308 \nU.S. 343\n, 60 S.Ct. 285; Sola Electric Co. v. Jefferson Electric Co., \n317 \nU.S. 173, 176\n, 177 S., 63 S.Ct. 172, 173, 174; cf. Clearfield Trust Co. v. United States, \n318 \nU.S. 363\n, 63 S.Ct. 573.\n So long as a labor union assumes to act as the statutory representative of a craft, it cannot rightly refuse to perform the duty, which is inseparable from the power of representation conferred upon it, to represent the entire membership of the craft. While the statute does not deny to such a bargaining labor organization the right to determine eligibility to its membership, it does require the union, in collective bargaining and in making contracts with the carrier, to represent non- union or minority union members of the craft without hostile discrimination, fairly, impartially, and in good faith. Wherever necessary to that end, the union is required to consider requests of non-union members of the craft and expressions of their views with respect to collective bargaining with the employer and to give to them notice of and opportunity for hearing upon its proposed action.\n Since the right asserted by petitioner 'is ... claimed ... under the Constitution' and a 'statute of the United States', the decision of the Alabama court adverse to that contention is reviewable here under  237(b) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.A.  344(b), unless the Railway Labor Act itself has excluded petitioner's claims from judicial consideration. The ques- \n\n[323 \nU.S. 192, 205]\n\u00a0\n tion here presented is not one of a jurisdictional dispute, determinable under the administrative scheme set up by the Act, cf. Switchmen's Union v. National Mediation Board, \n320 \nU.S. 297\n, 64 S.Ct. 95; General Committee v. Missouri-Kansas-Texas R. Co., \n320 \nU.S. 323\n, 64 S.Ct. 146; General Committee v. Southern Pacific Co., \n320 \nU.S. 338\n, 64 S.Ct. 142; Brotherhood of Railway & Steamship Clerks v. United Transport Service Employees, \n320 \nU.S. 715\n, 64 S.Ct. 260; Id., \n320 \nU.S. 816\n, 64 S.Ct. 435, or restricted by the Act to voluntary settlement by recourse to the traditional implements of mediation, conciliation and arbitration. General Committee v. Missouri- Kansas-Texas R. Co., supra, \n320 \nU.S. 332, 337\n, 64 S.Ct. 150, 153. There is no question here of who is entitled to represent the craft, or who are members of it, issues which have been relegated for settlement to the Mediation Board, Switchmen's Union v. National Mediation Board, supra; General Committee v. Missouri-Kansas-Texas R Co., supra. Nor are there differences as to the interpretation of the contract which by the Act are committed to the jurisdiction of the Railroad Adjustment Board.\n Section 3, First [i], which provides for reference to the Adjustment Board of 'disputes between an employee or group of employees and a carrier or carriers growing out of grievances or out of the interpretation or application of agreements', makes no reference to disputes between employees and their representative. Even though the dispute between the railroad and the petitioner were to be heard by the Adjustment Board, that Board could not give the entire relief here sought. The Adjustment Board has consistently declined in more than 400 cases to entertain grievance complaints by individual members of a craft represented by a labor organization. 'The only way that an individual may prevail is by taking his case to the union and causing the union to carry it through to the Board.' Administrative Procedure in Government Agencies, S. Doc. No. 10, 77th Cong., 1st Sess., Pt. 4, p. 7. Whether or not judicial power might be exerted to require the Adjustment Board to consider individual grievances, \n\n[323 \nU.S. 192, 206]\n\u00a0\n as to which we express no opinion, we cannot say that there is an administrative remedy available to petitioner or that resort to such proceedings in order to secure a possible administrative remedy, which is withheld or denied, is prerequisite to relief in equity. Further, since  3, First (c), permits the national labor organizations chosen by the majority of the crafts to 'prescribe the rules under which the labor members of the Adjustment Board shall be selected' and to 'select such members and designate the division on which each member shall serve', the Negro firemen would be required to appear before a group which is in large part chosen by the respondents against whom their real complaint is made. In addition  3, Second, provides that a carrier and a class or craft of employees, 'all acting through their representatives, selected in accordance with the provisions of this Act', may agree to the establishment of a regional board of adjustment for the purpose of adjusting disputes of the type which may be brought before the Adjustment Board. In this way the carrier and the representative against whom the Negro firemen have complained have power to supersede entirely the Adjustment Board's procedure and to create a tribunal of their own selection to interpret and apply the agreements now complained of to which they are the only parties. We cannot say that a hearing, if available, before either of these tribunals would constitute an adequate administrative remedy. Cf. Tumey v. Ohio, \n273 \nU.S. 510\n, 47 S.Ct. 437, 50 A.L.R. 1243. There is no administrative means by which the Negro firemen can secure separate representation for the purposes of collective bargaining. For the Mediation Board 'has definitely ruled that a craft or class of employees may not be divided into two or more on the basis of race or color for the purpose of choosing representatives.' \n4\n\u00a0\n\n[323 \nU.S. 192, 207]\n\u00a0\n In the absence of any available administrative remedy, the right here asserted, to a remedy for breach of the statutory duty of the bargaining representative to represent and act for the members of a craft, is of judicial cognizance. That right would be sacrificed or obliterated if it were without the remedy which courts can give for breach of such a duty or obligation and which it is their duty to give in cases in which they have jurisdiction. Switchmen's Union v. National Mediation Board, supra, \n320 \nU.S. 300\n, 64 S.Ct. 97; Stark v. Wickard, \n321 \nU.S. 288, 306\n, 307 S., 64 S.Ct. 559, 569, 570. Here, unlike General Committee v. Missouri-Kansas-Texas R. Co., supra, and General Committee v. Southern Pacific Co., supra, there can be no doubt of the justiciability of these claims. As we noted in General Committee v. Missouri-Kansas-Texas R. Co., supra, \n320 \nU.S. 331\n, 64 S.Ct. 150, the statutory provisions which are in issue are stated in the form of commands. For the present command there is no mode of enforcement other than resort to the courts, whose jurisdiction and duty to afford a remedy for a breach of statutory duty are left unaffected. The right is analogous to the statutory right of employees to require the employer to bargain with the statutory representative of a craft, a right which this Court has enforced and protected by its injunction in Texas & N.O.R. Co. v. Brotherhood of Railway & S. S. Clerks, supra, \n281 \nU.S. 556, 557\n, 560 S., 50 S. Ct. 429, 430, and in Virginian R. Co. v. System Federation, supra, \n300 \nU.S. 548\n, 57 S.Ct. 599, and like it is one for which there is no available administrative remedy.\n We conclude that the duty which the statute imposes on a union representative of a craft to represent the interests of all its members stands on no different footing and that the statute contemplates resort to the usual judicial remedies of injunction and award of damages when appropriate for breach of that duty. \n\n[323 \nU.S. 192, 208]\n\u00a0\n The judgment is accordingly reversed and remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice BLACK concurs in the result.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY, concurring.\n The economic discrimination against Negroes practiced by the Brotherhood and the railroad under color of Congressional authority raises a grave constitutional issue that should be squarely faced.\n The utter disregard for the dignity and the well-being of colored citizens shown by this record is so pronounced as to demand the invocation of constitutional condemnation. To decide the case and to analyze the statute solely upon the basis of legal niceties, while remaining mute and placid as to the obvious and oppressive deprivation of constitutional guarantees, is to make the judicial function something less than it should be.\n The constitutional problem inherent in this instance is clear. Congress, through the Railway Labor Act, has conferred upon the union selected by a majority of a craft or class of railway workers the power to represent the entire craft or class in all collective bargaining matters. While such a union is essentially a private organization, its power to represent and bind all members of a class or craft is derived solely from Congress. The Act contains no language which directs the manner in which the bargaining representative shall perform its duties. But it cannot be assumed that Congress meant to authorize the representative to act so as to ignore rights guaranteed by the Constitution. Otherwise the Act would bear the stigma of unconstitutionality under the Fifth Amendment in this respect. For that reason I am willing to read the statute as not permitting or allowing any action by the \n\n[323 \nU.S. 192, 209]\n\u00a0\n bargaining representative in the exercise of its delegated powers which would in effect violate the constitutional rights of individuals.\n If the Court's construction of the statute rests upon this basis, I agree. But I am not sure that such is the basis. Suffice it to say, however, that this constitutional issue cannot be lightly dismissed. The cloak of racism surrounding the actions of the Brotherhood in refusing membership to Negroes and in entering into and enforcing agreements discriminating against them, all under the guise of Congressional authority, still remains. No statutory interpretation can erase this ugly example of economic cruelty against colored citizens of the United States. Nothing can destroy the fact that the accident of birth has been used as the basis to abuse individual rights by an organization purporting to act in conformity with its Congressional mandate. Any attempt to interpret the Act must take that fact into account and must realize that the constitutionality of the statute in this respect depends upon the answer given.\n The Constitution voices its disapproval whenever economic discrimination is applied under authority of law against any race, creed or color. A sound democracy cannot allow such discrimination to go unchallenged. Racism is far too virulent today to permit the slightest refusal, in the light of a Constitution that abhors it, to expose and condemn it wherever it appears in the course of a statutory interpretation. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The respondents urge that the Circuit Court sustained their demurrers on the ground that the suit could not be maintained against the Brotherhood, an unincorporated association, since by Alabama statute such an association cannot be sued unless the action lies against all its members individually, and on several other state-law grounds. They argue accordingly that the judgment of affirmance of the state Supreme Court may be rested on an adequate non-federal ground. As that court specifically rested its decision on the sole ground that the Railway Labor Act places no duty upon the Brotherhood to protect petitioner and other Negro firemen from the alleged discriminatory treatment, the judgment rests wholly on a federal ground, to which we confine our review.

The Court of Appeals was of the opinion that a representative is not only required to act in behalf of all the employees in a bargaining unit, but that a labor organization which excludes a minority of a craft from its membership has no standing to act as such representative of the minority.\n The Act has been similarly interpreted by the Emergency Board referred to in General Committee v. Southern Pacific Co., \n320 \nU.S. 338, 340\n, 342 S., 343, 64 S.Ct. 142, 143, 144, 145, note.

Horton, of Peoria, Ill., for respondent. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 29, 30]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This action was instituted by petitioner, who is the administratrix of the estate and the widow of the deceased Harold C. Tennant, under the Federal Employers' Liability Act. \n1\n Recovery was sought for the alleged wrongful death of Tennant during the course of his employment as a member of a switching crew in one of respondent's railroad switching yards. The case was submitted to a jury, which returned a verdict in favor of petitioner and awarded her damages of $26,250. The District Court entered judgment accordingly. On appeal by respondent, the court below reversed this judgment after finding that, while there was evidence of negligence by respondent, there was no substantial proof that this negligence was the proximate cause of Tennant's death. 134 F.2d 860. It held that the District Court should have directed a verdict in favor of respondent or allowed its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. We granted certiorari because of important problems as to petitioner's right to a jury determination of the issue of causation.\n Tennant was employed as a switchman in the 'B' yard of respondent's switching yards in East Peoria, Illinois. He had worked there for several years and had been attached to the particular five-man switching crew for several months prior to the fatal accident. On the night of July 12, 1940, this crew was engaged in one of its nightly tasks of coupling freight cars and removing them from track B-28. The electric Diesel engine used by the crew was brought down from the north through divide switch B-28 and onto track B-28, which extended straight north and south. The front or pilot end of the engine was headed south. There were about twenty cars in various \n\n[321 \nU.S. 29, 31]\n\u00a0\n groups on track B-28 at that time; they were to be coupled together and moved northward out of track B-28 to other locations.\n In the course of these coupling operations, the engine stopped and started six or eight times, gradually moving southward. After all twenty cars had been coupled, the engine remained statinary for five or ten minutes before the engineer received the backup signal from Harkless, the foreman. The engineer testified that the engine at this point was standing about 5 or 6 car lengths south of switch B-28, a car length approximately forty feet. There was other testimony, however, indicating that the engine was seven or eight car lengths south of the switch. While thus waiting for the backup signal, the engineer saw Tennant on the west side of the engine placing his raincoat in a clothes compartment beneath the cab window. After putting on a cap and jacket he walked around the north or rear end of the engine and was never seen alive after that.\n There was no direct evidence as to Tennant's precise location at the moment he was killed. There was some evidence to indicate that he never walked back on either side of the engine. It was his duty as a switchman or pin-puller to stay ahead of the engine as it moved back out of track B- 28, protect it from other train movements, and attend to the switches.\n The engine then pulled the twenty cars out of track B-28. The fact that Tennant was missing was first noticed when the engine reached a point some distance north of switch B-28. An investigation revealed blood marks on the west rail of track B-28 some 315 feet, or about seven or eight car lengths, south of switch B-28. There was a pool of blood a foot and a half north of those marks; near by, between the rails, were Tennant's right hand, his cap and his lighted lantern. His body was found at switch B-28, while his head was discovered \n\n[321 \nU.S. 29, 32]\n\u00a0\n about fourteen car lengths north and west of that switch. An examination of the engine and cars disclosed only a tiny bit of flesh on the outside rim of the north wheel of the third car from the engine. There was no evidence of his having slipped or fallen from any part of the engine or cars.\n The case was submitted to the jury on the allegation that Tennant's death resulted from respondent's negligence, in that its engineer backed the engine and cars northward out of track B-28 without first ringing the engine bell. The failure to ring the bell, which was not disputed, was alleged to be in violation of Rule 30 of respondent's rules for its employees. This rule provides that 'The engine bell must be rung when an engine is about to move and while approaching and passing public crossings at grades, and to prevent accidents.' There was conflicting evidence as to whether this rule was for the benefit of crew members who presumably were aware of switching operations and as to whether it was a customary practice for the bell to be rung under such circumstances. In addition, respondent placed great reliance on the provision of Rule 32 that 'The unnecessary use of either the whistle or the bell is prohibited.' This was said to demonstrate that the bell should not have been rung on this occasion.\n In order to recover under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, it was incumbent upon petitioner to prove that respondent was negligent and that such negligence was the proximate cause in whole or in part of the fatal accident. Tiller v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., \n318 \nU.S. 54, 67\n, 63 S.Ct. 444, 451, 143 A.L.R. 967. Petitioner was required to present probative facts from which the negligence and the causal relation could reasonably be inferred. 'The essential requirement is that mere speculation be not allowed to do duty for probative facts after making due allowance for all reasonably \n\n[321 \nU.S. 29, 33]\n\u00a0\n possible inferences favoring the party whose case is attacked.' Galloway v. United States, \n319 \nU.S. 372, 395\n, 63 S.Ct. 1077, 1089; Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe R. Co. v. Toops, \n281 \nU.S. 351\n, 50 S.Ct. 281. If that requirement is met, as we believe it was in this case, the issues may properly be presented to the jury. No court is then justified in substituting its conclusions for those of the twelve jurors.\n As to the proof of negligence, the court below correctly held that it was sufficient to present a jury question. In view of respondent's own rule that a bell must be rung 'when an engine is about to move,' it was not unreasonable for the jury to conclude that the failure to ring the bell under these circumstances constituted negligence. This was not an operation where bell ringing might be termed unnecessary or indiscriminate as a matter of law. Cf. Aerkfetz v. Humphreys, \n145 \nU.S. 418, 420\n, 12 S.Ct. 835, 836; Toledo, St. L. & W.R.R. v. Allen, \n276 \nU.S. 165, 171\n, 48 S.Ct. 215, 217. The engine had remained stationary for several minutes, during which the engineer saw Tennant disappear in the direction of the subsequent engine movement. Still not knowing the precise whereabouts of Tennant, the engineer then caused the engine and cars to make an extended backward movement. Such a movement without a warning, was clearly dangerous to life and limb. New York Central R. Co. v. Marcone, \n281 \nU.S. 345, 349\n, 50 S.Ct. 294, 295. There was ample though conflicting evidence that respondent's written rule, as well as the practice and custom, required the ringing of the engine bell in just such a situation. We cannot say, therefore, that the jury's concurrence in that view was unjustified.\n The court below erred, however, in holding that there was not sufficient proof to support the charge that respondent's negligence in failing to ring the bell was the proximate cause of Tennant's death. The absence of eye witnesses was not decisive. There was testimony that \n\n[321 \nU.S. 29, 34]\n\u00a0\n his duties included staying near the north or rear end of the engine as it made its backward movement out of track B-28. The location of his severed hand, cap, lantern and the pool of blood was strong evidence that the was killed approximately at the point where the engine began this backward movement and where he might have been located in the performance of his duties. To this evidence must be added the presumption that the deceased was actually engaged in the performance of those duties an exercised due care for his own safety at the time of his death. Looney v. Metropolitan R. Co., \n200 \nU.S. 480, 488\n, 26 S.Ct. 303, 306; Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe R. Co. v. Toops, supra, \n281 \nU.S. 356\n, 50 S.Ct. 283; New Aetna Portland Cement Co. v. Hatt, 6 Cir., 231 F. 611, 617. In addition, the evidence relating to the rule and custom of ringing a bell 'when an engine is about to move' warranted a finding that Tennant was entitled to rely on such a warning under these circumstances. The ultimate inference that Tennant would not have been killed but for the failure to warn him is therefore supportable. The ringing of the bell might well have saved his life. The jury could thus find that respondent was liable 'for ... death resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the ... employees.' \n2\n\u00a0\n\n In holding that there was no evidence upon which to base the jury's inference as to causation, the court below emphasized other inferences which are suggested by the conflicting evidence. Thus it was said to be unreasonable to assume that Tennant was standing on the track north of the engine in the performance of his duties. It seemed more probable to the court that he seated himself on the footboard of the engine and fell asleep. Or he may have walked back unnoticed to a point south of the engine and been killed while trying to climb through the cars to the other side of the track. These and other possibilities sug- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 29, 35]\n\u00a0\n gested by diligent counsel for respondent all suffer from the same lack of direct proof as characterizes the one adopted by the jury. But to the extent that they involve a disobedience of duty by Tennant no presumption in their favor exists. Nor can any possible assumption of risk or contributory negligence on Tennant's part be presumed in order to negate an inference that death was due to respondent's negligence.\n It is not the function of a court to search the record for conflicting circumstantial evidence in order to take the case away from the jury on a theory that the proof gives equal support to inconsistent and uncertain inferences. The focal point of judicial review is the reasonableness of the particular inference or conclusion drawn by the jury. It is the jury, not the court, which is the fact-finding body. It weighs the contradictory evidence and inferences, judges the credibility of witnesses, receives expert instructions, and draws the ultimate conclusion as to the facts. The very essence of its function is to select from among conflicting inferences and conclusions that which it considers most reasonable. Washington & Georgetown R. Co. v. McDade, \n135 \nU.S. 554, 571\n, 572 S., 10 S.Ct. 1044, 1049; Tiller v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., supra, \n318 \nU.S. 68\n, 63 S.Ct. 451, 143 A.L.R. 967; Bailey v. Central Vermont Ry., \n319 \nU.S. 350, 353\n, 354 S., 63 S.Ct. 1062, 1064. That conclusion, whether it relates to neglilgence, causation or any other factual matter, cannot be ignored. Courts are not free to reweigh the evidence and set aside the jury verdict merely because the jury could have drawn different inferences or conclusions or because judges feel that other results are more reasonable.\n Upon an examination of the record we cannot say that the inference drawn by this jury that respondent's negligence caused the fatal accident is without support in the evidence. Thus to enter a judgment for respondent notwithstanding the verdict is to deprive petitioner of the right to a jury trial. No reason is apparent why we should abdicate our duty to protect and guard that right in this \n\n[321 \nU.S. 29, 36]\n\u00a0\n case. We accordingly reverse the judgment of the court below the remand the case to it for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER and Mr. Justice JACKSON concur in the result.\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE and Mr. Justice ROBERTS are of opinion that the judgment should be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 35 Stat. 65, as amended, 36 Stat. 291, 53 Stat. 1404, 45 U.S.C.  51 et seq., 45 U.S.C.A.  51 et seq. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See note 1, supra. \n\n\n\n\n","103":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTENNESSEE COAL, IRON & R.

Such an issue can be resolved only by discarding formalities and adopting a realistic attitude, recognizing that we are dealing with human beings and with a statute that is intended to secure to them the fruits of their toil and exertion.\n Three iron ore mining companies, petitioners herein, filed declaratory judgment actions1 to determine whether time spent by iron ore miners in traveling underground in mines to and from the 'working face'2 constitutes work or employment for which compensation must be paid under the Act.

The actual controversy relates only to the hours of employment during the period intervening between the effective date of the Act, October 24, 1938, and the dates when the respective actions were initiated in April, 1941.3 It is \n\n[321 \nU.S. 590, 593]\n\u00a0\n conceded that if underground travel constitutes employment, the miners worked more than the statutory maximum workweek and are entitled to be paid one and one-half times the regular rate for the excess hours. But if the travel time is excluded from the workweek, thus limiting it to the time spent at the working face, no overtime payments are due.\n After extended hearings, the District Court found that the travel time 'bears in a substantial degree every indicia of worktime: supervision by the employer, physical and mental exertion, activity necessary to be performed for the employers' benefit, and conditions peculiar to the occupation of mining.' (40 F.Supp. 4, 10.) The court accordingly ruled that the travel time, as well as the time spent at the surface obtaining and returning tools, lamps and carbide and checking in and out, was included within the workweek. 40 F.Supp. 4. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed as to the travel time, holding that the District Court's findings on that matter were supported by substantial evidence. The judgment was modified by the Circuit Court, however, by excluding from the workweek the time spent in the activities at the surface. 5 Cir., 135 F.2d 320, rehearing denied 5 Cir., 137 F.2d 176. The importance of the problem as to the travel time led us to grant certiorari. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n Specifically we are called upon to decide whether the District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals properly found that iron ore miners were at work within the meaning of the Act while engaged in underground travel which they were obliged to perform on the property of and under the direction of petitioners as a necessary concomitant of their employment. The record shows that petitioners own and operate twelve underground iron ore \n\n[321 \nU.S. 590, 594]\n\u00a0\n mines in Jefferson County, Alabama,5 and that the general pattern of facts underlying the findings of the courts below is essentially the same in each of these mines. \n 6\n\u00a0\n\n The miners begin their day by arriving on the company property at a scheduled hour7 and going to the bath house, where they change into working clothes. 8 They then walk to the tally house near the mine entrance or portal; there they check in and hang up individual brass checks, furnished by petitioners, on a tally or check-in board. This enables the foreman and other officials to tell at a glance those individuals who have reported for work and those production and service crews that are incomplete and in need of substitutes. Vacancies are filled and the head miners and crews receive any necessary instructions. In addition, each miner either rents a battery lamp for the day or buys a can of carbide each day or two for underground illumination purposes. And at some of the mines, \n\n[321 \nU.S. 590, 595]\n\u00a0\n many miners stop at a tool box or tool house on the surface to pick up other small supplies and tools necessary for their work. These activities consume but a few minutes.\n The miners thereupon are required to report at the loading platform at the mine portal and await their turn to ride down the inclined shafts of the mines. Originally the miners could reach the working faces entirely by foot, but as the shafts increased in length petitioners provided transportation down the main shafts. The miners accordingly ride part of the way to the working faces in ore skips9 or regular man trips,10 which operate on narrow gauge tracks by means of cables or hoisting ropes. The operation of the skips and man trips is under the strict control and supervision of the petitioners at all times and they refuse to permit the miners to walk rather than ride. Regular schedules are fixed; loading and unloading are supervised; the speed of the trips is regulated; and the conduct of the miners during the rides is prescribed.\n About three to six trips are made, depending on the size of the mine and the number of miners. Ten men sit on each man trip car, while from 30 to 40 are crowded into an ore skip. They are forced to jump several feet into the skip from the loading platform, which not infrequently causes injuries to ankles, feet and hands. The skips are usually overcrowded and the men stand tightly pressed together. The heads of most of them are a foot or more \n\n[321 \nU.S. 590, 596]\n\u00a0\n above the top of the skips. But since the skips usually clear the low mine ceilings by only a few inches, the miners are compelled to bend over. They thus ride in a close 'spoon-fashion,' with bodies contorted and heads drawn below the level of the skip top. Broken ribs, injured arms and legs, and bloody heads often result; even fatalities are not unknown.\n The length of the rides in the dark, moist, malodorous shafts varies in the different mines from 3,000 feet to 12,000 feet. The miners then climb out of the skips and man trips at the underground man-loading platforms or 'hoodlums' and continue their journeys on foot for distances up to two miles. These subterranean walks are filled with discomforts and hidden perils. The surroundings are dark and dank. The air is increasingly warm and humid, the ventilation poor. Odors of human sewage, resulting from a complete absence of sanitary facilities, permeate the atmosphere. Rotting mine timbers add to the befouling of the air. Many of the passages are level, but others take the form of tunnels and steep grades. Water, muck and stray pieces of ore often make the footing uncertain. Low ceilings must be ducked and moving ore skips must be avoided. Overhead, a maze of water and air pipe lines, telephone wires, and exposed high voltage electric cables and wires present everdangerous obstacles, especially to those transporting tools. At all times the miners are subject to the hazards of falling rocks.\n Moreover, most of the working equipment, except drills and heavy supplies, is kept near the 'hoodlums.' This equipment is carried each day by foot by the crews through these perilous paths from the 'hoodlums' to the working faces. Included are such items as fifty-pound sacks of dynamite, dynamite caps, fuses, gallon cans of oil and servicemen's supplies. Actual drilling and loading of the ore begin on arrival at the working faces, interrupted only by a thirty minute lunch period spent at or near the faces. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 590, 597]\n\u00a0\n The service and maintenance men, of course, work wherever they are needed.\n At the end of the day's duties at the working faces, the miners lay down their drills, pick up their other equipment and retrace their steps back to the 'hoodlums.' They wait there until an ore skip or man trip is available to transport them back to the portal. After arriving on the surface, they return their small tools and lamps, pick up their brass checks at the tally house, and proceed to bathe and change their clothes at the bath house. Finally they leave petitioners' property and return to their homes.\n In determining whether this underground travel constitutes compensable work or employment within the meaning of the Fair Labor Standards Act, we are not guided by any precise statutory definition of work or employment. Section 7(a) merely provides that no one, who is engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce, shall be employed for a workweek longer than the prescribed hours unless compensation is paid for the excess hours at a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate. Section 3(g) defines the word 'employ' to include 'to suffer or permit to work,' while Section 3(j) states that 'production' includes 'any process or occupation necessary to ... production.'\n But these provisions, like the other portions of the Fair Labor Standards Act, are remedial and humanitarian in purpose. We are not here dealing with mere chattels or articles of trade but with the rights of those who toil, of those who sacrifice a full measure of their freedom and talents to the use and profit of others. Those are the rights that Congress has specially legislated to protect. Such a statute must not be interpreted or applied in a narrow, grudging manner. Accordingly we view Sections 7(a), 3(g) and 3(j) of the Act as necessarily indicative of a Congressional intention to guarantee eigher regular or overtime compensation for all actual work or employ- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 590, 598]\n\u00a0\n ment. To hold that an employer may validly compensate his employees for only a fraction of the time consumed in actual labor would be inconsistent with the very purpose and structure of those sections of the Act. It is vital, of course, to determine first the extent of the actual workweek. Only after this is done can the minimum wage and maximum hour requirements of the Act be effectively applied. And, in the absence of a contrary legislative expression, we cannot assume that Congress here was referring to work or employment other than as those words are commonly used-as meaning physical or mental exertion (whether burdensome or not) controlled or required by the employer and pursued necessarily and primarily for the benefit of the employer and his business. \n 11\n\u00a0\n\n Viewing the facts of this case as found by both courts below in the light of the foregoing considerations, we are unwilling to conclude that the underground travel in petitioners' iron ore mines cannot be construed as work or employment within the meaning of the Act. The exacting and dangerous conditions in the mine shafts stand as mute, unanswerable proof that the journey from and to the portal involves continuous physical and mental exertion as well as hazards to life and limb. And this compulsory travel occurs entirely on petitioners' property and is at all times under their strict control and supervision. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 590, 599]\n\u00a0\n Such travel, furthermore, is not primarily undertaken for the convenience of the miners and bears no relation whatever to their needs or to the distance between their homes and the mines. \n12\n Rather the travel time is spent for the benefit of petitioners and their iron ore mining operations. The extraction of ore from these mines by its very nature necessitates dangerous travel in petitioners' underground shafts in order to reach the working faces, where production actually occurs. Such hazardous travel is thus essential to petitioners' production. It matters not that such travel is, in a strict sense, a non-productive benefit. Nothing in the statute or in reason demands that every moment of an employee's time devoted to the service of his employer shall be directly productive. Section 3(j) of the Act expressly provides that it is sufficient if an employee is engaged in a process or occupation necessary to production. Hence employees engaged in such necessary but not directly productive activities as watching and guarding a building,13 waiting for work,14 and standing by on call15 have been held to be engaged in work necessary to production and entitled to the benefits of the Act. Iron ore miners travelling underground are no less engaged in a 'process or occupation' necessary to actual production. They do more than 'stand and wait,' Missouri, K. & T.R. Co. v. United States, \n231 \nU.S. 112, 119\n, 34 S. Ct. 26, 27. Cf. Bountiful Brick Co. v. Giles, \n276 \nU.S. 154, 158\n, 48 S.Ct. 221, 222, 66 A.L.R. 1402. Theirs is a fossorial activity bearing all the indicia of hard labor. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 590, 600]\n\u00a0\n The conclusion that underground travel in iron ore mines is work has also been reached by the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division. On March 17, 1941, he approved an informal report of his representative based upon an investigation of the 'hours worked' in underground metal mines in the United States. The report concluded, in part, that 'The workday in underground metal mining starts when the miner reports for duty as required at or near the collar (portal) of the mine and ends when he reaches the collar at the end of the shift.' See also Sunshine Mining Co. v. Carver, D.C., 41 F.Supp. 60. In addition, statutes of several important metal mining states provide that the eight-hour per day limitation upon work includes travel underground. \n16\n\u00a0\n\n Petitioners, however, rely mainly upon the alleged 'immemorial custom and agreements arrived at by the practice of collective bargaining' which are said to establish 'the 'face to face' method as the standard and measure \n\n[321 \nU.S. 590, 601]\n\u00a0\n for computing working time in the iron ore industry.' They further claim that since the Fair Labor Standards Act contains no specific provision regarding underground travel in mines, Congress must be presumed to have intended to perpetuate existing customs or to leave the matter to be worked out through the process of collective bargaining.\n The short answer is that the District Court was unable to find from the evidence that any such 'immemorial' custom or collective bargaining agreements existed. That court, in making its findings, properly directed its attention solely to the evidence concerning petitioners' iron ore mines and disregarded the customs and contracts in the coal mining industry. There was ample evidence that prior to the crucial date of the enactment of the statute, the provisions in petitioners' contracts with their employees relating to a forty hour workweek 'at the usual working place' bore no relation to the amount of time actually worked or the compensation received. Instead, working time and payment appear to have been related to the amount of iron ore mined each day. Hence such contract provisions defining the workweek are of little if any value in determining the workweek and compensation under a statute which requires that they be directly related to the actual work performed.\n Likewise there was substantial, if not conclusive, evidence that prior to 1938 petitioners recognized no independent labor unions and engaged in no bona fide collective bargaining with an eye toward reaching agreements on the workweek. Contracts with company-nominated unions and discriminatory actions toward the independent unions are poor substitutes for 'contracts fairly arrived at through the process of collective bargaining.' The wage payments and work on a tonnage basis, as well as the contract provisions as to the workweek, were all dictated by petitioners. The futile efforts by the miners \n\n[321 \nU.S. 590, 602]\n\u00a0\n to secure at least partial compensation for their travel time and their dissatisfaction with existing arrangments, moreover, negative the conclusion that there was any real custom as to the workweek and compensation therefor. A valid custom cannot be based on so turbulent and discordant a history; it requires something more than unilateral and arbitrary imposition of working conditions. \n17\n We thus cannot say that the District Court's findings as to custom and contract are so clearly erroneous as to compel us to disregard them.\n But in any event it is immaterial that there may have been a prior custom or contract not to consider certain work within the compass of the workweek or not to compensate employees for certain portions of their work. The Fair Labor Standards Act was not designed to codify or perpetuate those customs and contracts which allow an employer to claim all of an employee's time while compensating him for only a part of it. Congress intended, instead, to achieve a uniform national policy of guaranteeing compensation for all work or employment engaged in by employees covered by the Act. \n18\n Any custom or contract falling short of that basic policy, like an agreement to pay less than the minimum wage requirements, cannot be utilized to deprive employees of their statutory \n\n[321 \nU.S. 590, 603]\n\u00a0\n rights. Cf. Overnight Motor Transportation Co. v. Missel, \n316 \nU.S. 572\n, 62 S.Ct. 1216; Holden v. Hardy, \n169 \nU.S. 366\n, 18 S.Ct. 383. See also Louisville & N.R. Co. v. Mottley, \n219 \nU.S. 467\n, 31 S. Ct. 265, 34 L.R.A.,N.S., 671; J. I. Case Company v. National Labor Relations Board, \n321 \nU.S. 332\n, 64 S.Ct. 576; Order of Railroad Telegraphers v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., \n321 \nU.S. 342\n, 64 S.Ct. 582.\n This does not foreclose, of course, reasonable provisions of contract or custom governing the computation of work hours where precisely accurate computation is difficult or impossible. Nor are we concerned here with the effect that custom and contract may have in borderline cases where the other facts give rise to serious doubts as to whether certain activity or non-activity constitutes work or employment. It is sufficient in this case that the facts relating to underground travel in iron ore mines leave no uncertainty as to its character as work. The Act thus requires that appropriate compensation be paid for such work. Any other conclusion would deprive the iron ore miners of the just remuneration guaranteed them by the Act for contributing their time, liberty and strength primarily for the benefit of others.\n The judgment of the court below is accordingly affirmed.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER, concurring.\n The legal question on the record before us lies within a narrow compass. Section 7 of the Fair Labor Standards Act commands the payment of compensation at a rate of not less than one and one-half times the regular rate for every employee under the Statute who is engaged 'for a workweek' longer than forty-four or forty-two hours during the first or the second year, respectively, after the effective date of the Section and forty hours thereafter. 52 Stat. 1060, 1063, 29 U.S.C.  207, 29 U.S.C.A.  207. Congress did not explicitly define 'workweek' and there is nothing in the available materials pertinent to construction that warrants a finding that 'workweek', as applied to the workers in the iron ore industry, had so settled a \n\n[321 \nU.S. 590, 604]\n\u00a0\n meaning at the time of the enactment of the Fair Labor Standards Act as to be deemed incorporated by reference. As a result, 'workweek' in this Statute, as applied to workers in this industry and on this record, has no technical meaning, that is, a meaning so well known to those in this particular industry as to be applied by courts in enforcing the Statute when invoked by men in the industry. For purposes of this case, in any event, when Congress used the word 'workweek', it used it colloquially-the term carries merely the meaning of common understanding.\n An administrative agency for preliminary adjudication of issues arising under the Wages and Hours Law, like that established by the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq., was not provided by Congress. And so, the application of this colloquial concept 'workweek' to the multifarious situations in American industry was left by Congress for ascertainment by judicial proceedings. These facts are to be found either by a jury or, as in this case, by a judge sitting without a jury. And so here it was the judge's duty to determine what time and energy on the part of the employees involved in this suit constituted a 'workweek' of these employees of the petitioners. After a trial which lasted for about three weeks, during which testimony covering 2,643 pages was heard and voluminous exhibits were introduced, the District Court made its findings of fact. A judgment for the employees based on these findings was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, D.C., 40 F.Supp. 4; 5 Cir., 135 F.2d 320.\n We have then a judgment of two courts based on findings with ample evidence to warrant such findings. Affirmance by this Court is therefore demanded.\n\n Mr. Justice JACKSON, concurring.\n This case in my view probably does not present any question of law or, if so, it is one with a very obvious \n\n[321 \nU.S. 590, 605]\n\u00a0\n answer. When Congress in the Fair Labor Standards Act referred to 'a work week longer than forty hours,' it considered, I assume, that what was a work week in fact should be a work week in law. Therefore, the determination of any particular case does not govern any other, for each establishment and industry stands on its own conditions.\n A seasoned and wise rule of this Court makes concurrent findings of two courts below final here in the absence of very exceptional showing of error. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., Inc., v. Ray-O-Vac Co., \n321 \nU.S. 275\n, 64 S.Ct. 593; District of Columbia v. Pace, \n320 \nU.S. 698\n, 64 S.Ct. 406; Baker v. Schofield, \n243 \nU.S. 114, 118\n, 37 S.Ct. 333, 334; Williams Manufacturing Co. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., \n316 \nU.S. 364, 367\n, 62 S.Ct. 1179, 1181.\n In these cases ore mining companies sought declaratory judgments that miners' travel time in the shafts getting to and from actual mining operations, and some other time, is not to be counted in the work week as defined for overtime purposes in the Fair Labor Standards Act. They alleged that the custom of their mines excluded it, but the trial court considered all the evidence and said, 'The evidence has disclosed no such custom.' The companies also contended that the activity during travel is not in the natural of work. After hearing a mass of conflicting testimony the trial court said of these activities, 'They are performed on the premises of the employer, in the furtherance of the employer's business, with no benefits to the employee (except to aid him in the performance of work for the employer), under conditions created and controlled by the employer, and they involve responsibility to the employer and physical exertion, even though not burdensome, on the part of the employee. No characteristic of work is lacking.' These were found to be the facts by the two courts below and, whatever we might decide if we were a trial court hearing the evidence in the first instance, we cannot with our limited review hold them wrong on this record. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 590, 606]\n\u00a0\n If these facts are accepted, the ruling that such travel time is part of the work week seems manifest. I would affirm on these controlling facts.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS.\n The question for decision in this case should be approached not on the basis of any broad humanitarian prepossessions we may all entertain, not with a desire to construe legislation so as to accomplish what we deem worthy objects, but in the traditional and, if we are to have a government of laws, the essential attitude of ascertaining what Congress has enacted rather than what we wish it had enacted.\n Much of what is said in the opinion, in my view, disregards this fundamental function of the judicial process and relies on considerations which have no place in the solution of the issue presented.\n What did Congress mean when it said, in Sec. 7(a) of the Fair Labor Standards Act, that 'No employer shall ... employ any of his employees ... for a workweek longer than forty hours ... unless such employee receives compensation' for overtime at a specified rate? No other issue is presented.\n The materials for decision are those to which resort always has been had in ascertaining the meaning of a statute. They are the mischief to be remedied, the purpose of Congress in the light of the mischief, and the means adopted to promote that purpose. These are not obscure in this instance.\n The committee reports upon the bill, which became the Fair Labor Standards Act1 make it clear that the sole purpose was to increase employment, to require a fair day's pay for a fair day's work by raising the wages of the \n\n[321 \nU.S. 590, 607]\n\u00a0\n most poorly paid workers and reducing the hours of those most overworked, and thus correct inequalities in the cost of producing goods and prevent unfair competition in commerce. The reports disclose no other purpose. The Congressional findings and declaration of policy embodied in Sec. 2(a)2 exhibit no intent to deal with any matter other than substandard conditions in industry stemming from wage and hour practices. The Act will be searched in vain for a mandate respecting any subject other than minimum wages and maximum hours of work. This court has construed it as dealing only with these subjects. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n In this setting, therefore, we are to determine what Congress meant by the term 'workweek' when it prescribed the maximum number of hours of labor an employer might require to be rendered within any week at the standard wage. The Act does not define 'workweek', for the evident reason that Congress believed it had a conventional meaning which all would understand and to which all could conform their practices. The term combines two words in common use. A week is any period of seven days. In accepted usage a man's work means that which he does for his employer as the consideration of the wage he receives. The term is often used in a more general sense as when one is asked what he is doing and replies 'I am working for Jones'. Of course he does not mean that Jones is paying him for each hour of every week of his life. Men are not commonly paid for the time they sleep, the time they eat, or the time they take to go to, and return from, their employer's premises. Thus, although the phrase 'work' may refer to the calling pursued, or the identity of the employer, it is plainly not so used in this statute. Its collocation with the word 'week' and with the injunction as to minimum pay, maximum \n\n[321 \nU.S. 590, 608]\n\u00a0\n hours, and overtime for extra work, in any week shows that what Congress meant by work was what I have above described,-the actual service rendered to the employer for which he pays wages in conformity to custom or agreement.\n It is common knowledge that what constitutes work for which payment is to be made varies with customs and practices in different industries or businesses. Where the employe is required to report at his employer's place of business and go thence to the place where his employer's activities are pursued, it has been the custom in some cases to pay for the time spent in going from the employer's place of business to the place of work. In many industries some or all of the employes are required to report and to remain at a given place awaiting a call for emergency or other casual service and, according to understanding, they are paid for the hours during which they wait as well as those in which they actually put forth physical or mental effort. There can be little doubt that Congress expected the provisions of the Act to be fitted into the prevailing practices and understandings as to what constituted work in various industries.\n The Act does not provide that the Administrator or the courts are to define a workweek in the case of each employer on such basis as they deem right, regardless of the custom of the industry or of existing agreements between employers and employees. Nor does the Act vest authority in Administrator or court to disregard and supersede existing understandings and practices as to what constitutes work or the workweek. There is nothing in the words of the statute or its history to suggest that Congress intended, without mentioning it, to confer on the Administrator or the courts so vast a power over the industry of the nation.\n The question in this case then is: What was the workweek of iron miners when the Act was adopted? If the \n\n[321 \nU.S. 590, 609]\n\u00a0\n answer is plain, then, I submit, that existing workweek must control in the administration of the statute unless and until employer and employes, by consensual arrangement, alter the current practice.\n The record presents no dispute as to the facts. Some are matters of public notoriety susceptible of judicial notice; others are contained in offers of evidence which the District Court excluded as irrelevant; others are exposed in the proofs.\n Conditions of labor in iron mines and in coal mines are similar. In both, as the workings become deeper, the men have farther to go to reach the places at which they labor. The time thus consumed by individual workmen varies in the same mine, and in different mines. The conditions in the channels of approach to the places of work are somewhat better in iron mines than in coal mines. The custom in coal mines is, therefore, persuasive, since some of the petitioners maintain coal and iron mines in close proximity, and since the practice in the two has been the same for many years.\n In the public arbitration proceedings at Birmingham, Alabama, in 1903, the testimony showed that a miner's day was reckoned 'from the time (he) gets to the face of the coal until he leaves the face of the coal,' and that the eight hour day was so measured. That arbitration resulted in a wage agreement on the 'face to face' basis; that is, on a wage fixed according to the time the miners worked at the face of the coal.\n In 1917 a public board of arbitration, whose award was approved by the United States Fuel Administrator, found:\n'An eight hour day means eight hours work at the usual working places of all classes of employees. This shall be exclusive of the time required in reaching such working places in the morning and departing from the same at night.' \n\n[321 \nU.S. 590, 610]\n\u00a0\n In 1920 the report and award of the Bituminous Coal Commission, which was made the basis of agreement between operators and union miners, employed the language just quoted.\n\n In 1933 the Code of Fair Competition for the Bituminous Coal Industry, promulgated by the President under the National Industrial Recovery Act, 48 Stat. 195, provided:\n'Seven hours of labor shall constitute a day's work and this means seven hours work at the usual working places for all classes of labor, exclusive of the lunch period, whether they be paid on the day or tonnage or other piece work basis.'\n\n In 1933 the Appalachian Agreement, approved by the President, provided:\n'Eight hours of labor shall constitute a day's work. The eight hour day means eight hours' work in the mines at the usual working places for all classes of labor exclusive of the lunch period.'\n\n Prior to 1938, the petitioner Tennessee Coal, Iron & Railroad Company paid its miners either on a piece work basis or upon a shift basis, as did the petitioners Sloss-Sheffield, and Republic Steel. But the common understanding of men and management was that, at first, ten hours and, later, eight hours constituted a working day. This is shown by the proofs and there is no evidence to the contrary.\n On numerous occasions the men working in these mines claimed, through their unions, that they ought to be paid for travel time consumed in the mines in going to or from the face where they worked. Their demands for pay for travel time are eloquent proof that they understood the basis on which their pay was reckoned and that it did not include travel time as working time. No agreement to pay for travel time was made and no practice to pay for it was adopted.\n In 1934 Tennessee made an agreement with the Union representing its employes, which was renewed in 1935, \n\n[321 \nU.S. 590, 611]\n\u00a0\n and again in 1936. It is undisputed that all of these agreements excluded payment for travel time. On October 6, 1938, before the Fair Labor Standards Act was in effect, a collective bargaining agreement was made between the International Union, affiliated with the CIO, and the Tennessee Company. In this agreement it was provided:\n'Section 4-Hours of Work. Eight (8) hours shall constitute a day's work and forty (40) hours shall constitute a week's work. Time and one- half shall be paid for all overtime in excess of eight (8) hours in any one day or for all overtime in excess of forty (40) hours in any one week.\n\n'The eight (8) hour day means eight hours of work in or about the mines at the usual working places for all classes of labor, exclusive of the lunch period, whether they be paid by the day or be paid on the tonnage basis.'\n\n This agreement remained in effect until May 5, 1941, when the provisions in question were abrogated pursuant to an opinion promulgated by the Wage and Hour Administrator as hereinafter described.\n The circumstances are not materially different with respect to Sloss- Sheffield. That company has bargained with a union representing its miners since 1934. Several times the union made a demand for payment of travel time but this was not granted. A formal agreement containing the same definitions of workweek, and hours of work, as in the case of Tennessee, was executed in 1939 and renewed in 1940. The company continued to pay on the face to face basis until 1941.\n Republic Steel has had no formal written agreement with its employes, but it has bargained with their union. As early as 1933 the union suggested that an arrangement be made whereby the men enter the mine on their own time and come out on company time, but the matter was not pressed. It came up again in 1934. After a strike, negotiations resulted in a return of the men to \n\n[321 \nU.S. 590, 612]\n\u00a0\n work on the face to face plan of payment. In 1935 the union proposed that the employes should enter on their own time and come out on company time, but in negotiations the matter was dropped. In 1936 the union wrote the company respecting an agreement and, in its proposal, said: 'The eight hour day means eight hours in or about the mines at the usual working places for all classes of work.' In 1939 the union proposed an agreement containing a like provision. In that year the union preferred charges before the National Labor Relations Board but these did not involve the face to face basis of wage computation. The complaint was settled by stipulation. The company continued to pay for a day's work on the face to face basis until May 1, 1941.\n The Fair Labor Standards Act became effective October 24, 1938. At that time coal and iron miners were being paid on the basis of their time spent at their working places in the mine. The miners fully understood this basis.\n On July 9, 1940, the director of the legal department of the United Mine Workers of America, in a letter to the Administrator of the Act, requested that he accept the definition of working time contained in the Appalachian agreement, which the letter said embodied 'the custom and traditions of the bituminous mining industry.' That definition was the same as that quoted from the Tennessee agreement, supra. The letter further said, respecting the face to face method:\n'This method of measuring the working time at the place of work has been the standard provision in the basic wage agreements for almost fifty years and is the result of collective bargaining in its complete sense.'\n\n and further said:\n'As mines grow older, the working places move farther and farther away from the portal or opening of the mine, and as such conditions develop, it becomes necessary for \n\n[321 \nU.S. 590, 613]\n\u00a0\n provision to be made for transportation of the men over long distances to their working places.'\n\n and added that adjustment of wage rates to any new measurement\n'would create so much confusion in the bituminous industry as to result in complete chaos, and would probably result in a complete stoppage of work at practically all of the coal mines in the United States.'\n\n On the footing of that letter the Administrator issued a release stating that the face to face basis in the bituminous industry would not be unreasonable.\n On March 23, 1941, the Administrator announced a modified portal to portal wage hour opinion in which he defined the work day in underground metal mining as starting when the miner reports at the collar of the mine, ends when he returns to the collar, and includes the time spent on the surface in obtaining and returning lamps, carbide, and tools and in checking in and out. Realizing that this was a complete change of opinion, the Administrator announced that he would not seek to compel payment of restitution from mine owners operating on a face to face basis but that he could not interfere with the right of employes or their representatives to sue for past overtime and penalties under  16(b) of the Act. Thereupon the unions representing miners demanded payment of overtime for all travel time since the effective date of the Act, and invoked the penalties specified therein.\n In order to avoid possible penalties, the petitioners complied with the Administrator's ruling and brought the present suit for a declaratory judgment to the effect that working time of underground employes comprised the hours of work in the usual working places in the mine and did not include the time consumed in travel thereto and therefrom.\n At the trial much evidence was taken as to the practice existing in iron mines long prior to, and at the date \n\n[321 \nU.S. 590, 614]\n\u00a0\n of the adoption of, the Fair Labor Standards Act. This was given by miners, foremen, and employers, and represented not any single locality but the industry over the country. In fact, some of the testimony consisted of depositions taken by the respondents, but offered by the petitioners. It was all to the effect that the working time of iron miners had always been calculated and paid for according to the time worked in the mine at the place assigned for the work and that travel time had never been included in the time for which payment was made.\n The district judge entered twenty-nine findings of fact. The first four are formal. The fifth is to the effect that, in the history of mining in the Birmingham District, plaintiffs' employes have been paid without regard to the number of hours spent at the face of the ore or at any specified place or station in the mines, and adds: 'This compensation has never been based upon any precise number of hours spent daily at the face of the seam or at any specified place or station in the mines.' The finding would seem difficult to explain in view of the history heretofore outlined. The explanation is found in the fact that, although the men were paid for an eight hour day of work at the face, if blasts were about to be set off at the close of the day the men were sent away from the face some time before the blasting but were, nevertheless, paid as if they had remained at the face for the full eight hours. But this can be no reason for disregarding the practices and agreements of the parties.\n Findings 6 to 12, inclusive, refer to various methods of payment practiced in the past and to the character of the work of miners and other underground workers. They evidently are intended to show that, while an eight hour day was in force, the wage was not calculated at an hourly rate. Of course, they do not contradict the fact that forty hours constituted the workweek nor the fact that it was \n\n[321 \nU.S. 590, 615]\n\u00a0\n understood that no wages were paid for time spent in travel in the mines.\n Finding 13 is to the effect that the unions which made agreements with various petitioners had never been certified by the National Labor Relations Board as appropriate units for collective bargaining. The bearing of this finding is difficult to understand in view of the fact that the employers dealt with the unions representing their men and two operated under formal collective bargaining agreements with nationally affiliated unions.\n Finding 14 briefly mentions that the men had several times demanded pay for travel time.\n Findings 15 to 27, inclusive, describe the conditions under which the men arrive at the mine, check in, obtain their tools, and walk, or are carried, to their work underground and how they return. They recite that the men have to obey company regulations while they are on the company property and in going to and returning from work. Many of these regulations are for the men's safety. These findings also show that, after arriving on company property, the men receive certain directions with respect to the work they are to do. The obvious bearing of these findings is that the court thought travel ought to be considered work, within the intendment of the Act, whatever the custom, practice, or agreement of the parties. It would be no less a judicial fiat, though somewhat more extreme, to hold that as the men's living quarters are uncomfortable and unhealthy and they must live in the neighborhood of the mines, the time spent in their homes must be paid for as work.\n The two concluding findings are of facts which add nothing. They are to the effect that, if all the travel time is counted in the workweek, the men have worked more than forty hours per week and the petitioners have not paid them for more than forty hours. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 590, 616]\n\u00a0\n The opinion and concurring opinion in this court rely heavily on these findings, especially as they were accepted by the Circuit Court of Appeals. But it will be observed that the findings are noteworthy for the feature that they deal, except in the instance mentioned, which has already been explained, with facts which are immaterial to the issues in the case. I do not see how aid to decision can be derived by refusing to disturb findings which do not meet the issue made by the pleadings. It is significant that the District Court avoided any finding as to whether the employers had ever paid travel time or as to the understanding of the parties that the employers were not paying for such travel time. And it is even more significant that the court made no finding whatever about the formal collective bargaining agreements entered into by the respondents with the petitioners in which both parties clearly significant their understanding of what was work in iron mines. And the court could not, under the proofs in this case, have found that these collective bargaining agreements were contrary to the accepted practice in iron and coal mines throughout the country prior to 1941. The petitioners objected that the findings omitted any reference to the fact that the companies had never paid for travel time, to the fact that the day's work for which wages were paid did not include travel time to or from the place where they mined the ore, or to the negotiations and agreements as to working time, and sought a new trial. The objections and motions were overruled.\n Reliance is placed on the trial court's finding that the evidence discloses no custom to exclude travel time from the workweek. But that very reliance exposes the fallacy of the lower court's and this court's position. Unless the statute gave the courts authority to make contracts for the parties, which the statute did not make, a court could not support such a contract by finding that there was no custom with respect to travel time. It would be necessary for \n\n[321 \nU.S. 590, 617]\n\u00a0\n it to find that there was a custom to pay for such time, which the District Court failed to do, for the obvious reason that there was no evidence of such custom.\n To say that we should pitch decision on acceptance of the findings of the trial court, when that court neglected to find facts which were highly relevant and material, is to disregard the real and the only issue in the case.\n As I have already pointed out, the Fair Labor Standards Act was not intended by Congress to turn into work that which was not work, or not so understood to be, at the time of its passage. It was not intended to permit courts to designate as work some activity of an employee, which neither employer nor employee had ever regarded as work, merely because the court thought that such activity imposed such hardship on him or involved conditions so deleterious to his health or welfare that he ought to be compensated for them.\n It is common knowledge that the issue of portal to portal pay was first nationally raised in connection with the mining industry after the nation was at war and in connection with disastrous coal strikes. And, indeed, the inspiration for the demand for portal to portal pay was furnished by the decision of the court below in this case. That decision was rendered on March 16, 1943. Three days later the National Policy Committee of the United Mine Workers changed its demanded definition of hours of labor so that existing demands, which, until then, had been on the traditional face to face basis of payment, should 'conform with the basic legal requirements of the industry and the maximum hours of work time provisions be amended to establish 'portal to portal' for starting and quitting time for all underground workers.' In presenting this demand it said: 'The Mine Workers desire to take advantage of the law which, under the Alabama decision, grants them the right to be paid for the time they are in the mines.' Thus it is plain that the decision under review was understood, \n\n[321 \nU.S. 590, 618]\n\u00a0\n as it must be, as a declaration of law by a court as to what is a work week under the Act and not a finding of fact based on the custom of the industry and the agreement of the parties. In August class actions were filed by the United Mine Workers in various district courts to obtain overtime compensation for portal to portal pay.\n One further fact should be noted. The District Court found that not only the travel time from and to the mouth of the mine should be counted as working time, but that the time men spent on the surface in collecting tools, etc., should also he included. The Circuit Court of Appeals, although professing to accept the fact findings of the District Court, reversed its judgment with respect to time spent on the surface, saying no more than that the District Court was wrong in including that time. This is further proof that the decision of the case by both courts below turns on the view of a court as to what ought to be considered work and what not, irrespective of the understanding of the parties. Suppose that the parties had agreed that travel time was working time and to be included and paid for in the workweek? Would the courts be at liberty to find the contrary and deprive respondents of the benefit of the agreement. I think not.\n I cannot better characterize the result in this case than by quoting from what Judge Sibley said in his dissenting opinion below:4\n'If it would be better to include travel time in work time, it ought to be done by a new bargain in which rates of pay are also reviewed. If the change is to be by a special statute (some western States have such statutes), it will operate justly in futuro, and not by unexpected penalty, as here.\n\n'There is nothing in the Act to outlaw agreements that travel time in getting to or from the agreed place of work \n\n[321 \nU.S. 590, 619]\n\u00a0\n is not work time. This is true though the employer may organize a means of transportation and make rules for its use. The agreements here that work time includes only time at the face of the ore bed are not illegal. Digging out the ore is what the miners agree to do, and for that they are paid. Getting their tools together and riding or walking to the agreed place of work is not, by force of any law, work done for the mine owner. No one, I suppose, would say that if a group of miners who had spent an hour riding to work decided of their own will not to dig any ore and spent another hour riding back, they had done any work for which they should be paid by force of the Act.\n\n'It is now proposed to assess against these appellants as back pay for overtime an estimated quarter of a million dollars, to be doubled by way of penalty, to compensate the miners for their time in going to and from their place of work, in the face of their agreements that this time was not in their work time. They are to get three times as much per hour for riding and walking to and from the work they were hired to do, as they get for doing the work itself. The injustice of it to me is shocking.'\n\n I would reverse the judgment.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE joins in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] These actions were instituted under the Federal Declaratory Judgments Act, 48 Stat. 955,  274d, 28 U.S.C.  400, 28 U.S.C.A.  400. They were consolidated for trial purposes and the District Court entered a single judgment. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The 'working face' is the place in the mine where the miners actually drill and load ore. The 'face to face' basis of compensation, advocated by petitioners, includes only the time spent at the working face. The 'portal to portal' basis, proposed by respondents, includes time spent in traveling between the portal or entrance to the mine and the working face and back again, as well as the time spent at the working face. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Since May 5, 1941, petitioners have paid their miners for travel time pursuant to contract in compliance with the opinion of the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division that underground travel in iron ore mines is work within the meaning of the Act. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] No review has been sought of the exclusion from the workweek of the activities at the surface. We therefore do not discuss that issue in this case. Alexander v. Cosden Pipe Line Co., \n290 \nU.S. 484, 487\n, 54 S.Ct. 292, 293, and cases cited. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The Tennessee Coal, Iron & Railroad Company has eight mines; Sloss- Sheffield Steel & Iron Company, two mines; and Republic Steel Corporation, two mines. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] As the District Court pointed out, the conditions set forth by the record are not intended to be used to censure petitioners' manner of maintenance of their mines, 'for these conditions may well be normal conditions in iron ore mines and practically inevitable.' Moreover, the record indicates that the Spaulding mine of the Republic Company has been operated only intermittently and experimentally during the last 20 years and many of the conditions in the other mines are not present. The ore is close to the surface and miners can walk all the way to the working faces. \n[\nFootnote 7\n] One of the Tennessee Company's superintendents stated that 'Whenever a man comes to the mine late, dragging along and encourages others to be late, he is setting a bad example. I want this understood thoroughly-men must be on time; we don't care whether they work here or not, but if they want to work here they will have to be on time or else they will be disciplined, even to discharge.' \n[\nFootnote 8\n] The use of the bath house, or change house, is optional. Some miners change their clothes at home and make no use of the bath houses furnished by petitioners. \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] An ore skip is an ordinary fourwheeled ore box car made of steel. It is normally used for transporting ore and its floor is often covered with muck from such haulings. When men are riding in the car it is known as a 'man skip trip.' It is used for such purposes in the mines of the Tennessee Company and the Republic Company. \n[\nFootnote 10\n] A regular man trip is a specially constructed series of cars. Each car is about eight feet long and resembles a stairway. Five men sit on either side of the car facing outwards, back to back with five men on the other side. The man trip used in the Sloss Company mines consists of six such cars. \n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] Webster's New International Dictionary (2d ed., unabridged) defines work as follows: '1. To exert oneself physically or mentally for a purpose, esp., in common speech, to exert oneself thus in doing something undertaken chiefly for gain, for improvement in one's material, intellectual, or physical condition, or under compulsion of any kind, as distinguished from something undertaken primarily for pleasure, sport, or immediate gratification, or as merely incidental to other activities (as a disagreeable walk involved in going to see a friend, or the packing of a trunk for a pleasure trip). ...' The word 'employ' is defined as follows: '2. To make use of the services of; to give employment to; to entrust with some duty or behest.' \n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] Cf. Dollar v.

The Supreme Court of Montana has construed Mont.Const. art. 18, sec. 4, and Mont.Rev.Code (1935), sec. 3071, which provide for eight hours of work per day in underground mines, to include all travel time, Butte Miners' Union No. 1 v. Anaconda Copper Mining Co., 112 Mont. 418, 118 P.2d 148. Nevada Comp.Laws (1929), sec. 10237, provides that the limitation shall apply to travel one way. But Wyoming Rev.Stat. (1931), sec. 63-107, specifically excludes underground travel from the limitation; a like result has been reached by interpretation of California Stats.1909, ch. 181, p. 279, in Matter of Application of Martin, 157 Cal. 59, 106 P. 238. Alabama and Tennessee fix no limitation on hours, while maximum hour statutes of other metal mining states are inconclusive insofar as the inclusion of travel time is concerned. See also Section 5(2) of the English Metalliferous Mines Regulation Act (1872), 35 & 36 Vict., c. 77, which provides that 'The period of each employment shall be deemed to begin at the time of leaving the surface, and to end at the time of returning to the surface.' \n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] Blackstone has said that one of the requisites of a valid custom is that 'it must have been peaceable, and acquiesced in; not subject to contention and dispute.

It expressly decided to give effect to two kinds of collective agreements, as specified in Section 7(b)(1) and ( 2) of the Act. Cf. Section 8(c). It thus did not intend that other collective agreements should relieve employers from paying for overtime in excess of an actual workweek of 40 hours, regardless of the provisions of such contracts. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] H.R. 1452, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., H.R. 2182, 75th Cong., 3d Sess., S.R. 884, 75th Cong., 1st Sess. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 52 Stat. 1060, 29 U.S.C.A.  202(a). \n[\nFootnote 3\n] United States v.

AMERICAN SUGAR REFINING CO.(1944)\nNo. 649\nArgued: March 29, 1944Decided: April 24, 1944\n\n\n\n Mr. Cody Fowler, of Tampa, Fla., for petitioners.\n Mr. Henry N. Longley, of New York City, for respondent. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 42, 43]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n We granted certiorari because this case poses an important question arising under the United States Arbitration Act. \n1\n The question arises in these circumstances. The petitioner Smith-Rowland Company, Inc., as owner, chartered to the respondent, American Sugar Refining Company, the barge 'Anaconda' for a voyage from Havana, Cuba, to Port Everglades, Florida. After arrival at the latter port, the respondent filed in a federal district court a libel in personam against the petitioner with a prayer for process of foreign attachment, and in rem against the vessel, which was seized by the marshal.\n Smith-Rowland Company, Inc., appearing specially, excepted to the jurisdiction of the court, relying on a provision of the charter party which was: 'Any and all differences and disputes of whatsoever nature arising out of this charter shall be put to arbitration at the final place of discharge ... pursuant to the provisions of the United States Arbitration Act ... except that the provisions of Section 8 thereof shall not apply to any arbitration hereunder.' (Italics supplied.)\n Section 8 of the Act is: 'If the basis of jurisdiction be a cause of action otherwise justiciable in admiralty, then, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the party claiming to be aggrieved may begin his proceeding hereunder by libel and seizure of the vessel ... according to the usual course of admiralty proceedings, and the court shall then have jurisdiction to direct the parties to proceed with the arbitration and shall retain jurisdiction to enter its decree upon the award.'\n The court treated the petitioner's exception as a motion to dismiss, and ordered dismissal2 on the ground that it was competent to the parties, while availing themselves of the \n\n[322 \nU.S. 42, 44]\n\u00a0\n provisions of the Act rendering arbitration agreements enforcible in courts of admiralty, to preclude resort to the usual process of seizure as security for compliance with any arbitral award. The respondent appealed from the order, and the parties entered a stipulation for value pursuant to which the barge was released from the marshal's custody. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the judgment. \n3\n We hold its action was right.\n Within the spheres of its operation,-maritime transactions and transactions in commerce, interstate and with foreign nations,-the Arbitration Act rendered a written provision in a contract by the parties to such a transaction, to arbitrate controversies arising thereout, specifically enforceable. Thereby Congress overturned the existing rule that performance of such agreements could not be compelled by resort to courts of equity or admiralty. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n After declaring (Section 2)5 such agreements to be enforceable, Congress, in succeeding sections, implemented the declared policy. By Section 3 it provided that 'if any suit or proceeding be brought in any of the courts of the United States upon any issue referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing for such arbitration, the court ... shall on application of one of the parties stay the trial ... until such arbitration has been had' if the applicant is not in default in proceeding with such arbitration. The section obviously envisages action in a court on a cause of action and does not oust the court's jurisdiction of the action, though the parties have agreed to arbitrate. And, it would seem there is nothing to prevent the plaintiff from commencing the action by attachment if such procedure is available \n\n[322 \nU.S. 42, 45]\n\u00a0\n under the applicable law. This section deals with suits at law or in equity. The concept seems to be that a power to grant a stay is enough without the power to order that the arbitration proceed, for, if a stay be granted, the plaintiff can never get relief unless he proceeds to arbitration.\n Section 8, that with which we are especially concerned, deals with the admiralty jurisdiction. It has already been quoted. If the cause of action is one cognizable in admiralty, then, though the parties have agreed to arbitrate, 'notwithstanding anything herein (i.e. in the Act) to the contrary,' the party claiming to be aggrieved may begin 'his proceeding hereunder by libel and seizure', 'according to the usual course of admiralty proceedings', and the court may direct the parties to proceed with arbitration and retain jurisdiction to enter its decree on the award. Here again the Act plainly contemplates that one who has agreed to arbitrate may, nevertheless, prosecute his cause of action in admiralty, and protects his opponent's right to arbitration by court order. Far from ousting or permitting the parties to the agreement to oust the court of jurisdiction of the cause of action the statute recognizes the jurisdiction and saves the right of an aggrieved party to invoke it.\n Finally we turn to Section 4, which permits 'a party aggrieved by the alleged failure' of his opponent to arbitrate as agreed, to petition any federal court of appropriate jurisdiction at law, in equity or in admiralty, for an order directing that arbitration proceed. Provision is made for framing an issue and trying it as to whether the parties are bound to arbitrate and the entry of an order accordingly. From this provision it is clear that the parties may proceed in an admiralty case without the customary libel and seizure. And it has been so held. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n[322 \nU.S. 42, 46]\n\u00a0\n Section 8 says the aggrieved party 'notwithstanding' the right granted by Section 4, may begin a suit in admiralty by libel and seizure. Our question is whether the Act contemplates or permits consensual elimination of the procedure thus saved by the Act and contractual confinement of the aggrieved party's resort to a court to a petition for an order to arbitrate under Section 4. We think the answer must be in the negative. Congress may have thought it wise not to raise doubts under the admiralty clause of the constitution. It may have thought that in many causes in admiralty if the aggrieved party could not seize the ship of his opponent, an arbitral award would be wholly unenforceable as the vessel might seldom or never again be within the jurisdiction of our courts. But, whatever its reasons, Congress plainly and emphatically declared that although the parties had agreed to arbitrate, the traditional admiralty procedure with its concomitant security should be available to the aggrieved party without in any way lessening his obligation to arbitrate his grievance rather than litigate the merits in court.\n It is enough that Congress has so declared. We think a party can not stipulate away such a jurisdiction which the legislation declares open as heretofore.\n The judgment is affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of February 12, 1925, c. 213, 43 Stat. 883, Title 9 U.S.C., 9 U.

Morehouse, of Chicago, Ill., for appellant.\n Mr. Robert L. Pierce, of Washington, D.C., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This direct appeal from a statutory three-judge district court involves important problems relating to 'grandfather' rights to a certificate as a common carrier by motor vehicle in a single coordinated rail-motor freight service. The final decree of that court dismissed appellant's petition to set aside an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission, 31 M.C.C. 299. The Commission's order had denied to the Chicago and North Western Railway Company, of which appellant is trustee, a certificate of public convenience and necessity as a common carrier by motor vehicle under the so-called 'grandfather clause' of Section 206(a) of Part II of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.  306(a), 49 U.S.C.A .  306(a).\n The essential facts are clear. The Chicago and North Western Railway Company, hereinafter referred to as the railroad, has extensive mileage in nine western states and is a large carrier of freight in less than carload lots. Prior to and since the statutory 'grandfather' date of June 1, 1935, it has supplemented its rail freight service by providing motor vehicle service between various freight stations on its rail lines. There are twenty-three such motor vehicle routes on highways parallel with and roughly adjacent to the railroad's lines. The motor trucks transport less than carload lots of freight in complete coordination with the rail service. The railroad instituted \n\n[321 \nU.S. 19, 21]\n\u00a0\n this additional method of transportation in order to furnish an improved and more convenient freight service to the public in certain areas of light traffic and in order to curtail car mileage and way-freight service. Motor vehicle transportation, in other words, is merely a new method of carrying on part of its all-rail freight business in which it had been engaged for many years.\n The railroad has consistently held itself out to the general public and to shippers as being engaged in this coordinated rail-motor freight service. It solicits all the freight transported by the trucks operating as part of this unified service and its bills of lading and tariffs are used throughout. The shipper does not know in a specific instance whether his freight will be shipped entirely by rail or partly by motor vehicle. But he is informed by the railroad's tariffs that the railroad at its option may substitute motor vehicle service for rail service between stations on its lines and that the charges in such a case are the same as wouls be applicable for all-rail service.\n In so substituting motor vehicle service, the railroad has not deemed it advisable to purchase or lease motor trucks or to employ its own personnel in such operations. Instead it has entered into written contracts for this service with motor vehicle operators who also serve customers other than the railroad. But the railroad at all times maintains direct and complete control of the movement and handling of its freight by these operators. It fixes the truck schedules so as to coordinate them with the rail schedules and designates the amount and particular shipments of freight to be moved. The motor vehicle operators issue no billing of any kind and solicit none of the freight transported for the railroad. They have no contractual or other relationships with either the shippers or the receivers of the freight. Their trucks are loaded at the freight stations by railroad employees, sometimes assisted by the truck drivers. After a truck is loaded a manifest \n\n[321 \nU.S. 19, 22]\n\u00a0\n is issued by the railroad's agent, which is signed by the truck driver; upon delivery of the freight to the other railroad freight station the manifest is signed by another railroad agent, thus releasing the motor vehicle operator.\n The written contracts describe the operators as 'independent contractors' and state that 'nothing herein contained shall be construed as inconsistent with that status.' The contractors are bound by these contracts to provide vehicles of a type satisfactory to the railroad for the purpose of transporting freight between certain specified freight stations in accordance with such schedules and instructions as shall be given by the railroad. The contractors agree to transport such freight as the railroad designates in a manner satisfactory to the railroad. All persons operating the motor vehicles are under the employment and direction of the contractors and are not considered railroad employees. The operations are conducted under the contractors' own names and the vehicles do not display the railroad's name. The contractors further agree to comply with state, federal and municipal laws and to indemnify the railroad against any failure or default in this respect. They also agree to indemnify the railroad against all loss or damage of any kind resulting from the operation of the motor vehicles. The railroad is authorized to maintain for its own protection public liability and property damage insurance on all the vehicles at the contractors' expense up to a specified amount. Finally, the contracts provide that in the event that the highways between any of the stations become impassable the contractors shall immediately notify the railroad so that it can arrange and substitute other service if it desires.\n With respect to these operations, the Commission found that the railroad did not operate motor vehicles 'either as owner or under lease or any other equivalent arrangement.' The contract provisions were found to 'establish \n\n[321 \nU.S. 19, 23]\n\u00a0\n that motor vehicles are to be supplied by the contractors and operated under their direction and control and under their responsibility to the general public as well as to the shippers. It is clear, therefore, that the motor-vehicle operations have been and are those of others as common carriers by motor vehicle in their own right and not those of applicant.' The Commission accordingly denied the railroad's 'grandfather' application. The district court dismissed without opinion the railroad's suit to set aside and enjoin the Commission's order, after finding that the order was lawful and was supported by substantial evidence.\n In light of these undisputed facts, however, we hold that the Commission erred in finding that the railroad was not entitled to a certificate as a common carrier by motor vehicle. This error arises not from a lack of substantial evidence to support its conclusion or from an improper exercise of its discretion. Rather it is due to an incorrect application to these facts of the statutory provisions and Congressional intention relating to 'grandfather' rights of common carriers by motor vehicle.\n Under the 'grandfather' clause of Section 206[a] of Part II of the Interstate Commerce Act, a certificate of public convenience and necessity can be awarded only to one who is a 'common carrier by motor vehicle' within the meaning of the Act. Originally the term 'common carrier by motor vehicle' was defined to include any person who undertakes, 'whether directly or by a lease or any other arrangement,' to transport passengers or property for the general public by motor vehicle. \n1\n For purposes of clarity, however, this language was stricken and the term was redefined by Congress in 1940 to include any person 'which holds itself out to the general public to engage \n\n[321 \nU.S. 19, 24]\n\u00a0\n in the transportation by motor vehicle' of passengers or property. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n In addition, as we pointed out in United States v. N. E. Rosenblum Truck Lines, Inc., \n315 \nU.S. 50, 53\n, 54 S., 62 S.Ct. 445, 447, 448, 'We think it clear that Congress did not intend to grant multiple 'grandfather' rights on the basis of a single transportation service.' Thus where a person holds himself out to the general public to engage in a single transportation service, consisting entirely or partly of motor vehicle operations, he is a 'common carrier by motor vehicle' within the contemplation of the statute. And Congress intended that he alone should receive 'grandfather' rights on the basis of that single service under Section 206(a) of the Act.\n The undisputed facts here disclose that only the railroad holds itself out to the general public to engage in a single complete freight transportation service to and from all points on its lines. As an integral and essential part of this service tendered by the railroad, motor vehicle transportation between certain stations is provided. It is completely synchronized with the rail service and has none of the elements of an independent service offered on behalf of the motor vehicle operators. Their operations are the operations offered by the railroad as component parts, not as separate or distinct segments, of its single service. They may be replaced or eliminated at the sole discretion of the railroad.\n The railroad, furthermore, is actively engaged in providing this single coordinated service. As to the motor vehicle operations supplementing its rail service, it is not a mere freight broker or forwarder. Cf. Acme Fast Freight, Inc., v. United States, D.C., 30 F.Supp. 968, affirmed 309 \n\n[321 \nU.S. 19, 25]\n\u00a0\n U.S. 638, 60 S.Ct. 810; O'Malley v. United States, D.C., 38 F.Supp. 1; Moore v. United Tates, D.C., 41 F.Supp. 786, affirmed \n316 \nU.S. 642\n, 62 S.Ct. 1036. Nor can it be described as the consignor or consignee of the freight so transported by motor vehicle. Cf. Lehigh Valley R. Co. v. United States, \n243 \nU.S. 444\n, 37 S.Ct. 434. The provisions and actual operation of the contracts with the operators demonstrate the railroad's rigid control over the movement of the freight and its retention of full responsibility to the shippers. The operators are 'independent' only by grace of contract nomenclature. By any realistic test they are mere aids in carrying out a part of the railroad's coordinated rail-motor freight service.\n Thus the railroad clearly is undertaking to transport freight by an 'other arrangement,' as those words are used in the original statutory definition of 'common carrier by motor vehicle.' Cf. Chairman Eastman's concurring opinion in Missouri Pacific R. Co. Common Carrier Application, 22 M.C.C. 321, 333. Even more clearly, under the amended definition, the railroad is holding itself out to the general public to engage in the transportation of freight by motor vehicle as part of its coordinated rail- motor freight service. In short, it is a common carrier by motor vehicle within the meaning of the Act. And the application of the Congressional intention not to grant multiple 'grandfather' rights in such a situation becomes clear. The railroad alone is entitled to common carrier 'grandfather' rights as to the motor vehicle service forming an integral part of its unified freight service. Any other conclusion would authorize the wholesale granting of twenty-three 'grandfather' permits to the various motor vehicle operators on the basis of this single transportation service offered by the railroad-a result which ascribes to Congress 'an intent incompatible with its purpose of regulation.' United States v. N. E. Rosenblum Truck Lines, Inc., supra, \n315 \nU.S. 54\n, 62 S.Ct. 448. We need not decide whether these operators are entitled to 'grandfather' permits as \n\n[321 \nU.S. 19, 26]\n\u00a0\n to other freight transported over their routes. But only the railroad acquired 'grandfather' rights as to the freight which they transport as an integral part of the railroad's coordinated rail-motor service.\n The Commission has taken the view that only one certificate can be granted on the basis of a single transportation service and that the 'common carrier by motor vehicle' entitled to the certificate is the one who exercises direction and control of the motor vehicle operations and assumes full responsibility therefor both to shippers and the general public. This so-called 'control and responsibility' test, however, is applicable in this case only insofar as it aids in determining the person offering and engaging in the single coordinated rail-motor freight service. To the extent that it leads to a result different from that reached by the application of the statutory provisions and the Congressional intent which we have indicated, it must be disapproved.\n The judgment of the court below is reversed. The case is remanded to that court with directions to remand it to the Commission for such further proceedings, consistent with this opinion, as may be appropriate.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice JACKSON is of the opinion that the judgment should be affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice BLACK concurs, dissenting.\n One who arranges for another to do some hauling for him may or may not enter the hauling business. The question whether the one or the other is the entrepreneur has occupied the courts from an early day. Holmes, Agency (1891), 5 Harv.L.Rev. 1, 15-16. The Commission has drawn upon that body of law concerning independent contractors for the purpose of determining \n\n[321 \nU.S. 19, 27]\n\u00a0\n whether in case of line-haul transportation the carrier dealing directly with the shipper or the one performing the actual motor transportation was the common carrier entitled to grandfather rights under the Act. That is to say it has held, and consistently so, that the carrier which exercised direction and control of the actual motor-vehicle operations and assumed responsibility therefor to shippers and to the general public was the one who was in 'operation' during the specified period as a 'common carrier by motor vehicle' within the meaning of the grandfather clause.  206(a). That test has been applied whether the carrier dealing directly with the shippers was a common carrier by motor vehicle (Dixie Ohio Express Co., 17 M.C.C. 735, 738-741; J. T. O'Malley, 23 M.C.C. 276, 279) or a common carrier by rail. Willett Company of Indiana, Inc., 21 M.C.C. 405, 408; Missouri Pac. R. Co., 22 M.C.C. 321, 326-327. It has been applied after as well as before the 1940 amendments. \n1\n Boston & Maine Transportation Co., 30 M.C.C. 697, 704-705. And in applying the test to railroad applicants it has placed them on a parity with motor vehicle applicants. Boston & Maine Transportation Co., supra. And see Crooks Terminal Warehouse, Inc., 34 M.C. C. 679. There have been disagreements within the Commission whether particular applicants satisfy the test. Missouri Pac. R. Co., supra; Boston & Maine Ransportation Co., supra. But there has been no disagreement over the propriety of the control and responsibility test itself.\n The control and responsibility test provides a fair measure of the grandfather rights. He who shows that he has been and is an independent contractor has established his claim to the transportation business as clearly as any connecting carrier. The fact that the transportation service offered is closely integrated and held out to the public \n\n[321 \nU.S. 19, 28]\n\u00a0\n as such does not mean that segments of the line-haul operation may not comprise separate enterprises. To attach grandfather rights to the separate segments is not to grant multiple rights. It is to allow those rights to follow ownership of the enterprise. I see no other way to effectuate the Congressional policy of preserving through the grandfather clause the position which motor vehicle operators 'struggled to obtain in our national transportation system.' United States v. Carolina Freight Carriers Corp., \n315 \nU.S. 475, 488\n, 62 S.Ct. 722, 729. To conclude that the present arrangement is a mere agency is to disagree with the Commission in its application of the control and responsibility test. To rest grandfather rights on the integrated rail-motor service which appellant offers the public is to grant it rights based on another man's business. To grant appellant these grandfather rights on the basis of a holding out is to give to the 1940 amendment an effect which Congress concededly did not intend. \n2\n I do not believe that \n\n[321 \nU.S. 19, 29]\n\u00a0\n Congress intended to put applicants such as appellant in a preferred position.\n Since there is concededly sufficient evidence to support the findings of the Commission on the control and responsibility test, I would affirm the judgment below. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 203(a)(14) of the Motor Carrier Act of 1935, 49 Stat. 543, 544. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section 203(a)(14) as amended by the Transportation Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 898, 920, 49 U.S.C.A.  303(a)(14). No change in the legislative intent with respect to the definition of common carriers by motor vehicle of the type involved in this case was evidenced by this amendment. See 86 Cong.Rec. 11546. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See note 2, infra. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Prior to 1940 the Act defined 'common carrier by motor vehicle' as one who 'undertakes, whether directly or by a lease or any other arrangement, to transport passengers or property', etc.  203(a)(14). The Transportation Act of 1940 amended that definition. It provided, so far as material here, that a 'common carrier by motor vehicle' was 'any person which holds itself out to the general public to engage in the transportation by motor vehicle in interstate or foreign commerce of passengers or property.' As the opinion of the Court states, that amendment made no change as respects common carriers of the type involved in this case. It had the 'sole purpose of eliminating carriers performing pick-up, delivery, and transfer service.' 86 Cong.Rec. 11546. And see Boston & Maine Transp. Co., supra, 30 M.C.C. 703-705. The grandfather clause contained in  206(a) provides for the issuance of a certificate without proof of public convenience and necessity, if the carrier 'was in bona fide operation as a common carrier by motor vehicle on June 1, 1935, over the route or routes or within the territory for which application is made and has so operated since that time.'\n Thus after as well as before the 1940 amendment the basic question in this type of case was whether the connecting carrier was in 'bona fide operation' as such a carrier. If it was an independent contractor it was engaged in such 'operation'; if it was performing a transportation service as a mere agent for the carrier with whom the shipper dealt, it was not.

UNITED STATES(1944)\nNo. 22\nArgued: Decided: December 18, 1944\n\n\n\n Rehearing Denied Feb. 12, 1945\n\n See \n324 U.S. 885, 65 S.Ct. 674. \n\n[323 U.S. 214, 215] Mr. Wayne M. Collins, of San Francisco, Cal., and Mr. Charles A. Horsky, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n\n Mr. Charles Fahy, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n The petitioner, an American citizen of Japanese descent, was convicted in a federal district court for remaining in San Leandro, California, a 'Military Area', contrary to Civilian Exclusion Order No. 34 of the Commanding General \n\n[323 U.S. 214, 216] of the Western Command, U.S. Army, which directed that after May 9, 1942, all persons of Japanese ancestry should be excluded from that area. No question was raised as to petitioner's loyalty to the United States. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed,1 and the importance of the constitutional question involved caused us to grant certiorari.\n\n It should be noted, to begin with, that all legal restrictions which curtail the civil rights of a single racial group are immediately suspect. That is not to say that all such restrictions are unconstitutional. It is to say that courts must subject them to the most rigid scrutiny. Pressing public necessity may sometimes justify the existence of such restrictions; racial antagonism never can.\n\n In the instant case prosecution of the petitioner was begun by information charging violation of an Act of Congress, of March 21, 1942, 56 Stat. 173, 18 U.S.C.A.  97a, which provides that\n\n'... whoever shall enter, remain in, leave, or commit any act in any military area or military zone prescribed, under the authority of an Executive order of the President, by the Secretary of War, or by any military commander designated by the Secretary of War, contrary to the restrictions applicable to any such area or zone or contrary to the order of the Secretary of War or any such military commander, shall, if it appears that he knew or should have known of the existence and extent of the restrictions or order and that his act was in violation thereof, be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be liable to a fine of not to exceed $5,000 or to imprisonment for not more than one year, or both, for each offense.'\n Exclusion Order No. 34, which the petitioner knowingly and admittedly violated was one of a number of military orders and proclamations, all of which were sub- \n\n[323 U.S. 214, 217] stantially based upon Executive Order No. 9066, 7 Fed.Reg. 1407. That order, issued after we were at war with Japan, declared that 'the successful prosecution of the war requires every possible protection against espionage and against sabotage to national-defense material, national-defense premises, and national-defense utilities. ...'\n\n One of the series of orders and proclamations, a curfew order, which like the exclusion order here was promulgated pursuant to Executive Order 9066, subjected all persons of Japanese ancestry in prescribed West Coast military areas to remain in their residences from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. As is the case with the exclusion order here, that prior curfew order was designed as a 'protection against espionage and against sabotage.' In Kiyoshi Hirabayashi v. United States, \n320 U.S. 81, 63 S.Ct. 1375, we sustained a conviction obtained for violation of the curfew order. The Hirabayashi conviction and this one thus rest on the same 1942 Congressional Act and the same basic executive and military orders, all of which orders were aimed at the twin dangers of espionage and sabotage.\n\n The 1942 Act was attacked in the Hirabayashi case as an unconstitutional delegation of power; it was contended that the curfew order and other orders on which it rested were beyond the war powers of the Congress, the military authorities and of the President, as Commander in Chief of the Army; and finally that to apply the curfew order against none but citizens of Japanese ancestry amounted to a constitutionally prohibited discrimination solely on account of race. To these questions, we gave the serious consideration which their importance justified. We upheld the curfew order as an exercise of the power of the government to take steps necessary to prevent espionage and sabotage in an area threatened by Japanese attack.\n\n In the light of the principles we announced in the Hirabayashi case, we are unable to conclude that it was beyond the war power of Congress and the Executive to exclude \n\n[323 U.S. 214, 218] those of Japanese ancestry from the West Coast war area at the time they did. True, exclusion from the area in which one's home is located is a far greater deprivation than constant confinement to the home from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. Nothing short of apprehension by the proper military authorities of the gravest imminent danger to the public safety can constitutionally justify either. But exclusion from a threatened area, no less than curfew, has a definite and close relationship to the prevention of espionage and sabotage. The military authorities, charged with the primary responsibility of defending our shores, concluded that curfew provided inadequate protection and ordered exclusion. They did so, as pointed out in our Hirabayashi opinion, in accordance with Congressional authority to the military to say who should, and who should not, remain in the threatened areas.\n\n In this case the petitioner challenges the assumptions upon which we rested our conclusions in the Hirabayashi case. He also urges that by May 1942, when Order No. 34 was promulgated, all danger of Japanese invasion of the West Coast had disappeared. After careful consideration of these contentions we are compelled to reject them.\n\n Here, as in the Hirabayashi case, supra, 320 U.S. at page 99, 63 S.Ct. at page 1385, '... we cannot reject as unfounded the judgment of the military authorities and of Congress that there were disloyal members of that population, whose number and strength could not be precisely and quickly ascertained. We cannot say that the war-making branches of the Government did not have ground for believing that in a critical hour such persons could not readily be isolated and separately dealt with, and constituted a menace to the national defense and safety, which demanded that prompt and adequate measures be taken to guard against it.'\n\n Like curfew, exclusion of those of Japanese origin was deemed necessary because of the presence of an unascertained number of disloyal members of the group, most of \n\n[323 U.S. 214, 219] whom we have no doubt were loyal to this country. It was because we could not reject the finding of the military authorities that it was impossible to bring about an immediate segregation of the disloyal from the loyal that we sustained the validity of the curfew order as applying to the whole group. In the instant case, temporary exclusion of the entire group was rested by the military on the same ground. The judgment that exclusion of the whole group was for the same reason a military imperative answers the contention that the exclusion was in the nature of group punishment based on antagonism to those of Japanese origin. That there were members of the group who retained loyalties to Japan has been confirmed by investigations made subsequent to the exclusion. Approximately five thousand American citizens of Japanese ancestry refused to swear unqualified allegiance to the United States and to renounce allegiance to the Japanese Emperor, and several thousand evacuees requested repatriation to Japan. \n2\n\n We uphold the exclusion order as of the time it was made and when the petitioner violated it. Cf. Chastleton Corporation v. Sinclair, \n264 U.S. 543, 547, 44 S.Ct. 405, 406; Block v. Hirsh, \n256 U.S. 135, 154, 155 S., 41 S.Ct. 458, 459, 16 A.L.R. 165. In doing so, we are not unmindful of the hardships imposed by it upon a large group of American citizens. Cf. Ex parte Kumezo Kawato, \n317 U.S. 69, 73, 63 S.Ct. 115, 117. But hardships are part of war, and war is an aggregation of hardships. All citizens alike, both in and out of uniform, feel the impact of war in greater or lesser measure. Citizenship has its responsibilities as well as its privileges, and in time of war the burden is always heavier. Compulsory \n\n[323 U.S. 214, 220] exclusion of large groups of citizens from their homes, except under circumstances of direst emergency and peril, is inconsistent with our basic governmental institutions. But when under conditions of modern warfare our shores are threatened by hostile forces, the power to protect must be commensurate with the threatened danger.\n\n It is argued that on May 30, 1942, the date the petitioner was charged with remaining in the prohibited area, there were conflicting orders outstanding, forbidding him both to leave the area and to remain there. Of course, a person cannot be convicted for doing the very thing which it is a crime to fail to do. But the outstanding orders here contained no such contradictory commands.\n\n There was an order issued March 27, 1942, which prohibited petitioner and others of Japanese ancestry from leaving the area, but its effect was specifically limited in time 'until and to the extent that a future proclamation or order should so permit or direct.' 7 Fed.Reg. 2601. That 'future order', the one for violation of which petitioner was convicted, was issued May 3, 1942, and it did 'direct' exclusion from the area of all persons of Japanese ancestry, before 12 o'clock noon, May 9; furthermore it contained a warning that all such persons found in the prohibited area would be liable to punishment under the March 21, 1942 Act of Congress. Consequently, the only order in effect touching the petitioner's being in the area on May 30, 1942, the date specified in the information against him, was the May 3 order which prohibited his remaining there, and it was that same order, which he stipulated in his trial that he had violated, knowing of its existence. There is therefore no basis for the argument that on May 30, 1942, he was subject to punishment, under the March 27 and May 3rd orders, whether he remained in or left the area.\n\n It does appear, however, that on May 9, the effective date of the exclusion order, the military authorities had \n\n[323 \nU.S. 214, 221] already determined that the evacuation should be effected by assembling together and placing under guard all those of Japanese ancestry, at central points, designated as 'assembly centers', in order 'to insure the orderly evacuation and resettlement of Japanese voluntarily migrating from military area No. 1 to restrict and regulate such migration.' Public Proclamation No. 4, 7 Fed.Reg. 2601. And on May 19, 1942, elevan days before the time petitioner was charged with unlawfully remaining in the area, Civilian Restrictive Order No. 1, 8 Fed.Reg. 982, provided for detention of those of Japanese ancestry in assembly or relocation centers. It is now argued that the validity of the exclusion order cannot be considered apart from the orders requiring him, after departure from the area, to report and to remain in an assembly or relocation center. The contention is that we must treat these separate orders as one and inseparable; that, for this reason, if detention in the assembly or relocation center would have illegally deprived the petitioner of his liberty, the exclusion order and his conviction under it cannot stand.\n\n We are thus being asked to pass at this time upon the whole subsequent detention program in both assembly and relocation centers, although the only issues framed at the trial related to petitioner's remaining in the prohibited area in violation of the exclusion order. Had petitioner here left the prohibited area and gone to an assembly center we cannot say either as a matter of fact or law, that his presence in that center would have resulted in his detention in a relocation center. Some who did report to the assembly center were not sent to relocation centersBut were released upon condition that they remain outside the prohibited zone until the military orders were modified or lifted. This illustrates that they pose different problems and may be governed by different principles. The lawfulness of one does not necessarily determine the lawfulness of the others. This is made clear \n\n[323 \nU.S. 214, 222] when we analyze the requirements of the separate provisions of the separate orders. These separate requirements were that those of Japanese ancestry (1) depart from the area; (2) report to and temporarily remain in an assembly center; (3) go under military control to a relocation center there to remain for an indeterminate period until released conditionally or unconditionally by the military authorities. Each of these requirements, it will be noted, imposed distinct duties in connection with the separate steps in a complete evacuation program. Had Congress directly incorporated into one Act the language of these separate orders, and provided sanctions for their violations, disobedience of any one would have constituted a separate offense. Cf. Blockburger v. United States, \n284 \nU.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 182. There is no reason why violations of these orders, insofar as they were promulgated pursuant to congressional enactment, should not be treated as separate offenses.\n\n The Endo case (Ex parte Mitsuye Endo) \n323 \nU.S. 283, 65 S.Ct. 208, graphically illustrates the difference between the validity of an order to exclude and the validity of a detention order after exclusion has been effected.\n\n Since the petitioner has not been convicted of failing to report or to remain in an assembly or relocation center, we cannot in this case determine the validity of those separate provisions of the order. It is sufficient here for us to pass upon the order which petitioner violated. To do more would be to go beyond the issues raised, and to decide momentous questions not contained within the framework of the pleadings or the evidence in this case. It will be time enough to decide the serious constitutional issues which petitioner seeks to raise when an assembly or relocation order is applied or is certain to be applied to him, and we have its terms before us.\n\n Some of the members of the Court are of the view that evacuation and detention in an Assembly Center were inseparable. After May 3, 1942, the date of Exclusion \n\n[323 \nU.S. 214, 223] Order No. 34, Korematsu was under compulsion to leave the area not as he would choose but via an Assembly Center. The Assembly Center was conceived as a part of the machinery for group evacuation. The power to exclude includes the power to do it by force if necessary. And any forcible measure must necessarily entail some degree of detention or restraint whatever method of removal is selected. But whichever view is taken, it results in holding that the order under which petitioner was convicted was valid.\n\n It is said that we are dealing here with the case of imprisonment of a citizen in a concentration camp solely because of his ancestry, without evidence or inquiry concerning his loyalty and good disposition towards the United States. Our task would be simple, our duty clear, were this a case involving the imprisonment of a loyal citizen in a concentration camp because of racial prejudice. Regardless of the true nature of the assembly and relocation centers-and we deem it unjustifiable to call them concentration camps with all the ugly connotations that term implies-we are dealing specifically with nothing but an exclusion order. To cast this case into outlines of racial prejudice, without reference to the real military dangers which were presented, merely confuses the issue. Korematsu was not excluded from the Military Area because of hostility to him or his race. He was excluded because we are at war with the Japanese Empire, because the properly constituted military authorities feared an invasion of our West Coast and felt constrained to take proper security measures, because they decided that the military urgency of the situation demanded that all citizens of Japanese ancestry be segregated from the West Coast temporarily, and finally, because Congress, reposing its confidence in this time of war in our military leaders-as inevitably it must-determined that they should have the power to do just this. There was evidence of disloyalty on the part of some, the military authorities considered that the need for \n\n[323 \nU.S. 214, 224] action was great, and time was short. We cannot-by availing ourselves of the calm perspective of hindsight-now say that at that time these actions were unjustified.\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER, concurring.\n\n According to my reading of Civilian Exclusion Order No. 34, it was an offense for Korematsu to be found in Military Area No. 1, the territory wherein he was previously living, except within the bounds of the established Assembly Center of that area. Even though the various orders issued by General DeWitt be deemed a comprehensive code of instructions, their tenor is clear and not contradictory. They put upon Korematsu the obligation to leave Military Area No. 1, but only by the method prescribed in the instructions, i.e., by reporting to the Assembly Center. I am unable to see how the legal considerations that led to the decision in Kiyoshi Hirabayashi v. United States, \n320 \nU.S. 81, 63 S.Ct. 1375, fail to sustain the military order which made the conduct now in controversy a crime. And so I join in the opinion of the Court, but should like to add a few words of my own.\n\n The provisions of the Constitution which confer on the Congress and the President powers to enable this country to wage war are as much part of the Constitution as provisions looking to a nation at peace. And we have had recent occasion to quote approvingly the statement of former Chief Justice Hughes that the war power of the Government is 'the power to wage war successfully.' Hirabayashi v. United States, supra, 320 U.S. at page 93, 63 S.Ct. at page 1382 and see Home Bldg. & L. Ass'n v. Blaisdell, \n290 \nU.S. 398, 426, 54 S.Ct. 231, 235, 88 A.L.R. 1481. Therefore, the validity of action under the war power must be judged wholly in the context of war. That action is not to be stigmatized as lawless because like action in times of peace would be lawless. To talk about a military order that expresses an allowable judgment of war needs by those entrusted with the duty of conducting war as 'an \n\n[323 \nU.S. 214, 225] unconstitutional order' is to suffuse a part of the Constitution with an atmosphere of unconstitutionality. The respective spheres of action of military authorities and of judges are of course very different. But within their sphere, military authorities are no more outside the bounds of obedience to the Constitution than are judges within theirs. 'The war power of the United States, like its other powers ... is subject to applicable constitutional limitations', Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries, Co., \n251 \nU.S. 146, 156, 40 S.Ct. 106, 108. To recognize that military orders are 'reasonably expedient military precautions' in time of war and yet to deny them constitutional legitimacy makes of the Constitution an instrument for dialetic subtleties not reasonably to be attributed to the hard-headed Framers, of whom a majority had had actual participation in war. If a military order such as that under review does not transcend the means appropriate for conducting war, such action by the military is as constitutional as would be any authorized action by the Interstate Commerce Commission within the limits of the constitutional power to regulate commerce. And being an exercise of the war power explicitly granted by the Constitution for safeguarding the national life by prosecuting war effectively, I find nothing in the Constitution which denies to Congress the power to enforce such a valid military order by making its violation an offense triable in the civil courts. Compare Interstate Commerce Commission v. Brimson, \n154 \nU.S. 447, 14 S.Ct. 1125; Id., \n155 \nU.S. 3, 15 S.Ct. 19, and Monongahela Bridge Co. v. United States, \n216 \nU.S. 177, 30 S.Ct. 356. To find that theConstitution does not forbid the military measures now complained of does not carry with it approval of that which Congress and the Executive did. That is their business, not ours.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS.\n\n I dissent, because I think the indisputable facts exhibit a clear violation of Constitutional rights.\n\n This is not a case of keeping people off the streets at night as was Kiyoshi Hirabayashi v. United States, \n320 \nU.S. 81, 63 S.Ct. 1375, \n\n[323 \nU.S. 214, 226] nor a case of temporary exclusion of a citizen from an area for his own safety or that of the community, nor a case of offering him an opportunity to go temporarily out of an area where his presence might cause danger to himself or to his fellows. On the contrary, it is the case of convicting a citizen as a punishment for not submitting to imprisonment in a concentration camp, based on his ancestry, and solely because of his ancestry, without evidence or inquiry concerning his loyalty and good disposition towards the United States. If this be a correct statement of the facts disclosed by this record, and facts of which we take judicial notice, I need hardly labor the conclusion that Constitutional rights have been violated.\n\n The Government's argument, and the opinion of the court, in my judgment, erroneously divide that which is single and indivisible and thus make the case appear as if the petitioner violated a Military Order, sanctioned by Act of Congress, which excluded him from his home, by refusing voluntarily to leave and, so, knowingly and intentionally, defying the order and the Act of Congress.\n\n The petitioner, a resident of San Leandro, Alameda County, California, is a native of the United States of Japanese ancestry who, according to the uncontradicted evidence, is a loyal citizen of the nation.\n\n A chronological recitation of events will make it plain that the petitioner's supposed offense did not, in truth, consist in his refusal voluntarily to leave the area which included his home in obedience to the order excluding him therefrom. Critical attention must be given to the dates and sequence of events.\n\n December 8, 1941, the United States declared war on Japan.\n\n February 19, 1942, the President issued Executive Order No. 9066,1 which, after stating the reason for issuing the \n\n[323 \nU.S. 214, 227] order as 'protection against espionage and against sabotage to national- defense material, national-defense premises, and national-defense utilities', provided that certain Military Commanders might, in their discretion, 'prescribe military areas' and define their extent, 'from which any or all persons may be excluded, and with respect to which, the right of any person to enter, remain in, or leave shall be subject to whatever restrictions' the 'Military Commander may impose in his discretion.'\n\n February 20, 1942, Lieutenant General DeWitt was designated Military Commander of the Western Defense Command embracing the westernmost states of the Union,-about one-fourth of the total area of the nation.\n\n March 2, 1942, General DeWitt promulgated Public Proclamation No. 1,2 which recites that the entire Pacific Coast is 'particularly subject to attack, to attempted invasion ... and, in connection therewith, is subject to espionage and acts of sabotage'. It states that 'as a matter of military necessity' certain military areas and zones are established known as Military Areas Nos. 1 and 2. It adds that 'Such persons or classes of persons as the situation may require' will, by subsequent orders, 'be excluded from all of Military Area No. 1' and from certain zones in Military Area No. 2. Subsequent proclamations were made which, together with Proclamation No. 1, included in such areas and zones all of California, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Nevada and Utah, and the southern portion of Arizona. The orders required that if any person of Japanese, German or Italian ancestry residing in Area No. 1 desired to change his habitual residence he must execute and deliver to the authorities a Change of Residence Notice.\n\n San Leandro, the city of petitioner's residence, lies in Military Area No. 1. \n\n[323 \nU.S. 214, 228] On March 2, 1942, the petitioner, therefore, had notice that, by Executive Order, the President, to prevent espionage and sabotage, had authorized the Military to exclude him from certain areas and to prevent his entering or leaving certain areas without permission. He was on notice that his home city had been included, by Military Order, in Area No. 1, and he was on notice further that, at sometime in the future, the Military Commander would make an order for the exclusion of certain persons, not described or classified, from various zones including that in which he lived.\n\n March 21, 1942, Congress enacted3 that anyone who knowingly 'shall enter, remain in, leave, or commit any act in any military area or military zone prescribed ... by any military commander ... contrary to the restrictions applicable to any such area or zone or contrary to the order of ... any such military commander' shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. This is the Act under which the petitioner was charged.\n\n March 24, 1942, General DeWitt instituted the curfew for certain areas within his command, by an order the validity of which was sustained in Hirabayashi v. United States, supra.\n\n March 24, 1942, General DeWitt began to issue a series of exclusion orders relating to specified areas.\n\n March 27, 1942, by Proclamation No. 4,4 the General recited that 'it is necessary, in order to provide for the welfare and to insure the orderly evacuation and resettlement of Japanese voluntarily migrating from Military Area No. 1 to restrict and regulate such migration'; and ordered that, as of March 29, 1942, 'all alien Japanese and persons of Japanese ancestry who are within the limits of Military Area No. 1, be and they are hereby \n\n[323 \nU.S. 214, 229] prohibited from leaving that area for any purpose until and to the extent that a future proclamation or order of this headquarters shall so permit or direct.' \n5\n\n No order had been made excluding the petitioner from the area in which he lived. By Proclamation No. 4 he was, after March 29, 1942, confined to the limits of Area No. 1. If the Executive Order No. 9066 and the Act of Congress meant what they said, to leave that area, in the face of Proclamation No. 4, would be to commit a misdemeanor.\n\n May 3, 1942, General DeWitt issued Civilian Exclusion Order No. 346 providing that, after 12 o'clock May 8, 1942, all persons of Japanese ancestry, both alien and non-alien, were to be excluded from a described portion of Military Area No. 1, which included the County of Alameda, California. The order required a responsible member of each family and each individual living alone to report, at a time set, at a Civil Control Station for instructions to go to an Assembly Center, and added that any person failing to comply with the provisions of the order who was found in the described area after the date set would be liable to prosecution under the Act of March 21, 1942, supra. It is important to note that the order, by its express terms, had no application to persons within the bounds 'of an established Assembly Center pursuant to instructions from this Headquarters ....' The obvious purpose of the orders made, taken together, was to drive all citizens of Japanese ancestry into Assembly Centers within the zones of their residence, under pain of criminal prosecution. \n\n[323 \nU.S. 214, 230] The predicament in which the petitioner thus found himself was this: He was forbidden, by Military Order, to leave the zone in which he lived; he was forbidden, by Military Order, after a date fixed, to be found within that zone unless he were in an Assembly Center located in that zone. General DeWitt's report to the Secretary of War concerning the programme of evacuation and relocation of Japanese makes it entirely clear, if it were necessary to refer to that document,-and, in the light of the above recitation, I think it is not,-that an Assembly Center was a euphemism for a prison. No person within such a center was permitted to leave except by Military Order.\n\n In the dilemma that he dare not remain in his home, or voluntarily leave the area, without incurring criminal penalties, and that the only way he could avoid punishment was to go to an Assembly Center and submit himself to military imprisonment, the petitioner did nothing.\n\n June 12, 1942, an Information was filed in the District Court for Northern California charging a violation of the Act of March 21, 1942, in that petitioner had knowingly remained within the area covered by Exclusion Order No. 34. A demurrer to the information having been overruled, the petitioner was tried under a plea of not guilty and convicted. Sentence was suspended and he was placed on probation for five years. We know, however, in the light of the foregoing recitation, that he was at once taken into military custody and lodged in an Assembly Center. We further know that, on March 18, 1942, the President had promulgated Executive Order No. 91027 establishing the War Relocation Authority under which so-called Relocation Centers, a enphemism for concentration camps, were established pursuant to cooperation between the military authorities of the Western Defense Command and the Relocation Authority, and that the petitioner has \n\n[323 \nU.S. 214, 231] been confined either in an Assembly Center, within the zone in which he had lived or has been removed to a Relocation Center where, as the facts disclosed in Ex parte Mitsuye Endo, \n323 \nU.S. 283, 65 S.Ct. 208, demonstrate, he was illegally held in custody.\n\n The Government has argued this case as if the only order outstanding at the time the petitioner was arrested and informed against was Exclusion Order No. 34 ordering him to leave the area in which he resided, which was the basis of the information against him. That argument has evidently been effective. The opinion refers to the Hirabayashi case, supra, to show that this court has sustained the validity of a curfew order in an emergency. The argument then is that exclusion from a given area of danger, while somewhat more sweeping than a curfew regulation, is of the same nature,-a temporary expedient made necessary by a sudden emergency. This, I think, is a substitution of an hypothetical case for the case actually before the court. I might agree with the court's disposition of the hypothetical case. \n8 The liberty of every American citizen freely to come and to go must frequently, in the face of sudden danger, be temporarily limited or suspended. The civil authorities must often resort to the expedient of excluding citizens temporarily from a locality. The drawing of fire lines in the case of a conflagration, the removal of persons from the area where a pestilence has broken out, are familiar examples. If the exclusion worked by Exclusion Order No. 34 were of that nature the Hirabayashi case would be authority for sustaining it. \n\n[323 \nU.S. 214, 232] But the facts above recited, and those set forth in Ex parte Metsuye Endo, supra, show that the exclusion was but a part of an over-all plan for forceable detention. This case cannot, therefore, be decided on any such narrow ground as the possible validity of a Temporary Exclusion Order under which the residents of an area are given an opportunity to leave and go elsewhere in their native land outside the boundaries of a military area. To make the case turn on any such assumption is to shut our eyes to reality.\n\n As I have said above, the petitioner, prior to his arrest, was faced with two diametrically contradictory orders given sanction by the Act of Congress of March 21, 1942. The earlier of those orders made him a criminal if he left the zone in which he resided; the later made him a criminal if he did not leave.\n\n I had supposed that if a citizen was constrained by two laws, or two orders having the force of law, and obedience to one would violate the other, to punish him for violation of either would deny him due process of law. And I had supposed that under these circumstances a conviction for violating one of the orders could not stand.\n\n We cannot shut our eyes to the fact that had the petitioner attempted to violate Proclamation No. 4 and leave the military area in which he lived he would have been arrested and tried and convicted for violation of Proclamation No. 4. The two conflicting orders, one which commanded him to stay and the other which commanded him to go, were nothing but a cleverly devised trap to accomplish the real purpose of the military authority, which was to lock him up in a concentration camp. The only course by which the petitioner could avoid arrest and prosecution was to go to that camp according to instructions to be given him when he reported at a Civil Control Center. We know that is the fact. Why should we set up a figmentary and artificial situation instead of addressing ourselves to the actualities of the case? \n\n[323 \nU.S. 214, 233] These stark realities are met by the suggestion that it is lawful to compel an American citizen to submit to illegal imprisonment on the assumption that he might, after going to the Assembly Center, apply for his discharge by suing out a writ of habeas corpus, as was done in the Endo case, supra. The answer, of course, is that where he was subject to two conflicting laws he was not bound, in order to escape violation of one of the other, to surrender his liberty for any period. Nor will it do to say that the detention was a necessary part of the process of evacuation, and so we are here concerned only with the validity of the latter.\n\n Again it is a new doctrine of constitutional law that one indicted for disobedience to an unconstitutional statute may not defend on the ground of the invalidity of the statute but must obey it though he knows it is no law and, after he has suffered the disgrace of conviction and lost his liberty by sentence, then, and not before, seek, from within prison walls, to test the validity of the law.\n\n Moreover, it is beside the point to rest decision in part on the fact that the petitioner, for his own reasons, wished to remain in his home. If, as is the fact he was constrained so to do, it is indeed a narrow application of constitutional rights to ignore the order which constrained him, in order to sustain his conviction for violation of another contradictory order.\n\n I would reverse the judgment of conviction.\n\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY, dissenting.\n\n This exclusion of 'all persons of Japanese ancestry, both alien and non-alien,' from the Pacific Coast area on a plea of military necessity in the absence of martial law ought not to be approved. Such exclusion goes over 'the very brink of constitutional power' and falls into the ugly abyss of racism.\n\n In dealing with matters relating to the prosecution and progress of a war, we must accord great respect and con- \n\n[323 \nU.S. 214, 234] sideration to the judgments of the military authorities who are on the scene and who have full knowledge of the military facts. The scope of their discretion must, as a matter of necessity and common sense, be wide. And their judgments ought not to be overruled lightly by those whose training and duties ill-equip them to deal intelligently with matters so vital to the physical security of the nation.\n\n At the same time, however, it is essential that there be definite limits to military discretion, especially where martial law has not been declared. Individuals must not be left impoverished of their constitutional rights on a plea of military necessity that has neither substance nor support. Thus, like other claims conflicting with the asserted constitutional rights of the individual, the military claim must subject itself to the judicial process of having its reasonableness determined and its conflicts with other interests reconciled. 'What are the allowable limits of military discretion, and whether or not they have been overstepped in a particular case, are judicial questions.' Sterling v. Constantin, \n287 \nU.S. 378, 401, 53 S.Ct. 190, 196.\n\n The judicial test of whether the Government, on a plea of military necessity, can validly deprive an individual of any of his constitutional rights is whether the deprivation is reasonably related to a public danger that is so 'immediate, imminent, and impending' as not to admit of delay and not to permit the intervention of ordinary constitutional processes to alleviate the danger. United States v. Russell, 13 Wall. 623, 627, 628; Mitchell v. Harmony, 13 How. 115, 134, 135; Raymond v. Thomas, \n91 \nU.S. 712, 716. Civilian Exclusion Order No. 34, banishing from a prescribed area of the Pacific Coast 'all persons of Japanese ancestry, both alien and non-alien,' clearly does not meet that test. Being an obvious racial discrimination, the \n\n[323 \nU.S. 214, 235] order deprives all those within its scope of the equal protection of the laws as guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment. It further deprives these individuals of their constitutional rights to live and work where they will, to establish a home where they choose and to move about freely. In excommunicating them without benefit of hearings, this order also deprives them of all their constitutional rights to procedural due process. Yet no reasonable relation to an 'immediate, imminent, and impending' public danger is evident to support this racial restriction which is one of the most sweeping and complete deprivations of constitutional rights in the history of this nation in the absence of martial law.\n\n It must be conceded that the military and naval situation in the spring of 1942 was such as to generate a very real fear of invasion of the Pacific Coast, accompanied by fears of sabotage and espionage in that area. The military command was therefore justified in adopting all reasonable means necessary to combat these dangers. In adjudging the military action taken in light of the then apparent dangers, we must not erect too high or too meticulous standards; it is necessary only that the action have some reasonable relation to the removal of the dangers of invasion, sabotage and espionage. But the exclusion, either temporarily or permanently, of all persons with Japanese blood in their veins has no such reasonable relation. And that relation is lacking because the exclusion order necessarily must rely for its reasonableness upon the assumption that all persons of Japanese ancestry may have a dangerous tendency to commit sabotage and espionage and to aid our Japanese enemy in other ways. It is difficult to believe that reason, logic or experience could be marshalled in support of such an assumption.\n\n That this forced exclusion was the result in good measure of this erroneous assumption of racial guilt rather than \n\n[323 \nU.S. 214, 236] bona fide military necessity is evidenced by the Commanding General's Final Report on the evacuation from the Pacific Coast area. \n1 In it he refers to all individuals of Japanese descent as 'subversive,' as belonging to 'an enemy race' whose 'racial strains are undiluted,' and as constituting 'over 112,000 potential enemies ... at large today' along the Pacific Coast. \n2 In support of this blanket condemnation of all persons of Japanese descent, however, no reliable evidence is cited to show that such individuals were generally disloyal,3 or had generally so conducted themselves in this area as to constitute a special menace to defense installations or war industries, or had otherwise by their behavior furnished reasonable ground for their exclusion as a group.\n\n Justification for the exclusion is sought, instead, mainly upon questionable racial and sociological grounds not \n\n[323 \nU.S. 214, 237] ordinarily within the realm of expert military judgment, supplemented by certain semi-military conclusions drawn from an unwarranted use of circumstantial evidence. Individuals of Japanese ancestry are condemned because they are said to be 'a large, unassimilated, tightly knit racial group, bound to an enemy nation by strong ties of race, culture, custom and religion.' \n4 They are claimed to be given to 'emperor worshipping ceremonies'5 and to 'dual citizenship.' \n6 Japanese language schools and allegedly pro-Japanese organizations are cited as evidence of possible group disloyalty,7 together with facts as to \n\n[323 \nU.S. 214, 238] certain persons being educated and residing at length in Japan. \n8 It is intimated that many of these individuals deliberately resided 'adjacent to strategic points,' thus enabling them 'to carry into execution a tremendous program of sabotage on a mass scale should any considerable number of them have been inclined to do so.'9 The need for protective custody is also asserted. The report refers without identity to 'numerous incidents of violence' as well as to other admittedly unverified or cumulative incidents. From this, plus certain other events not shown to have been connected with the Japanese Americans, it is concluded that the 'situation was fraught with danger to the Japanese population itself' and that the general public 'was ready to take matters into its own hands.' \n10 Finally, it is intimated, though not directly \n\n[323 \nU.S. 214, 239] charged or proved, that persons of Japanese ancestry were responsible for three minor isolated shellings and bombings of the Pacific Coast area,11 as well as for unidentified radio transmissions and night signalling.\n\n The main reasons relied upon by those responsible for the forced evacuation, therefore, do not prove a reasonable relation between the group characteristics of Japanese Americans and the dangers of invasion, sabotage and espionage. The reasons appear, instead, to be largely an accumulation of much of the misinformation, half-truths and insinuations that for years have been directed against Japanese Americans by people with racial and economic prejudices-the same people who have been among the foremost advocates of the evacuation. \n12 A military judg- \n\n[323 \nU.S. 214, 240] ment based upon such racial and sociological considerations is not entitled to the great weight ordinarily given the judgments based upon strictly military considerations. Especially is this so when every charge relative to race, religion, culture, geographical location, and legal and economic status has been substantially discredited by independent studies made by experts in these matters. \n13\n\n The military necessity which is essential to the validity of the evacuation order thus resolves itself into a few intimations that certain individuals actively aided the enemy, from which it is inferred that the entire group of Japanese Americans could not be trusted to be or remain loyal to the United States. No one denies, of course, that there were some disloyal persons of Japanese descent on the Pacific Coast who did all in their power to aid their ancestral land. Similar disloyal activities have been engaged in by many persons of German, Italian and even more pioneer stock in our country. But to infer that examples of individual disloyalty prove group disloyalty and justify discriminatory action against the entire group is to deny that under our system of law individual guilt is the sole basis for deprivation of rights. Moreover, this inference, which is at the very heart of the evacuation orders, has been used in support of the abhorrent and despicable treatment of minority groups by the dictatorial tyrannies which this nation is now pledged to destroy. To give constitutional sanction to that inference in this case, however well- intentioned may have been the military command on the Pacific Coast, is to adopt one of the cruelest of the rationales used by our enemies to destroy the dignity of the individual and to encourage and open the door to discriminatory actions against other minority groups in the passions of tomorrow. \n\n[323 \nU.S. 214, 241] No adequate reason is given for the failure to treat these Japanese Americans on an individual basis by holding investigations and hearings to separate the loyal from the disloyal, as was done in the case of persons of German and Italian ancestry. See House Report No. 2124 (77th Cong., 2d Sess.) 247-52. It is asserted merely that the loyalties of this group 'were unknown and time was of the essence.' \n14 Yet nearly four months elapsed after Pearl Harbor before the first exclusion order was issued; nearly eight months went by until the last order was issued; and the last of these 'subversive' persons was not actually removed until almost eleven months had elapsed. Leisure and deliberation seem to have been more of the essence than speed. And the fact that conditions were not such as to warrant a declaration of martial law adds strength to the belief that the factors of time and military necessity were not as urgent as they have been represented to be.\n\n Moreover, there was no adequate proof that the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the military and naval intelligence services did not have the espionage and sabotage situation well in hand during this long period. Nor is there any denial of the fact that not one person of Japanese ancestry was accused or convicted of espionage or sabotage after Pearl Harbor while they were still free,15 a fact which is some evidence of the loyalty of the vast majority of these individuals and of the effectiveness of the established methods of combatting these evils. It \n\n[323 \nU.S. 214, 242] seems incredible that under these circumstances it would have been impossible to hold loyalty hearings for the mere 112,000 persons involved- or at least for the 70,000 American citizens-especially when a large part of this number represented children and elderly men and women.16 Any inconvenience that may have accompanied an attempt to conform to procedural due process cannot be said to justify violations of constitutional rights of individuals.\n\n I dissent, therefore, from this legalization of racism. Racial discrimination in any form and in any degree has no justifiable part whatever in our democratic way of life. It is unattractive in any setting but it is utterly revolting among a free people who have embraced the principles set forth in the Constitution of the United States. All residents of this nation are kin in some way by blood or culture to a foreign land. Yet they are primarily and necessarily a part of the new and distinct civilization of the United States. They must accordingly be treated at all times as the heirs of the American experiment and as entitled to all the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution.\n\n\n Mr. Justice JACKSON, dissenting.\n\n Korematsu was born on our soil, of parents born in Japan. The Constitution makes him a citizen of the United States by nativity and a citizen of California by \n\n[323 \nU.S. 214, 243] residence. No claim is made that he is not loyal to this country. There is no suggestion that apart from the matter involved here he is not law- abiding and well disposed. Korematsu, however, has been convicted of an act not commonly a crime. It consists merely of being present in the state whereof he is a citizen, near the place where he was born, and where all his life he has lived.\n\n Even more unusual is the series of military orders which made this conduct a crime. They forbid such a one to remain, and they also forbid him to leave. They were so drawn that the only way Korematsu could avoid violation was to give himself up to the military authority. This meant submission to custody, examination, and transportation out of the territory, to be followed by indeterminate confinement in detention camps.\n\n A citizen's presence in the locality, however, was made a crime only if his parents were of Japanese birth. Had Korematsu been one of four-the others being, say, a German alien enemy, an Italian alien enemy, and a citizen of American-born ancestors, convicted of treason but out on parole- only Korematsu's presence would have violated the order. The difference between their innocence and his crime would result, not from anything he did, said, or thought, different than they, but only in that he was born of different racial stock.\n\n Now, if any fundamental assumption underlies our system, it is that guilt is personal and not inheritable. Even if all of one's antecedents had been convicted of treason, the Constitution forbids its penalties to be visited upon him, for it provides that 'no Attainder of Treason shall work Corruption of Blood, or Forfeiture except during the Life of the Person attained.' Article 3,  3, cl. 2. But here is an attempt to make an otherwise innocent act a crime merely because this prisoner is the son of parents as to whom he had no choice, and belongs to a race from which there is no way to resign. If Congress in peace-time legislation should \n\n[323 \nU.S. 214, 244] enact such a criminal law, I should suppose this Court would refuse to enforce it.\n\n But the 'law' which this prisoner is convicted of disregarding is not found in an act of Congress, but in a military order. Neither the Act of Congress nor the Executive Order of the President, nor both together, would afford a basis for this conviction. It rests on the orders of General DeWitt. And it is said that if the military commander had reasonable military grounds for promulgating the orders, they are constitutional and become law, and the Court is required to enforce them. There are several reasons why I cannot subscribe to this doctrine.\n\n It would be impracticable and dangerous idealism to expect or insist that each specific military command in an area of probable operations will conform to conventional tests of constitutionality. When an area is so beset that it must be put under military control at all, the paramount consideration is that its measures be successful, rather than legal. The armed services must protect a society, not merely its Constitution. The very essence of the military job is to marshal physical force, to remove every obstacle to its effectiveness, to give it every strategic advantage. Defense measures will not, and often should not, be held within the limits that bind civil authority in peace. No court can require such a commander in such circumstances to act as a reasonable man; he may be unreasonably cautious and exacting. Perhaps he should be. But a commander in temporarily focusing the life of a community on defense is carrying out a military program; he is not making law in the sense the courts know the term. He issues orders, and they may have a certain authority as military commands, although they may be very bad as constitutional law.\n\n But if we cannot confine military expedients by the Constitution, neither would I distort the Constitution to approve all that the military may deem expedient. This is \n\n[323 \nU.S. 214, 245] what the Court appears to be doing, whether consciously or not. I cannot say, from any evidence before me, that the orders of General DeWitt were not reasonably expedient military precautions, nor could I say that they were. But even if they were permissible military procedures, I deny that it follows that they are constitutional. If, as the Court holds, it does follow, then we may as well say that any military order will be constitutional and have done with it.\n\n The limitation under which courts always will labor in examining the necessity for a military order are illustrated by this case. How does the Court know that these orders have a reasonable basis in necessity? No evidence whatever on that subject has been taken by this or any other court. There is sharp controversy as to the credibility of the DeWitt report. So the Court, having no real evidence before it, has no choice but to accept General DeWitt's own unsworn, self-serving statement, untested by any cross-examination, that what he did was reasonable. And thus it will always be when courts try to look into the reasonableness of a military order.\n\n In the very nature of things military decisions are not susceptible of intelligent judicial appraisal. They do not pretend to rest on evidence, but are made on information that often would not be admissible and on assumptions that could not be proved. Information in support of an order could not be disclosed to courts without danger that it would reach the enemy. Neither can courts act on communications made in confidence. Hence courts can never have any real alternative to accepting the mere declaration of the authority that issued the order that it was reasonably necessary from a military viewpoint.\n\n Much is said of the danger to liberty from the Army program for deporting and detaining these citizens of Japanese extraction. But a judicial construction of the due process clause that will sustain this order is a farm more \n\n[323 \nU.S. 214, 246] subtle blow to liberty than the promulgation of the order itself. A military order, however unconstitutional, is not apt to last longer than the military emergency. Even during that period a succeeding commander may revoke it all. But once a judicial opinion rationalizes such an order to show that it conforms to the Constitution, or rather rationalizes the Constitution to show that the Constitution sanctions such an order, the Court for all time has validated the principle of racial discrimination in criminal procedure and of transplanting American citizens. The principle then lies about like a loaded weapon ready for the hand of any authority that can bring forward a plausible claim of an urgent need. Every repetition imbeds that principle more deeply in our law and thinking and expands it to new purposes. All who observe the work of courts are familiar with what Judge Cardozo described as 'the tendency of a principle to expand itself to the limit of its logic.' \n1 A military commander may overstep the bounds of constitutionality, and it is an incident. But if we review and approve, that passing incident becomes the doctrine of the Constitution. There it has a generative power of its own, and all that it creates will be in its own image. Nothing better illustrates this danger than does the Court's opinion in this case.\n\n It argues that we are bound to uphold the conviction of Korematsu because we upheld one in Kiyshi Hirabayashi v. United States, \n320 \nU.S. 81, 63 S.Ct. 1375, when we sustained these orders in so far as they applied a curfew requirement to a citizen of Japanese ancestry. I think we should learn something from that experience.\n\n In that case we were urged to consider only that curfew feature, that being all that technically was involved, because it was the only count necessary to sustain Hirabayashi's conviction and sentence. We yielded, and the Chief Justice guarded the opinion as carefully as language \n\n[323 \nU.S. 214, 247] will do. He said: 'Our investigation here does not go beyond the inquiry whether, in the light of all the relevant circumstances preceding and attending their promulgation, the challenged orders and statute afforded a reasonable basis for the action taken in imposing the curfew.' 320 U.S. at page 101, 63 S.Ct. at page 1386. 'We decide only the issue as we have defined it-we decide only that the curfew order as applied, and at the time it was applied, was within the boundaries of the war power.' 320 U.S. at page 102, 63 S.Ct. at page 1386. And again: 'It is unnecessary to consider whether or to what extent such findings would support orders differing from the curfew order.' 320 U.S. at page 105, 63 S.Ct. at page 1387. (Italics supplied.) However, in spite of our limiting words we did validate a discrimination of the basis of ancestry for mild and temporary deprivation of liberty. Now the principle of racial discrimination is pushed from support of mild measures to very harsh ones, and from temporary deprivations to indeterminate ones. And the precedent which it is said requires us to do so is Hirabayashi. The Court is now saying that in Hirabayashi we did decide the very things we there said we were not deciding. Because we said that these citizens could be made to stay in their homes during the hours of dark, it is said we must require them to leave home entirely; and if that, we are told they may also be taken into custody for deportation; and if that, it is argued they may also be held for some undetermined time in detention camps. How far the principle of this case would be extended before plausible reasons would play out, I do not know.\n\n I should hold that a civil court cannot be made to enforce an order which violates constitutional limitations even if it is a reasonable exercise of military authority. The courts can exercise only the judicial power, can apply only law, and must abide by the Constitution, or they cease to be civil courts and become instruments of military policy. \n\n[323 \nU.S. 214, 248] Of course the existence of a military power resting on force, so vagrant, so centralized, so necessarily heedless of the individual, is an inherent threat to liberty. But I would not lead people to rely on this Court for a review that seems to me wholly delusive. The military reasonableness of these orders can only be determined by military superiors. If the people ever let command of the war power fall into irresponsible and unscrupulous hands, the courts wield no power equal to its restraint. The chief restraint upon those who command the physical forces of the country, in the future as in the past, must be their responsibility to the political judgments of their contemporaries and to the moral judgments of history.\n\n My duties as a justice as I see them do not require me to make a military judgment as to whether General DeWitt's evacuation and detention program was a reasonable military necessity. I do not suggest that the courts should have attempted to interfere with the Army in carrying out its task. But I do not think they may be asked to execute a military expedient that has no place in law under the Constitution I would reverse the judgment and discharge the prisoner. \nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1] 140 F.2d 289.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2] Hearings before the Subcommittee on the National War Agencies Appropriation Bill for 1945, Part II, 608-726; Final Report, Japanese Evacuation from the West Coast, 1942, 309-327; Hearings before the Committee on Immigration and Naturalization, House of Representatives, 78th Cong., 2d Sess., on H.R. 2701 and other bills to expatriate certain nationals of the United States, pp. 37-42, 49-58. \n\n\n[\nFootnote 1] 7 Fed.Reg. 1407. \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2] 7 Fed.Reg. 2320. \n\n\n[\nFootnote 3] 56 Stat. 173, 18 U.S.C.A.  97a. \n\n[\nFootnote 4] 7 Fed.Reg. 2601. \n\n\n[\nFootnote 5] The italics in the quotation are mine.

They are a dangerous element. There is no way to determine their loyalty. The west coast contains too many vital installations essential to the defense of the country to allow any Japanese on this coast. ... The danger of the Japanese was, and is now-if they are permitted to come back-espionage and sabotage. It makes no difference whether he is an American citizen, he is still a Japanese. American citizenship does not necessarily determine loyalty. ... But we must worry about the Japanese all the time until he is wiped off the map. Sabotage and espionage will make problems as long as he is allowed in this area. ...' \n\n[\nFootnote 3] The Final Report, p. 9, casts a cloud of suspicion over the entire group by saying that 'while it was believed that some were loyal, it was known that many were not.'

To the extent that assimilation is a problem, it is largely the result of certain social customs and laws of the American general public. Studies demonstrate that persons of Japanese descent are readily susceptible to integration in our society if given the opportunity. Strong, The Second-Generation Japanese Problem (1934); Smith, Americans in Process (1937); Mears, Resident Orientals on the American Pacific Coast (1928); Millis, The Japanese Problem in the United States (1942). The failure to accomplish an ideal status of assimilation, therefore, cannot be charged to the refusal of these persons to become Americanized or to their loyalty to Japan. And the retention by some persons of certain customs and religious practices of their ancestors is no criterion of their loyalty to the United States. \n\n[\nFootnote 5] Final Report, pp. 10-11. No sinister correlation between the emperor worshipping activities and disloyalty to America was shown. \n\n[\nFootnote 6] Final Report, p. 22. The charge of 'dual citizenship' springs from a misunderstanding of the simple fact that Japan in the past used the doctrine of jus sanguinis, as she had a right to do under international law, and claimed as her citizens all persons born of Japanese nationals wherever located. Japan has greatly modified this doctrine, however, by allowing all Japanese born in the United States to renounce any claim of dual citizenship and by releasing her claim as to all born in the United States after 1925.

This insinuation, based purely upon speculation and circumstantial evidence, completely overlooks the fact that the main geographic pattern of Japanese population was fixed many years ago with reference to economic, social and soil conditions. Limited occupational outlets and social pressures encouraged their concentration near their initial points of entry on the Pacific Coast. That these points may now be near certain strategic military and industrial areas is no proof of a diabolical purpose on the part of Japanese Americans.

They undersell the white man in the markets. ... They work their women and children while the white farmer has to pay wages for his help,. If all the Japs were removed tomorrow, we'd never miss them in two weeks, because the white farmers can take over and produce everything the Jap grows. And we don't want them back when the war ends, either.' Quoted by Taylor in his article 'The People Nobody Wants,' 214 Sat. Eve.

Louisville & N.R. Co., Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen & Enginemen et al., \n323 \nU.S. 192\n, 65 S. Ct. 226, in which we answered in the affirmative a question also presented in this case. The question is whether the Railway Labor Act, 48 Stat. 1185, 45 U.S.C.  151 et seq., 45 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq., imposes on a labor organization, acting as the exclusive bargaining representative of a craft or class of railway employees, the duty to represent all the employees in the craft without discrimination because of their race. The further question in this case is whether the federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain a non-diversity suit in which petitioner, a railway employee subject to the Act, seeks remedies by injunction and award of damages for the failure of the union bargaining representative of his craft to perform the duty imposed on it by the Act, to represent petitioner and other members of his craft without discrimination because of race.\n Petitioner, a Negro fireman, employed by the Norfolk & Southern Railway, brought this suit in the District Court against the Railway, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Fire- \n\n[323 \nU.S. 210, 212]\n\u00a0\n men and Enginemen and certain of its subsidiary lodges, and one of its officers, setting up, in all material respects, a cause of action like that alleged in the Steele case. The Brotherhood, a labor union, is the designated bargaining representative under the Railway Labor Act, for the craft of firemen of which petitioner is a member, and is accepted as such by the Railway and its employees.\n Acting as such the Brotherhood gave to the Railroad the notice of March 28, 1940, and later entered into the contract of February 18, 1941 and its subsequent modifications, all of which were the subject of our consideration in the Steele case. Petitioner complains of the discriminatory application of the contract provisions to him and other Negro members of his craft in favor of 'promotable', i.e., white, firemen, by which he has been deprived of his preexisting seniority rights, removed from the interstate passenger run to which he was assigned and then assigned to more arduous and difficult work with longer hours in yard service, his place in the passenger service being filled by a white fireman.\n He alleges that the contract was signed and put into effect without notice to him or other Negro members of his craft, and without opportunity for them to be heard with respect to its terms, and that his protests and demands for relief to the Railway and the Brotherhood have been unavailing. Petitioner prays for a declaratory adjudication of his rights, for an injunction restraining the discriminatory practices complained of, for an award of damages and for other relief.\n The District Court dismissed the suit for want of jurisdiction. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed, 140 F.2d 35, on the ground that the federal courts are without jurisdiction of the cause, there being no diversity of citizenship and, insofar as the suit is grounded on the wrongful acts of respondents, it is not one arising under the laws of the United States, even \n\n[323 \nU.S. 210, 213]\n\u00a0\n though the union was chosen as bargaining representative pursuant to the Railway Labor Act. See Gully v. First Nat. Bank, \n299 \nU.S. 109, 112\n, 114 S., 57 S.Ct. 96, 97, 98.\n For the reasons stated in our opinion in the Steele case the Railway Labor Act itself does not exclude the petitioner's cause of action from the consideration of the federal courts.

National Mediation Board, \n320 \nU.S. 297\n, 64 S.Ct. 95; General Committee of Adjustments of Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers for Missouri-Kansas-Texas R. v. Missouri-Kansas-Texas R.

It is the federal statute which condemns as unlawful the Brotherhood's conduct. 'The extent and nature of the legal consequences of this condemnation though left by the statute to judicial determination, are nevertheless to be derived from it and the federal policy which it has adopted.'

As other jurisdictional questions were raised in the courts below which have not been considered by the Court of Appeals, the case will be remanded to that court for further proceedings.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice MURPHY concurs in the result for the reasons expressed in his concurring opinion in Steele v. Louisville & N.R. Co. \n\n\n\n","108":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU. S. v. AMERICAN SURETY CO.(1944)\nNo. 381\nArgued: Decided: April 24, 1944\n\n\n\n Mr. Robert L. Stern, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Homer Cummings, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On June 24, 1931, one John V. Grogan entered into a contract1 with the United States to construct certain public buildings at the United States Inspection Station at \n\n[322 \nU.S. 96, 97]\n\u00a0\n Babb-Piegan, Montana. Respondent became the surety on Grogan's performance bond to the United States. The completion date of the contract was March 4, 1932, but this was extended to June 20, 1933. Grogan failed to complete the work by the extended date. The Government, however, allowed him to continue with the construction. On July 20, 1934, thirteen months later, the work was still uncompleted. Pursuant to its authority under Article 9 of the construction contract, the Government thereupon terminated Grogan's right to proceed with the work because of his continuing default. The Government finished the work through another contractor, expending $2,044. 04 more than it would have been required to expend had Grogan completed the work.\n The United States brought this suit in the District Court to recover the excess cost and also to recover liquidated damages of $9,875 for the delay occasioned by Grogan's default. The liquidated damages were computed on the basis of an agreed $25 per day for the 395 days between June 20, 1933, the extended date for completion, and July 20, 1934, when the contract right to proceed was terminated. Grogan was not served and never appeared. The District Court denied respondent's motion to strike from the complaint the paragraph alleging a right to liquidated damages. United States v. Grogan, D.C., 39 F.Supp. 819. The court subsequently rendered judgment, after trial without a jury, for the United States for $2,044.04 as excess cost of completion and $9,875 as liquidated damages for delay. See United States v. Grogan, D.C., 44 F.Supp. 871. On appeal, the court below affirmed the judgment as to the excess cost but reversed as to the liquidated damages. American Surety Co. v. United States, 9 Cir., 136 F.2d 437. The public importance of the issue of the Government's right to liquidated damages under these circumstances led us to grant certiorari. \n320 \nU.S. 729\n, 64 S.Ct. 190. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 96, 98]\n\u00a0\n Section 21 of the Act of June 6, 1902,2 provides that all contracts for the construction of any public building under the control of the Treasury Department shall contain a stipulation calling for liquidated damages for delay in completion of the work and that such stipulation shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties. Proof of actual damages is rendered unnecessary. This statute, however, does not purport to require liquidated damages to be paid in amounts or under circumstances beyond those stipulated by the parties. Robinson v. United States, \n261 \nU.S. 486, 488\n, 43 S.Ct. 420, 421. It was pursuant to this statutory command that Article 9 of the construction contract in issue was inserted. Thus this article is determinative of the Government's right to liquidated damages under the circumstances of this case.\n Article 9, set out in the margin,3 provides in effect that: (1) if the contractor refuses or fails to prosecute the work \n\n[322 \nU.S. 96, 99]\n\u00a0\n with proper diligence or to complete his work within the specified time, the Government may at any time terminate his right to proceed and prosecute the same to completion by contract or otherwise, in which case the Government may recover from the contractor or his surety any excess cost occasioned thereby; (2) 'if the Government does not terminate the right of the contractor to proceed, the contractor shall continue the work, in which event the actual damages for the delay will be impossible to determine and in lieu thereof the contractor shall pay to the Government as fixed, agreed, and liquidated damages for each calendar day of delay until the work is completed or accepted the amount set forth in the specifications.' In this instance, paragraph 5 of the accompanying specifications provides that 'the contractor shall pay to the government the amount of Twenty-Five Dollars ($25.00) as fixed, agreed, and liquidated damages for each calendar day's delay in the completion of the contract.' This paragraph merely provides the agreed rate of the per diem liquidated damages to be paid in the situations contemplated by Article 9. It is obviously not intended to spell out the situations where liquidated damages are to be paid and cannot, con- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 96, 100]\n\u00a0\n trary to the Government's contention, control the language of Article 9.4\n The impact of Article 9 on the facts of this case is clear. The contractor having failed to complete his work within the specified time, the Government exercised its option under the first part of Article 9 to terminate his right to proceed. This power to terminate could be exercised before or on the stipulated completion date or, as in this case, at any date thereafter. The Government then made other arrangements to complete the construction work and was entitled to, and did recover, the excess cost occasioned thereby. It thus waived its right to liquidated damages under the second part of Article 9. That right is conditioned upon the Government not terminating the contractor's right to proceed. Where there is such a termination, even though it be subsequent to the stipulated completion date, the right to liquidated damages disappears. Such has been the uniform and correct result heretofore reached in the application of this type of contract provision. See United States v. Cunningham, 75 U.S. App.D.C. 95, 125 F.2d 28; United States v. Maryland Casualty Co., D.C., 25 F.Supp. 778; Maryland Casualty Co. v. United States, 93 Ct.Cl. 247. See also Fidelity & Casualty Co. of New York v. United States, 81 Ct.Cl. 495; Commercial Casualty Insurance Co. v. United States, 83 Ct.Cl. 367; American Employer's Insurance Co. v. United States, 91 Ct.Cl. 231.\n The Government has urged us to read the second part of Article 9 as though the right to liquidated damages were \n\n[322 \nU.S. 96, 101]\n\u00a0\n based, not upon a condition precedent that the Government not terminate, but upon a continuing condition, under which liquidated damages would accrue 'so long as the Government does not terminate' the contractor's right to proceed. This is said to be the only way to give full effect to the prime purpose of Section 21 of the 1902 Act to eliminate the uncertainties and difficulties of establishing actual damages to the Government by delay in obtaining the use of a public building. Otherwise proof is required of actual damages for the delay where termination occurs before completion in the teeth of a statute which dispenses with such proof in suits on a construction contract containing a stipulation 'for liquidated damages for delay.' The Government also claims that failure to allow it liquidated damages under these circumstances leaves it entirely to the contractor whether liquidated damages will ever be paid since he can relieve himself of such liability at any time short of completion simply by abandoning the work or provoking the Government to terminate his right to proceed. The Government contracting officers in turn would be induced to allow the contractor to proceed to completion despite inexcusable delays so as not to forfeit mounting liquidated damages, thus precluding prompt completion and occupancy of needed structures.\n But we are confronted here with an unambiguous contract that clearly limits the right to liquidated damages to situations where the Government does not at any time terminate the contractor's right to proceed. That it may be wiser to expand the right to such damages to every case of delay, regardless of whether there is a termination, is of course not relevant in interpreting and applying clear words of limitation in the contract. We find nothing, moreover, in Section 21 of the 1902 Act that fills in interstices deliberately left open by the parties. No statutory language of policy forbids the Government and a contractor from stipulating for liquidated damages in \n\n[322 \nU.S. 96, 102]\n\u00a0\n limited situations only. Indeed the statute makes any such stipulation 'conclusive and binding upon all parties,' thereby foreclosing the Government's right to object to its own failure to insist upon liquidated damages in other situations. Since we are not justified in rewriting the clear provisions of the contract to include what might well have been but was not inserted, the judgment below must be affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The form of contract used was U.S. Standard Form No. 23 construction contract, approved by the President on November 19, 1926, and used between 1926 and 1935. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] C. 1036, 32 Stat. 310, 326; 40 U.S.C.  269, 40 U.S.C.A.  269.

S. v. HARK(1944)\nNo. 83\nArgued: Decided: January 3, 1944\n\n\n\n Rehearing Denied Jan. 31, 1944. See \n321 \nU.S. 802\n, 64 S.Ct. 517.\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the District of Massachusetts.\n Mr. Paul A. Freund, of Washington, D.C., for appellant. \n\n[320 \nU.S. 531, 532]\n\u00a0\n Mr. William H. Lewis, of Boston, Mass., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This appeal, prosecuted under the Criminal Appeals Act,1 presents questions touching the jurisdiction of this court and the merits of the controversy.\n Appellees were indicted December 21, 1942, for sales of beef in violation of Maximum Price Regulation No. 169, as amended, issued pursuant to the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942.2 They moved to quash. The District Court rendered an opinion March 5, 1943, holding that, since the pertinent provisions of the regulation which the appellees were charged to have violated had been revoked prior to the return of the indictment, they could not be held to answer the charge. \n3\n The last sentence of the opinion was: 'The motion to quash is granted.'\n Under date of March 5 the clerk made an entry in the docket as follows: 'Sweeney, J. Opinion-Motion to quash is granted.' There seems to be no dispute that some days later an additional entry was placed upon the docket bearing the date March 5 and reading: 'Sweeney, J. Indictment quashed.' It further appears that, upon application of the United States Attorney, Judge Sweeney, on March 31, signed a formal order quashing the indictment. \n4\n On the same day the clerk struck from the \n\n[320 \nU.S. 531, 533]\n\u00a0\n docket the last mentioned entry dated March 5 and entered, under the date March 31, the following: 'Sweeney, J. Order quashing indictment.' On April 30 Judge Sweeney allowed a petition for appeal to this court.\n The appellees moved to dismiss the appeal on the grounds that it was not seasonably taken for the reason that the decision upon the motion to quash made by Judge Sweeney in his opinion of March 5 constituted the judgment of the court; and that, as the appeal is not based upon the invalidity or construction of the statute upon which the indictment was founded, it was improperly taken to this court under the Criminal Appeals Act. We postponed consideration of the motion to the hearing on the merits.\n First. The Criminal Appeals Act requires that any appeal to this court which it authorizes be taken 'within thirty days after the decision or judgment5 has been rendered ....' Neither the District Court nor this court has power to extend the period. If the opinion filed on March 5 constituted, within the meaning of the Act, the decision or judgment of the District Court, or if either of the docket entries bearing date March 5 constituted the final decision \n\n[320 \nU.S. 531, 534]\n\u00a0\n or judgment, the appeal was untimely. \n6\n The circumstances disclosed require that we determine what constitutes the decision or judgment from which an appeal lies in this case. We are without the benefit of a rule such as Rule 58 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c, which provides that 'the notation of a judgment in the civil docket as provided by Rule 79(a) constitutes the entry of the judgment; and the judgment is not effective before such entry.'\n The judgment of a court is the judicial determination or sentence of the court upon a matter within its jurisdiction. No form of words and no peculiar formal act is necessary to evince its rendition or to mature the right of appeal. And the modes of evidencing the character of the judgment and of attesting the fact and time of its rendition vary from state to state according to local statute or custom, from a simple docket entry or the statement of a conclusion in an opinion, to a formal adjudication, signed by the judge or the clerk, in a journal or order book, or filed as part of the record in the case. The practice in federal courts doubtless varies because of the natural tendency to follow local state practice. Unaided by statute or rule of court we must decide on the bare record before us what constitutes the decision or judgment of the court below from which appeal must be taken within thirty days after rendition.\n In view of the diverse practice and custom in District Courts we cannot lay down any hard and fast rule. Where, as here, a formal judgment is signed by the judge, this is prima facie the decision or judgment rather than a state- \n\n[320 \nU.S. 531, 535]\n\u00a0\n ment in an opinion or a docket entry. \n7\n In recent cases we have so treated it. 8 But we are told by appellees that it is not the practice of the court below to require written orders, and that entry on the docket has always been considered as entry of judgment, and for this support is found in a letter from a deputy clerk of the court. On the other hand, the appellant calls our attention to five cases brought here under the Criminal Appeals Act from the District Court for Massachusetts in each of which the record contains a formal order quashing an indictment, and in four of which there was an opinion as well as the formal order. \n9\n In view of these facts, we think we should give weight to the action of the judge rather than to the opinion of counsel or of a ministerial officer of the court. The judge was conscious, as we are, that he was without power to extend the time for appeal. He entered a formal order of record. We are unwilling to assume that he deemed this an empty form or that he acted from a purpose indirectly to extend the appeal time, which he could not do overtly. In the absence of anything of record to lead to a contrary conclusion, we take the formal order of March 31 as in fact and in law the pronouncement of the court's judgment and as fixing the date from which the time for appeal ran.\n Second. This appeal is authorized by the Criminal Appeals Act. That Act permits a direct appeal to this court, inter alia, from a judgment of a District Court 'sustaining \n\n[320 \nU.S. 531, 536]\n\u00a0\n a special plea in bar.' The material question is not how the defendant's pleading is styled but the effect of the ruling sought to be reviewed;10 and we have, therefore, treated a motion to quash, the grant of which would bar prosecution for the offense charged, as a plea in bar within the purview of the statute. \n11\n The defense here was in bar of the prosecution; to sustain it was to end the cause and exculpate the defendants.\n Third. We hold that revocation of the regulation did not prevent indictment and conviction for violation of its provisions at a time when it remained in force. The reason for the common law rule that the repeal of a statute ends the power to prosecute for prior violations12 is absent in the case of a prosecution for violation of a regulation issued pursuant to an existing statute which expresses a continuing policy, to enforce which the regulation was authorized. Revocation of the regulation does not repeal the statute; and though the regulation calls the statutory penalties into play, the statute, not the regulation, creates the offense and imposes punishment for its violation. 13 United States v. Curtiss- Wright Export Corp., \n299 \nU.S. 304\n, 57 S.Ct. 216, is authority for the view that an indictable offense was charged.\n The judgment is reversed.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY, dissenting.\n I cannot agree that this appeal was 'taken within thirty days after the decision or judgment has been rendered,' as required by the Criminal Appeals Act, 18 U.S.C.  682, 18 U.S.C.A.  682. This appeal was allowed by Judge Sweeney of the District \n\n[320 \nU.S. 531, 537]\n\u00a0\n Court of Massachusetts on April 30, 1943, and is timely only if the formal order signed on March 31 constitutes the final decision or judgment. The particular circumstances of this case, however, forbid such a conclusion.\n As the majority opinion states, the final decision or judgment from which the thirty-day appeal period runs requires no peculiar formal act or form of words. The effective act varies from court to court. But there is no doubt as to the practice in the District Court of Massachusetts. As stated by the deputy clerk of that court, whose duties and familiarity with the court's procedure lend great weight to his statements, 'The practice in this District, on the receipt of an opinion granting a motion to quash, is to make an entry on the docket under the judge's name, 'Indictment quashed.' It is not the practice to have a written order.' This statement, which appears to have had the approval of Judge Sweeney, clearly indicates that the final judgment in this case is to be found in the docket entry under the judge's name.\n Judge Sweeney's opinion of March 5 granted the motion to quash the indictment. Pursuant to the District Court's practice, an entry on the docket under the judge's name, constituting the final judgment, would normally have been made on the same day, March 5. Because of inadvertence, however, the entry was not made until some time between March 25 and March 29. At that time the docket clerk made the following entry on the docket: 'March 5. Sweeney, J. Indictment quashed.' That entry thereby constituted the final and effective judgment. And assuming that this judgment was not entered until March 29, the allowance of this appeal on April 30 was out of time.\n It is contended that the subsequent formal order signed on March 31 by Judge Sweeney is the effective judgment. But the procedure in this District Court makes clear that such formal written orders are unnecessary. It is the \n\n[320 \nU.S. 531, 538]\n\u00a0\n simple docket entry which is the final decision or judgment of the court below.\n Moreover, the circumstances surrounding the formal order of March 31 reveal no intention by Judge Sweeney to supersede the effect of the previous docket entry or to extend the time for appeal. The deputy clerk, in a letter written to the Department of Justice, has described the situation in these words:\n'On or about March 31st, the Government presented a written order to me, and I accompanied the United States Attorney to Judge Sweeney's chambers. It was entirely new procedure for us to have a written order. I understand it was only because the United States represented that the Department of Justice wanted a written order in this case, so as to conform to the suggestion contained in Mr. Justice Jackson's concurring opinion in United States v. Swift & Co., \n318 \nU.S. 442\n, 446 (63 S.Ct. 684, 686), that Judge Sweeney signed the order. I can recall that Judge Sweeney protested against the necessity of signing such an order when it was presented to him, but did sign it at the request of the United States Attorney. I also remember that Judge Sweeney said he was not going to adopt the practice of signing orders in all such future cases. When it came time to make an entry of this order in the books, I assumed that it was to take the place of the entry 'Sweeney, J. Indictment quashed', which was made between March 25th and March 29th, and I told the docket clerk making the entry to cross out the entry which had been made previously between March 25th and March 29th.\n\n'When I wrote my letter to you, it seemed to me that I had told the Court that the entry of March 5 would necessarily be stricken out, but I find that the Court has no recollection of being so informed. There was no intention that the order of March 31 should extend the time for appeal, and it is the Court's recollection that he so stated to counsel.\n\n'By direction of the Court, I am sending a copy of this letter to counsel for the defendant.' \n\n[320 \nU.S. 531, 539]\n\u00a0\n It thus clearly appears that the March 5 entry, which was actually made between March 25 and March 29, was intended to be the final decision or judgment of the District Court and that the appeal period began to run from the date of actual entry. The March 31 order was entered at the Government's insistence merely to conform to a suggestion of one Justice of this Court to the effect that 'we would be greatly aided if the District Courts in dismissing an indictment would indicate in the order the ground, and if more than one, would separately state and number them.' United States v. Swift & Co., \n318 \nU.S. 442, 446\n, 63 S.Ct. 684, 686. That order was thus no more than a clarification and reiteration of the March 5 judgment. It cannot be considered as a vacation of the prior judgment or as a new or amended judgment.\n\n The very fact that Judge Sweeney stated that the March 31 order did not extend the time for appeal demonstrates his belief and intention that a valid final order had theretofore been entered. Some time after March 31 the deputy clerk on his own initiative ordered the March 5 docket entry stricken in the mistaken belief that it had been superseded. In its place was inserted the entry: 'March 31. Sweeney, J. Order quashing indictment.' Such action was obviously insufficient to change either Judge Sweeney's intention or the finality and effect of the March 5 entry for purposes of appeal to this Court.\n Varying and uncertain rules governing criminal appeals are to be avoided whenever possible. Yet the effect of holding this appeal to be timely is to inject into the procedure of the court below an element of confusion and doubt. Heretofore parties to a criminal proceeding in the District Court of Massachusetts were entitled to rely on the docket entry, following an opinion granting a motion to quash, as the final decision or judgment. \n\n[320 \nU.S. 531, 540]\n\u00a0\n They could calculate appeal periods from the date of that entry. Now they must risk the possibility that at an undeterminable later date one of the parties will convince the court that a formal order should be entered and that the time for appeal will start from that date. No reason of law or policy suggests itself in support of such uncertainty.\n Judged by the fixed and simple practice of the court below in entering its final judgments, this appeal cannot be considered timely.\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice RUTLEDGE join in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 18 U.S.C.  682, 18 U.S.C.A.  682. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 56 Stat. 23, 50 U.S.C.Appendix,  901 etc., 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix,  901 et seq. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] 49 F.Supp. 95, 98. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] 'Sweeney, J.: This cause came on to be heard upon the defendant's motion to quash the indictment alleging that Maximum Price Regulation No. 169 has been revoked by the Price Administrator, effective December 16, 1942, before the indictment was returned.

Maryland, Luther Martin, Attorney General of Maryland, himself a member of the Constitutional Convention, said, 'The whole of this subject of taxation is full of difficulties, which the Convention found it impossible to solve, in a manner entirely satisfactory. The first attempt was to divide the subjects of taxation between the State and the national government. This being found impracticable, or inconvenient, the State governments surrendered altogether their right to tax imports and exports, and tonnage; giving the authority to tax all other subjects to Congress, but reserving to the States a concurrent right to tax the same subjects to an unlimited extent. This was one of the anomalies of the government, the evils of which must be endured, or mitigated by discretion and mutual forbearance.' McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 376. Where discretion and forbearance have failed it often has fallen to this Court to determine specific cases for which the Convention was unable to agree upon a general rule. Looking backward it is easy to see that the line between the taxable and the immune has been drawn by an unsteady hand.\n But since 1819, when Chief Justice Marshall in the McCulloch case expounded the principle that properties, functions, and instrumentalities of the Federated Government are immune from taxation by its constitutent parts, this Court never has departed from that basic doctrine or wavered in its application. In the course of time it held that even without explicit congressional action immunities had become communicated to the income or property or transactions of others because they in some manner dealt with or acted for the Government. \n1\n In \n\n[322 \nU.S. 174, 177]\n\u00a0\n recent years this Court has curtailed sharply the doctrine of implied delegated immunity. \n2\n But unshaken, rarely questioned, and indeed not questioned in this case, is the principle that possessions, institutions, and activities of the Federal Government itself in the absence of express congressional consent are not subject to any form of state taxation. The real controversy here is whether, especially in view of recent decisions, taxing authorities of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania have infringed this admitted immunity.\n Mesta Machine Company, an appellant with the United States, exists as a corporation under the laws of Pennsylvania and has a manufacturing plant in the County of Allegheny, of that Commonwealth, the County being appellee herein. It is engaged in the manufacture of heavy machinery. In October 1940, the War Department desired to produce a quantity of large field guns. It could have assembled an organization, created a government- owned corporation, and erected a plant which would have been wholly tax immune. Clallam County v. United States, \n263 \nU.S. 341\n, 44 S.Ct. 121. But for reasons of time and policy it chose to utilize a going concern under private management and ownership. Mesta's plant was not equipped for the manufacture of ordnance. It was agreed that certain additional equipment specially required for \n\n[322 \nU.S. 174, 178]\n\u00a0\n the work should be furnished at Government cost and should remain the property of the United States.\n The basic arrangement between Mesta and the Government was provided for by three separate titles of a single contract, made in October 1940. A title was devoted to each feature of the arrangement, being generally: procurement of Government-owned equipment at Government cost; lease of such equipment by the Government to Mesta; and Mesta's undertaking to make and deliver the guns at a fixed price each. In February 1941 a supplemental contract was made.\n Under the first title of the contract machinery was to be procured in three possible ways: Mesta, as an independent contractor and not as agent of the Government, could purchase it; Mesta could manufacture it; or the Government at its option could furnish any part of it. In carrying out the agreement Mesta manufactured one machine, the Government furnished eight gun-boring lathes and two rifling machines from its Watervliet Arsenal, and the rest Mesta purchased from other machine-tool manufacturers. The machinery bought or built by Mesta was inspected and accepted on behalf of the United States, which thereupon compensated Mesta as agreed. The contract provided that title to all such property should vest in the Government upon delivery at the site of work and inspection and acceptance.\n By the second title of the contract the Government leased this equipment to Mesta for the period during which guns are manufactured by it under this contract or later supplements. As rental Mesta agreed to pay the sum of one dollar. Mesta was permitted to use the equipment 'for the purpose of expediting the manufacture of guns' and for no other, without consent, except that such machinery as was 'purchased or furnished to supplement its existing facilities' might be used 'for general purposes.' Liability of Mesta for loss, damage, or destruction \n\n[322 \nU.S. 174, 179]\n\u00a0\n of equipment was 'that of a bailee under a mutual benefit bailment.' Mesta could not remove any of it without permission, and at all times it was accessible to Government inspection. On termination of the gun-supply contract, unless a stand-by contract was made, Mesta agreed to remove and ship the equipment according to Government directions, in good condition subject to fair wear and tear and depreciation.\n The leasing title of the contract made no mention of taxation. The equipment-procurement title provided for reimbursement of Mesta 'in the performance of the work under this Title' for payments 'under the Social Security Act, (42 U.S.C.A.  301 et seq.) and any applicable State or local taxes, fees, or charges which the Contractor may be required on account of this contract to pay on or for any plant, equipment, process, organization, materials, supplies, or personnel.' The gun-supply title recited that the contract price did not 'include any tax imposed by any state, county, or municipality upon the transaction of this purchase of guns. The Government shall not be liable, directly or indirectly, for the payment of any such taxes, except that if the Contractor after using every effort short of litigation to procure exemption or refund, as the case may be, should be compelled to pay to any state, county or municipality, any tax upon the transaction of this procurement, an amount equal to the tax so paid shall be paid by the Government on demand of the Contractor, in addition to the prices herein stated.' The Government admits liability to reimburse Mesta if it is obliged to pay tax by reason of the assessment in question here.\n The machinery was bolted on concrete foundations in Mesta's plant on real property owned by it. It could be removed without damage to the building.\n The present controversy flared when the assessing authorities of Allegheny County revised Mesta's previously determined assessment for ad valorem taxes. They added \n\n[322 \nU.S. 174, 180]\n\u00a0\n thereto the value of the machinery in question, fixed at $618,000. This included property acquired from other tool manufacturers as above described, $444,000; that manufactured by Mesta, $14,000; lathes brought from the Watervliet Arsenal, $160,000. Mesta protested and exhausted administrative remedies without avail, and on July 30, 1942, paid under protest $5,137.12, the amount of the tax attributable to this increased assessment.\n Mesta took a timely appeal allowed by statute to the Court of Common Pleas. The United States petitioned to intervene, reciting that it would be required to reimburse Mesta by force of its contract. Intervention was permitted against objection by the County, and the United States has participated in the litigation since. Mesta attacked the assessment under both state and federal law, claiming that under the State Tax Law property belonging to another was not to be considered a part of its mill and that if construed to authorize assessment and taxation of this machinery, the statute violated the Federal Constitution.\n The Court of Common Pleas held that the State Act authorized the assessment, but that the machinery here involved was 'owned by the United States' and so for constitutional reasons could not be included.\n The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, on appeal of the County, reversed, and reinstated the assessment. It held that under the state law regardless of who held the title to it the machinery constituted a part of the mill for purposes of assessment and was properly assessed as real estate. It acknowledged that property held by the United States is 'beyond the pale of taxation' by a state, but this assessment, it said, is not against the United States but against Mesta, which is operating its mill for private purposes. If Mesta defaulted in tax payments, the Court held that 'the paramount rights of the government in the \n\n[322 \nU.S. 174, 181]\n\u00a0\n machinery could not be divested or in any way affected,' hence the government could suffer no loss. Evidence that the machinery was not owned by Mesta it held to be irrelevant and improperly admitted. Two Justices dissented.\n The United States and Mesta appealed and we postponed consideration of jurisdictional questions to the hearing on the merits.\n\n\n I.\n\n\n It is denied that the Government has valid title to the machinery. This contention is urged by the member cities of the National Institute of Municipal Law Officers, permitted to file a brief and to argue orally as amici curiae. Their position is that 'the Government is subject to the legal rules applicable to private transactions.' Under Pennsylvania law transfer of title to personal property to be good as against subsequent purchasers and lienors must be accompanied by delivery of possession. They say that inspection and acceptance by a contracting officer on behalf of the United States at the Mesta plant did not under decisional law of Pennsylvania amount to delivery of possession to the United States and hence that its title is defective. The position of the County is less extreme. It argued earlier in the litigation that the machinery became part of Mesta's real estate upon installation and that the United States had only 'a reversionary interest after the termination of the contract.' It later conceded that title to the property was not in Mesta 'except for tax purposes.' The Pennsylvania Supreme Court thought it immaterial whether title was in the Government, but said, '... this private arrangement between the Mesta Company, the owner of the land and buildings and operator of the mill, and the Federal government, the owner of the machinery, which treats the equipment as personal property and per- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 174, 182]\n\u00a0\n mits the latter to remove it at the termination of the contract, can in no way change the legal effect of the Act of assembly which specifically designates machinery, under these circumstances, as real estate for tax purposes.'\n We do not determine whether, under Pennsylvania law, the retention of possession by Mesta would protect only good-faith purchasers or lienors who relied upon it or whether, as urged by the amici, it also makes the Government's title imperfect as against these taxing authorities, who were fully advised of the Government's claim before the assessment was made. Even if the latter were true, we do not think the state law would be decisive of the question of title.\n The Constitution provides that 'The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States ....' Art. IV, Sec. 3, cl. 2. It also gives Congress the power 'To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution' all powers vested in the Government or in any department or officer thereof, Art. I, Sec. 8, cl. 18, and it makes the laws of the United States enacted pursuant thereto 'the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.' Art. VI, cl. 2.\n Every acquisition, holding, or disposition of property by the Federal Government depends upon proper exercise of a constitutional grant of power. In this case no contention is made that the contract with Mesta is not fully authorized by the congressional power to raise and support armies and by adequate congressional authorization to the contracting officers of the War Department. It must be accepted as an act of the Federal Government warranted by the Constitution and regular under statute. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 174, 183]\n\u00a0\n Procurement policies so settled under federal authority may not be defeated or limited by state law. The purpose of the supremacy clause was to avoid the introduction of disparities, confusions and conflicts which would follow if the Government's general authority were subject to local controls. The validity and construction of contracts through which the United States is exercising its constitutional functions, their consequences on the rights and obligations of the parties, the titles or liens which they create or permit, all present questions of federal law not controlled by the law of any state.

Or the Government may avail itself, as any other lienor, of state recording facilities, in which case, while it has never been denied that it must pay non-discriminatory fees for their use, the recording may not be made the occasion for taxing the Government property. Federal Land Bank v. Crosland, \n261 \nU.S. 374\n, 43 S.Ct. 385, 29 A.L.R. 1; Pittman v. Home Owners' Loan Corp., \n308 \nU.S. 21\n, 60 S.Ct. 15, 124 A.L.R. 1263\n\n\n We hold that title to the property in question is in the United States and is effective for tax purposes.\n\n\n II.\n\n\n The County denies, however, that it is taxing property belonging to the United States. First, it says it taxes only the land, which the United States does not own; and the \n\n[322 \nU.S. 174, 184]\n\u00a0\n machinery is not taxed, but is considered only as an enhancement of the value of the land to Mesta, its owner. Secondly, it says the lien of the tax does not encumber and the process of collection does not involve any sale or other interference with the machinery. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has upheld the questioned tax because upon these grounds it concluded that no interference with the federal function resulted.\n'Where a federal right is concerned we are not bound by the characterization given to a state tax by state courts or Legislatures, or relieved by it from the duty of considering the real nature of the tax and its effect upon the federal right asserted.' Carpenter v. Shaw, \n280 \nU.S. 363, 367\n, 368 S., 50 S.Ct. 121, 123.\n\n It is not contended that the scheme of taxation employed by Pennsylvania is anything other than the old and widely used ad valorem general property tax. This taxation plan involves the identification and valuation of the variable individual holdings to be taxed, commonly called the assessment, the application of a uniform rate calculated on the need for public revenues, and the collection, in default of payment, by distraint and sale of the property assessed and taxed. This form of taxation is not regarded primarily as a form of personal taxation but rather as a tax against the property as a thing. Its procedures are more nearly analogous to procedures in rem than to those in personam. While personal liability for the tax may be and sometimes is imposed, the power to tax is predicated upon jurisdiction of the property, not upon jurisdiction of the person of the owner, which often is lacking without impairment of the power to tax. In both theory and practice the property is the subject of the tax and stands as security for its payment.\n The Pennsylvania statutes embody this scheme of taxation. They are a century old. The basic provision reads: \n\n[322 \nU.S. 174, 185]\n\u00a0\n 'The following subjects and property shall ... be valued and assessed, and subject to taxation.' \n3\n Taxes are 'declared to be a first lien on said property.' \n4\n (Emphasis supplied.) It is only under these legislative provisions that the tax in question is laid.\n The procedure of the assessors is consistent with no other theory than that the machinery itself was being assessed and taxed exactly as land was being assessed and taxed. The Government-owned machinery was inspected and itemized by the assessor, each machine was then separately appraised by a machinery expert, and the aggregate full values of $618,000 were carried into the assessment. The assessment against Mesta was entered in the books of the assessors as follows: 'Land, $293,795; Buildings, $1, 123,124; Machinery $2,489,085; Total assessment, $3,906,004.' The machinery item included the value of the Government's property.\n The assessors made no claim that the temporary presence of the Government's machinery actually enhanced the market value or the use value of Mesta's land. The assessors simply and forthrightly valued Mesta's land as land, and the Government's machines as machinery, and added the latter to the former. We discern little theoretical difference, and no practical difference at all, between what was done and what would be done if the machinery were taxed in form. Its full value was ascertained and added to the base to which the annual rates would apply for county, city, borough, town, township, school, and poor purposes.\n We hold that the substance of this procedure is to lay an ad valorem general property tax on property owned by the United States. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 174, 186]\n\u00a0\n III.\n It is contended, however, that Government title does not prevent such state taxation, because the incidence of the tax is borne by Mesta, not the Government, and the taxation creates no lien upon its property or interference with its function.\n The Commonwealth certainly has broad powers and choices of methods to tax Mesta, a corporation created by it and domiciled and operating within its borders. The trend of recent decisions has been to withdraw private property and profits from the shelter of governmental immunity but without impairing the immunity of the State or the Nation itself. Benefits which a contractor receives from dealings with the Government are subject to state income taxation. \n5\n Salaries received from it may be taxed. \n6\n The fact that materials are destined to be furnished to the Government does not exempt them from sales taxes imposed on the contractor's vendor. \n7\n But in all of these cases what we have denied is immunity for the contractor's own property, profits, or purchases. We have not held either that the Government could be taxed or its contractors taxed because property of the Government was in their hands. The distinction between taxation of private interests and taxation of governmental interests, although sometimes difficult to define, is fundamental in application of the immunity doctrine as developed in this country.\n Mesta has some legal and beneficial interest in this property. It is a bailee for mutual benefit. Whether such a right of possession and use in view of all the circumstances could be taxed by appropriate proceedings we do not decide. Its leasehold interest is subject to some \n\n[322 \nU.S. 174, 187]\n\u00a0\n qualification of the right to use the property except for gun manufacture, is limited to the period it engages in such work, and is perhaps burdened by other contractual conditions. We have held that where private interests in property were so preponderant that all the Government held was a naked title and a nominal interest, the whole value was taxable to the equitable owner. Northern Pacific R. Co. v. Myers, \n172 \nU.S. 589\n, 19 S.Ct. 276; City of New Brunswick v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 547\n, 48 S.Ct. 371. But that is not the situation here, and the State has made no effort to segregate Mesta's interest and tax it. The full value of the property, including the whole ownership interest, as well as whatever value proper appraisal might attribute to the leasehold, was included in Mesta's assessment.\n It is contended the whole value of the property may be reached since the impact of the tax is upon Mesta. In support of this we are reminded that the tax, so the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania held, falls upon the real estate alone, because the lien thereof does not touch the Government's property, which before or after tax default may be removed. But renunciation of any lien on Government property itself, which could not be sustained in any event, hardly establishes that it is not being taxed. The fact is that the lien on the underlying land is increased because of and in proportion to the assessment of the machinery. If the tax is collected by selling the land out from under the machinery, the effect on its usefulness to the Government would be almost as disastrous as to sell the machinery itself. The coercion of payment from compelling the Government to move its property and interrupt production at the Mesta plant would defeat the purpose of the Government in owning and leasing it.\n We think, however, that the Government's property interests are not taxable either to it or to its bailee. The 'Government' is an abstraction, and its possession of property largely constructive. Actual possession and cus- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 174, 188]\n\u00a0\n tody of Government property nearly always are in someone who is not himself the Government but acts in its behalf and for its purposes. He may be an officer, an agent, or a contractor. His personal advantages from the relationship by way of salary, profit, or beneficial personal use of the property may be taxed as we have held. But neither he nor the Government can be taxed for the Government's property interest. Rarely does a state or municipality pursue the Federal Government itself. Most of the immunity cases we have been called upon to deal with involved assertion of a right to tax Government property against an individual. In United States v. Rickert, \n188 \nU.S. 432\n, 23 S.Ct. 478, 483, this Court decided that improvements made upon lands to which the United States held title but which were put in possession of Indians for their benefit remained immune from taxation and that cattle, horses, and chattels purchased with the money of the Government and 'put into the hands of the Indians to be used in execution of the purpose of the government in reference to them' were likewise immune from taxation. In Van Brocklin v. Tennessee, \n117 \nU.S. 151\n, 6 S.Ct. 670, Tennessee attempted to sell for state taxes lands which the United States owned at the time the taxes were assessed and levied, but in which it had ceased to have any interest at the time of sale. There, as here, it was claimed the collection affected only private persons, whose equities in the matter were at least doubtful, and that the United States could suffer no harm. The Court held, however, that the immunity protected the private owner for the tax had been laid against an interest of the Government which was beyond the reach of state taxing power. See also Irwin v. Wright, \n258 \nU.S. 219\n, 42 S.Ct. 293; Lee v. Osceola & Little River Road Improvement District, \n268 \nU.S. 643\n, 45 S.Ct. 620.\n A state may tax personal property and might well tax it to one in whose possession it was found, but it could hardly tax one of its citizens because of moneys of the \n\n[322 \nU.S. 174, 189]\n\u00a0\n United States which were in his possession as Collector of Internal Revenue, Postmaster, Clerk of the United States Court, or other federal officer, agent, or contractor. We hold that Government-owned property, to the full extent of the Government's interest therein, is immune from taxation, either as against the Government itself or as against one who holds it as a bailee.\n\n\n IV.\n\n\n We find no support for the claim that the immunity has been waived. Congress certainly has not done so. It is true that the contract requires Mesta to obey and abide by the 'applicable' law of Pennsylvania. But such language does not require Mesta to submit to unconstitutional exactions. It clearly is inadequate to waive federal immunity, even if we assume a contracting officer had power to do so. Likewise any contractual obligation of the War Department to pay Mesta's taxes does not operate either to waive or to create an immunity. Nor is the validity of the tax dependent upon the ultimate resting place of the economic burden of the tax. We also think it immaterial what, if any, right of reimbursement the Pennsylvania law grants a lessee against a private lessor in similar circumstances. State law could not obligate the Central Government to reimburse for a valid tax, much less for an invalid one.\n Each party urges equities in its favor. The Government points to the exigencies of war, points to numerous and increasing state efforts to tax such property, and urges against the decision below that it is a precedent for taxation of a substantial portion of property of the Government valued at 7 1\/2 billion dollars in the possession and use of private contractors engaged in war production. It owns property on private lands, under contracts similar to this, with a value approximating two billion dollars, over $257,000,000 of it located in Pennsylvania. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 174, 190]\n\u00a0\n Appellees, and especially the amici, on the other hand, point for a different purpose to the amount of Government property in war production. It is said that increased municipal services, to serve and protect the influx of war workers, are required in all communities where large war contracts of this type are placed; that such local services rely heavily on real estate taxation; that to exclude property such as this, together with the large real estate holdings that have been and are being acquired by the Government, imposes this increased cost on others. While validation of assessments of this character will measurably increase the cost of waging the war, it is argued that the Federal Government may diffuse the cost throughout the country instead of putting a back-breaking burden on local governments where war plants are located. For these reasons we are urged to hold the position of the Government 'unsound, as well as inequitable.'\n Such considerations remind us of our heavy responsibility in deciding the issues but hardly provide a guide or alter the usual principles for decision. The equities in this unfortunate conflict between the United States and one of its most important industrial communities are not capable of judicial ascertainment or equalization. Whether a county loses more than it gains by such federal activity, and what other federal benefits ought to be considered if a balance were to be struck between advantages and disadvantages, we cannot say. The adjustment of benefits and burdens is for other departments, and studies to that end have been undertaken. \n8\n We can only say that our \n\n[322 \nU.S. 174, 191]\n\u00a0\n constitutional system as judicially interpreted from the beginning leaves no room for the localities to impose either compensatory or retaliatory taxation on Government property interests. Their remedy lies in petition to the Federal Congress, which also is their Congress.\n\n\n V.\n\n\n Our jurisdiction was questioned by appellee's motion to dismiss, and its consideration was postponed to hearing of the merits. The argument runs that the tax is laid only upon Mesta and therefore only Mesta can question its validity; that if Mesta does so, it can be only under the Fourteenth Amendment; that no question has been assigned under this Amendment and hence the appeal should be dismissed.\n The questions in this case do not arise under the Fourteenth Amendment. They depend on provisions adopted and principles settled long before the Fourteenth Amendment and which exist independently of it.\n The United States was admitted to the case as an intervenor. Both it and Mesta raised these questions of taxability, as either may do. The United States may question the taxation in order to protect its sovereignty over the property in question. Mesta as bailee is under a duty to protect the property and may protect itself from unlawful burdens put upon it because of its possession of the \n\n[322 \nU.S. 174, 192]\n\u00a0\n property. The tax is calculated and imposed on the land and machinery as a unit, the lien of the assessment on the machinery becomes a lien on the land which can be taken to pay the tax occasioned by the machinery. Since the tax must be paid out of Mesta's property it is in a position to challenge the validity of the tax, as was the case in Van Brocklin v. Tennessee, supra. Both Mesta and the Government made timely insistence that the Pennsylvania Tax Law as applied violates the Federal Constitution. The highest court of the State rendered final judgment against the claim of federal right. We have jurisdiction by appeal. Judicial Code  237(a), 28 U.S.C.A.  344(a). The motion to dismiss is denied.\n The Tax Law of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as interpreted and applied in this case violates the Federal Constitution in so far as it purports to authorize taxation of the property interests of the United States in the machinery in Mesta's plant, or to use that interest to tax or to enhance the tax upon the Government's bailee. The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice BLACK and Mr. Justice DOUGLAS concur in the result.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS.\n I think the judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania is right and should be affirmed for the reasons stated in its opinion.\n If James v. Dravo Contracting Company, \n302 \nU.S. 134\n, 58 S.Ct. 208, 114 A.L.R. 318, were not upon our books, or had been decided the other way, I should agree to the opinion of the court. In that case, at the insistence of the United States, this court held that a State gross receipts tax upon payments by the United States to a contractor for erecting structures on United \n\n[322 \nU.S. 174, 193]\n\u00a0\n States property was valid because the tax was not laid upon the contract, the Government, its property, its officers, or its instrumentality; was laid upon an independent contractor and was nondiscriminatory. Although admitting that the payment of the tax imposed a burden upon the activities of the United States because it inevitably increased the cost of exercise of its functions, the court nonetheless sustained the exaction. I then thought, as I still think, that the decision overruled a century of procedents in this court.\n It was not long before the Government repented its generosity. Four years later, it insisted, in State of Alabama v. King & Boozer, \n314 \nU.S. 1\n, 62 S.Ct. 43, 140 A.L.R. 615, that a state sales tax upon a purchase of building materials by a contractor who was to incorporate them into a Government project, and where, upon delivery, inspection, and acceptance, they became the property of the Government, was so direct a tax on the Government as to infringe its constitutional immunity. The court, however, followed to its logical conclusion the decision in James v. Dravo Contracting Co. and expressly overruled earlier decisions inconsistent with James v. Dravo Contracting Co. and State of Alabama v. King & Boozer. \n1\n I concurred in that decision, feeling myself bound by the Dravo case.\n In this case, as I think, the court necessarily reverts to the test of burdensomeness by a form of words and, as a result, again plunges the applicable principle into confusion.\n The truth is that the tax liability of Mesta in respect of its manufacturing plant has been increased by the presence in the plant of machinery bailed to the taxpayer by the federal Government. It is true too that, either as a result of the express terms of the Government's contract with Mesta, the Government's monetary obligation to \n\n[322 \nU.S. 174, 194]\n\u00a0\n Mesta will be increased by the imposition of increased tax or, as in the Dravo case, if the contractor is liable for an increase of tax by reason of the fact that he is such contractor, the Government, in the long run, will have to pay more for goods and services as a result of such increase.\n In order to relieve the Government of this burden, the court is now obliged to say that the law of Pennsylvania is something different from what the Supreme Court of the Commonwealth has declared it, and that a century of State administrative and judicial construction is meaningless when the supposed necessity arises to unburden the Government from the result of State taxation upon privately owned property.\n The law of Pennsylvania is, and always has been, that a tax imposed on real estate is enhanced in amount by buildings and machinery placed upon the land with the consent of the owner even though he does not own the improvements but is a mere bailee. The lien of the tax extends only to the land owned by the taxpayer and the bailed improvements are neither under the lien nor subject to seizure or sale for payment of the tax. But this settled law is brushed aside and it is said, notwithstanding these facts, that, in some indefinable way, Pennsylvania has in truth levied an ad valorem tax upon property of the United States which is in the possession of Mesta as bailee. This is nothing in substance but to say, in the teeth of the Dravo and King & Boozer cases, that if a tax levied upon a contractor of the Government imposes a burden upon the Government's activities it violates the constitutional immunity and must be stricken down. Whereas, in those cases, the court accepted the tax for what it was, viz., a tax upon the contractor and not upon the Government, here, although under State law the liability to the State is that of the contractor and his property, and can, in no event, be the liability of the Government or its property,-except as the Government either \n\n[322 \nU.S. 174, 195]\n\u00a0\n contractually assumes the burden or bears it as an incident of the contractor's burden,-the court announces that the tax is laid on the Government's property.\n I think the case was decided by the court below on a nonfederal ground. The decision is pitched solely upon the character and incidence of the real property tax of the Commonwealth. As that court, in the light of a hundred years of history, defined the tax and the tax lien neither was laid upon or collectable from the United States or its property. As a result of that decision Mesta became liable for an increased tax as a result of certain transactions with the Government. Unless the doctrine of immunity from consequent burden on the Government, as the other party to the contract, is to be reimported into our jurisprudence, the appeal should be dismissed because the decision below was based upon an adequate nonfederal ground.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER, dissenting.\n I should like to add a few words to the opinion of my brother ROBERTS, with which, in the main, I agree.\n This controversy is treated by the Court as though it presented a challenge by Pennsylvania to the authority of the United States. The case is not entitled, on the facts as I understand them, to have such importance attributed to it. We are all agreed that a State must subordinate its policies to the constitutional powers duly exercised by the United States. War of course evokes powers of government not available in times of peace, but it is no less true of the war powers of the Government than of the peace powers that the Constitution and the laws enacted in accordance with it are 'the supreme Law of the Land.' United States Constitution, Art. VI.\n Implicit in our federal scheme is immunity of the Federal Government from taxation by the States. After having long been the subject of differences of opinion, the \n\n[322 \nU.S. 174, 196]\n\u00a0\n extent of this implied immunity was greatly curtailed. The basis of the doctrine was shifted from that of an argumentative financial burden to the Federal Government to that of freedom from discrimination against transactions with the Government and freedom from direct impositions upon the property and the instrumentalities of the Government. The decisions in James v. Dravo Contracting Co., \n302 \nU.S. 134\n, 58 S.Ct. 208, 114 A.L.R. 318, and State of Alabama v. King & Boozer, \n314 \nU.S. 1\n, 62 S.Ct. 43, 140 A.L.R. 615, mean nothing unless they mean that it is not enough that the Government may ultimately have to bear the cost of a part or even the whole of a tax which a State imposes on a third person who has business relations with the Government, when a State could impose such a tax upon such a third person but for the fact that the transaction which gave rise to it was not with a private person but with the Government. So much for the scope of the implied immunity of the Government from state taxation as I understand the decisions to date. But in carrying on effectively the task committed to it, the United States can, I believe, go beyond the judicial doctrine of implied immunity from taxation. I have no doubt that Congress, by appropriate legislation, could immunize those who deal with the Government from sales and property taxes which States otherwise are free to impose.\n On the record before us, Pennsylvania has not challenged the implied immunity of the Federal Government from taxation nor has she sought to tax that which Congress has said should be free from taxation. Pennsylvania has not taxed property owned by the Government. Pennsylvania has not used her otherwise unquestioned power of taxation to discriminate against one dealing with the Government. Finally, Pennsylvania has not tried to impose a tax which Congress, in order to facilitate war production, has forbidden the States to levy. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 174, 197]\n\u00a0\n Pennsylvania merely seeks to enforce a tax assessment against the owner of lands and buildings in the manner in which she has made such an assessment for one hundred years. She has assessed real property concededly owned by Mesta at a valuation increased by the value of the machinery made available to Mesta by various arrangements with the Government. But it is the realty that is being taxed, precisely as other realty is taxed, and by precisely the same method of determining the value of other realty. If the machinery which has here been affixed to the land through arrangements with the Government had been machinery that belonged to Remington Arms and Mesta had been operating through Remington as a sub- contractor for the Government, I suppose no one would doubt that Pennsylvania could assess the value of the land taxed against Mesta as it was here assessed, quite regardless of the retention of the title by Remington of the annexed fixtures, the value of which served to enhance the amount at which the land was assessed. It cannot alter the nature of the tax as a tax against Mesta's ownership of the land and buildings whether the enhancing fixtures belong to the Government or to Remington. Constitutional answers do at times turn on a nicety but not on a nicety without at least a nice significance.\n The case thus appears to me one that was decided by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court on the settled construction of the Pennsylvania statute as a tax on realty, and not at all as a tax on the only thing that belongs to the United States, namely, machinery annexed to the realty. Here also 'there can be no pretence that the court adopted its view in order to evade a constitutional issue, and the case has been decided upon grounds that have no relation to any federal question.' Nickel v. Cole, \n256 \nU.S. 222, 225\n, 41 S.Ct. 467, 468. The only interest which the State here taxed was an interest within the power of the State to tax; it was not a \n\n[322 \nU.S. 174, 198]\n\u00a0\n federal interest. See Elder v. Wood, \n208 \nU.S. 226, 232\n, 28 S.Ct. 263, 264; City of New Brunswick v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 547\n, 48 S. Ct. 371. The rate at which that interest was taxed is equally a matter for Pennsylvania to determine. In view of the Dravo case, supra, and State of Alabama v. King & Boozer, supra, there is not before us a constitutionally immunized burden of the Government. Insofar as the financial burden has been directly assumed by the Government it has been so assumed by arrangements which the contracting officers of the Government saw fit to make with Mesta.\n In respect to the problem we are considering, the constitutional relation of the Dominion of Canada to its constituent Provinces is the same as that of the United States to the States. A recent decision of the Supreme Court of Canada is therefore pertinent. In City of Vancouver v. Attorney General of Canada, (1944) S.C.R. 23, that Court denied the Dominion's claim to immunity, in a situation precisely like this, as I believe we should deny the claim of the Government. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Dobbins v.

No. 216, 78th Cong., 1st Sess. (1943). This comprehensive report shows the impossibility of generalizing about the equities between the Federal Government and a community in cases dealing with isolated properties. Much federally owned property is held for the accommodation and service of the locality, such as the Post Office or the courthouses. Other is held for general administrative purposes in which the locality has an interest or for the care of wards, such as veterans, in which local inhabitants share with others. The report considers all federally owned real estate and improvements, but not personalty. It shows that the United States had within Pennsylvania on June 30, 1937, property costing $278,519,000, with market value of $151,806,000. The estimated annual tax based on fair market value at local rates would be $3,152,000. But the average annual federal aid to that state is reported to be: 1928-30, $6,834,000; 1931-33, $ 10,791,000; 1934-37, all kinds, $190,071,000 (excluding FERA, CWA, and WPA . $23,118,000). \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Panhandle Oil Co. v.

CRESCENT AMUSEMENT CO.(1944)\nNo. 17\nArgued: Decided: December 11, 1944\n\n\n\n Rehearing Denied Jan. 8, 1945\n\n\n See \n323 \nU.S. 818\n, 65 S.Ct. 437.\n Appeals from the District Court of the United States for the Middle District of Tennessee.\n\n\n[323 \nU.S. 173, 176]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Wendall Berge, Asst.Atty.Gen., and Mr. Robert L. Wright, of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n Mr. William Waller, of Nashville, Tenn., for Crescent Amusement Co. et al.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The United States brought this civil suit against nine affiliated companies (whom we will call the exhibitors) operating motion picture theaters in some 70 small towns in Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, and Tennessee; against certain officers of these companies; and against eight major distributors of motion picture films, charging them with a conspiracy unreasonably to restrain interstate trade and commerce in motion-picture films and to monopolize the exhibition of films in this area in violation of  1 and  2 of the Sherman Act. 26 Stat. 209, 15 U.S.C.  1, 2, 15 U.S.C.A.  1, 2. This suit was dismissed against five of the distributors on motion of the United States. \n1\n Of the other three the Court found that only one had violated the Sherman Act. The court also found that seven of the exhibitors and three of the individual defendants had violated the Sherman Act substantially as charged. It entered a decree against them. From the judgment en- \n\n[323 \nU.S. 173, 177]\n\u00a0\n tered the United States, six of the exhibitors, and three individual defendants appeal directly to this Court under  2 of the Act of February 11, 1903, 32 Stat. 823, 15 U.S.C.  29, 15 U.S.C.A.  29, and  238 of the Judicial Code, as amended by the Act of February 13, 1925, 43 Stat. 936, 938, 28 U.S.C.  345, 28 U.S.C.A.  345.\n I. Before we come to the merits there is a preliminary question as to whether the appeal of the United States in No. 17 is premature. The District Court entered a final judgment in this case on May 17, 1943. On the sixieth day after judgment there were motions pending to amend the findings. On that day the appeal was applied for and allowed. On August 30, 1943, the court ruled on the motions to amend its findings. Within sixty days thereafter the United States applied for the appeal in No. 18 and it was allowed. The appeal in No. 17 was filed here at the same time as that in No. 18. The appellees move to dismiss No. 17 on the ground that it was premature and to dismiss No. 18 on the ground that the District Court by allowing the first appeal lost jurisdiction of the cause and was without power to allow a further appeal. We think the motion to dismiss the appeal in No. 17 must be granted and the motion to dismiss the appeal in No. 18 denied.\n The motion to amend the findings tolled the time to appeal if it was not addressed to 'mere matters of form but raised questions of substance' e.g., if it sought a 'reconsideration of certain basic findings of fact and the alteration of the conclusions of the court.' Leishman v. Associated Wholesale Electric Co., \n318 \nU.S. 203, 205\n, 63 S.Ct. 543, 544. An examination of the motion makes plain that matters of substance were raised. The appeal in No. 17 was accordingly premature. Zimmern v. United States, \n298 \nU.S. 167\n, 56 S.Ct. 706. But it does not follow that the District Court had no jurisdiction to allow the appeal in No. 18. An appeal can hardly be premature (and therefore a nullity) here and yet not \n\n[323 \nU.S. 173, 178]\n\u00a0\n premature (and therefore binding) below. Under these circumstances an appellant may rely upon the later appeal (Ohio Public Service Co. v. State of Ohio ex rel. Fritz, \n274 \nU.S. 12\n, 47 S.Ct. 480) and not run the risk of losing an appellate review on the appeal first allowed. Cf. Wilentz v. Sovereign Camp, \n306 \nU.S. 573\n, 59 S.Ct. 709.\n II. We turn to the merits. Crescent, the principal exhibitor,2 owns 50% of the stock of Cumberland and Lyric. The majority of Crescent's stock is owned by defendant Sudekum, by certain of his relatives, and by defendants Stengel and Baulch. Prior to 1937 Crescent owned almost two- thirds of the stock of Muscle Shoals; since that time Muscle Shoals was run as a partnership in which Sudekum's wife had a half-interest. Defendant Stengel, Sudekum's son-in-law, is the record holder of all of Rockwood's stock. Rockwood owns 50% of the stock of Cherokee and Kentucky and of five other theatre corporations. Rockwood was operated as a 'virtual branch' of the Crescent business under the immediate supervision of Stengel. Sudekum is president of Crescent, Cumberland, and Lyric; Stengel is an officer and director of Kentucky and Cherokee. Sudekum was paid $200 a week by Cherokee 'for his advice and assistance in running the business.' Each of these companies was an exhibitor operating motion picture theatres.\n In the five-year period ended in August 1939 when this bill was filed the exhibitors experienced a rather rapid growth-in the number of towns where their theatres were operated; in the number of towns where they operated without competition; in their earnings and surplus. The United States claims that that growth was the prod- \n\n[323 \nU.S. 173, 179]\n\u00a0\n uct of restraints of trade in violation of  1 of the Sherman Act and of monopolistic practices in violation of  2.\n The District Court found that each of the seven exhibitors had violated the Sherman Act by\n'A. Creating and maintaining an unreasonable monopoly of the business of operating theatres in the towns of Tennessee, Northern Alabama, and Central and Western Kentucky, in which each has theatres.\n\n'B. Combining its closed towns with its competitive situations in licensing films for the purpose and with the effect of compelling the major distributors to license films on a non-competitive basis in competitive situations and to discriminate against its independent competitors in licensing films.\n\n'C. Coercing or attempting to coerce independent operators into selling out to it, or to abandon plans to compete with it by predatory practices.'\n\n The court found that these violations were effected (a) by combining with each other and with certain major distributors in making franchises, i.e. term contracts for the licensing of films, with the purpose and effect of maintaining their theatre monopolies and preventing independents from competing with them; (b) by combining with each other for the purpose of dividing the territory in which theatres might be operated by any of them; (c) by combining with each other for the purpose and with the effect of eliminating, suppressing, and preventing independents from competing in the territory in which each operated; and (d) by combining with each other and with certain major distributors in licensing films for the purpose and with the effect of maintaining their theatre monopolies and preventing independents from competing with them. Three of the individual defendants were found to have participated actively in these violations. \n\n[323 \nU.S. 173, 180]\n\u00a0\n Interstate commerce was found to have been employed in consummating the conspiracy. In the selling season each year the distributor's salesmen solicit contracts from the exhibitors for the distributor's approval by the home office. As the films are released for exhibition prints are sent to the numerous exchanges located in various states and delivered by them to the exhibitors in their respective areas. \n3\n The exhibitor ordinarily returns the print to the distributor's exchange from which it is supplied to other theatres. The findings are wholly adequate to establish that the business of the exhibitors involves a regular interchange of films in interstate commerce. As we shall see, that course of business may be sufficient to make the Sherman Act applicable to the business of exhibiting motion pictures. Interstate Circuit v. United States, \n306 \nU.S. 208\n, 59 S.Ct. 467. Cf. Binderup v. Pathe Exchange, \n263 \nU.S. 291\n, 44 S.Ct. 96. The crucial issues in the present case relate to the evidence and the appropriateness of the decree.\n III. The defendants assert that the United States failed to prove the allegations of the complaint as amplified by the bill of particulars. But no such error was assigned. The only assignments on this phase of the case relate to subsidiary findings which are parts of sixteen of the one hundred and eighty-seven findings of fact contained in one hundred and twenty printed pages. Hence they are the only ones we will consider. Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v. Watson, \n287 \nU.S. 86, 91\n, 53 S.Ct. 32, 34, 86 A.L.R. 174; E. R. Squibb & Sons v. Mallinckrodt Chemical Works, \n293 \nU.S. 190\n, 55 S.Ct. 135; Rule 9, \n275 \nU.S. 600\n, 50 S.Ct. xxxi. We have examined them and conclude that they do not constitute reversible error. If any modifications were made in these subsidiary findings they would not be basic or essential ones. \n\n[323 \nU.S. 173, 181]\n\u00a0\n The crux of the government's case was the use of the buying power of the combination for the purpose of eliminating competition with the exhibitors and acquiring a monopoly in the areas in question. There was ample evidence that the combination used its buying power for the purpose either of restricting the ability of its competitors to license films or of eliminating competition by acquiring the competitor's property or otherwise. For example, the defendants would insist that a distributor give them monopoly rights in towns where they had competition or else defendants would not give the distributor any business in the closed towns where they had no competition. The competitor not being able to renew his contract for films would frequently go out of business or come to terms and sell out to the combination with an agreement not to compete for a term of years. The mere threat would at times be sufficient and cause the competitor to sell out to the combination 'because his mule was scared.' In that way some of the affiliates were born. In summarizing various deals of this character the District Court said, 'Each of these agreements not to compete with Crescent or its affiliates in other towns extended far beyond the protection of the business being sold, and demonstrated a clear intention to monopolize theatre operation wherever they or their affiliates secured a foothold.' \n4\n\u00a0\n\n[323 \nU.S. 173, 182]\n\u00a0\n The same type of war-fare was waged with franchise contracts with certain major distributors covering a term of years. These gave the defendants important exclusive film-licensing agreements. Their details varied. But generally they gave the defendant exhibitors the right to first-run exhibition of all feature pictures which they chose to select in their designated towns. Clearances over the same or nearby towns were provided, i.e. a time lag was established between the showing by the defendant exhibitors and a subsequent showing by others. The opportunity of competitors to obtain feature pictures for subsequent runs was further curtailed by repeat provisions \n\n[323 \nU.S. 173, 183]\n\u00a0\n which gave the defendant exhibitors the option of showing the pictures in their theatres a second time. In reviewing one of these franchise agreements the District Court concluded, 'The repeat-run clause in the franchise was completely effective in preventing the sale of a second-run of any Paramount features to any opposition theatre.'\n We are now told, however, that the independents were eliminated by the normal processes of competition; that their theatres were less attractive; that their service was inferior; that they were not as efficient businessmen as the defendants. We may assume that if a single exhibitor launched such a plan of economic warfare he would not run afoul of the Sherman Act. \n5\n But the vice of this undertaking was the combination of several exhibitors in a plan of concerted action. They had unity of purpose and unity of action. They pooled their buying power for a common end. It will not do to analogize this to a case where purchasing power is pooled so that the buyers may obtain more favorable terms. The plan here was to crush competition and to build a circuit for the exhibitors. The District Court found that some of the distributors were co-conspirators on certain phases of the program. But we can put that circumstance to one side and not stop to inquire whether the findings are adequate on that phase of the case. For it is immaterial whether the distributors technically were or were not members of the conspiracy. The showing of motion pictures is of course a local affair. But action by a combination of exhibitors to obtain an agreement with a distributor whereby commerce with a competing exhibitor is suppressed or restrained is a conspiracy in restraint of trade and a conspiracy to monopo- \n\n[323 \nU.S. 173, 184]\n\u00a0\n lize a part of the trade or commerce among the States, each of which is prohibited by the Sherman Act. And as we have said, the course of business which involves a regular exchange of films in interstate commerce is adequate to bring the exhibitors within the reach of the Sherman Act. Interstate Circuit v. United States, supra.\n The exhibitors, however, claim that the findings against them on the facts must fall because of improper evidence. The evidence to which this objection is directed consists of letters or reports written by employees of certain of the major distributors to other employees or officers in the same company stating reasons why the distributor was discriminating against an independent in favor of the defendants. The United States asserts that these letters or reports were declarations of one conspirator in furtherance of the common objective and therefore admissible as evidence against all under the rule of Hitchman Coal & Coke Co. v. Mitchell, \n245 \nU.S. 229, 249\n, 38 S.Ct. 65, 72, L.R.A.1918C, 497, Ann.Cas.1918B, 461. And it is argued that it makes no difference that these distributors were dismissed out of the case (Delaney v. United States, \n263 \nU.S. 586, 590\n, 44 S.Ct. 206, 207) since they were charged with being co-conspirators and since the findings are with certain exceptions adequate to support the charge. We do not come to that question. The other evidence established the position of the distributors and their relations to the theatres involved, what the distributors in fact did, the combination of the defendants, the character and extent of their buying power, and how it was in fact used. This other evidence was sufficient to establish the restraints of trade and monopolistic practices; the purpose, character, and extent of the combination are inferable from it alone. Thus even if error be assumed in in introduction of the letters and reports, the burden of showing prejudice has not been sustained.\n The defendants finally object to the findings on the ground that they were mainly taken verbatim from the \n\n[323 \nU.S. 173, 185]\n\u00a0\n government's brief. The findings leave much to be desired in light of the function of the trial court. See United States v. Forness, 2 Cir., 125 F. 2d 928, 942, 943. But they are nonetheless the findings of the District Court. And they must stand or fall depending on whether they are supported by evidence. We think they were.\n IV. The major controversy here has turned on the provisions of the decree.\n A. Objections of the United States. The United States objects to the provision of the decree that no defendant exhibitor shall acquire a financial interest in any additional theatre outside Nashville in any town where there already is a theatre 'unless the owner of such theatre should voluntarily offer to sell same to either of the exhibitor defendants, and when none of said defendants, their officers, agents or servants are guilty of any of the acts or practices prohibited by paragraph nine (9) hereof.' Paragraph 9 referred to enjoins the defendants 'from coercing or attempting to coerce independent operators into selling out to it, or to abandon plans to compete with it by predatory practices.' It asks that there be substituted for that provision one which the District Court had earlier approved restraining such acquisitions 'except after an affirmative showing that such acquisition will not unreasonably restrain competition.'\n The Court at times has rather freely modified decrees in Sherman Act cases where it approved the conclusions of the District Court as to the nature and character of the violations. Standard Oil Co. v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 1\n, 78-82, 31 S.Ct. 502, 523-525, 34 L.R.A.,N.S., 834, Ann.Cas.1912D, 734; United States v. American Tobacco Co., \n221 \nU.S. 106\n, 184-188, 31 S.Ct. 632, 650, 651. We recognize however that there is a wide range of discretion in the District Court to mould the decree to the exigencies of the particular case; and where the findings of violations are sustained, we will not direct a recasting of the decree except on a showing of abuse of discretion. See Ethyl Gasoline Corp. v. United \n\n[323 \nU.S. 173, 186]\n\u00a0\n States, \n309 \nU.S. 436, 461\n, 60 S.Ct. 618, 627; United States v. Bausch & Lomb Optical Co., \n321 \nU.S. 707, 725\n, 728 S., 64 S.Ct. 805, 814, 816. We think this is a case where we should act lest the public interest not be adequately protected by the decree as cast.\n The generality of this provision of the decree bids fair to call for a retrial of a Sherman Act case any time a citation for contempt is issued. The crucial facts in each case would be subtle ones as is usually true where purpose and motive are at issue. This type of provision is often the only practical remedy against continuation of illegal trade practices. But we are dealing here with a situation which permits of a more select treatment. The growth of this combine has been the result of predatory practices condemned by the Sherman Act. The object of the conspiracy was the destruction or absorption of competitors. It was successful in that endeavor. The pattern of past conduct is not easily forsaken. Where the proclivity for unlawful activity has been as manifest as here, the decree should operate as an effective deterrent to a repetition of the unlawful conduct and yet not stand as a barrier to healthy growth on a competitive basis. The acquisition of a competing theatre terminates at once its competition. Punishment for contempt does not restore the competition which has been eliminated. And where businesses have been merged or purchased and closed out it is commonly impossible to turn back the clock. Moreover if the District Court were to supervise future acquisitions in this case, it would not be undertaking an onerous and absorbing administrative burden. The burden would not seem more onerous than under the alternative provision where in substance the issue would be violation of the Sherman Act vel non.\n These considerations impel us to conclude that the decree should be revised so as to prohibit future acquisitions of a financial interest in additional theatres outside of \n\n[323 \nU.S. 173, 187]\n\u00a0\n Nashville 'except after an affirmative showing that such acquisition will not unreasonably restrain competition.'\n B. Objections of the Defendants. (1) The decree enjoins the defendant exhibitors from making franchises with certain distributors 'with the purpose and effect of maintaining their theatre monopolies and preventing independent theatres from competing with them' and from entering into 'any similar combinations and conspiracies having similar purposes and objects'. The decree also enjoins them from combining, in licensing films, their closed towns with their competitive situations 'for the purpose and with the effect of compelling the major distributors to license films on a non- competitive basis in competitive situations and to discriminate' against the independents. The decree also enjoins each defendant exhibitor 'from conditioning the licensing of films in any competitive situation (outside Nashville) upon the licensing of films in any other theatre situation.'\n It is argued that these provisions will aggrandize the distributors at the expense of the exhibitors, that if such measures are taken they should be taken against the distributors, that they deprive the exhibitors of group purchasing power, that the franchise agreements are normal and necessary both for distributors and exhibitors, and that these provisions of the decree are so vague and general as to greatly burden the conduct of these businesses.\n It is not for us, however, to pick and choose between competing business and economic theories in applying this law. Congress has made that choice. It has declared that the rule of trade and commerce should be competition not combination. United States v. Trenton Potteries Co., \n273 \nU.S. 392, 397\n, 47 S.Ct. 377, 379, 50 A.L.R. 989; Fashion Originators' Guild v. Federal Trade Commission, \n312 \nU.S. 457, 465\n, 668 S., 61 S.Ct. 703, 706. Since Congress has made that choice, we cannot refuse to sustain a decree because by some other measure of the public \n\n[323 \nU.S. 173, 188]\n\u00a0\n good the result may not seem desirable. United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., \n310 \nU.S. 150, 221\n, 222 S., 60 S.Ct. 811, 843, 844. The duty of the Court in these cases is 'to frame its decree so as to suppress the unlawful practices and to take such reasonable measures as would preclude their revival.' Ethyl Gasoline Corp. v. United States, supra, 309 U.S. at page 461, 60 S.Ct. at page 627. The chief weapons used by this combination in its unlawful warfare were the franchise agreements and the licensing system. The fact that those instruments could be lawfully used does not mean that the defendants may leave the court unfettered. Civil suits under the Sherman Act would indeed be idle gestures if the injunction did not run against the continuance or resumption of the unlawful practice. And it is hard to see how the decree could be made less general and more specific. If it is a burden which cannot be lightened by application to the court for exercise of the power which it has reserved over the decree, it is a burden which those who have violated the Act must carry. And the fact that there may be somewhere in the background a greater conspiracy from which flow consequences more serious than we have here is no warrant for a refusal to deal with the lesser one which is before us.\n\n\n (2)\n Serious complaint is made of the divestiture provisions of the decree. It requires each corporate exhibitor to divest itself of the ownership of any stock or other interest in any other corporate defendant or affiliated corporation,6 and enjoins it from acquiring any interest in those companies. Sudekum is required to resign as an officer of any corporation (except Crescent) which is affiliated with any defendant exhibitor and he is enjoined from acquiring control over any such affiliate (except Crescent) by acting as officer or otherwise. Stengel is required to resign as \n\n[323 \nU.S. 173, 189]\n\u00a0\n officer of the affiliates (except one corporation of his choice) and is enjoined from acquiring any control over the others by acting as an officer or otherwise. A year from the date of entry of the decree is allowed for completing this divestiture.\n It is said that these provisions are inequitable and harsh income tax wise, that they exceed any reasonable requirement for the prevention of future violations, and that they are therefore punitive.\n The Court has quite consistently recognized in this type of Sherman Act case that the government should not be confined to an injunction against further violations. Dissolution of the combination will be ordered where the creation of the combination is itself the violation. See Northern Securities Co. v. United States, \n193 \nU.S. 197\n, 354-360, 24 S.Ct. 436, 463-466; Standard Oil Co. v. United States, supra; United States v. American Tobacco Co., supra, 221 U.S. at pages 186-188, 31 S.Ct. at pages 650-651; United States v. Union Pacific R. Co., \n226 \nU.S. 61, 97\n, 33 S.Ct. 53, 61; United States v. Reading Co., \n253 \nU.S. 26, 63\n, 40 S.Ct. 425, 434; United States v. Lehigh Valley R. Co., \n254 \nU.S. 255\n, 41 S.Ct. 104; United States v.

Those who violate the Act may not reap the benefits of their violations and avoid an undoing of their unlawful project on the plea of hardship or inconvenience. That principle is adequate here to justify divestiture of all interest in some of the affiliates since their acquisition was part of the fruits of the conspiracy. But the relief need not, and under these facts, should not be so restricted. The fact that the companies were affiliated induced joint action and agreement. Common control was one of the instruments in bringing about unity of purpose and unity of action and in making the conspiracy effective. If that affiliation continues, there will be tempting opportunity for these exhibitors to continue to act in combination \n\n[323 \nU.S. 173, 190]\n\u00a0\n against the independents. The proclivity in the past to use that affiliation for an unlawful end warrants effective assurance that no such opportunity will be available in the future. Hence we do not think the District Court abused its discretion in failing to limit the relief to an injunction against future violations. There is no reason why the protection of the public interest should depend solely on that somewhat cumbersome procedure when another effective one is available.\n The fact that minority stockholders of the affiliated companies are not parties to the suit is no legal barrier to a separation of the companies. United States v. American Tobacco Co., supra. No legal right of one stockholder is normally affected if another stockholder is required to sell his stock. And no exception to that rule has been shown to exist here. Only business inconvenience and hardship are asserted. It is said, however, that the decree requires Rockwood and Cherokee (two defendant exhibitors) to sell their respective half-interests in two companies which were not made parties to the proceedings. The argument is that the latter companies are indispensable parties if such divestiture is required. Reliance is placed on State of Minnesota v. Northern Securities Co., \n184 \nU.S. 199\n, 22 S.Ct. 308. In that case Minnesota brought an original action in this Court alleging that the acquisition by Northern Securities Co. of the majority stock of two railroad companies effected a consolidation of the railroads in violation of Minnesota law. Minnesota asked, among other things, for an injunction against Northern Securities Co. voting the stock of those companies. The Court held that the two railroad companies were indispensable parties; and since the jurisdiction of the Court would have been defeated if they were joined, leave to file the bill was denied. Denial of the right of a majority stockholder to vote his stock would deprive the corporation of a board of direc- \n\n[323 \nU.S. 173, 191]\n\u00a0\n tors elected in accordance with state law. If such a step were taken, the corporation should be a party so that all corporate interests might be represented. State of Minnesota v. Northern Securities Co. goes no farther than that. Here there is no showing of any complication of that order. If such a complication appeared, the District Court could bring in the two affiliates as parties in order to effectuate the decree. United States v. Southern Pacific Co., supra, 259 U.S. at page 241, 42 S.Ct. at page 502. But on this record it does not appear that if Rockwood and Cherokee are required to sell their half-interests in those companies any legal right of any other stockholder would be affected. Cf. Morgan v. Struthers, \n131 \nU.S. 246\n, 9 S.Ct. 726.\n We have considered the other contentions and find them without merit.\n The appeal in No. 17 is dismissed.\n The judgment in No. 18 is reversed.\n The judgment in No. 19 is affirmed.\n It is so ordered.\n Appeal dismissed; one judgment affirmed; other judgment reversed.\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER, Mr. Justice MURPHY, and Mr. Justice JACKSON took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS dissents. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This was done after a consent decree had been entered against five of the major distributors in United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc. This dismissal did not eliminate the charge that these distributors had conspired with the defendant exhibitors to restrain and monopolize trade. And some of the distributors, though dismissed from the case, were found to be co-conspirators with the exhibitors in making franchise agreements and in licensing films for the purpose of maintaining the exhibitors' theatre monopolies and of preventing the independents from competing. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Crescent is used for Crescent Amusement Co.; Cumberland for Cumberland Amusement Co.; Lyric for Lyric Amusement Co., Inc.; Cherokee for Cherokee Amusements, Inc.; Kentucky for Kentucky Amusement Co., Inc.; Muscle Shoals for Muscle Shoals Theatres; and Rockwood for Rockwood Amusement Co. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The defendant exhibitors during the five year period preceding the filing of this suit paid about 90% of their total film rental to the eight major distributors. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The expansion of the combination during this period was summarized by the District Court as follows:\n'On August 11, 1934, the defendant exhibitors and their affiliates operated in thirty-two towns in Tennessee, (excluding Nashville) Kentucky, and Alabama, in six of which they had competition. On August 11, 1939, the defendant exhibitors and their affiliates with the exception of Strand, heretofore dismissed as a defendant, operated in seventy-eight towns in Tennessee excluding Nashville) Kentucky, Alabama, and North Carolina, in five of which they had competition, and the only towns in which they have competition today outside of Nashville, are Gadsden, Alabama, Harriman, Gallatin and McMinville, Tennessee, and Franklin, Kentucky. In two of these towns-Gadsden, Alabama, and Harriman, Tennessee, the independent theatres have opened since the filing of this suit and two more-Franklin, Kentucky and Gallatin, Tennessee-are towns which Crescent entered less than two years before the filing of this suit.\n\n'Of the forty-five towns in Tennessee listed in the 1940 census as having populations between 2,500 and 10,000, Crescent and its affiliates now operate theatres in all but nine. The independents operating in three of those nine towns have already been approached by Sudekum emissaries with the suggestion that they sell to one of the defendant exhibitors.'\n\n Their financial growth was found to be 'out of all proportion' to their physical expansion: \n'During the five-year period immediately preceding the suit, the Crescent and Rockwood companies each experienced a phenomenal growth in earnings and surplus which was out of all proportion to the increase in gross receipts and gross assets resulting from physical expansion of the business and improving general economic conditions. During the five-year fiscal period from June 30, 1934 to June 30, 1939, Crescent's total assets were less than doubled, but its surplus was increased thirty times. During the last fiscal year of said period its gross receipts were less than twice the amount of its gross receipts for the first fiscal year of said period, but its net profits (exclusive of dividends received) were more than five times those of the first year. During the five-year period, its net earnings (exclusive of dividends received) averaged about 35 per cent per annum, on its capitalization.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] A union of the exhibitor with a distributor in such a program would of course constitute a conspiracy under the Sherman Act as held in Interstate Circuit v.

GASKIN(1944)\nNo. 68\nArgued: Decided: January 3, 1944\n\n\n\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of Florida.\n Mr. W. Marvin Smith, of Washington, D.C., for appellant.\n Mr. Marion B. Knight, of Blounstown, Fla., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n An indictment was returned against the appellee in the District Court for Northern Florida which charged that he arrested one Johnson 'to a condition of peonage,' upon a claim that Johnson was indebted to him, and with intent to cause Johnson to perform labor in satisfaction of the debt, and that he forcibly arrested and detained Johnson against his will and transported him from one place to another within Florida. There was no allegation \n\n[320 \nU.S. 527, 528]\n\u00a0\n that Johnson rendered any labor or service in consequence of the arrest. From a judgment sustaining a demurrer,1 the United States appealed. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The charge is laid under  269 of the Criminal Code,3 which is: 'Whoever holds, arrests, returns, or causes to be held, arrested, or returned, or in any manner aids in the arrest or return of any person to a condition of peonage, shall be fined ... or imprisoned ....'\n The District Court held that the statute imposes no penalty for an arrest with intent to compel the performance of labor or service unless the person arrested renders labor or service for a master following the arrest.\n We think this was error. Section 269 derives from  1 of the Act of March 2, 1867,4 which abolished and prohibited the system known as peonage in any territory or state, nullified any law, ordinance, regulation, or usage inconsistent with the prohibition, and added criminal sanctions in the language now constituting  269. The Act was passed further to implement the Thirteenth Amendment and is directed at individuals whether or not acting under color of law or ordinance. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n The section makes arrest of a person with intent to place him in a state of peonage a separate and independent offense. It penalizes 'whoever holds, arrests, returns, or causes to be held, arrested, or returned ... any person to a condition of peonage.' The language is inartistic. The appropriate qualifying preposition for the word 'holds' is 'in'. An accurate qualifying phrase for the \n\n[320 \nU.S. 527, 529]\n\u00a0\n verb 'arrests' would be 'to place in or return to' peonage. But the compactness of phrasing and the lack of strict grammatical construction does not obscure the intent of the Act. Years ago this Court indicated that the disjunctive phrasing imports that each of the acts,-holding, arresting, or returning,-may be the subject of indictment and punishment. \n6\n We think that view is sound apart from any consideration of the legislative history of the enactment. But when viewed in its setting no doubt of the purpose of the statute remains.\n The Act of 1867 was passed as the result of agitation in Congress for further legislation because of the use of federal troops to arrest persons who had escaped from a condition of peonage. \n7\n The first section abolished and prohibited peonage and made certain practices in connection therewith criminal. The second section imposed a duty on all in the military and civil service to aid in the enforcement of the first, and provided that if any officer or other person in the military service should offend against the Act's provisions he should, upon conviction by a court martial, be dishonorably dismissed from the service. \n8\n It is plain that arrest for the purpose of placing a person in or returning him to a condition of peonage was one of the evils to be suppressed.\n The appellee invokes the rule that criminal laws are to be strictly construed and defendants are not to be convicted under statutes too vague to apprise the citizen of the nature of the offense. That principle, however, \n\n[320 \nU.S. 527, 530]\n\u00a0\n does not require distortion or nullification of the evident meaning and purpose of the legislation. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n The judgment is reversed.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY, dissenting.\n We are dealing here with a criminal statute, the penalties of which circumscribe personal freedom. Before we sanction the imposition of such penalties no doubts should exist as to the statutory proscription of the acts in question. Otherwise individuals are punished without having been adequately warned as to those actions which subjected them to liability.\n It is doubtful whether an arrest not followed by actual peonage clearly and unmistakably falls within the prohibition of  269 of the Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C.A.  444. The court below, at least, felt that the statute did not cover such a situation. Other judges have expressed similar doubts. United States v. Eberhart, C.C., 127 F. 252; dissenting opinion in Taylor v. United States, 4 Cir., 244 F. 321, 332, 333. And in order to reach the opposite conclusion, this Court labels the statutory language as 'inartistic' and as lacking in 'strict grammatical construction.' It then proceeds to rewrite the statute, in conformity with what it conceives to have been the original intention of Congress, so as to penalize 'whoever ... arrests ... any person for the purpose of placing him in a condition of peonage.' I cannot assent to this judicial revision of a criminal law. Congress alone has power to amend or clarify the criminal sanctions of a statute.\n Apologia for inadequate legislative draftsmanship and reliance on the admitted evils of peonage cannot replace the right of each individual to a fair warning from Congress as to those actions for which penalties are inflicted. \n\n[320 \nU.S. 527, 531]\n\u00a0\n Punishment without clear legislative authority might conceivably contain more potential seeds of oppression than the arrest of a person 'to a condition of peonage.' \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] D.C., 50 F.Supp. 607. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Pursuant to the Criminal Appeals Act, 18 U.S.C.  682, 18 U.S.C.A.  682. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] 18 U.S.C.  444, 18 U.S.C.A.  444. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] 14 Stat. 546. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] Clyatt v.

Sonosky, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. George H. Jennings, of Sapulpa, Okl., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question in this case is whether full-blood Indians of the Five Civilized Tribes may be divested of title to restricted land by a sale in partition proceedings to which the United States is not a party.\n A full-blood Creek Indian died leaving heirs of the full blood. They inherited certain lands from her, lands which were subject to restrictions on alienation both in her hands and in the hands of the heirs. \n1\n By  2 of the Act of June \n\n[322 \nU.S. 363, 364]\n\u00a0\n 14, 1918 (25 U.S.C.  355, 25 U.S.C.A.  355, 40 Stat. 606) Congress declared that such lands were 'made subject to the laws of the State of Oklahoma, providing for the partition of real estate.' \n2\n By  3 of the Act of April 12, 1926 (44 Stat. 239) Congress provided for the service upon the Superintendent for the Five Civilized Tribes of a prescribed written notice of the pendency of any suit to which a restricted member of the Tribes in Oklahoma or the restricted heirs or grantees are parties and which involves claims to 'lands allotted to a citizen of the Five Civilized Tribes or the proceeds, issues, rents, and profits derived from the same.' By that Act the United States is given an opportunity to appear in the cause and is bound by the judgment which is entered.\n The heirs instituted partition proceedings in the District Court for Creek County, Oklahoma in March 1940. The United States was not named as a party nor was notice of the suit served on the Superintendent. A judgment of partition was entered, pursuant to which the land was sold and a sheriff's deed in partition issued to respondent. In \n\n[322 \nU.S. 363, 365]\n\u00a0\n 1941 respondent instituted in the same court the present action against the Indian heirs to quiet his title. Notice was served on the Superintendent. The heirs answered disclaiming any interest. At the instance of the United States the cause was removed to the federal District Court as authorized by  3 of the Act of April 12, 1926. The United States then answered, alleging that the partition proceedings were void for lack of the United States as a party and for want of service on the Superintendent under  3 of the Act of April 12, 1926. It prayed that the deed in partition be set aside and title quieted in the heirs. The District Court held that the partition proceedings were valid and quieted title in respondent. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 138 F.2d 985. The case is here on a petition for a writ of certiorari which we granted because of the importance in the administration of Indian affairs of the question presented.\n It seems clear from the language of the Act of June 14, 1918 and its legislative history (S.Rep. No. 330, 65th Cong., 2d Sess.) that Congress vested in the Oklahoma state courts jurisdiction to determine heirship in these restricted lands ( 1) and jurisdiction to partition them.  2. See Salmon v. Johnson, 78 Okl. 182, 189 P. 537; United States v. Bond, 10 Cir., 108 F.2d 504. The authority of Congress to select state tribunals to perform such functions is clear. Parker v. Richard, \n250 \nU.S. 235\n, 39 S.Ct. 442; Harris v. Bell, \n254 \nU.S. 103\n, 41 S.Ct. 49; Stewart v. Keyes, \n295 \nU.S. 403\n, 55 S.Ct. 807. But a grant of jurisdiction to a particular court without more does not determine what parties are indispensable to the proceedings in question. Petitioner concedes that the United States is not a necessary party to proceedings to determine heirship under  1 of the Act of June 14, 1918. Since restrictions on alienation do not prevent inheritance, no governmental interest is at least directly involved in such a determination. It may likewise be inferred from the \n\n[322 \nU.S. 363, 366]\n\u00a0\n language, nature, and purpose of Acts of Congress which vest jurisdiction over specified Indian affairs in a designated court that Congress not only has made that tribunal the exclusive agency to effectuate the federal policy but also has dispensed with any requirement that the United States be a party to the proceedings. See Hy-yu-tse-mil-kin v. Smith, \n194 \nU.S. 401\n, 413-414, 24 S.Ct. 676, 680, 681. Winton v. Amos, \n255 \nU.S. 373, 392\n, 41 S.Ct. 342, 349. But we do not think that Congress did more by those provisions of the Act of June 14, 1918 with which we are presently concerned than to grant the Oklahoma state courts jurisdiction over partition proceedings.\n Restricted Indian land is property in which the United States has an interest. 'This national interest is not to be expressed in terms of property, or to be limited to the assertion of rights incident to the ownership of a reversion or to the holding of a technical title in trust.' Heckman v. United States, \n224 \nU.S. 413, 437\n, 32 S.Ct. 424, 431. Though the Indian's interest is alienated by judicial decree, the United States may sue to cancel the judgment and set the conveyance aside where it was not a party to the action. Bowling v. United States, \n233 \nU.S. 528\n, 34 S.Ct. 659; Privett v. United States, \n256 \nU.S. 201\n, 41 S.Ct. 455; Sunderland v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 226\n, 45 S.Ct. 64. Under  2 of the Act of June 14, 1918 lands partitioned in kind to full-bloods remain restricted. Only if the land is sold at partition sale are the restrictions removed. The governmental interest throughout the partition proceedings is as clear as it would be if the fee were in the United States. Minnesota v. United States, \n305 \nU.S. 382\n, 387-388, 59 S.Ct. 292, 294, 295; Town of Okemah, Okl., v. United States, 10 Cir., 140 F.2d 963. The United States as guardian of the Indians is necessarily interested either in obtaining partition in kind where that course conforms to its policy of preserving restricted land for the Indians or in seeing that the best possible price is obtained where a sale is desirable. Where, as here, the lands are both tax- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 363, 367]\n\u00a0\n exempt and restricted, the United States is concerned with the reinvestment of the proceeds in other lands likewise tax-exempt and restricted as provided in the Act of June 30, 1932, 47 Stat. 474, 25 U.S.C .  409a, 25 U.S.C.A. \n3\n The United States is also interested in protecting the preferential right of the Secretary of the Interior to purchase the land at the sale for another Indian as provided in  2 of the Act of June 26, 1936, 49 Stat. 1967, 25 U.S.C.A.  502.4 These are important governmental interests. Since the power of Congress over Indian affairs is plenary, it may waive or withdraw these duties of guardianship or entrust them to such agency-state or federal-as it chooses. But we do not find any indication that when Congress came to deal with these partition proceedings it substituted the Oklahoma state court for the Secretary of the Interior in the performance of the \n\n[322 \nU.S. 363, 368]\n\u00a0\n functions which we have enumerated. That alone would not be fatal to respondent's position if it could be inferred that those governmental interests were to be protected by means other than making the United States a party. But, as we have said, the Act in question purports to be no more than a jurisdictional statute. It fails to say that the United States is not a necessary party; nor does it suggest that the United States or its officers are confined to a limited role in the proceedings. Cf. United States v. Candelaria, \n271 \nU.S. 432, 444\n, 46 S.Ct. 561, 563. We must read the Act in light of the history of restricted lands. That history shows that the United States has long been considered a necessary party to such proceedings in view of the large governmental interests which are at stake. We will not infer from a mere grant of jurisdiction to a state or federal court to adjudicate claims to restricted lands and to order their sale or other distribution that Congress dispensed with that long-standing requirement. The purpose to effectuate such a major change in policy must be clear.\n Much stress is laid on the point that if  2 of the Act of June 14, 1918 is so construed, it was meaningless until the Act of April 12, 1926 was passed which provided a statutory method for making the United States a party. The argument is that prior to the latter Act there was no way of joining the United States as a party to such an action. But as stated by Mr. Justice Brandeis speaking for the Court in Minnesota v. United States, supra, 305 U.S. at page 388, 59 S.Ct. at page 295, authorization to bring an action involving restricted lands 'confers by implication permission to sue the United States.' 5 The suit in that case failed because no jurisdiction was granted to the state courts to condemn the lands in question. \n6\n But since the state court in the present case was given jurisdiction to partition, consent to be sued in the \n\n[322 \nU.S. 363, 369]\n\u00a0\n state court may be implied. Service of process therefore might be had in the usual way (see Town of Okemah, Okl., v. United States, supra, 140 F.2d at page 966) even in absence of the 1926 Act.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 35 Stat. 312; 44 Stat. 239; 45 Stat. 495; 47 Stat. 777. And see Parker v.

Construing  5(2)(a) and (b) of Part I of the Interstate Commerce Act, 24 Stat. 379, as amended by the Transportation Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 905, 49 U.S.C.  5(2)(a) and (b), 49 U.S.C.A.  5(2)(a, b), as requiring the application to be made by Union, the non-carrier corporation controlling Refiners, the Commssion denied the application of the carriers for lack of power in the Commission to approve the purchase.\n The questions for our decision are (1) whether the acquisition of the property and franchises of one carrier by another, which is controlled by a non-carrier, involves the acquisition of control of the first or vendor- carrier by the non-carrier for which the Commission's approval is required by  5(2)(a) of the Interstate Commerce Act; and if so (2) whether the Commission rightly held that under  5(2)(b) of the Act it could not consider the propriety of the transaction in the absence of an application by the non-carrier for the Commission's authority to acquire control.\n Appellee Refiners holds certificates of public convenience and necessity from the Interstate Commerce Commission to operate as a common carrier, by motor vehicle, of gasoline and petroleum products in Pennsylvania and eight of the central states. Refiners, as the Commission \n\n[322 \nU.S. 31, 33]\n\u00a0\n found, is controlled through ownership of 82.6% of its outstanding common stock by Union Tank Car Company, a non-carrier corporation. Marshall, a corporation, holds a certificate of public convenience and necessity under the grandfather clause  206 of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.  306, 49 U.S.C.A.  306, authorizing carriage as a common carrier of petroleum products in bulk in tank trucks over irregular routes in Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington, D.C. By their joint application Refiners and Marshall sought authority of the Commission under  5(2)(a) for Refiners to acquire by purchase the operating property and rights of Marshall.\n After a hearing on the application, in which nine motor carriers, co- appellants here, appeared as protestants and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice intervened, Division 4 of the Commission issued its report finding that the proposed purchase was within the scope of  5(2)(a) and (b) and would be consistent with the public interest. It overruled contentions of the protestants that the proposed purchase would result in the acquisition of control of Marshall by Union, the non-carrier, through its control of Refiners, the purchaser, so as to require that Union join in the application. 39 M.C.C. 93. On petition for rehearing the Commission reversed the holding of Division 4. It concluded that as Union the non- carrier, already controlled one carrier, Refiners, the purchase of the property and business of Marshall by Refiners would result in their control by Union and that under  5(2)(a) and (b) and related sections this could not be done without an application by Union for the Commission's authority to do so. 39 M.C.C. 271.\n Union having failed to apply for that authority within the twenty days allowed for that purpose by the Commission's order, the Commission dismissed the pending application of Refiners and Marshall. Upon the suit of appel- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 31, 34]\n\u00a0\n lees the District Court for Maryland, three judges sitting, set aside the Commission's order, Circuit Judge Soper dissenting, 52 F.Supp. 1010, and the case comes here on appeal under 28 U.S.C.  47a, 345, 28 U.S.C.A.  47a, 345.\n Section 5(2)(a) of the Act, makes it 'lawful, with the approval and authorization of the Commission ... for two or more carriers to consolidate or merge their properties or franchises ... into one corporation for the ownership, management, and operation of the properties theretofore in separate ownership; or for any carrier ... to purchase ... the properties ... of another; ... or for a person which is not a carrier and which has control of one or more carriers to acquire control of another carrier through ownership of its stock or otherwise'.\n Section 5(2)(b) provides that 'Whenever a transaction is proposed under subparagraph (a), the carrier or carriers or person seeking authority therefor shall present an application to the Commission ....' And  5(3) provides that 'Whenever a person which is not a carrier is authorized, by an order entered under paragraph (2), to acquire control of any carrier or of two or more carriers, such person thereafter shall, to the extent provided by the Commission in such order, be considered as a carrier subject to' specified provisions of the Act, relating mainly to the keeping of accounts, the making of reports, access to records, the issuance of securities and the assumption of liabilities.\n Section 5(4) makes it 'unlawful for any person, except as provided in paragraph (2), to enter into any transaction within the scope of subparagraph (a) thereof, or to accomplish or effectuate, or to participate in accomplishing or effectuating, the control or management in a common interest of any two or more carriers, however such result is attained, whether directly or indirectly, by use of ... a holding or investment company or companies, a voting trust or trusts, or in any other manner whatsoever. ... As used in this paragraph and paragraph (5), the words \n\n[322 \nU.S. 31, 35]\n\u00a0\n 'control or management' shall be construed to include the power to exercise control or management.'\n In determining whether, under the non-carrier control clause of  5(2)( a), Union, the non-carrier here, is required to file an application with the Commission, the issue turns on the questions whether, within the meaning of the statute, Union is by the proposed transaction attempting to 'acquire control' of Marshall and, if so, whether Union is within the requirement of  5(2)(b) that the person seeking the authority of the Commission to acquire such control shall present his application to the Commission. In answering these questions the District Court thought that the several instances specified by  5(2)(a), in which the Commission is authorized to permit acquisition of carrier control, are separate and independent of each other so that, the Commission having full authority to authorize Refiners to purchase Marshall under the merger and purchase provisions of  5(2)(a), its authority in that respect is not limited or superseded by the non-carrier control provision appearing later in the subparagraph and that provision is therefore inapplicable.\n In any case the District Court concluded that these provisions are permissive only, giving the Commission authority to act with respect to any one without regard to the restriction imposed by any other. Since Refiners' and Marshall's application to the Commission for approval of Refiners' purchase of Marshall's property and operating rights are within the permissive authority of the Commission under the purchase provision of  5(2)(a), the Court thought that it was not necessary for Union to comply with the non-carrier provision and with the requirement of  5(2)(b) by joining in the application even though the non-carrier provision would otherwise be applicable to the transaction.\n But this overlooks the fact, which the Commission thought controlling, that the present transaction may fall \n\n[322 \nU.S. 31, 36]\n\u00a0\n within both the purchase provision and the non-carrier control provision of the statute since it involves not only the purchase of Marshall by Refiners but also the acquisition of control of Marshall by Union, through its control of Refiners. The question then is not whether the non-carrier control provision limits or supersedes the purchase provision but whether, as the Commission thought, both apply, and if so the extent to which they restrict the Commission's authority to approve the acquisition of control by a non-carrier which has not filed an application pursuant to  5(2)(b).\n As a matter of statutory construction it does not follow that such parts of the proposed transaction in this case as are subject to the requirement of the non-carrier control provision can escape that requirement because the transaction also involves a purchase which falls within and satisfies the requirement of the purchase provision of the statute. Section 5(4) prohibits each of the transactions enumerated in  5( 2)(a) unless approved by the Commission. And it is plain that if the proposed transaction involves Union's non-carrier control of Marshall within the meaning of  5(2)(a), appropriate application to the Commission for its approval must be made in conformity to  5(2)(b). Hence our inquiry must be directed to the nature of the requirement of the non- carrier control provision of the statute and to the question whether if applicable it is satisfied by appellees' application to the Commission in which Union did not join.\n It is not doubted that if Union, having control of Refiners, sought to acquire stock control of Marshall, Union would be required by  5(2)(b) to apply for the Commission's authority to do so. But it is said that having control of Refiners, Union may, by procuring Refiners' compliance with the purchase provisions of the statute alone, extend its control indefinitely to other carriers merely by directing the purchase of their property and \n\n[322 \nU.S. 31, 37]\n\u00a0\n business by Refiners, without subjecting itself to the jurisdiction of the Commission as provided in  5(3), so long as Union does not act directly as the purchaser of the property1 or of a controlling stock interest in such other carriers.\n We think that neither the language nor the legislative history of the statute admits of so narrow a construction. Section 5(4) makes it unlawful, without the approval of the Commission as provided by  5(2)(a), for a person which is not a carrier and which has control of one or more carriers to acquire control of another carrier through ownership of its stock or otherwise. Not only is this language broad enough in terms to embrace the acquisition of control by a non-carrier through the purchase, by a controlled carrier, of the property and business of another carrier, but the legislative history indicates that such was its purpose.\n Congress, by  407 of the Transportation Act of 1920, 41 Stat. 480, amended the Interstate Commerce Act so as to provide in  5(2) that the Commission should have authority to permit a rail carrier or carriers to acquire control of another by lease or purchase of stock; by  5(8) the carriers affected were relieved from the operation of the antitrust laws, and by  5(6) the Commission was authorized upon special conditions to approve the actual consolidation of rail carriers. By the 1933 amendment of  5(2), 48 Stat. 217, the Commission was given further authority to permit unified control of two separate carriers 'through ownership of their stock' and in 1940,  5(2)(a) was amended to read as at present by the addition \n\n[322 \nU.S. 31, 38]\n\u00a0\n of the words 'or otherwise' to the phrase last quoted, and the section was made applicable to motor carriers, 54 Stat. 905. Section 1(3)(b) of the Act as amended in 1940 declares that 'control' 'shall be construed to include actual as well as legal control, whether maintained or exercised through or by reason of the method of or circumstances surrounding organization or operation, through or by common directors, officers, or stockholders, a voting trust or trusts, a holding or investment company or companies, or through or by any other direct or indirect means; and to include the power to exercise control'.\n The Conference Committee Report on the Transportation Act of 1940, H. R. Rep. No. 2832, 76th Cong., 3rd Sess., p. 63, points out that this definition of 'control' was added in order to make applicable to specified sections of the Act, including  5, the benefit of the interpretation of this Court in Rochester Telephone Corporation v. United States, \n307 \nU.S. 125\n. 145, 146, 59 S.Ct. 754, 764, 765, of the similar definition of 'control' in  2 of the Communications Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 1065, 47 U.S.C.  152(b), 47 U.S.C.A.  152(b). In that case this Court had emphasized the breadth of the statutory language as embracing every type of control in fact. It had declared that the existence of control must be determined by a regard for the 'actualities' of intercorporate relationships and that the Commission's determinations of fact, if warranted by the record, were conclusive.\n Here the statute has declared that the non-carrier control to be approved by the Commission is control through stock ownership 'or otherwise'.  5(2)(a). It has in the broadest terms prohibited the effectuating of 'control or management ... however such result is attained, whether directly or indirectly, by use of common directors, officers, or stockholders, a holding or investment company ... or in any other manner whatsoever.'  5(4). 'Control or management' is defined to include 'the power to exercise control or management'.  5(4). The con- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 31, 39]\n\u00a0\n trol or management whose acquisition is prohibited unless the approval of the Commission is secured is that which is obtained 'in any ... manner whatsoever', 'however such result is attained, whether directly or indirectly',  5(4). It includes 'actual as well as legal control',  1(3)( b), and 'the power to exercise control or management,'  5(4).\n Appellees argue that the Commission, in finding that the proposed purchase of the property and franchises of Marshall would be an acquisition of 'control' requiring the Commission's approval under  5(2)( a) and 5(4), disregarded the words of the statute which speaks only of acquisition of control of another 'carrier', defined in  1(3)(a) as a person, 'natural or artificial', and not of acquisition of control of its property. But such a literal interpretation of the statute ignores its essential object. What  5(4) read with  5(2)(a) prohibits, unless authorized by the Commission, is the merger by two or more carriers of 'their properties or franchises ... into one corporation for the ownership, management, and operation of the properties theretofore in separate ownership', and the acquisition by a non-carrier, having control of one carrier, of control of another, or the effectuating in any other manner of 'the control or management in a common interest of any two or more carriers'.\n The statute is thus concerned, not merely with the acquisition of control of one corporation by another, but with the acquisition of control of a corporation which is doing the business of a carrier, because such control is in effect control of its carrier business. Control of that business, which may be effected by stock ownership, may also be 'otherwise' effected through a contract of a controlled carrier to purchase the business of the other carrier, if the purchase receives the approval of the Commission. The power thus acquired over the vendor- carrier by the contract of purchase is the power 'to exercise control or \n\n[322 \nU.S. 31, 40]\n\u00a0\n management' over its carrier business which, under  5(4), can become effective only with the approval of the Commission. As the Commission pointed out in its report, there can be no more direct or positive manner of obtaining control than by outright purchase of another carrier's business and property, and the purpose of the Act would be defeated if outright purchase, through the medium of a controlled subsidiary carrier, of another carrier's property and operating rights, were exempted, while control by purchase of stock of the other carrier through the same subsidiary remained within the Act.\n The Commission also emphasized the fact that, as the motor carrier business is now organized, purchase of the assets and franchises of carriers would be the usual and in many cases the only feasible method of acquiring control of them. It pointed out that many of the businesses are owned by individuals or partnerships, often possessing extensive operating rights. In the case of corporations their stock is usually closely held and they are without outstanding long-term debt obligations. In all these cases a simple and usual method of acquiring control of other carriers is by the cash purchase of their assets and operating rights and the assumption of their liabilities followed by liquidation of the vendor. The Commission concluded, 'Proceeding thus through a controlled subsidiary, a non-carrier holding company, or others, may expand at will without becoming subject to our jurisdiction under the construction adopted by the division. We cannot agree to that construction of 'control' as used in the act'. 39 M.C.C. at 275. For the reasons which we have stated we think the Commission's construction of the Act in this respect is correct.\n The question remains whether the Commission had authority to proceed in the absence of any application by Union. By  5(4) any transaction within the scope of \n\n[322 \nU.S. 31, 41]\n\u00a0\n subparagraph (a) of paragraph (2) is unlawful except as provided by that paragraph, which includes subparagraph (b). Section 5(2)(a), read with  5( 4), requires the acquisition of control to be with the approval of the Commission. And  5(2)(b) requires the 'person' seeking authority for a transaction covered by subparagraph (a), here the non-carrier control of Marshall, to present an application to the Commission. The Commission may approve the application 'subject to such terms and conditions and such modifications as it shall find to be just and reasonable'. The purpose of these provisions of  5(2)(b) and 5(4) is apparent when they are read with  5(3), which authorizes the Commission, by its order permitting non- carrier control, to require such non-carrier to be considered a carrier subject to the Act to the extent provided in the order made in conformity to  5(3).\n The control over the non-carrier contemplated by  5(3) can be acquired only if the non-carrier subjects itself to the jurisdiction of the Commission by filing its application with the Commission for its approval of such non-carrier control as is provided by  5(2)(b). The purpose of  5(3) to subject the non-carrier, thus acquiring control, to specified provisions of the Act would be defeated if the non-carrier were not to become subject to the Commission's order. That is avoided by making it unlawful to acquire non-carrier control save on the non-carrier's application to the Commission in conformity to  5(2)(b). As appellees' application to the Commission involved the acquisition of non-carrier control of Marshall by Union, Union was a person seeking authority for such control and as such was required by  5(2)(b) to make application to the Commission. To approve the transaction involving such non-carrier control without the application of the non-carrier would be to authorize \n\n[322 \nU.S. 31, 42]\n\u00a0\n Union's non-carrier control of Marshall without subjecting the former to the Commission's jurisdiction as required by  5(3).\n The Commission rightly concluded that it was without authority to approve such control unless Union, the non-carrier, filed its application with the Commission, and since Union failed to do so within the time allowed by the Commission's order, the Commission properly dismissed the pending application in which Union had failed to join. It was therefore error for the District Court to set aside the Commission's order, and the judgment of the District Court is reversed.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS is of the opinion that the judgment should be affirmed for the reasons given by the District Court. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Such an acquisition of operating property, whether or not within  5(2)(a), would render the acquiring corporation an operating carrier within  203(a) (14-16) subject as such to the jurisdiction of the Commission under Part II. Similarly, the transfer of the carrier's operating franchises would be subject to the Commission's jurisdiction under  212(b). \n\n\n\n\n","115":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v. SEATTLE-FIRST NAT. BANK(1944)\nNo. 267\nArgued: Decided: March 27, 1944\n\n\n\n\n[321 \nU.S. 583, 584]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Valentine Brookes, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Arnold L. Graves, of Spokane, Wash., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent initiated this suit to recover the amount of the documentary stamp tax, penalty and interest which had been exacted under the Revenue Act of 1926, as amended, in connection with a statutory consolidation of banks under Section 3 of the National Banking Act. \n1\n The District Court entered judgment for respondent for the amount of the tax and interest, 44 F.Supp. 603.2 The Circuit Court of Appeals held that the case was governed by one of its former decisions3 and affirmed the judgment, 136 F.2d 676. We granted certiorari, \n320 \nU.S. 723\n, 64 S.Ct. 67, because this judgment was alleged to conflict with decisions in other circuits4 and because of the desirability of a final settlement of the problems involved. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 583, 585]\n\u00a0\n In 1935 the directors of the Spokane and Eastern Trust Company, state bank, entered into a written agreement of consolidation with the directors of the First National Bank of Seattle. The agreement provided that the banks were to be consolidated under the charter of the First National Bank of Seattle and under the new corporate title of Seattle-First National Bank, the respondent herein. The agreement was ratified and confirmed by the requisite number of stockholders of both banks and the Comptroller of the Currency issued the necessary certificate of approval, reciting that the directors and shareholders of both banks had complied with the provisions of the National Banking Act.\n The state bank owned real estate, including its banking premises, as well as corporate stocks and bonds, to all of which it held legal and beneficial title as part of its corporate assets. It also held in trust certain stocks and bonds, the legal title to which was vested in it as trustee, executor, administrator, guardian, or in other fiduciary capacities. Section 5 of the consolidation agreement provided that 'All assets of each association at the date of consolidation shall pass to and vest in the consolidated association, and the consolidated association shall be responsible for all of the liabilities of every kind and description of each of the consolidating associations.'\n The transfer to respondent of title to this property held by the state bank was not evidenced by any deed, conveyance, assignment or other instrument. Nor were any documentary stamps purchased or affixed with respect to such transfer. Subsequently, a deputy collector examined the bank records and exacted a tax from respondent on the theory that the consolidation had resulted in a taxable transfer. The necessary stamps were purchased and affixed and this suit for refund followed.\n First. We conclude that, as to the securities to which the state bank held both legal and beneficial title, there \n\n[321 \nU.S. 583, 586]\n\u00a0\n was no taxable transfer under the stamp tax provisions in effect at the time the consolidation took place.\n Section 800, Schedule A(3), of the Revenue Act of 1926, as amended,5 imposes a stamp tax on transfers of legal title to any shares of stock or certificates, 'whether made upon or shown by the books of the corporation or other organization, or by any assignment in blank, or by any delivery, or by any paper or agreement or memorandum or other evidence of transfer or sale (whether entitling the holder in any manner to the benefit of such share certificate ... or not).' Schedule A(9)6 imposes a stamp tax on similar transfers of legal title to bonds.\n Standing alone, these statutory provisions make no exceptions and clearly impose a tax on the transfer of title to the securities legally and beneficially owned by the state bank. But administrative regulations, which until recently have been left undisturbed by subsequently enacted legislation and are to be respected as settled administrative practice,7 have carved out certain exemptions germane to the transfer here involved. Thus Article 34(r) of Treasury Regulations 71 (1932 Ed.) provides that the transfer of stock owned by a corporation which is merged into another corporation is subject to the stamp tax, 'such a transfer being effected by the \n\n[321 \nU.S. 583, 587]\n\u00a0\n act of the parties and not wholly by operation of law.' \n8\n Article 35(r) specifically exempts from the tax those transfers of shares or certificates of stock 'which result wholly by operation of law'; it further states that 'transfers of this character are those which the law itself will effect without any voluntary act of the parties, such as transfer of stock from decedent to executor.' Article 120 makes these same provisions applicable to sales or transfers of bonds. The problem thus resolves itself into a determination of whether the transfer of the state bank's securities to respondent occurred 'wholly by operation of law' so as to exempt the transfer from the stamp tax requirements.\n It is clear that the consolidation or merger of the national bank and the state bank occurred through the voluntary acts of the respective directors and stockholders pursuant to the provisions of Section 3 of the National Banking Act, with the approval of the Comptroller of the Currency. If the words 'wholly by operation of law,' as used in the administrative regulations, refer here to the entire process of consolidation, of which the transfer of securities is an essential part, the exemption cannot be applied. But in a broad sense, few if any transfers ever take place 'wholly by operation of law' for every transfer must necessarily be a part of a chain of human events, rarely if ever other than voluntary in character. Thus to give any real substance to the exemption, we must take a more narrow view and examine the transfer apart from its general background. We must look only to the immediate mechanism by which the transfer is made ef- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 583, 588]\n\u00a0\n fective. If that mechanism is entirely statutory, effecting an automatic transfer without any voluntary action by the parties, then the transfer may truly be said to be 'wholly by operation of law.'\n Here the actual transfer to respondent of the legal and beneficial title to the securities owned by the state bank was not affected by or dependent on any of the voluntary acts relating to the consolidation agreement or the ratification or approval thereof. Nor was any voluntary deed, conveyance, assignment or other instrument utilized. Rather the transfer occurred solely and automatically by virtue of Section 3 of the National Banking Act. This provides in pertinent part that: (1) upon consolidation, the corporate existence of each of the constituent banks shall be merged and continued in the consolidated national banking association, which shall be deemed to be the same corporation as the constituent banks; (2) all the rights, franchises and interests of each constituent bank in and to every species of property, real, personal and mixed, and choses in action thereto belonging, 'shall be deemed to be transferred to and vested in' the consolidated association without any deed or other transfer; (3) the consolidated association, by virtue of such consolidation and without any order or other action by any court or otherwise, shall hold and enjoy the same and all rights of property, franchises and interests (including fiduciary interests) in the same manner and to the same extent as held and enjoyed by the constituent banks.\n Thus it is the National Banking Act that is the mechanism by which the transfer of securities is made effective. No voluntary act by the parties is necessary. If follows that the transfer occurred 'wholly by operation of law.' The mere fact that the parties here saw fit to include in their consolidation agreement a provision that all assets of each constituent bank 'shall pass to and vest in the consolidated association' does not make the transfer any \n\n[321 \nU.S. 583, 589]\n\u00a0\n less than one 'wholly by operation of law.' This was merely an agreement that the assets would be transferred in the future and did not purport to be a present, effective conveyance. The transfer of the securities to which the state bank held legal and beneficial title was therefore exempt from the stamp tax under Articles 34(r) and 35(r).\n Second. We reach the same conclusion as to the transfer of securities to which the state bank held legal title in trust in various fiduciary capacities. The intent to tax such transfers must be clear and unmistakable. No such intent is apparent here. Under Section 3 of the National Banking Act, these securities passed to respondent 'wholly by operation of law' just as did the securities previously discussed. Articles 34(r) and 35(r) make no distinction between transfers of stocks from a fiduciary and transfers from one who is also the beneficial owner. The exemption therein contained is therefore applicable. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n Third. The transfer of the real property owned by the state bank is likewise, in our opinion, exempt from the stamp tax.\n Section 800, Schedule A(8), of the Revenue Act of 1926, as amended,10 places a stamp tax on 'Conveyances: Deed, instrument, or writing, delivered ... whereby any lands, tenements, or other realty sold shall be granted, assigned, transferred, or otherwise conveyed to, or vested in, the \n\n[321 \nU.S. 583, 590]\n\u00a0\n purchaser or purchasers ....' It is clear, however, from Section 3 of the National Banking Act that the state bank's realty was not conveyed to or vested in respondent by means of any deed, instrument or writing. There was a complete absence of any of the formal instruments or writings upon which the stamp tax is laid. Nor can the realty be said to have been 'sold' or vested in a 'purchaser or purchasers' within the ordinary meanings of those terms. Only by straining the realities of the statutory consolidation process can respondent be said to have 'bought' or 'purchased' the real property. That we are unable to do.\n The judgment of the court below is therefore affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of November 7, 1918, c. 209, 40 Stat. 1043, Sec. 3, as added by the Act of February 25, 1927, c. 191, 44 Stat. 1224, Sec. 1, and as amended by the Banking Act of 1933, c. 89, 48 Stat. 162, Sec. 24, and the Banking Act of 1935, c. 614, 49 Stat. 684, Sec. 331, 12 U.S.C.  34a, 12 U.

SOUTH-EASTERN UNDERWRITERS ASS'N(1944)\nNo. 354\nArgued: January 11, 1944Decided: June 5, 1944\n\n\n\n Rehearing Denied Oct. 9, 1944\n\n\n See 65 S.Ct. 26.\n On Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of Georgia.\n Mr. Francis Biddle, Atty. Gen., for appellant.\n Messrs. John T. Cahill, of New York City, and Dan MacDougald, of Atlanta, Ga., for appellees. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 534]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n For seventy-five years this Court has held, whenever the question has been presented, that the Commerce Clause of the Constitution does not deprive the individual states of power to regulate and tax specific activities of foreign insurance companies which sell policies within their territories. Each state has been held to have this power even though negotiation and execution of the companies' policy contracts involved communications of information and movements of persons, moneys, and papers across state lines. Not one of all these cases, however, has involved an Act of Congress which required the Court to decide the issue of whether the Commerce Clause grants to Congress the power to regulate insurance transactions stretching across state lines. Today for the first time in the history of the Court that issue is squarely presented and must be decided.\n Appellees-the South-Eastern Underwriters Association (S.E.U.A.), and its membership of nearly 200 private stock fire insurance companies, and 27 individuals-were indicted in the District Court for alleged violations of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. The indictment alleges two conspiracies. The first, in violation of  1 of the Act, was to restrain interstate trade and commerce by fixing and maintaining arbitrary and non-competitive premium rates on fire and specified 'allied lines'1 of insurance in \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 535]\n\u00a0\n Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia; the second, in violation of  2, was to monopolize trade and commerce in the same lines of insurance in and among the same states. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The indictment makes the following charges: The member companies of S. E.U.A. controlled 90 per cent of the fire insurance and 'allied lines' sold by stock fire insurance companies in the six states where the conspiracies were consummated. \n3\n Both conspiracies consisted of a continuing agreement and concert of action effectuated through S.E.U.A. The conspirators not only fixed premium rates and agents' commissions, but employed boycotts together with other types of coercion and intimidation to force non-member insurance companies into the conspiracies, and to compel persons who needed insurance to buy only from S.E.U.A. members on S. E.U.A. terms. Companies not members of S.E.U.A. were cut off from the opportunity to reinsure their risks, and their services and facilities were disparaged; independent sales agencies who defiantly rep- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 536]\n\u00a0\n resented non-S.E.U.A. companies were punished by a withdrawal of the right to represent the members of S.E.U.A.; and persons needing insurance who purchased from non-S.E.U.A. companies were threatened with boycotts and withdrawal of all patronage. The two conspiracies were effectively policed by inspection and rating bureaus in five of the six states, together with local boards of insurance agents in certain cities of all six states.\n The kind of interference with the free play of competitive forces with which the appellees are charged is exactly the type of conduct which the Sherman Act has outlawed for American 'trade or commerce' among the states. \n4\n Appellees5 have not argued otherwise. Their defense, set forth in a demurrer, has been that they are not required to conform to the standards of business conduct established by the Sherman Act because 'the business of fire insurance is not commerce.' Sustaining the demurrer, the District Court held that 'the business of insurance is not commerce, either intrastate or interstate;' it 'is not interstate commerce or interstate trade, though it might be considered a trade subject to local laws, either State or Federal, where the commerce clause is not the authority relied upon.' 51 F.Supp. 712, 713, 714.\n The District Court's opinion does not contain the slightest intimation that the indictment was held defective on a theory that it charged the appellees with restraining and monopolizing nothing but the making of local contracts. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 537]\n\u00a0\n There was not even a demurrer on that ground. The District Court treated the indictment as charging illegal restraints of trade in the total 'activities complained of as constituting the business of insurance.' 51 F. Supp. 712, 713. And in great detail the indictment set out these total activities, of which the actual making of contracts was but a part. As recognized by the District Court, the insurance business described in the indictment included not only the execution of insurance contracts but also negotiations and events prior to execution of the contracts and the innumerable transactions necessary to performance of the contracts. All of these alleged transactions, we shall hereafter point out, constituted a single continuous chain of events, many of which were multistate in character, and none of which, if we accept the allegations of the indictment, could possibly have been continued but for that part of them which moved back and forth across state lines. True, many of the activities described in the indictment which constituted this chain of events might, if conceptually separated from that from which they are inseparable, be regarded as wholly local. But the District Court in construing the indictment did not attempt such a metaphysical separation. Looking at all the transactions charged, it felt compelled by previous decisions of this Court to hold that despite the interstate character of many of them 'the business of insurance is not commerce', and that as a consequence this 'business', contracts and all, could not be 'interstate commerce' or 'interstate trade.' In other words, the District Court held the indictment bad for the sole reason that the entire 'business of insurance' (not merely the part of the business in which contracts are physically executed) can never under any possibly circumstances be 'commerce', and that therefore, even though an insurance company conducts a substantial part of its business transactions across state lines, it is not engaged in 'commerce among the States' within the meaning of \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 538]\n\u00a0\n either the Commerce Clause or the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. \n6\n Therefore, to say that the indictment charges nothing more than restraint and monopoly in the 'mere formation of an insurance contract', as has been suggested in this Court, is to give it a different and narrower meaning than did the District Court,-something we cannot do consistently with the Criminal Appeals Act which permits the case to come here on direct appeal. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n The record, then, presents two questions and no others: (1) Was the Sherman Act intended to prohibit conduct of fire insurance companies which restrains or monopolizes the interstate fire insurance trade? (2) If so, do fire insurance transactions which stretch across state lines constitute 'Commerce among the several States' so as to make them subject to regulation by Congress under the \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 539]\n\u00a0\n Commerce Clause? Since it is our conclusion that the Sherman Act was intended to apply to the fire insurance business we shall, for convenience of discussion, first consider the latter question.\n\n\n I.\n\n\n Ordinarily courts do not construe words used in the Constitution so as to give them a meaning more narrow than one which they had in the common parlance of the times in which the Constitution was written. To hold that the word 'commerce' as used in the Commerce Clause does not include a business such as insurance would do just that. Whatever other meanings 'commerce' may have included in 1787, the dictionaries, encyclopedias, and other books of the period show that it included trade: businesses in which persons bought and sold, bargained and contracted. \n8\n And this meaning has persisted to modern times. Surely, therefore, a heavy burden is on him who asserts that the plenary power which the Commerce Clause grants to Congress to regulate 'Commerce among the several States' does not include the power to regulate trading in insurance to the same extent that it includes power to regulate other trades or businesses conducted across state lines. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n The modern insurance business holds a commanding position in the trade and commerce of our Nation. Built \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 540]\n\u00a0\n upon the sale of contracts of indemnity, it has become one of the largest and most important branches of commerce. \n10\n Its total assets exceed $37,000, 000,000, or the approximate equivalent of the value of all farm lands and buildings in the United States. \n11\n Its annual premium receipts exceed $6, 000,000,000, more than the average annual revenue receipts of the United States Government during the last decade. \n12\n Included in the labor force of insurance are 524,000 experienced workers, almost as many as seek their livings in coal mining or automobile manufacturing. \n13\n Perhaps no modern commercial enterprise directly affects so many persons in all walks of life as does the insurance business. Insurance touches the home, the family, and the occupation or the business of almost every person in the United States. 14 \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 541]\n\u00a0\n This business is not separated into 48 distinct territorial compartments which function in isolation from each other. Interrelationship, interdependence, and integration of activities in all the states in which they operate are practical aspects of the insurance companies' methods of doing business. A large share of the insurance business is concentrated in a comparatively few companies located, for the most part, in the financial centers of the East. \n15\n Premiums collected from policyholders in every part of the United States flow into these companies for investment. As policies become payable, checks and drafts flow back to the many states where the policyholders reside. The result is a continuous and indivisible stream of intercourse among the states composed of collections of premiums, payments of policy obligations, and the countless documents and communications which are essential to the negotiation and execution of policy contracts. Individual policyholders living in many different states who own policies in a single company have their separate interests blended in one assembled fund of assets upon which all are equally dependent for payment of their policies. The decisions which that company makes at its home office-the risks it insures, the premiums it charges, the investments it makes, the losses it pays-concern not just the people of the state where the home office happens \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 542]\n\u00a0\n to be located. They concern people living far beyond the boundaries of that state.\n That the fire insurance transactions alleged to have been restrained and monopolized by appellees fit the above-described pattern of the national insurance trade is shown by the indictment before us. Of the nearly 200 combining companies, chartered in various states and foreign countries, only 18 maintained their home offices in one of the six states in which the S.E.U.A. operated; and 127 had headquarters in either New York, Pennsylvania, or Connecticut. During the period 1931-1941 a total of $ 488,000,000 in premiums was collected by local agents in the six states, most of which was transmitted to home offices in other states; while during the same period $215,000,000 in losses was paid by checks or drafts sent from the home offices to the companies' local agents for delivery to the policy holders. \n16\n Local agents solicited prospects, utilized policy forms sent from home offices, and made regular reports to their companies by mail, telephone or telegraph. Special travelling agents supervised local operations. The insurance sold by members of S.E.U.A. covered not only all kinds of fixed local properties, but also such properties as steamboats, tugs, ferries, shipyards, warehouses, terminals, trucks, busses, railroad equipment and rolling stock, and movable goods of all types carried in interstate and foreign commerce by every media of transportation.\n Despite all of this, despite the fact that most persons, speaking from common knowledge, would instantly say that of course such a business is engaged in trade and \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 543]\n\u00a0\n commerce, the District Court felt compelled by decisions of this Court to conclude that the insurance business can never be trade or commerce within the meaning of the Commerce Clause. We must therefore consider these decisions.\n In 1869 this Court held, in sustaining a statute of Virginia which regulated foreign insurance companies, that the statute did not offend the Commerce Clause because 'issuing a policy of insurance is not a transaction of commerce.' Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168, 183. 17 Since then, in similar cases, this statement has been repeated, and has been broadened. In Hooper v. California, \n155 \nU.S. 648, 654\n, 655 S., 15 S.Ct. 207, 210, decided in 1895, the Paul statement was reaffirmed, and the Court added that, 'The business of insurance is not commerce.' In 1913 the New York Life Insurance Company, protesting against a Montana tax, challenged these broad statements, strongly urging that its business, at least, was so conducted as to be engaged in interstate commerce. But the Court again approved the Paul statement and held against the company, saying that 'contracts of insurance are not commerce at all, \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 544]\n\u00a0\n neither state nor interstate.' New York Life Insurance Company v. Deer Lodge County, \n231 \nU.S. 495, 503\n, 504 S., 510, 34 S.Ct. 167, 169, 170, 172.18\n In all cases in which the Court has relied upon the proposition that 'the business of insurance is not commerce', its attention was focused on the validity of state statutes-the extent to which the Commerce Clause automatically deprived states of the power to regulate the insurance business. Since Congress had at no time attempted to control the insurance business, invalidation of the state statutes would practically have been equivalent to granting insurance companies engaged in interstate activities a blanket license to operate without legal restraint. As early as 1866 the insurance trade, though still in its infancy,19 was subject to widespread abuses. \n20\n To meet the imperative need for correction of these abuses \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 545]\n\u00a0\n the various state legislatures, including that of Virginia, passed regulatory legislation. \n21\n Paul v. Virginia upheld one of Virginia's statutes. To uphold insurance laws of other states, including tax laws, Paul v. Virginia's generalization and reasoning have been consistently adhered to.\n Today, however, we are asked to apply this reasoning, not to uphold another state law, but to strike down an Act of Congress which was intended to regulate certain aspects of the methods by which interstate insurance companies do business; and, in so doing, to narrow the scope of the federal power to regulate the activities of a great business carried on back and forth across state lines. But past decisions of this Court emphasize that legal formulae devised to uphold state power cannot uncritically be accepted as trustworthy guides to determine Congressional power under the Commerce Clause. \n22\n Furthermore, the reasons given in support of the generalization that 'the business of insurance is not commerce' and can never be conducted so as to constitute 'Commerce among the States' are inconsistent with many decisions of this Court which have upheld federal statutes regulating interstate commerce under the Commerce Clause. \n23\n\u00a0\n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 546]\n\u00a0\n One reason advanced for the rule in the Paul case has been that insurance policies 'are not commodities to be shipped or forwarded from one State to another.' \n24\n But both before and since Paul v. Virginia this Court has held that Congress can regulate traffic though it consist of intangibles. \n25\n Another reason much stressed has been that insurance policies are mere personal contracts subject to the laws of the state where executed. But this reason rests upon a distinction between what has been called 'local' and what 'interstate', a type of mechanical criterion which this Court has not deemed controlling in the measurement of federal power. Cf. Wickard v. Filburn, \n317 \nU.S. 111, 119\n, 120 S., 63 S.Ct. 82, 86, 87; Parker v. Brown, \n317 \nU.S. 341, 360\n, 63 S.Ct. 307, 318. We may grant that a contract of insurance, considered as a thing apart from negotiation and execution, \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 547]\n\u00a0\n does not itself constitute interstate commerce. Cf. Hall v. Geiger-Jones Co., \n242 \nU.S. 539, 557\n, 558 S., 37 S.Ct. 217, 223, 224, L.R.A. 1917F, 514, Ann.Cas.1917C, 643. But it does not follow from this that the Court is powerless to examine the entire transaction, of which that contract is but a part, in order to determine whether there may be a chain of events which becomes interstate commerce. \n26\n Only by treating the Congressional power over commerce among the states as a 'technical legal conception' rather than as a 'practical one, drawn from the course of business' could such a conclusion be reached. Swift & Co. v. United States, \n196 \nU.S. 375, 398\n, 25 S.Ct. 276, 280. In short, a nationwide business is not deprived of its interstate character merely because it is built upon sales contracts which are local in nature. Were the rule otherwise, few businesses could be said to be engaged in interstate commerce. \n27\n\u00a0\n\n Another reason advanced to support the result of the cases which follow Paul v. Virginia has been that, if any as- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 548]\n\u00a0\n pects of the business of insurance be treated as interstate commerce, 'then all control over it is taken from the states and the legislative regulations which this court has heretofore sustained must be declared invalid.' \n28\n Accepted without qualification, that broad statement is inconsistent with many decisions of this Court. It is settled that, for Constitutional purposes, certain activities of a business may be intrastate and therefore subject to state control, while other activities of the same business may be interstate and therefore subject to federal regulation. \n29\n And there is a wide range of business and other activities which, though subject to federal regulation, are so intimately related to local welfare that, in the absence of Congressional action, they may be regulated or taxed by the states. \n30\n In marking out these activities the primary test applied by the Court is not the mechanical one of whether the particular activity affected by the state regulation is part of interstate commerce, but rather whether, in each case, the competing demands of the state and national interests involved can be accommodated. \n31\n And the fact that partic- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 549]\n\u00a0\n ular phases of an interstate business or activity have long been regulated or taxed by states has been recognized as a strong reason why, in the continued absence of conflicting Congressional action, the state regulatory and tax laws should be declared valid. \n32\n\u00a0\n\n The real answer to the question before us is to be found in the Commerce Clause itself and in some of the great cases which interpret it. Many decisions make vivid the broad and true meaning of that clause. It is interstate commerce subject to regulation by Congress to carry lottery tickets from state to state. Lottery Case (Champion v. Ames), \n188 \nU.S. 321, 355\n, 23 S.Ct. 321, 326. So also is it interstate commerce to transport a woman from Louisiana to Texas in a common carrier, Hoke v. United States, \n227 \nU.S. 308\n, 320-323, 33 S.Ct. 281, 283, 284, 43 L.R.A.,N.S., 906, Am.Cas.1913E, 905; to carry across a state line in a private automobile five quarts of whiskey intended for personal consumption, United States v. Simpson, \n252 \nU.S. 465\n, 40 S.Ct. 364, 10 A.L.R. 510; to drive a stolen automobile from Iowa to South Dakota, Brooks v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 432\n, 436-439, 45 S.Ct. 345, 346, 347, 37 A.L.R. 1407. Diseased cattle ranging between Georgia and Florida are in commerce, Thornton v. United States, \n271 \nU.S. 414, 425\n, 46 S.Ct. 585, 588; and the transmission of an electrical impulse over a telegraph line between Alabama and Florida is intercourse and subject to paramount federal regulation, Pensacola Telegraph Co. v. Western Union Telegraph Co., \n96 \nU.S. 1\n, 11. Not only, then, may transactions be commerce though non-commercial; they may be commerce though illegal and \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 550]\n\u00a0\n sporadic, and though they do not utilize common carriers or concern the flow of anything more tangible than electrons and information. These activities having already been held to constitute interstate commerce, and persons engaged in them therefore having been held subject to federal regulation, it would indeed be difficult now to hold that no activities of any insurance company can ever constitute interstate commerce so as to make it subject to such regulation;-activities which, as part of the conduct of a legitimate and useful commercial enterprise, may embrace integrated operations in many states and involve the transmission of great quantities of money, documents, and communications across dozens of state lines.\n The precise boundary between national and state power over commerce has never yet been, and doubtless never can be, delineated by a single abstract definition. \n33\n The most widely accepted general description of that part of commerce which is subject to the federal power is that given in 1824 by Chief Justice Marshall in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 189, 190: 'Commerce, undoubtedly, is traffic, but it is something more-it is intercourse. It describes the commercial intercourse between nations, and \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 551]\n\u00a0\n parts of nations in all its branches ....' Commerce is interstate, he said, when it 'concerns more states than one.' Id., 9 Wheat. 194. No decision of this Court has ever questioned this as too comprehensive a description of the subject matter of the Commerce Clause. 34 To accept a description less comprehensive, the Court has recognized, would deprive the Congress of that full power necessary to enable it to discharge its Constitutional duty to govern commerce among the states. \n35\n\u00a0\n\n The power confided to Congress by the Commerce Clause is declared in The Federalist to be for the purpose of securing the 'maintenance of harmony and proper intercourse among the States.' \n36\n But its purpose is not confined to empowering Congress with the negative authority \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 552]\n\u00a0\n to legislate against state regulations of commerce deemed inimical to the national interest. The power granted Congress is a positive power. It is the power to legislate concerning transactions which, reaching across state boundaries, affect the people of more states than one;-to govern affairs which the individual states, with their limited territorial jurisdictions, are not fully capable of governing. \n37\n This federal power to determine the rules of intercourse across state lines was essential to weld a loose confederacy into a single, indivisible nation; its continued existence is equally essential to the welfare of that nation. \n38\n\u00a0\n\n Our basic responsibility in interpreting the Commerce Clause is to make certain that the power to govern intercourse among the states remains where the Constitution placed it. That power, as held by this Court from the beginning, is vested in the Congress, available to be exer- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 553]\n\u00a0\n cised for the national welfare as Congress shall deem necessary. No commercial enterprise of any kind which conducts its activities across state lines has been held to be wholly beyond the regulatory power of Congress under the Commerce Clause. We cannot make an exception of the business of insurance.\n\n\n II.\n\n\n We come then to the contention, earnestly pressed upon us by appellees, that Congress did not intend in the Sherman Act to exercise its power over the interstate insurance trade.\n Certainly the Act's language affords no basis for this contention. Declared illegal in  1 is 'every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States ...'; and 'every person' who shall make such a contract or engage in such a combination or conspiracy is deemed guilty of a misdemeanor. Section 2 is not less sweeping. 'Every person' who monopolizes, or attempts to monopolize, or conspires with 'any other person' to monopolize, 'any part of the trade or commerce among the several States' is, likewise, deemed guilty of a misdemeanor. Language more comprehensive is difficult to conceive. On its face it shows a carefully studied attempt to bring within the Act every person engaged in business whose activities might restrain or monopolize commercial intercourse among the states.\n A general application of the Act to all combinations of business and capital organized to suppress commercial competition is in harmony with the spirit and impulses of the times which gave it birth. 'Trusts' and 'monopolies' were the terror of the period. \n39\n Their power to fix \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 554]\n\u00a0\n prices, to restrict production, to crush small independent traders, and to concentrate large power in the few to the detriment of the many, were but some of numerous evils ascribed to them. 40 The organized opponents of trusts aimed at the complete destruction of all business combinations which possessed potential power, or had the intent, to destroy competition in whatever the people needed or \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 555]\n\u00a0\n wanted. \n41\n So great was the strength of the anti-trust forces that the issue of trusts and monopolies became non-partisan. The question was not whether they should be abolished, but how this purpose could best be accomplished. \n42\n\u00a0\n\n Combinations of insurance companies were not exempt from public hostility against the trusts. Between 1885 and 1912, twenty-three states enacted laws forbidding insurance combinations. \n43\n When, in 1911, one of these state \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 556]\n\u00a0\n statutes was unsuccessfully challenged in this Court, the Court had this to say: 'We can well understand that fire insurance companies, acting together, may have owners of property practically at their mercy in the matter of rates, and may have it in their power to deprive the public generally of the advantages flowing from competition between rival organizations engaged in the business of fire insurance. In order to meet the evils of such combinations or associations, the state is competent to adopt appropriate regulations that will tend to substitute competition in the place of combination or monopoly.' German Alliance Ins. Co. v. Hale, \n219 \nU.S. 307, 316\n, 31 S.Ct. 246, 248.44\n Appellees argue that the Congress knew, as doubtless some of its members did, that this Court had prior to 1890 said that insurance was not commerce and was subject to state regulation, and that therefore we should read the Act as though it expressly exempted that business. But neither by reports nor by statements of the bill's sponsors or others was any purpose to exempt insurance companies revealed. And we fail to find in the legislative history of the Act an expression of a clear and unequivocal desire of Congress to legislate only within that area previously \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 557]\n\u00a0\n declared by this Court to be within the federal power. \n45\n Cf. Helvering v. Griffths, \n318 \nU.S. 371\n, 63 S.Ct. 636; Parker v. Motor Boat Sales, \n314 \nU.S. 244\n, 62 S.Ct. 221. We have been shown not one piece of reliable evidence that the Congress of 1890 intended to freeze the proscription of the Sherman Act within the mold of then current judicial decisions defining the commerce power. On the contrary, all the acceptable \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 558]\n\u00a0\n evidence points the other way. That Congress wanted to go to the utmost extent of its Constitutional power in restraining trust and monopoly agreements such as the indictment here charges admits of little, if any, doubt. 46 \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 559]\n\u00a0\n The purpose was to use that power to make of ours, so far as Congress could under our dual system, a competitive business economy. \n47\n Nor is it sufficient to justify our reading into the Act an exemption for insurance that the Congress of 1890 may have known that states already were regulating the insurance business. The Congress of 1890 also knew that railroads were subject to regulation not only by states but by the federal government itself, but this fact has been held insufficient to bring to the railroad companies the interpretative exemption from the Sherman Act they have sought. United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Association, \n166 \nU.S. 290, 314\n, 315 S., 320-325, 17 S.Ct. 540, 548, 549, 551-553.\n Appellees further argue that, quite apart from what the Sherman Act meant in 1890, the succeeding Congresses have accepted and approved the decisions of this Court that the business of insurance is not commerce. They call attention to the fact that at various times since 1890 Congress has refused to enact legislation providing for federal regulation of the insurance business, and that several resolutions proposing to amend the Constitution specifically to authorize federal regulation of insurance have failed of passage. In addition, they emphasize that, although the Sherman Act has been amended several times, no amendments have been adopted which specifically bring insurance within the Act's proscription. The Government, for its part, points to evidence that various members of Congress during the period 1900-1914 considered there were 'trusts' in the insurance business, and expressed the view that the insurance business should be subject to the anti- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 560]\n\u00a0\n trust laws. \n48\n It also points out that in the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 Congress specifically exempted certain conduct of marine insurance companies from the 'anti-trust' laws. \n49\n\u00a0\n\n The most that can be said of all this evidence considered together is that it is inconclusive as to any point here relevant. By no means does it show that the Congress of 1890 specifically intended to exempt insurance companies from the all-inclusive scope of the Sherman Act. Nor can we attach significance to the omission of Congress to include in its amendments to the Act an express statement that the Act covered insurance. From the beginning Congress has used language broad enough to include all businesses, and never has amended the Act to define these businesses with particularity. And the fact that several Congresses since 1890 have failed to enact proposed legislation providing for more or less comprehensive federal regula- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 561]\n\u00a0\n tion of insurance does not even remotely suggest that any Congress has held the view that insurance alone, of all businesses, should be permitted to enter into combinations for the purpose of destroying competition by coercive and intimidatory practices.\n Finally it is argued at great length that virtually all the states regulate the insurance business on the theory that competition in the field of insurance is detrimental both to the insurers and the insured, and that if the Sherman Act be held applicable to insurance much of this state regulation will be destroyed. The first part of this argument is buttressed by opinions expressed by various persons that unrestricted competition in insurance results in financial chaos and public injury. Whether competition is a good thing for the insurance business is not for us to consider. Having power to enact the Sherman Act, Congress did so; if exceptions are to be written into the Act, they must come from the Congress, not this Court. And as was said in answer to a similar argument that the Sherman Act should not be applied to a railroad combination:\n'It is the history of monopolies in this country and in England that predictions of ruin are habitually made by them when it is attempted, by legislation, to restrain their operations and to protect the public against their exactions. ...\n\n'But even if the court shared the gloomy forebodings in which the defendants indulge, it could not refuse to respect the action of the legislative branch of the government if what it has done is within the limits of its constitutional power. The suggestions of disaster to business have, we apprehend, their origin in the zeal of parties who are opposed to the policy underlying the act of Congress or are interested in the result of this particular case; at any rate, the suggestions imply that the court may and ought to refuse the enforcement of the provisions of the \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 562]\n\u00a0\n act if, in its judgment, Congress was not wise in prescribing as a rule by which the conduct of interstate and international commerce is to be governed, that every combination, whatever its form, in restraint of such commerce and the monopolizing or attempting to monopolize such commerce, shall be illegal. These, plainly, are questions as to the policy of legislation which belong to another department, and this court has no function to supervise such legislation from the standpoint of wisdom or policy. ...' Harlan, J., affirming decree, Northern Securities Co. v. United States, \n193 \nU.S. 197, 351\n, 352 S., 24 S.Ct. 436, 462.\n\n The argument that the Sherman Act necessarily invalidates many state laws regulating insurance we regard as exaggerated. Few states go so far as to permit private insurance companies, without state supervision, to agree upon and fix uniform insurance rates. Cf. Parker v. Brown, \n317 \nU.S. 341\n, 350-352, 63 S.Ct. 307, 313, 314. No states authorize combinations of insurance companies to coerce, intimidate, and boycott competitors and consumers in the manner here alleged, and it cannot be that any companies have acquired a vested right to engage in such destructive business practices. \n50\n\u00a0\n\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS and Mr. Justice REED took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE, dissenting.\n This Court has never doubted, and I do not doubt, that transactions across state lines which often attend and are incidental to the formation and performance of an insurance contract, such as the use of facilities for interstate \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 563]\n\u00a0\n communication and transportation, are acts of interstate commerce subject to regulation by the federal government under the commerce clause. Nor do I doubt that the business of insurance as presently conducted has in many aspects such interstate manifestations and such effects on interstate commerce as may subject it to the appropriate exercise of federal power. See Polish National Alliance v. National Labor Relations Board, \n322 \nU.S. 643\n, 64 S.Ct. 1196.\n But such are not the questions now before us. We are not concerned here with the power of Congress to do what it has not attempted to do, but with the question whether Congress in enacting the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.A .  1-7, 15 note, has asserted its power over the business of insurance.\n The questions which the Government has raised, advisedly it would seem (cf. New York Life Insurance Co. v. Deer Lodge County, \n231 \nU.S. 495, 499\n, 34 S.Ct. 167, 168), by the indictment in this case, as it has been interpreted by the District Court below, are quite different from the question, discussed in the Court's opinion, whether the incidental use of the facilities of interstate commerce and transportation in the conduct of the fire insurance business renders the business itself 'commerce' within the meaning of the Sherman Act and the commerce clause. The questions here are whether the business of entering into contracts in one state, insuring against the risk of loss by fire of property in others, is itself interstate commerce; and whether an agreement or conspiracy to fix the premium rates of such contracts and in other ways to restrict competition in effecting policies of fire insurance, violates the Sherman Act. The court below has answered 'no' to both of these questions. I think that its answer is right and its judgment should be affirmed, both on principle and in view of the permanency which should be given to the construction of the commerce clause and the Sherman Act in this respect, which has until now been consistently adhered to by all branches of the Government. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 564]\n\u00a0\n The case comes here on direct appeal by the Government from the District Court's judgment dismissing the indictment. Under the provisions of the Criminal Appeals Act, 18 U.S.C.  682, 18 U.S.C.A.  682, the only questions open for decision here are whether the District Court's constructions of the commerce clause and of the Sherman Act, on which it rested its decision, are the correct ones. United States v. Borden Co., \n308 \nU.S. 188, 193\n, 60 S.Ct. 182, 186; United States v. Wayne Pump Co., \n317 \nU.S. 200, 208\n, 63 S.Ct. 191, 196; United States v. Swift & Co., \n318 \nU.S. 442, 444\n, 63 S.Ct. 684, 685.\n For the particular facts to which the court below applied the Constitution and the Sherman Act we must look to the indictment as the District Court has construed it. And we must accept that construction, for by the provisions of the Criminal Appeals Act the District Court's construction of the indictment is reviewable on appeal not by this Court but by the Circuit Court of Appeals. United States v. Patten, \n226 \nU.S. 525, 535\n, 33 S.Ct. 141, 142, 44 L.R.A.,N.S., 325; United States v. Colgate & Co., \n250 \nU.S. 300, 306\n, 39 S.Ct. 465, 467, 7 A.L.R. 443; United States v. Borden Co., supra.\n The District Court pointed out that the offenses charged by the indictment are a conspiracy to fix arbitrary and non-competitive premium rates on fire insurance sold in several named states, and by means of that conspiracy to restrain and to monopolize trade and commerce in fire insurance in those states. The court went on to say (51 F.Supp. 713):\n'To constitute a violation of the Sherman Act, the restraint and monopoly denounced must be that of interstate trade or commerce, and, unless the restraint and monopoly charged in the indictment be restraint or monopoly in interstate trade or commerce the indictment must fall.\n\n'It is not a question here of whether the defendants participated in some incidental way in interstate commerce or used in some instances the facilities of interstate commerce, but is rather whether the activities complained \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 565]\n\u00a0\n of as constituting the business of insurance would themselves constitute interstate trade or commerce, and whether defendants' method of conducting same amounted to restraint or monopoly of same. It is not a question as to whether or not Congress had power to regulate the insurance companies or some phase of their activities, but rather whether Congress did so by the Sherman Act.\n\n'Persons may be engaged in interstate commerce, yet, if the restraint or monopoly complained of is not itself a restraint or monopoly of interstate trade or commerce, they may not be convicted of violation of the Sherman Act. The fact that they may use the mails and instrumentalities of interstate commerce and communication, and be subject to Federal regulations relating thereto, would not make applicable the Sherman Act to intrastate commerce or to activities which were not commerce at all.\n\n'The whole case, therefore, depends upon the question as to whether or not the business of insurance is interstate trade or commerce, and if so, whether the transactions alleged in the indictment constitute interstate commerce.'\n\n In short the District Court construed the indictment as charging restraints not in the incidental use of the mails or other instrumentalities of interstate commerce, nor in the insurance of goods moving in interstate commerce, but in the 'business of insurance.' And by the 'business of insurance' it necessarily meant the business of writing contracts of insurance, for the indictment charges only restraints in entering into such contracts, not in their performance,1 and the Court deemed it irrelevant that in \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 566]\n\u00a0\n the negotiation and performance of the contracts appellees 'may use the mails and instrumentalities of interstate commerce.' It held that that business is not in itself interstate commerce, and that the alleged conspiracies to restrain and to monopolize that business were not, without more, in restraint of interstate commerce and consequently were not violations of the Sherman Act.\n This construction of the indictment as confined in its scope to a conspiracy to fix premium rates and otherwise restrain competition in the business of writing insurance contracts, and to monopolize that business-a construction requiring decision of the question whether that business is interstate commerce-is adopted by the Government. Its brief in this Court states the 'questions presented' as follows:\n'1. Whether the fire insurance business is in commerce.\n\n'2. Whether the fire insurance business is subject to the constitutional power of Congress to regulate commerce among the several states.\n\n'3. Whether, if so, the Sherman Act is violated by an agreement among fire insurance companies to fix and maintain arbitrary and non-competitive rates and to monopolize trade and commerce in fire insurance, in part through boycotts directed at companies not part of the conspiracy and the agents and purchasers of insurance who deal with them.' \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 567]\n\u00a0\n The numerous and unvarying decisions of this Court that 'insurance is not commerce'2 have never denied that acts of interstate commerce may be incidental to the business of writing and performing contracts of insurance, or that those incidental acts are subject to the commerce power. Our decisions on this subject have uniformly rested on the ground that the formation of an insurance contract, even though it insures against risk of loss to property located in other states or moving in interstate commerce, is not interstate commerce, and that although the incidents of interstate communication and transportation which often attend the formation and performance of an insurance contract are interstate commerce, they do not serve to render the business of insurance itself interstate commerce. See Hooper v. California, \n155 \nU.S. 648, 655\n, 15 S.Ct. 207, 210; New York Life Ins. Co. v. Deer Lodge County, \n231 \nU.S. 495, 508\n, 509 S., 34 S. Ct. 167, 171, 172.\n\n If an insurance company in New York executes and delivers, either in that state or another, a policy insuring the owner of a building in New Jersey against loss by fire, no act of interstate commerce has occurred. True, if the owner comes to New York to procure the insurance or after delivery in New York carries the policy to New Jersey, or the company sends it there by mail or messenger, such would be acts of interstate commerce. Similarly if the owner pays the premiums by mail to the company in New \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 568]\n\u00a0\n York, or the company's New Jersey agent sends the premiums to New York, or the company in New York sends money to New Jersey on the occurrence of the loss insured against, acts of interstate commerce would occur. But the power of the Congress to regulate them is derived, not from its authority to regulate the business of insurance, but from its power to regulate interstate communication and transportation. And such incidental use of the facilities of interstate commerce does not render the insurance business itself interstate commerce. Nor is the nature of a single insurance transaction or a few such transactions not involving interstate commerce altered in that regard merely because their number is multiplied. The power of Congress to regulate interstate communication and transportation incidental to the insurance business is not any more or any less because the number of insurance transactions is great or small. The Congressional power to regulate does not extend to the formation and performance of insurance contracts save only as the latter may affect communication and transportation which are interstate commerce or may otherwise be found by Congress to affect transactions of interstate commerce. And even then, such effects on the commerce as do not involve restraints in competition in the marketing of goods and services are not within the reach of the Sherman Act. That such are the controlling principles has been fully recognized by this Court in the numerous cases which have held that the business of insurance is not commerce or as such subject to the commerce power. See, for example, New York Life Ins. Co. v. Deer Lodge County, supra, \n231 \nU.S. 508, 509\n, 34 S.Ct. 171, 172.\n These principles are not peculiar to insurance contracts. They are equally applicable to other types of contracts which relate to things or events in other states than that of their execution, but which do not contain any obligation to engage in any form of interstate commerce. The \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 569]\n\u00a0\n parties to them are not engaged in interstate commerce, for such commerce is not necessarily involved in or prerequisite to the formation of such contracts and they do not in their performance necessarily involve the doing of interstate business. The mere formation of a contract to sell and deliver cotton or coal or crude rubber is not in itself an interstate transaction and does not involve any act of interstate commerce because cotton, coal and crude rubber are subjects of interstate or foreign commerce, or because in fact performance of the contract may not be effected without some precedent or subsequent movement interstate of the commodities sold, or because there may be incidental use of the facilities of interstate commerce or transportation in the formation of the contract. Ware & Leland v. Mobile County, \n209 \nU.S. 405\n, 411-413, 28 S.Ct. 526, 528, 529, 14 Ann.Cas. 1031; Western Live Stock Co. v. Bureau of Internal Revenue, \n303 \nU.S. 250, 253\n, 58 S.Ct. 546, 547, 115 A.L.R. 944. Compare Dahnke-Walker Milling Co. v. Bondurant, \n257 \nU.S. 282, 292\n, 42 S.Ct. 106, 109. That the principle underlying that conclusion is the same as that underlying the decisions of this Court that the business of insurance is not interstate commerce, has been repeatedly recognized and affirmed.

Mobile County, supra, \n209 \nU.S. 411\n, 28 S.Ct. 528, 14 Ann.Cas. 1031; Engel v. O'Malley, \n219 \nU.S. 128, 139\n, 31 S.Ct. 190, 193; New York Life Ins. Co. v.

Wallace, \n259 \nU.S. 44, 69\n, 42 S.Ct. 453, 458; Board of Trade v. Olsen, \n262 \nU.S. 1, 32\n, 33 S., 43 S.Ct. 470, 475, 476; Moore v. New York Cotton Exchange, \n270 \nU.S. 593, 604\n, 46 S.Ct. 367, 369, 45 A.L.R. 1370; Western Livestock Co. v. Bureau of Internal Revenue, supra; and see Hopkins v. United States, \n171 \nU.S. 578, 588\n, 589 S., 602, 19 S.Ct. 40, 43, 44, 49.\n The conclusion that the business of writing insurance is not interstate commerce could not rightly be otherwise unless we were to depart from the universally accepted view that the act of making any contract which does not stipulate for the performance of an act or transaction of \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 570]\n\u00a0\n interstate commerce is not in itself interstate commerce. And this has been held to be true even though the contract be effected by exchange of communications across state lines, see New York Life Ins. Co. v. Cravens, \n178 \nU.S. 389, 400\n, 20 S.Ct. 962, 967; Ware & Leland v. Mobile County, supra; New York Life Ins. Co. v. Deer Lodge County, supra, \n231 \nU.S. 509\n, 34 S.Ct. 172, a point which need not be considered here for the indictment makes no charge that the policies written by appellees are thus effected, but alleges only that they are 'sold' by the defendants in certain named states.\n Undoubtedly contracts so entered into for the sale of commodities which move in interstate commerce may become the implements for restraints in marketing those commodities, and when so used may for that reason be within the Sherman Act, see Northern Securities Co. v. United States, \n193 \nU.S. 197, 334\n, 338 S., 24 S.Ct. 436, 455, 457; United States v. Patten, supra, \n226 \nU.S. 543, 544\n, 33 S.Ct. 145, 146, 44 L.R. A.,N.S., 325; Standard Oil Co. v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 163, 168\n, 169 S., 51 S.Ct. 421, 423. Compare Thames & Mersey Marine Ins. Co. v. United States, \n237 \nU.S. 19\n, 35 S.Ct. 496, Ann.Cas.1915D, 1087. But it is quite another matter to say that the contracts are themselves interstate commerce or that restraints in competition as to their terms or conditions are within the Sherman Act, in the absence of a showing that the purpose or effect is to restrain competition in the marketing of the goods or services to which the contracts relate. Compare Hill v. Wallace, supra, \n259 \nU.S. 69\n, 42 S.Ct. 458, with Board of Trade of City of Chicago v. Olsen, supra, \n262 \nU.S. 31\n-33, 43 S.Ct. 475, 476; Blumenstock Bros. Advertising Agency v. Curtis Pub. Co., supra, with Indiana Farmers' Guide Pub. Co. v. Prairie Co., \n293 \nU.S. 268\n, 55 S.Ct. 182; Moore v. New York Cotton Exchange, supra, with United States v. Patten, supra.\n In this respect insurance contracts do not in point of law stand on any different footing as regards the Sherman Act. If contracts of insurance are in fact made the instruments of restraint in the marketing of goods and services in or affecting interstate commerce, they are not beyond the reach of the Sherman Act more than contracts \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 571]\n\u00a0\n for the sale of commodities,-contracts which, not in themselves interstate commerce, may nevertheless be used as the means of its restraint. But since trade in articles of commerce is not the subject matter of contracts of insurance, it is evident that not only is the writing of insurance policies not interstate commerce but there is little scope for their use in restraining competition in the marketing of goods and services in or affecting the commerce.\n The contract of insurance makes no stipulation for the sale or delivery of commodities in interstate commerce or for any other interstate transaction. It provides only for the payment of a sum of money in the event of the loss insured against and it is no necessary consequence of the alleged restraints on competition in fixing premiums, that interstate commerce will be restrained. We have no occasion to consider the argument which the court below rejected, that the indictment charges that the conspiracy to fix premiums adversely affects interstate commerce because in some instances the commodities insured move across state lines, or because interstate communication and transportation are in some instances incidental to the business of issuing insurance contracts. This is so both because, as we have said, we are bound by the District Court's construction of the indictment, and, more importantly, because such effects on interstate commerce, as will presently appear, are not within the reach of the Sherman Act.\n The conclusion seems inescapable that the formation of insurance contracts, like many others, and the business of so doing, is not, without more, commerce within the protection of the commerce clause of the Constitution and thereby, in large measure, excluded from state control and regulation. See Hooper v. California, supra, \n155 \nU.S. 655\n, 15 S.Ct. 210, 39L.Ed. 297; New York Life Insurance Co. v. Deer Lodge County, supra. This conclusion seems, upon analysis, not only correct on \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 572]\n\u00a0\n principle and in complete harmony with the uniform rulings by which this Court has held that the formation of all types of contract which do not stipulate for the performance of acts of interstate commerce, are likewise not interstate commerce, but it has the support of an unbroken line of decisions of this Court beginning with Paul v. Virginia, seventy-five years ago, and extending down to the present time. In 1913 this Court was asked, on elaborate briefs and arguments, such as are now addressed to us, to overrule Paul v. Virginia, supra, and the many cases which have followed it. New York Life Insurance Co. v. Deer Lodge County, supra. See also New York Life Insurance Co. v. Cravens, supra. In the Deer Lodge case the mode of conducting the insurance business was almost identical with that alleged here (231 U.S. at 499, 500, 34 S.Ct. 168, 169); it was strenuously urged, as here, that by reason of the great size of insurance companies 'modern life insurance had taken on essentially a national and international character' (231 U.S. at page 507, 34 S.Ct. at page 171); and, as here, that the use of the mails incident to the formation of the contract and the interstate transmission of premiums and the proceeds of the policies 'constitute a 'current of commerce among the states\" (231 U.S. at page 509, 34 S.Ct. at page 172). All these arguments were rejected, and the business of insurance was held not to be interstate commerce, on the grounds which we have stated and think valid-but which the Government's brief and the opinion of the Court in this case have failed to notice.\n If the business of entering into insurance contracts is not interstate commerce, it seems plain that agreements to fix premium rates, or other restraints on competition in entering into such contracts, are not violations of the Sherman Act. As we have often had occasion to point out, the restraints prohibited by the Sherman Act are of competition in the marketing of goods or services whenever the competition occurs in or affects interstate commerce in those goods or services. See Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, \n310 \nU.S. 469\n, 495-501, 60 S.Ct. 982, 993-996, 128 A.L.R. 1044, and cases cited. The contract of \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 573]\n\u00a0\n insurance does not undertake to supply or market goods or services and there is no suggestion that policies of insurance when issued are articles of commerce or that after their issue they are sold in the market as such, or, if they were, that the formation of the contract would itself be interstate commerce. See Hooper v. California, supra; New York Life Ins. Co. v. Deer Lodge County, supra, \n231 \nU.S. 510\n, 34 S.Ct. 172; cf. Ware & Leland v. Mobile County, supra; Moore v. New York Cotton Exchange, supra.\n No more does the performance of an insurance contract involving the payment of premiums by the insured and the payment of losses by the insurer involve the marketing of goods or services. The indictment here, as the District Court pointed out, charges restraints on competition in fixing the terms and conditions of insurance contracts. And even if we assume, although the District Court did not mention it, that the indictment also charges restraints on the performance of such contracts, it is plain that such restrains on the performance as well as the formation of the contracts cannot operate as restraints on competition in the marketing of goods or services. Such restraints are not within the purview of the Sherman Act. Compare Federal Base Ball Club v. National League, \n259 \nU.S. 200, 209\n, 42 S.Ct. 465, 466, 26 A.L.R. 357; United Mine Workers v. Coronado Coal Co., \n259 \nU.S. 344, 410\n, 411 S., 42 S.Ct. 570, 583, 27 A.L.R. 762; Blumenstock Bros. Advertising Agency v. Curtis Pub. Co., supra; Moore v. New York Cotton Exchange, supra. The practice of law is not commerce, nor, at least outside the District of Columbia, is it subject to the Sherman Act, and it does not become so because a law firm attracts clients from without the state or sends its members or juniors to other states to argue cases, or because its clients use the interstate mails to pay their fees. Federal Base Ball Club v. National League, supra.\n It would be strange, indeed, if Congress, in adopting the Sherman Act in 1890, more than twenty years after this Court had supposedly settled the question, had considered that the business of insurance was interstate com- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 574]\n\u00a0\n merce or had contemplated that the Sherman Act was to apply to it. Nothing in its legislative history suggests that it was intended to apply to the business of insurance. \n3\n The legislative materials indicate that Congress was primarily concerned with restraints of competition in the marketing of goods sold in interstate commerce, which were clearly within the federal commerce power. \n4\n And while the Act is not limited to restraints of commerce in physical goods, see, e.g., Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers v. United States, \n286 \nU.S. 427\n, 52 S.Ct. 607, there is no reason to suppose that Congress intended the Act to apply to matters in which, under prevailing decisions of this Court, commerce was not involved. On the contrary the House committee, in reporting the bill which was adopted without change, declared: 'No attempt is made to invade the legislative authority of the several States or even to occupy doubtful grounds. No system of laws can be devised by Congress alone which would effectually protect the people of the \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 575]\n\u00a0\n United States against the evils and oppression of trusts and monopolies. Congress has no authority to deal, generally, with the subject within the States, and the States have no authority to legislate in respect of commerce between the several States or with foreign nations.' \n5\n\u00a0\n\n In 1904 and again in 1905 President Roosevelt urged 'that the Congress carefully consider whether the power of the Bureau of Corporations cannot constitutionally be extended to cover interstate transactions in insurance'. 6 \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 576]\n\u00a0\n The American Bar Association, executives of leading insurance companies, and others, joined in the request. \n7\n Numerous bills providing for federal regulation of various aspects of the insurance business were introduced between 1902 and 19068 but the judiciary committees of both House and Senate concluded that the regulation of the business of marine, fire and life insurance was beyond Congressional power. Sen. Rep. No. 4406, 59th Cong., 1st Sess.; H.R. Rep. No. 2491, 59th Cong., 1st Sess., 12-25. The House committee stated that 'the question as to whether or not insurance is commerce has passed beyond the realm of argument, because the Supreme Court of the United States has said many times for a great number of years that insurance is not commerce.' P. 13.9 \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 577]\n\u00a0\n And when in 1914, one year after the decision in New York Life Insurance Co. v. Deer Lodge County, supra, Congress by the clayton Act, 38 Stat. 730, amended the Sherman Act and defined the term 'commerce' as used in that Act, it gave no indication that it questioned or desired this Court to overrule the decision of the Deer Lodge case and those preceding it. On the contrary Mr. Webb, who was in charge of the bill in the House of Representatives, stated that 'insurance companies are not reached as the Supreme Court has held that their contracts or policies are not interstate commerce'. 51 Cong.Rec. 9390.10 \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 578]\n\u00a0\n This Court, throughout the seventy-five years since the decision of Paul v. Virginia, has adhered to the view that the business of insurance is not interstate commerce. \n11\n Such has ever since been the practical construction by the other branches of the Government of the application to insurance of the commerce clause and the Sherman Act. Long continued practical construction of the Constitution or a statute is of persuasive force in determining its meaning and proper application. Pocket Veto Case, \n279 \nU.S. 655, 688\n, 690 S., 49 S.Ct. 463, 469, 470, 64 A.L.R. 1434; Federal Trade Commission v. Bunte Bros., \n312 \nU.S. 349, 351\n, 352 S., 61 S.Ct. 580, 581, 582; United States v. Cooper Corp., \n312 \nU.S. 600, 613\n, 614 S., 61 S.Ct. 742, 747, 748. It is significant that in the fifty years since the enactment of the Sherman Act the Government has not until now sought to apply it to the business of insurance,12 and that Congress has continued to regard \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 579]\n\u00a0\n insurance as not constituting interstate commerce. Although often asked to do so it has repeatedly declined to pass legislation regulating the insurance business and to sponsor constitutional amendments subjecting it to Cognressional control. \n13\n\u00a0\n\n The decision now rendered repudiates this long continued and consistent construction of the commerce clause and the Sherman Act. We do not say that that is in itself a sufficient ground for declining to join in the Court's decision. This Court has never committed itself to any rule or policy that it will not 'bow to the lessons of experience and the force of better reasoning' by overruling a mistaken precedent. See cases collected in Justice Brandeis's dissenting opinion in Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., \n285 \nU.S. 393, 406\n, 409 S., 52 S.Ct. 443, 447, 448, notes 1-4, and in Smith v. Allwright, \n321 \nU.S. 649\n, 64 S.Ct. 757, note 10; and see Legal Tender Cases, 12 Wall. 457, 553, 554. This is especially the case when the meaning of the Constitution is at issue and a mistaken construction is one which cannot be corrected by legislative action.\n To give blind adherence to a rule or policy that no decision of this Court is to be overruled would be itself to overrule many decisions of the Court which do not accept that view. But the rule of stare decisis embodies a wise policy because it is often more important that a rule of law be settled than that it be settled right. This is especially so where as here, Congress is not without regulatory power. Cf. Penn Dairies v. Milk Control Comm., \n318 \nU.S. 261, 271\n, 275 S., 63 S.Ct. 617, 621, 623. The question then is not whether an earlier decision should ever be overruled, but whether a \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 580]\n\u00a0\n particular decision ought to be. And before overruling a precedent in any case it is the duty of the Court to make certain that more harm will not be done in rejecting than in retaining a rule of even dubious validity. Compare Helvering v. Griffiths, \n318 \nU.S. 371, 400\n, 404 S., 63 S.Ct. 636, 651- 653.\n From what has been said it seems plain that our decisions that the business of insurance is not commerce are not unsound in principle, and involve no inconsistency or lack of harmony with accepted doctrine. They place no field of activity beyond the control of both the national and state governments as did Hammer v. Dagenhart, \n247 \nU.S. 251\n, 38 S.Ct. 529, 3 A.L.R. 649, Ann.Cas.1918E, 724, overruled three years ago by a unanimous Court in United States v. Darby, \n312 \nU.S. 100, 117\n, 657 S., 61 S.Ct. 451, 458, 132 A.L.R. 1430. On the contrary the ruling that insurance is not commerce, and is therefore unaffected by the restrictions which the commerce clause imposes on state legislation, removed the most serious obstacle to regulation of that business by the states. Through their plenary power over domestic and foreign corporations which are not engaged in interstate commerce, the states have developed extensive and effective systems of regulation of the insurance business, often solving regulatory problems of a local character with which it would be impractical or difficult for Congress to deal through the exercise of the commerce power. And in view of the broad powers of the federal government to regulate matters which, though not themselves commerce, nevertheless affect interstate commerce, Wickard v. Filburn, \n317 \nU.S. 111\n, 63 S.Ct. 82; Polish National Alliance v. National Labor Relations Board, supra, there can be no doubt of the power of Congress if it so desires to regulate many aspects of the insurance business mentioned in this indictment.\n But the immediate and only practical effect of the decision now rendered is to withdraw from the states, in large measure, the regulation of insurance and to confer it on the national government, which has adopted no legis- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 581]\n\u00a0\n lative policy and evolved no scheme of regulation with respect to the business of insurance. Congress having taken no action, the present decision substitutes, for the varied and detailed state regulation developed over a period of years, the limited aim and indefinite command of the Sherman Act for the suppression of restraints on competition in the marketing of goods and services in or affecting interstate commerce, to be applied by the courts to the insurance business as best they may.\n In the years since this Court's pronouncement that insurance is not commerce came to be regarded as settled constitutional doctrine, vast efforts have gone into the development of schemes of state regulation and into the organization of the insurance business in conformity to such regulatory requirements. Vast amounts of capital have been invested in the business in reliance on the permanence of the existing system of state regulation. How far that system is now supplanted is not, and in the nature of things could not well be, explained in the Court's opinion. The Government admits that statutes of at least five states will be invalidated by the decision as in conflict with the Sherman Act, and the argument in this Court reveals serious doubt whether many others may not also be inconsistent with that Act. The extent to which still other state statutes will now be invalidated as in conflict with the commerce clause has not been explored in any detail in the briefs and argument or in the Court's opinion.\n Certainly there cannot but be serious doubt as to the validity of state taxes which may now be thought to discriminate against the interstate commerce, cf. Philadelphia Fire Association v. New York, \n119 \nU.S. 110\n, 7 S.Ct. 108; or the extent to which conditions may be imposed on the right of insurance companies to do business within a state; or in general the extent to which the state may regulate whatever aspects of the business are now for the first time to be \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 582]\n\u00a0\n regarded as interstate commerce. While this Court no longer adheres to the inflexible rule that a state cannot in some measure regulate interstate commerce, the application of the test presently applied requires 'a consideration of all the relevant facts and circumstances' in order to determine whether the matter is an appropriate one for local regulation and whether the regulation does not unduly burden interstate commerce, Parker v. Brown, \n317 \nU.S. 341, 362\n, 63 S.Ct. 307, 319-a determination which can only be made upon a case-to-case basis. Only time and costly experience can give the answers.\n Congress made the choice against so drastic a change when in 1906 it rejected the proposals to assume national control over the insurance business. The report of the House Committee on the Judiciary pointed out that 'all of the evils and wrongs complained of are subject to the exclusive regulation of State legislative power' and added: 'assuming that Congress declares that insurance is commerce and the Supreme Court holds the legislation constitutional, how much could Congress regulate, and what effect would such legislation have? It would disturb the very substructure of government by precipitating a violent conflict between the police power of the States and the power of Cognress to regulate interstate commerce. To uphold the Federal power would be to extinguish the police power of the State by the legislation of Congress. In other words, Congress would admit corporations into the respective States and have the entire regulating power.' H.R.Rep. No. 2491, 59th Cong., 1st Sess., 13, 15-16. See id. 18.\n Had Congress chosen to legislate for such parts of the insurance business as could be found to affect interstate commerce, whether by making the Sherman Act applicable to them or by regulation in some other form, it could have resolved many of these questions of conflict between \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 583]\n\u00a0\n federal and state regulation. But this Court can decide only the questions before it in particular cases. Its action in now overturning the precedents of seventy-five years governing a business of such volume and of such wide ramifications, cannot fail to be the occasion for loosing a flood of litigation and of legislation, state and national, in order to establish a new boundary between state and national power, raising questions which cannot be answered for years to come, during which a great business and the regulatory officers of every state must be harassed by all the doubts and difficulties inseparable from a realignment of the distribution of power in our federal system. These considerations might well stay a reversal of long established doctrine which promises so little of advantage and so much of harm. For me these considerations are controlling.\n The judgment should be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER.\n I join in the opinion of the CHIEF JUSTICE.\n The relations of the insurance business to national commerce and finance, I have no doubt, afford constitutional authority for appropriate regulation by Congress of the business of insurance, certainly not to a less extent than Congressional regulation touching agriculture. See, e.g., Smith v. Kansas City Title & Trust Co., \n255 \nU.S. 180\n, 41 S.Ct. 243; Wickard v. Filburn, \n317 \nU.S. 111\n, 63 S.Ct. 82. But the opinion of the CHIEF JUSTICE leaves me equally without doubt that by the enactment of the Sherman Act in 1890, 15 U.S.C.A.  1-7, 15 note, Congress did not mean to disregard the then accepted conception of the constitutional basis for the regulation of the insurance business. And the evidence is overwhelming that the inapplicability of the Sherman Act, in its contemporaneous setting, to insurance transactions such as those charged by this indictment has been confirmed and not modified by \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 584]\n\u00a0\n Congressional attitude and action in the intervening fifty years. There is no Congressional warrant therefore for bringing about the far-reaching dislocations which the opinions of the CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice JACKSON adumbrate.\n\n Mr. Justice JACKSON, dissenting in part.\n\n\n I.\n\n\n The historical development of public regulation of insurance underwriting in this country has created a dilemma which confronts this Court today. It demonstrates that 'The life of the law has not been logic: it has been experience.'\n For one hundred fifty years Congress never has undertaken to regulate the business of insurance. Therefore to give the public any protection against abuses to which that business is peculiarly susceptible the states have had to regulate it. Since 1851 the several states, spurred by necessity and with acquiescence of every branch of the Federal Government, have been building up systems of regulation to discharge this duty toward their inhabitants. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n There never was doubt of the right of a state to regulate the business of its domestic companies done within the home state. The foreign corporation was the problem. Such insurance interests resisted state regulation and brought a series of cases to this Court. The companies sought to disable the states from regulating them by arguing that insurance business is interstate commerce, an argument almost identical with that now made by the \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 585]\n\u00a0\n Government. \n2\n The foreign companies thus sought to vest insurance control exclusively in Congress and to deprive every state of power to exclude them, to regulate them, or to tax them for the privilege of doing business.\n The practical and ultimate choice that faced this Court was to say either that insurance was subject to state regulation or that it was subject to no existing regulation at all. The Court consistently sustained the right of the states to represent the public interest in this enterprise. It did so, wisely or unwisely, by resort to the doctrine that insurance is not commerce and hence is unaffected by the grant of power to Congress to regulate commerce among the several states. Each state thus was left free to exclude foreign insurance companies altogether or to admit them to do business on such conditions as it saw fit to impose. The whole structure of insurance regulation and taxation as it exists today has been built upon this assumption. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n The doctrine that insurance business is not commerce always has been criticized as unrealistic, illogical, and inconsistent with other holdings of the Court. I am unable to make any satisfactory distinction between insurance business as now conducted and other transactions that are held to constitute interstate commerce. \n4\n Were we con- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 586]\n\u00a0\n sidering the question for the first time and writing upon a clean slate, I would have no misgivings about holding that insurance business is commerce and where conducted across state lines is interstate commerce and therefore that congressional power to regulate prevails over that of the states. I have little doubt that if the present trend continues federal regulation eventually will supersede that of the states.\n The question therefore for me settles down to this: What role ought the judiciary to play in reversing the trend of history and setting the nation's feet on a new path of policy? To answer this I would consider what choices we have in the matter.\n\n\n II.\n\n\n The Government claims, and we must approve or reject the claim, that the antitrust laws constitute an exercise of congressional power which reaches the insurance business. That might be true on either of two different bases. The practical as well as the theoretical difference is substantial, as this case will show.\n\n 1. \nIf an activity is held to be interstate commerce, Congress has paramount regulatory power. If it acts at all in relation to such a subject, it often has been held that it has 'occupied the field' to the exclusion of the states, that the federal legislation defines the full measure of regulation and outside of it the activity is to be free. \n5\n This Court now is not fully agreed as to the effects of the Commerce Clause on state power,6 but at least the Court always has considered that if an activity is held to be interstate in character a state may not exclude, burden, or obstruct it,7 \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 587]\n\u00a0\n nor impose a license tax on the privilege of carrying it on within the state. \n8\n The holding of the Court in this case brings insurance within this line of decisions restricting state power.\n\n 2. \nAlthough an activity is held not to be commerce or not to be interstate in character, Congress nevertheless may reach it to prohibit specific acivities in its conduct that substantially burden or restrain interstate commerce. Wickard v. Filburn, \n317 \nU.S. 111\n, 63 S.Ct. 82. When this power is exercised by Congress, it impairs state regulation only in so far as it actually conflicts with the federal regulation. Terminal Railroad Association v. Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, \n318 \nU.S. 1\n, 63 S.Ct. 420. This congressional power to reach activities that are not interstate commerce interferes with state power only in a milder, narrower, and more specific way.\n Instead of overruling our repeated decisions that insurance is not commerce, the Court could apply to this case the principle that even if it is not commerce the antitrust laws prohibit its manipulation to restrain interstate commerce, just as we hold that the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq., prohibits insurance companies, even if not in commerce, from engaging in unfair labor practices which affect commerce. Polish National Alliance v. N.L.R.B., \n322 \nU.S. 643\n, 64 S.Ct. 1196. This would require the Government to show that any acts it sought to punish affect something more than insurance and substantially affect interstate transportation or interstate commerce in some commodity. Whatever problems of reconciliation between state and federal authority this would present- and it would not avoid them all-it would leave the basis of state regulation unimpaired.\n The principles of decision that I would apply to this case are neither novel nor complicated and may be shortly put:\n\n 1. \nAs a matter of fact, modern insurance business, as \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 588]\n\u00a0\n usually conducted, is commerce; and where it is conducted across state lines, it is in fact interstate commerce.\n\n 2. \nIn contemplation of law, however, insurance has acquired an established doctrinal status not based on present-day facts. For constitutional purposes a fiction has been established, and long acted upon by the Court, the states, and the Congress, that insurance is not commerce.\n\n 3. \nSo long as Congress acquiesces, this Court should adhere to this carefully considered and frequently reiterated rule which sustains the traditional regulation and taxation of insurance companies by the states.\n\n 4. \nAny enactment by Congress either of partial or of comprehensive regulations of the insurance business whould come to us with the most forceful presumption of constitutional validity. The fiction that insurance is not commerce could not be sustained against such a presumption, for resort to the facts would support the presumption in favor of the congressional action. The faction therefore must yield to congressional action and continues only at the sufferance of Congress.\n\n 5. \nCongress also may, without exerting its full regulatory powers over the subject, and without challenging the basis or supplanting the details of state regulation, enact prohibitions of any acts in pursuit of the insurance business which substantially affect or unduly burden or restrain interstate commerce.\n\n 6. \nThe antitrust laws should be construed to reach the business of insurance and those who are engaged in it only under the latter congressional power. This does not require a change in the doctrine that insurance is not commerce. The statute as thus construed would authorize prosecution of all combinations in the course of insurance business to commit acts not required or authorized by state law, such as intimidation, disparagement, or coer- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 589]\n\u00a0\n cion, if they unreasonably restrain interstate commerce in commodities or interstate transportation. \n9\n It would leave state regulation intact.\n\n\n III.\n\n\n The majority of the sitting Justices insist that we follow the more drastic course. Abstract logic may support them, but the common sense and wisdom of the situation seem opposed. It may be said that practical consequences are no concern of a court, that it should confine itself to legal theory. Of course, in cases where a constitutional provision or a congressional statute is clear and mandatory, its wisdom is not for us. But the Court now is not following, it is overruling, an unequivocal line of authority reaching over many years. We are not sustaining an act of Congress against attack on its constitutionality, we are making unprecedented use of the Act to strike down the constitutional basis of state regulation. I think we not only are free, but are duty bound, to consider practical consequences of such a revision of constitutional theory. This Court only recently recognized that certain former decisions as to the dividing line between state and federal power were illogical and theoretically wrong, but at the same time it announced that it would adhere to them because both governments had accommodated the structure of their laws to the error. Davis v. Department of Labor & Industries, \n317 \nU.S. 249, 255\n, 63 S.Ct. 225, 228. It seemed a commonsense course to follow then, and I think similar considerations should restrain us from following a contrary and destructive course now. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 590]\n\u00a0\n The states began nearly a century ago to regulate insurance, and state regulation, while no doubt of uneven quality, today is a successful going concern. Several of the states, where the greatest volume of business is transacted, have rigorous and enlightened legislation, with enforcement and supervision in the hands of experienced and competent officials. Such state departments, through trial and error, have accumulated that body of institutional experience and wisdom so indispensable to good administration. The Court's decision at very least will require an extensive overhauling of state legislation relating to taxation and supervision. The whole legal basis will have to be reconsidered. What will be irretrievably lost and what may be salvaged no one now can say, and it will take a generation of litigation to determine. Certainly the states lose very important controls and very considerable revenues. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n The recklessness of such a course is emphasized when we consider that Congress has not one line of legislation deliberately designed to take over federal responsibility for this important and complicated enterprise. 11 There is no federal department or personnel with national experience \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 591]\n\u00a0\n in the subject on which Congress can call for counsel in framing regulatory legislation. A poorer time to thrust upon Congress the necessity for framing a plan for nationalization of insurance control would be hard to find.\n Moreover, we have not a hint from Congress that it concurs in the plan to federalize responsibility for insurance supervision. Indeed, every indication is to the contrary. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 592]\n\u00a0\n It was urged to do so by one President,13 and by the insurance companies. 14 The decisions of this Court confirming state power over insurance have been paralleled by a history of congressional refusal to extend federal authority into the field,15 although no decision ever has explicitly denied the power to do so. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 593]\n\u00a0\n The orderly way to nationalize insurance supervision, if it be desirable, is not by court decision but through legislation. Judicial decision operates on the states and the industry retroactively. We cannot anticipate, and more than likely we could not agree, what consequences upon tax liabilities, refunds, liabilities under state law to states or to individuals, and even criminal liabilities will follow this decision. Such practical considerations years ago deterred the Court from changing its doctrine as to insurance. \n16\n Congress, on the other hand, if it thinks the time has come to take insurance regulation into the federal system, may formulate and announce the whole scope and effect of its action in advance, fix a future effective date, and avoid all the confusion, surprise, and injustice which will be caused by the action of the Court. \n17\n\u00a0\n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 594]\n\u00a0\n A judgment as to when the evil of a decisional error exceeds the evil of an innovation must be based on very practical and in part upon policy considerations. When, as in this problem, such practical and political judgments can be made by the political branches of the Government, it is the part of wisdom and self-restraint and good government for courts to leave the initiative to Congress.\n Moreover, this is the method of responsible democratic government. To force the hand of Congress is no more \n\n[322 \nU.S. 533, 595]\n\u00a0\n the proper function of the judiciary than to tie the hands of Congress. To use my office, at a time like this, and with so little justification in necessity, to dislocate the functions and revenues of the states18 and to catapult Congress into immediate and undivided responsibility for supervision of the nation's insurance businesses is more than I can reconcile with my view of the function of this Court in our society. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The 'allied lines' of insurance handled by appellees are described in the indictment as 'inland navigation and transportation, inland marine, sprinkler leakage, explosion, windstorm and tornado, extended coverage, use and occupancy, and riot and civil commotion insurance.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The pertinent provisions of Sections 1 and 2 of the Act of July 2, 1890, 26 Stat. 209, as amended, 15 U.S.C.  1 and 2, 15 U.S.C.A.  1, 2, commonly known as the Sherman Act, are as follows:\n'Sec. 1. Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal : ... Every person who shall make any contract or engage in any combination or conspiracy declared by sections 1-7 of this title to be illegal shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor. ...\n\n'Sec. 2. Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, ....' \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The indictment does not state the proportion of fire insurance and 'allied lines' sold by stock companies, as distinguished from mutuals, etc ., in the six states involved. But it does state that 'stock companies receive approximately 85% of the total premium income of all fire insurance companies operating in the United States.' \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] See, e.g., Fashion Originators' Guild v. Federal Trade Comm'n, \n312 \nU.S. 457\n, 465-468, 61 S.Ct. 703, 706-708; United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., \n310 \nU.S. 150\n, 210-224, 60 S.Ct. 811, 838-845; Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v.

Two further grounds of demurrer, based upon the Fifth, Sixth, and Tenth Amendments, were not considered by the District Court. \n[\nFootnote 7\n] See 56 Stat. 271 amending 34 Stat. 1246, 18 U.S.C. 682, 18 U.S.C.A .  682; United States v. Borden Company, \n308 \nU.S. 188, 192\n, 193 S., 60 S.Ct. 182, 185, 186. Appellees contend that the District Court read both counts of the indictment as alleging that the trade or commerce sought to be restrained and monopolized was the business of selling fire insurance, that the Court rightly decided that such business was not commerce, and that therefore its judgment should be affirmed. The Government denies that the Court construed the indictment so narrowly. It insists that the first count of the indictment charges a violation of  1 of the Act regardless of whether the insurance business itself be commerce, since that account charges that the practices of the fire insurance companies constituted an unlawful restraint of interstate trade or commerce in such fields as transportation and industry which must purchase fire insurance. Cf. Polish National Alliance v. National Labor Relations Board, \n322 \nU.S. 643\n, 64 S.Ct. 1196, In the view we take of the case it is unnecessary to pass upon this question. We consider the case on the assumption that appellees' contention on this point is correct. \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] See Gibbons v.

Superintendent, etc., of Kansas, \n233 \nU.S. 389, 414\n, 415 S., 34 S.Ct. 612, 620, L.R.A.1915C, 1189. \n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] The five largest legal reserve life insurance companies, owning total assets of approximately $15,000,000,000, have their home offices in or near New York City. Best's Life Reports, 1939, as summarized in Monograph 28 printed for the use of the Temporary National Economic Committee, Appendix A (U.S. Government Printing Office 1940). Each of these companies is licensed in every state of the Union except that two of them are not licensed in Texas. Life Insurance Year Book, 1942-3.\n The five largest stock fire and marine insurance companies, owning total assets of approximately $550,000,000, are similarly located. Best's 1943 Digest of Insurance Stocks, xxxii. And each does business in every state of the union. Ibid. \n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] The amounts given as premiums collected and losses paid during the period 1931-1941 are for all stock fire insurance companies operating in the six states involved. The companies which were parties to the alleged conspiracies probably collected and paid about 90% of these amounts since they controlled that percentage of the total business. \n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] 'The defect of the argument lies in the character of their business. Issuing a policy of insurance is not a transaction of commerce. The policies are simple contracts of indemnity against loss by fire, entered into between the corporations and the assured, for a consideration paid by the latter. These contracts are not articles of commerce in any proper meaning of the word. They are not subjects of trade and barter offered in the market as something having an existence and value independent of the parties to them. They are not commodities to be shipped or forwarded from one State to another, and then put up for sale. They are like other personal contracts between parties which are completed by their signature and the transfer of the consideration. Such contracts are not inter-state transactions, though the parties may be domiciled in different States. The policies do not take effect-are not executed contracts-until delivered by the agent in Virginia. They are, then, local transactions, and are governed by the local law.' 8 Wall. 168, 183. \n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] Other cases which have repeated or relied upon the Paul generalization are Ducat v.

See, for example, An Address on the Regulation of Insurance By Congress, by John F. Dryden, President, Prudential Insurance Company of America, delivered November 22, 1904, pp. 12-13: 'The decision (Paul v. Virginia), and those that have followed, did not relate to the real point involved in a consideration of the regulation of the insurance business as interstate commerce by the Federal government. ... It is the opinion of qualified authorities who have given most careful consideration to this aspect of the subject ... that under the implied and resulting powers of the Constitution the Supreme Court would not withhold the verdict of constitutionality from an act of Congress declaring interstate insurance to be interstate commerce.' See, similarly, Insurance is Commerce, by George F. Seward, President, The Fidelity and Casualty Company of New York ( 1910) pp. 15-16; S.S.

This particular difficulty was recognized by the authors of the Federalist Papers: 'All new laws, though penned with the greatest technical skill, and passed on the fullest and most mature deliberation, are considered as more or less obscure and equivocal, until their meaning be liquidated and ascertained by a series of particular discussions and adjudications .... Here, then, are three sources of vague and incorrect definitions: indistinctness of the object, imperfection of the organ of conception, inadequateness of the vehicle of ideas. Any one of these must produce a certain degree of obscurity. The Convention, in delineating the boundary between the federal and State jurisdictions, must have experienced the full effect of them all.'

The same must be the case in respect to commerce, and to every other matter to which its jurisdiction is permitted to extend. ...

I recollect one judicial decision upon this subject very definitely. The Supreme Court has decided that insurance is not commerce, and I suppose by following the circle of negations long enough and excluding all the things not commerce we should come at last to the residuum, which must be commerce or interstate commerce, because it can be nothing else. A fortiori, judging from this principle, I should myself have decided that transportation is not commerce nor interstate commerce either. ...\n\n'I feel inclined to make the prediction, as one of the things to come in this vast domain, scarcely touched, of cases arising under the Constitution and laws of Congress, that the whole mass of merchantable paper known as negotiable by the law merchant, made at one place, negotiable at another, payable at another, transcending in its negotiation State lines, will be remitted to Congressional action, and with respect to its creation, its formation, its negotiation, with respect to all the rights and liabilities which may arise under it, the people, stunned with the eternal dissonance of conflicting decisions and judgments of forty- eight or fifty tribunals of last resort in the States upon the subject of interstate negotiable paper, will require Congress to act therein, and that, unconstitutional as I now deem it or think it, it will as a matter of necessity be done, and in any such legislation with respect to that paper, the whole bulk of it, the personal and peculiar conditions of litigants will not be inquired about, but simply whether the one party or the other is entitled to relief or liable to recovery against him by reason of being a party to interstate commercial paper, negotiable and payable and suable under the action of Congress which may finally take place upon that subject. ...\n\n'Nor do I think with the Senator from New York that we are discharged from duty or released from our obligation to legislate upon the subject of trusts because the States have a right to do so.' 21 Cong.Rec. 2556-2557.\n\n And see Note. 48, infra. \n\n[\nFootnote 46\n] Senator George, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee which redrafted the Sherman Act before its final passage, stated on the floor of the Senate that, 'The bill has been very ingeniously and properly drawn to cover every case which comes within what is called the commercial power of Congress. ... It is well known that the great evil of these combinations, these conspiracies, as they are called, these monopolies, as they are denominated by the bill, consists in the fact that by combination, by association, there have been gathered together the money and the means of large numbers of persons, and under these combinations, or conspiracies, or trusts, this great aggregated capital is wielded by a single hand and guided by a single brain, or at least by hands and brains acting in complete harmony and co-operation, and that in this way, by this association, by this direction of this immense amount of capital, by one organized will, to a very large extent, these wrongs have been perpetrated upon the American people.' 21 Cong.Rec. 3147.\n Earlier, Senator Sherman had explained, 'I do not wish to single out any particular trust or combination. It is not a particular trust, but the system I aim at.' 21 Cong.Rec. 2457. And in the House, Representative Stewart, delivering the last speech preceding the unanimous adoption of the present Act, stated '... The provisions of this trust bill are just as broad, sweeping, and explicit as the English language can make them to express the power of Congress over this subject under the Constitution of the United States. ...' 21 Cong.Rec. 6314.\n Compare Kidd v. Pearson, \n128 \nU.S. 1\n, 9 S.Ct. 6, and United States v. E.C. Knight Co., \n156 \nU.S. 1\n, 15 S.Ct. 249, with Addyston Pipe & Steel Co. v. United States, \n175 \nU.S. 211\n, 20 S.Ct. 96 and United States v. American Tobacco Co., \n221 \nU.S. 106\n, 31 S. Ct. 632. \n\n[\nFootnote 47\n] Senator Sherman, explaining his bill to the Senate, stated, 'It is to arm the Federal courts within the limits of their constitutional power that they may co-operate with the State courts in checking, curbing, and controlling the most dangerous combinations that now threaten the business, property, and trade of the people of the United States.' 21 Cong.Rec. 2457. \n\n[\nFootnote 48\n] For example, the following colloquy occurred in the House during the debate on passage of the Clayton Act:\n'Mr. Barton. We had an illustration recently where a big fire insurance company came into the State where local insurance companies have been doing business, not confined to the border of the State, and cut prices in that immediate locality until we had in three States 40 or 50 local companies put out of business, and then the price was put back where it was profitable to the company. Might not his same condition exist where we started a wholesale house in a State where their territory was confined to the State-might it not be a reduction of prices for putting that institution out of business?\n\n'Mr. Webb. If the purpose is to wrongfully injure or destroy a competitor, this section will cover such practice; but insurance companies are not reached, as the Supreme Court has held that their contracts or policies are not interstate commerce.\n\n'Mr. Barton. Is it not right that they should come within the law?\n\n'Mr. Webb. Yes.' 51 Cong.Rec. 9390.\n\n So far as appears, this was the only mention of the insurance cases during the discussions leading to passage of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 730. And, as in 1890, when the Sherman Act was under consideration, the reference to these cases showed dissatisfaction with them. See note 45, supra. \n[\nFootnote 49\n]  29(b), 41 Stat. 988, 1000, 46 U.S.C.A.  885(b). \n\n[\nFootnote 50\n] Whether reliance on earlier statements of this Court in the Paul v. Virginia line of cases that insurance is not 'commerce' could ever be pleaded as a defense to a criminal prosecution under the Sherman Act is a question which has been suggested but one it is not necessary to discuss at this time. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] It charges an agreement (a) to fix premium rates, (b) to fix commissions paid, (c) to adopt reclassifications of risks on the basis of which premium rates are fixed, (d) to adhere to standard terms, conditions, and clauses, in the insurance contract, (e) to withhold reinsurance facilities from nonmembers of the South-Eastern Underwriters' Association, ( f) to withdraw from and refuse to enter agencies representing non-members, ( g) to boycott and withhold patronage from purchasers of insurance from non- members, (h) to disparage the services and facilities of non-members, (i) to establish and maintain rating bureaus to police and maintain these agreements, (j) to establish and maintain boards and groups of agents for the same purpose. There is no allegation that commissions are paid otherwise than on the entering into of the contracts. The indictment thus charges only restraints in the terms of the insurance contracts and restraints, by boycotts, in competition in entering into such contracts and in entering into contracts of reinsurance. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] E.g., Paul v.

In the course of the debates in the Senate on the original bill introduced by Senator Sherman, Senator Turpie, discussing the extent of the federal commerce power, stated, 'I recollect one judicial decision upon this subject very definitely. The Supreme Court has decided that insurance is not commerce. ...' 21 Cong.Rec. 2556. During subsequent debates on that bill Senator Hoar, who later took charge of the revised bill reported by the Judiciary Committee and ultimately enacted, 21 Cong.Rec. 3145 et seq., denied the existence of federal substantive power, under the commerce clause or article III,  2, over contracts between citizens of different states, asserting that Senator Sherman's bill could be supported only as a regulation of the 'importation transportation, or sale of articles. ...' 21 Cong.Rec. 2567. See also the statements of Senator Eustis at 21 Cong.Rec. 2646, 2651-2. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] See Senator Sherman's original bill, S. 3445, 50th Cong., S. 1, 51st Cong., and his statement at 21 Cong.Rec. 2562. Texts of the bill throughout its various amendments are set out in Bills and Debates Relating to Trusts, Sen.Doc. No. 147, 57th Cong., 2nd Sess. (1903). \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] H.R.Rep. No. 1707, 51st Cong., 1st Sess., p. 1. See also the statement on the floor of the House by Mr. Culberson, in charge of the bill, 'There is no attempt to exercise any doubtful authority on this subject, but the bill is confined strictly and alone to subjects over which, confessedly, there is no question about the legislative power of Congress. ...' 21 Cong.Rec. 4089. And see the statement of Senator Edmunds, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee which reported out the bill in the form in which it passed, that in drafting that bill the committee thought that 'we would frame a bill that should be clearly within our constitutional power, that we would make its definition out of terms that were well known to the law already, and would leave it to the courts in the first instance to say how far they could carry it or its particular deinitions as applicable to each particular case as the occasion might arise.' 21 Cong.Rec. 3148. Similarly Senator Hoar, a member of that committee who with Senator Edmunds was in charge of the bill, stated 'Now we are dealing with an offense against interstate or international commerce, which the State cannot regulate by penal enactment, and we find the United States without any common law. The great thing that this bill does, except affording a remedy, is to extend the common-law principles, which protected fair competition in trade in old times in England, to international and interstate commerce in the United States.' 21 Cong.Rec. 3152. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] Messages of the Presidents 6901, 6986-7. See the Report of the Commissioner of Corporations, 1905, p. 5, urging that Congress 'so legislate upon the subject as to afford an opportunity to present to the Supreme Court the question whether insurance as now conducted is interstate commerce, and hence subject to Federal regulation.'\n See also Sen.Doc. No. 333, 59th Cong., 1st Sess. (1906), for a message of President Roosevelt proposing an insurance code for the District of Columbia and enclosing a report of a convention of State officers called by him to investigate wrongful insurance methods. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] See e.g., 29 American Bar Association Reports 538 (1906); 24 Annals of American Academy of Political and Social Sciences (1904) 69, 78-83; 26 Id.

(1899). \n[\nFootnote 9\n] Compare the debates in the House on the bill, S. 569, to establish a Department of Commerce and Labor. As reported by the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce  6 of the bill provided for the creation of a bureau of insurance to 'exercise such control as may be provided by law' over insurance companies and to 'foster, promote, and develop' the insurance business by collecting and compiling statistics. H.R.Rep. No. 2970, 57th Cong., 2d Sess., 12, 15. After extended debate, in which the provision was objected to for want of power in the federal government to regulate the insurance business and as a threat to the continuance of existing state regulation, 36 Cong.Rec. 868-9, 872-3, 908-11, 919-21, and in which it was insisted by proponents of the bill, as now, that insurance is commerce, 36 Cong.Rec. 876-7, amendments to strike all reference to insurance from the bill were adopted. 36 Cong.Rec. 911, 921. A proposed amendment to prohibit the use of the mails by insurance companies doing business in violation of state law was likewise defeated. 36 Cong.Rec. 922- 3. The conference committee then inserted the provision, adopted as  6 of the Act, 32 Stat. 828, authorizing the Bureau of Corporations to compile and publish useful information concerning corporations doing business in the United States and engaged in interstate or foreign commerce, 'including corporations engaged in insurance.' Upon assurances that this section 'simply authorizes information being secured' and that 'there is nothing in this measure that contravenes the votes of the House on that subject', 36 Cong.Rec. 2008, the conference report was adopted. The insurance provisions were not in the bill as it had originally passed the Senate, and the conference report was adopted by that body without debate. 36 Cong.Rec. 1990, 2035-6.\n The Commissioner of Corporations made a study of state legislation, but reported that 'in view of the decisions of the Supreme Court I have not felt warranted in trying to assume jurisdiction over insurance companies for the purpose of investigation.' Report of the Commissioner of Corporations, 1905, p. 5; see Report of the Commissioner of Corporations, 1904, pp. 29-33; Report of the Secretary of Commerce and Labor, 1903, p. 26. \n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] Mr. Webb's statement was made in answer to an inquiry by Mr. Barton as to whether the proposed section 2 of the Clayton Act would render illegal certain practices if engaged in by wholesalers, in the course of which Mr. Barton referred to an instance of such practices committed by insurance companies. The colloquy continued:\n'Mr. Barton. It is not right that they should come within the law?\n\n Mr. Webb. Yes.'\n Assuming that Mr. Webb's answer related to insurance companies, and expressed a desire that such companies should be included within the prohibitions of the Sherman and Clayton Acts, but were not, nothing was done to amend those Acts so as to carry out that desire or which would require this Court to reexamine the scope of federal power over insurance. \n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] For cases arising under the Anti-Trust laws in which this Court has so stated see Hopkins v.

Under the Criminal Appeals Act we have no jurisdiction to construe or reconstrue the indictment. My view would require remand to the District Court or the Circuit Court of Appeals for consideration in the light of our opinion. \n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] In 1943, gross premiums taxes on insurance companies yielded 40 states an aggregate of $96,108,000 and the remaining eight an estimated $ 26,892,000, making a total of $123,000,000. State Tax Collections in 1943, pamphlet published by Bureau of the Census, p. 8. \n[\nFootnote 11\n] It is impossible to believe that Congress, if it ever intended to assume responsibility for general regulation of insurance, would have made the antitrust laws the sole manifestation of its purpose. Its only command is to refrain from restraints of trade. Intelligent insurance regulation goes much further. It requires careful supervision to ascertain and protect solvency, regulation which may be inconsistent with unbridled rate competition. It prescribes some provisions of policies of insurance and many other matters beyond the scope of the Sherman Act.\n Also it requires sanctions for obedience far more effective than the $ 5,000 maximum fine on corporations prescribed by the antitrust laws. Violation of state laws are commonly punishable by cancellation of permission to do business therein-a drastic sanction that really commands respect.\n The antitrust laws sanctions are little better than absurd when applied to huge corporations engaged in great enterprise. In the two related Madison Oil cases (see United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., \n310 \nU.S. 150\n, 60 S.Ct. 811) fifteen of the seventeen corporations convicted had combined capital and surplus reported to be $2, 833,516,247. The total corporate fines on them were $255,000, making a ratio of fines to corporate capital and surplus of less than 1\/100 of one per cent. In addition, fines of $180,000 were assessed against individuals. In the automobile financing case (see United States v. General Motors Corp ., 7 Cir., 121 F.2d 376, certiorari denied \n314 \nU.S. 618\n, 62 S.Ct. 105) General Motors Corporation, three wholly owned subsidiaries and no individuals were convicted. The fines were $20,000. Capital and surplus were then reported at $1,047,840,321, the fine being somewhat less than 1\/500 of 1 per cent thereof.\n In each case the corporate fines were $5000, the maximum permitted by the statute. 15 U.S.C.  1, 15 U.S.C.A.  1. \n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] The last agency to investigate insurance problems was the Temporary National Economic Committee. It made no recommendation of federal control. Its chairman, Senator O'Mahoney, after reviewing carefully the problems caused by the concentration of economic power in the hands of the insurance companies an the abuses of the business, said: 'Therefore I say again that personally I would not support any law that would undertake to do away with state regulation of insurance, and there never has been suggested to me or to any member of the TNEC or to the committee as a whole any thought of doing away with state regulation or imposing federal supervision.' 26 American Bar Association Journal 913. Both dominant political parties have supported the present system. In 1940, the Democratic platform contained this provision: 'We favor strict supervision of all forms of the insurance business by the several States for the protection of policyholders and the public.' The Republican platform of that year contained this provision: 'We favor a continuance of regulation of insurance by the several States.' \n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] President Theodore Roosevelt twice recommended that Congress assume control of insurance.

It was not reported out of committee. S. 2736, 55th Cong., 2d Sess.\n After President Roosevelt's recommendation of 1904, Senator Dryden introduced a bill in the Senate to establish a bureau of insurance in the Department of Commerce. The bill died in committee. S. 7277, 58th Cong., 3d Sess.\n After President Roosevelt's second recommendation, the House Judiciary Committee reported that Congress had no power to regulate insurance, and said: 'The views of the Supreme Court have practically met the approval of the bar and business men of the United States as being in accordance with law and common sense.' H.R.Rep. 2491, 59th Cong., 1st Sess ., March 23, 1906, p. 14.\n The Senate Committee on the Judiciary made a similar report. Sen.Rep. 4406, 59th Cong., 1st Sess., 1906.\n In 1914-15, resolutions were introduced in both the House and the Senate proposing an amendment to the Constitution to the effect that Congress should have power to regulate the business or commerce of insurance throughout the United States and its territories or possessions. The resolutions were not reported out of the Judiciary Committee.

Deer Lodge County, \n231 \nU.S. 495, 502\n, 34 S.Ct. 167, 169, the Court said: 'To reverse the cases, therefore, would require us to promulgate a new rule of constitutional inhibition upon the States, and which would compel a change of their policy and a readjustment of their laws. Such result necessarily urges against a change of decision.' \n[\nFootnote 17\n] In resisting pressure to federalize insurance supervision Congress has followed the advice of some of the best informed champions of the public interest on insurance problems. One was Louis D. Brandeis. Speaking as counsel for the Protective Committee of Policyholders in the Equitable Life Assurance Society, before the Commercial Club of Boston, on October 26, 1905, Mr. Brandeis said:\n'The sole effect of a Federal law would be-the sole purpose of the Dryden bill (see note 15, supra) must have been-to free the companies from the careful scrutiny of the commissioners of some of the States. It seeks to rob the State even of the right to protect its own citizens from the legalized robbery to which present insurance measures subject the citizens, for by the terms of the bill a Federal license would secure the right to do business within the borders of the State, regardless of the State prohibitions, free from the State's protective regulations. With a frankness which is unusual-and an effrontery which is common-among the insurance magnates-this bill is introduced in the Senate by John F. Dryden, the president of the Prudential Life Insurance Company-the company which pays to stockholders annual dividends equivalent to 219.78 per cent. for each dollar paid in on the stock; the company which devotes itself mainly to insuring the working men at an expense of over 37.28 cents on every dollar of premiums paid; the company which, in 1904, made the worst record of lapsed and surrendered industrial policies. ...\n\n'Federal supervision is also advocated by Mr. James M. Beck (formerly Assistant Attorney General of the United States), the counsel for the Mutual Life Insurance Company, and his main argument against State supervision appears to be that the companies pay, in the aggregate, for fees and taxes in the several States $10,000,000, which he says is twice as much as is necessary to cover the expense of proper supervision. Ten million dollars is a large sum in itself, but a very small one compared with the aggregate assets or the aggregate expense of management. Mr. Beck's company paid in 1904 $1,138,663 in taxes and fees. Its management expenses were $15,517,520, or nearly fourteen times as much. Our Massachusetts savings banks paid in the year ending October 31, 1904, $1, 627,794.46 in taxes to this Commonwealth: that is $80,890.02 more than the whole expense of management, which was.$1,546,904.44. \n\n'Doubtless the insurance departments of some States are subjects for just criticism. In many of the States the department is inefficient, in some doubtless corrupt. But is there anything in our experience of Federal supervision of other departments of business which should lead us to assume that it will be freer from grounds of criticism or on the whole more efficient than the best insurance department of any of the States? For it must be remembered that an efficient supervision by the department of any State will in effect protect all the policy-holders of the company wherever they may reside. Let us remember rather the ineffectiveness for eighteen long years of the Interstate Commerce Commission to deal with railroad abuses, the futile investigation by Commissioner Garfield of the Beef Trust, and the unfinished investigation into the affairs of the Oil Trust in which he has since been engaged. Federal supervision would serve only to centralize still further the power of our Government and to increase still further the powers of the corporations.'\n\n Mr. Justice Brandeis for a unanimous Court wrote, in Bothwell v. Buckbee-Mears Co., 1927, \n275 \nU.S. 274, 276\n, 48 S.Ct. 124, 125: 'A contract of insurance, although made with a corporation having its office in a State other than that in which the insured resides and in which the interest insured is located, is not interstate commerce.' He joined in other similar decisions in Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Wisconsin, \n247 \nU.S. 132\n, 38 S.Ct. 444; National Union Fire Insurance Co. v. Wanberg, \n260 \nU.S. 71\n, 43 S.Ct. 32. \n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] Thirty-five states of the Union have filed amicus curiae briefs with us, protesting against the decision which the Court is promulgating. \n\n\n\n\n","117":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v.

Burchmore, all of Chicago, Ill., for intervener- appellee.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE.\n In its petition for rehearing appellee Staley Manufacturing Co. for the first time calls to our attention certain alleged changes in the location and arrangement of tracks on which are placed cars moving to and from the tracks of the line-haul carriers from and to Staley's industrial tracks. The changes are alleged to have occurred after the submission of the case to the Interstate Commerce Commission and are said to call for a different conclusion than that reached by the Commission as to whether the spotting service now performed by Staley is a part of the service covered by the line haul tariffs.\n The Commission's report considered in detail the circumstances attending the placing of cars at what are termed the Burwell tracks, which it found to be located within the Staley plant area and to have been leased by Staley to appellee Wabash Railroad Co. Its report states that in general, cars delivered to Staley were initially placed by the carrier on the Burwell tracks and thence switched to appropriate unloading points at the Staley plant, while cars received from Staley were generally placed on the Wabash Railroad's general or storage tracks, but were also sometimes placed on the Burwell tracks. The Commission found, on sufficient evidence then before it, that 'the movements between points of loading or unloading within the plant area of the Staley Company and the Burwell yard, the storage yard, or the general yard of the Wabash ... in all instances are, and must be, co- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 198, 200]\n\u00a0\n ordinated with the industrial operations of the Staley Company and conform to its convenience.' And in its second conclusion of law it stated that 'all services between the Burwell yard or the storage or general yard of the Wabash and points of loading or unloading within the plant area of the Staley Company are plant services for the Staley Company and not common- carrier services covered by the line-haul rates and charges of respondent carriers'.\n By their petitions for rehearing addressed to the Commission, appellees alleged that since March 1, 1941, three months after the case had been submitted to the Commission and about two months before it rendered its decision, the use of the Burwell tracks had been discontinued, and that those tracks had thereafter been disconnected and were being dismantled. They further alleged that appellee Wabash Railroad was in course of constructing new tracks on its own property 'adjacent to its yard tracks north of the Staley plant' and 'immediately north of the so- called Burwell yard' for use in the interchange of cars with Staley and other shippers, and that meanwhile the interchange was being performed from its general or storage yards. Appellees moved respectively that the Commission reconsider its decision 'upon such further proceedings as may be appropriate and necessary', and that 'the case be set down for a further hearing, and that ... the Commission reconsider its order'. No evidence was specified or tendered to prove before the Commission the allegations of the petitions for rehearing, and no opportunity to introduce evidence was in terms requested. The Commission denied the petitions for rehearing without opinion.\n Before the District Court appellees set out the substance of their petitions to the Commission for rehearing and urged that the Commission erred in denying them. The \n\n[322 \nU.S. 198, 201]\n\u00a0\n United States in its answer admitted only that appellees had alleged in those petitions for rehearing the matters set forth; the truth of the matters alleged was not admitted by either appellant. No new evidence was taken in the District Court. 51 F.Supp. 141. That court did not pass on this question, and made no findings as to the extent or effect of the alleged change of conditions.\n Nothing in the petitions to the Commission for rehearing or in the petition here affords any basis for saying that the alleged changes in conditions are of a character which would require any modification of the Commission's order or that appellees could not, with due diligence, have brought the changes to the attention of the Commission before it made its report. They were not referred to in appellees' briefs in this Court. Compare rule 27, paragraphs 4 and 6, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 354; I. T.S. Rubber Co. v. Essex Rubber Co., \n272 \nU.S. 429, 431\n, 432 S., 47 S.Ct. 136, 137; Flournoy v. Wiener, \n321 \nU.S. 253\n, 64 S.Ct. 548 at page 552. Neither the Commission nor the District Court have made findings with respect to them and they were not considered by this Court or referred to in its opinion.\n We find nothing in the record or in the petition before us which calls on the Court in the present proceeding to pass on the question now sought to be raised. Our decision is accordingly without prejudice to appellees' presentation in any appropriate proceeding before the Commission and the courts, of their contention that as a result of changed conditions after the case was submitted to the Commission, the spotting service as now performed is not in excess of the carriers' obligation under their tariff rates, and that its performance by the carriers without charge is therefore not unlawful.\n The petition for rehearing is denied.\n Petition denied. \n\n\n\n","118":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v. WABASH R. CO.(1944)\nNo. 453\nArgued: March 8, 1944Decided: March 27, 1944\n\n\n\n\n\n[321 \nU.S. 403, 405]\n\u00a0\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of Illinois.\n Mr. Allen Crenshaw, of Birmingham, Ala., for appellants.\n Mr. Elmer A.

Co.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Interstate Commerce Commission, in a report and order supplemental to its main report in Ex parte 104, Practices of Carriers Affecting Operating Revenues or Expenses, Part II, Terminal Services, 209 I.C.C. 11, has directed appellee railroads to cancel certain tariff supplements by which they propose to eliminate charges for spotting freight cars at the doors of factories in the industrial plant of appellee Staley Manufacturing Co., at Decatur, Illinois. The Commission based its order upon a finding that the performance without charge of the spotting service would be an unlawful preference because a departure from filed tariffs, in violation of  6(7) of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.  6(7), 49 U.S.C.A.  6(7). On appellees' petition the District Court for Southern Illinois, three judges sitting, 28 U.S.C.  47, 28 U.S.C.A.  47, set aside the Commission's order, 51 F.Supp. 141. It held that the Commission's conclusion that the free spotting service rendered at the Staley \n\n[321 \nU.S. 403, 406]\n\u00a0\n plant is an unlawful preference, was not supported by evidence, and that the Commission's order must be set aside because it results in discrimination contrary to  2 and 3(1) of the Act, 49 U.S.C.A.  2, 3(1 ), since it appears that similar free spotting serivice was being rendered to Staley's competitors against which the Commission had issued no order. The case comes here on appeal under 28 U.S.C.  47a, 345, 28 U.S.C.A.  47a, 345. The principal question for our decision is whether, as the District Court thought, the order is invalid because it results in a prohibited discrimination.\n In Ex parte 104, the Commission initiated an extensive investigation of the service rendered by interstate railroads in spotting cars at points upon the systems of plant trackage maintained by large industries. After a study of the conditions at some two hundred industrial plants to which the rail carriers made allowances for spotting service performed by the industries, and at numerous other plants where the spotting service was rendered without charge by the carriers, the Commission found that the freight rates had not been so fixed as to compensate the carriers for such service and that the railroads by assuming to perform it, or pay for its performance by the industries, had assumed a burden not included in the transportation service compensated by the filed tariffs. And it concluded that the performance by the railroads of such service, free, or the payment to the industries of allowances for its performance by them, is in violation of  6(7) of the Act.\n The Commission, in its main report in Ex parte 104, recognized that by railway tariff practice in this country the rates on carload traffic moving to or from any city or town apply to so-called 'switching' or 'terminal' districts and entitle each industry within such a district to have the traffic delivered directly to and taken from its site. By this method of delivery and by use of private tracks of the industry the railroads are saved the expense of maintaining more extensive terminal facilities, the service and cost \n\n[321 \nU.S. 403, 407]\n\u00a0\n of delivery within the switching district being comparable to that of delivery on team tracks or sidings or at way stations. But in the case of large industries having extensive plant trackage the Commission found that cars hauled to the industry usually come to rest at nearby interchange tracks, after which the intraplant distribution of the cars is made at times and in a manner to serve the convenience of the industry rather than that of the carrier in completing its transportation service.\n In determining in such circumstances the point at which the carrier service ends and the service in placing the cars so as to meet the convenience of the industry begins, the Commission stated that the line of demarcation 'should be drawn at the point where the carrier is prevented from performing at its ordinary operating convenience any further service, by the nature, desires, or disabilities of a plant', 209 I.C.C. at page 34. It added, 'When a carrier is prevented at its ordinary operating convenience from reaching points of loading or unloading within a plant, without interruption or interference by the desires of an industry or the disabilities of its plant, such as the manner in which the industrial operations are conducted, the arrangement or condition of its tracks, weighing service, or similar circumstances, ... the service beyond the point of interruption or interference is in excess of that performed in simple switching or team-track delivery. ...' 209 I.C.C. at pages 44, 45.\n The application of such a test obviously requires an intensive study of traffic conditions prevailing at the particular plant at which the spotting service is rendered. It is for this reason that the Commission, in carrying into effect the principles announced in Ex parte 104, has found it necessary to proceed to a series of supplemental investigations of the spotting service rendered at particular plants. Accordingly the Commission made no order on the foot of its main report, but following a series of sup- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 403, 408]\n\u00a0\n plemental reports, including the present one, each detailing the facts found as to the spotting service rendered at the particular plant investigated, the Commission has made cease and desist orders, applicable to that service, a number of which this Court has upheld on review. See United States v. American Sheet & Tin Plate Co., \n301 \nU.S. 402\n, 57 S.Ct. 804; Goodman Lumber Co. v. United States, \n301 \nU.S. 669\n, 57 S.Ct. 936; A. O. Smith Corp. v. United States, \n301 \nU.S. 669\n, 57 S.Ct. 936; United States v. Pan American Petroleum Corp., \n304 \nU.S. 156\n, 58 S.Ct. 771. In sustaining the Commission's findings in these proceedings, as in related cases, this Court has held that the point in time and space at which the carrier's transportation service ends is a question of fact to be determined by the Commission and not the courts, and that its findings on that question will not be disturbed by the courts if supported by evidence. United States v. American Sheet & Tin Plate Co., supra, \n301 \nU.S. 408\n, 57 S.Ct. 807; United States v. Pan American Petroleum Corp., supra, \n304 \nU.S. 158\n, 58 S.Ct. 773; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Hoboken Mfrs. R. Co., \n320 \nU.S. 368, 378\n, 64 S.Ct. 159, 164, and cases cited.\n In this, as in its earlier supplemental reports, the Commission has examined the actual conditions of operation at the industrial plant in question, here the Staley plant, and has found these conditions to be similar in type to those held sufficient to support its orders in United States v. American Sheet & Tin Plate Co., supra, and United States v. Pan American Petroleum Corp., supra. 1 It made an extended \n\n[321 \nU.S. 403, 409]\n\u00a0\n examination of car movements within the plant area of the Staley Company, which extends for a distance of about two and a quarter miles, includes some forty buildings used in the manufacture of various products, principally from corn and soy beans, and contains approximately 20 miles of track, having 18 points at which freight is loaded or unloaded. It found that inbound cars are in the first instance placed upon interchange tracks from which they are later spotted at the points of loading and unloading, a service requiring in numerous instances two or more car movements performed by engines and crews regularly and exclusively assigned to it; that the interchange tracks are reasonably convenient points for the delivery and receipt of cars; that the movements between the interchange tracks and the points of loading and unloading are not performed at the carrier's convenience but are 'coordinated with the industrial operations of the Staley Company and conform to its convenience'; that the service beyond the interchange points is in excess of that involved in switching cars to a team track or ordinary industrial siding or spur, and is consequently not a part of the transportation service which ends at the interchange tracks.\n Contentions of appellees based on a formal change of control of the interchange tracks by lease from the Staley Company to appellee Wabash Railroad executed subsequent to the Commission's report in Ex parte 104, are irrelevant to our present inquiry. After the lease, as before, they continued to be used as interchange tracks and the controlling question is whether the movement from the interchange tracks to points of loading and unloading is a plant service for the convenience of the industry, or a \n\n[321 \nU.S. 403, 410]\n\u00a0\n part of the carrier service comparable to the usual car delivery at a team track or siding. The Commission's finding that it is a plant service is supported by evidence and must be accepted as conclusive here.\n Appellees make no other serious contention of want of evidentiary support for the Commission's conclusion that the carrier service ended at the interchange tracks and the District Court found no such lack. Their contention, upheld by the court below, is that the Commission's order cannot be supported merely by the circumstances disclosed by the evidence respecting the operations at the Staley plant, but that its validity must turn upon a comparison of the conditions at the Staley plant with those at competing plants. They urge further, and the District Court so held, that, as it appears from the record that similar spotting service is being rendered at competing plants, the Commission's order compels appellees to discriminate against Staley, contrary to  2 and 3(1).\n This argument ignores the nature of the present proceeding which is to enforce  6(7), not  2 and 3(1). Section 6(7) prohibits departures from the filed tariffs and it is violated, as the Commission has pointed out, when carriers pay the industries for a terminal service not included in their transportation service or when they render such terminal service free of charge. This prohibition applies without qualification to every carrier and when, as here, the unlawfulness of the allowance or service is shown by the conditions prevailing at a particular industrial plant, it is unnecessary, in order to support the Commission's order, to consider whether generally similar allowances or services at other plants are, or are not, lawful under conditions prevailing there.\n In this respect a proceeding under  6(7) is unlike proceedings under  2 and 3(1) which prohibit unjust discriminations and undue preferences. United States v. American Sheet & Tin Plate Co., supra, \n301 \nU.S. 406\n, 57 S. Ct. 806; United States \n\n[321 \nU.S. 403, 411]\n\u00a0\n v. Hanley, D.C., 71 F. 672, 673, 674; compare Merchants' Warehouse Co. v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 501, 510\n, 511 S., 51 S.Ct. 505, 508, 509. Since under these sections acts or practices not otherwise unlawful may be so because discriminatory or preferential, it becomes necessary to make comparisons between the different acts or practices said to produce the discrimination or preference, in order to determine whether they are such in fact and whether they are unjust or undue. Differences in conditions may justify differences in carrier rates or service. In determining whether there is a prohibited unjust discrimination or undue preference, it is for the Commission to say whether such differences in conditions exist and whether, in view of them, the discrimination or preference is unlawful. See Barringer & Co. v. United States, \n319 \nU.S. 1, 7\n, 8 S., 63 S.Ct. 967, 971, and cases cited.\n The Commission's decision here, (245 I.C.C. 383, 408) and its finding of a 'preferential service', are not based and do not depend on a comparison of conditions at the Staley plant with those obtaining at others. By its fifth finding the Commission found that the spotting service rendered at the Staley plant was a service 'in excess of those rendered shippers generally in the receipt and delivery of traffic on team tracks or industrial sidings and spurs', and hence in excess of that provided for by the tariff rates. It concluded in its third conclusion of law that the performance of this service without charge would result in receipt by the Staley Company of 'a preferential service not accorded to shippers generally', and hence would result in a prohibited refunding or remitting of a portion of the filed tariff rates.\n The Commission, after pointing out that evidence was introduced showing that spotting is performed without charge at various plants, some of which compete with the Staley Company, also found, 'The evidence does not satisfactorily show that the circumstances and conditions under which the spotting is performed at such plants are substantially similar to those at the Staley plant. If it \n\n[321 \nU.S. 403, 412]\n\u00a0\n did, it would only show the probability of the existence of unlawful practices at such plants and the need for investigations in connection therewith.' The District Court relied solely on this evidence to support its conclusion of lack of evidentiary support for the Commission's finding of a 'preferential service not accorded to shippers generally' and to support its own finding that under the present order Staley is being discriminated against. For this reason it concluded that the Commission's order must be set aside.\n We think that this is a mistaken interpretation of the Commission's findings and misapprehends their legal effect. If the Commission's reference, in its conclusion of law, to 'a preferential service not accorded to shippers generally' means more than the statement in the fifth finding of fact that the service is 'in excess of those rendered shippers generally in the receipt and delivery of traffic on team tracks', it is obviously irrelevant to the present proceeding. For it could not serve to foreclose the legal conclusion to be drawn from the fifth finding that the free performance of the spotting service at the Staley plant is in violation of  6(7) because of the traffic conditions found to prevail there. United States v. American Sheet & Tin Plate Co., supra, \n301 \nU.S. 406, 407\n, 57 S.Ct. 806, 807. But a reading of the Commission's report and findings makes abundantly clear that it was not concerned with discriminations or preferences between the Staley plant and others, such as are prohibited by  2 and 3(1); that the 'preference' to which it referred was not based upon a comparison of conditions at the Staley plant with those of others, but upon an application to the actual conditions at the Staley plant of the standards laid down in its report in Ex parte 104, in order to ascertain whether the service rendered there is in excess of that which the carriers are obliged to perform by their tariffs.\n As the Commission and this Court have pointed out, a preference or rebate is the necessary result of every violation of  6(7) where the carrier renders or pays for a service \n\n[321 \nU.S. 403, 413]\n\u00a0\n not covered by the prescribed tariffs. Davis v. Cornwell, \n264 \nU.S. 560, 562\n, 44 S.Ct. 410. The Commission emphasized that no question of discrimination or preference prohibited by  2 and 3 was involved in the present proceeding when it found that the evidence did not show that the circumstances and conditions under which the spotting is performed at other plants are substantially similar to those at the Staley plant, and that if it did that it would only tend to show that the practice was unlawful at the others as well. So far as the District Court found that the Staley Company was being discriminated against by the continuance of the service at other plants, its finding is irrelevant to any issue in the present proceeding which relates only to violations of  6(7) and not  2 and 3(1). In any case findings of discrimination or undue preference under  2 and 3(1), as we have said, are for the Commission and not the courts. And the Commission has found that the evidence does not show that conditions with respect to the spotting service at the Staley plant and those of its competitors are similar.\n While it is the duty of the Commission to proceed as rapidly as may be to suppress violations of  6(7) in the performance of spotting services, that is to be accomplished, as we have held, by an investigation of the traffic conditions prevailing at each particular plant where the service is rendered and not by comparison of the services rendered at different plants. Appellees complain of the Commission's long delay, some six years since the present proceeding was begun, in investigating spotting services rendered at the plants of Staley's competitors, but any of the appellees have been free to initiate proceedings to eliminate any unlawful preferences or discriminations affecting them if they so desired ,  13(1), 49 U.S.C.A.  13(1), and no reason appears why they could not have done so. There are other modes of inducing the Commission to perform its duty than by setting aside its order prohibiting a practice \n\n[321 \nU.S. 403, 414]\n\u00a0\n which plainly violates  6(7), because it has not made like orders against other offenders. The suppression of abuses resulting from violations of  6(7) would be rendered practically impossible if the Commission were required to suppress all simultaneously or none. Section 12(1), 49 U.S.C.A .  12(1), imposes on the Commission the duty to enforce the provisions of the Act. That duty under  6(7) would hardly be performed if the Commission were to decline to enforce it against one because it could not at the same time enforce it against all.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Commission examined the conditions at the Staley plant in a supplemental report rendered May 22, 1936, in which it directed the carriers, appellants here, to abandon the practice of paying allowances to Staley for the performance of the spotting service. A. E. Staley Mfg. Co. Terminal Allowance, 215 I.C.C. 656. An action to enjoin enforcement of that order was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice as a result of this Court's decision in the Tin Plate, Pan-American Petroleum, and other cases sustaining similar orders. Thereupon the payment of allowances was abandoned, and the carriers assumed the performance of the spotting services, establishing a charge of $2.27 per car, later increased to $2.50. By schedules filed to become effective December 15, 1939, the carriers proposed to cancel the spotting charge. In the present proceeding the Commission has refused to approve the proposed schedules, and has likewise refused, after having reopened the proceedings in Staley Mfg. Co. Terminal Allowance, supra, to modify its prior order. 245 I.C.C. 383. \n\n\n\n\n","119":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNION BROKERAGE CO. v. JENSEN(1944)\nNo. 291\nArgued: February 1, 1944Decided: May 8, 1944\n\n\n\n Mr. Leonard Eriksson, of Fergus Falls, Minn., for petitioner.\n Ordner T. Bundlie, of Pipestone, Minn., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit brought in one of the lower courts of Minnesota by the Union Brokerage Company against Jensen and Rime for breach of fiduciary obligations in relation to Union's business, that of customhouse brokerage. The only defense to the suit with which we are concerned is the alleged disability of Union to resort to Minnesota's courts for want of compliance with her laws governing the transaction of business in the State as a foreign corporation. Minn.L.1935, c. 200, Minn.Stat.1941, c. 303. The Supreme Court of Minnesota sustained this defense, reversed the judgment in favor of the peti- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 202, 203]\n\u00a0\n tioner, and ordered the suit dismissed. 215 Minn. 207, 9 N.W.2d 721. We brought the case here to determine the important question whether enforcement of the Minnesota Foreign Corporation Act in this situation runs counter to federal law pertaining to customhouse brokers or is barred by the Commerce Clause, Const. art. 1,  8, cl. 3. \n320 \nU.S. 724\n, 64 S.Ct. 70.\n Another claim that state authority must yield to controlling federal authority over interstate and foreign commerce is thus presented. It becomes necessary therefore to ascertain precisely what demand the State has here made, in relation to what transactions or activity it is making such demand, in what way federal authority has regulated such transactions or activity, and, finally, whether the Commerce Clause by its own force, in case federal law has not actually taken control, excludes the State from the exercise of the power it has here asserted.\n For many years the petitioner, a North Dakota corporation, conducted a customhouse brokerage business at Portal, North Dakota, a port of entry from Canada by way of the Canadian Pacific Railway. In July, 1940, the Canadian Pacific re-routed most of its shipments whereby they no longer entered the United States through Portal but came through Noyes, Minnesota, with the result that more than 90% of Union's business was diverted from Portal. After November, 1940, at which time respondent Jensen resigned as officer of Union under circumstances giving rise to this suit, Union began to do business at Noyes and was doing business in Minnesota when it brought this suit. We shall outline the nature of this customhouse brokerage business only so far as is relevant to a consideration of our problem.\n On goods shipped from Canada into this country the consignee of imported merchandise must 'make entry' of \n\n[322 \nU.S. 202, 204]\n\u00a0\n them at the office of the collector of customs at Noyes either in person or by an authorized agent, and this must be done within forty-eight hours of the report of the vehicle which carried the goods unless the collector extends the time. Tariff Act of 1930, 46 Stat. 590, 722, 52 S.Ct. 1083, 19 U.S.C.  1484(a), 19 U.S.C.A.  1484(a). To make entry, the contents and value of the shipment must be declared and the tariff estimated, and the production of a certified invoice and a bill of lading is generally required. 19 U.S.C.  1484(b)(c)(e)(g), 19 U.S.C.A.  1484(b, c, e, g). Speed in making entry is vital, because goods cannot proceed to their ultimate destination until its completion. Apart from the fact that importers cannot always or even often make entries in person, the procedure makes demands upon skill and experience. The specialist in these services is the customhouse broker. In addition, he advances the duty in order that the goods may be cleared. 19 U.S.C.  1505, 19 U.S.C.A.  1505. The competence of the broker also bears on the efficient collection of customs duties in that the likelihood of additional assessment or refund after final determination of the duty is greatly lessened by accuracy in the tentative computation. But since errors and differences of opinion are inevitable, to insure collection of deficiencies, the Government requires a bond prior to release. 19 U.S.C.  1499, 19 U.S.C.A.  1499; 19 Code Fed. Reg.  6.27.\n The business of customhouse brokers, it is apparent, demands a sense of responsibility and skill. To protect importers as well as the Treasury, Congress has authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to 'prescribe rules and regulations governing the licensing as customhouse brokers of citizens of the United States of good moral character, and of corporations, associations, and partnerships, and may require as a condition to the granting of any license, the showing of such facts as he may deem advisable as to the qualifications of the applicant to render valuable service to importers and exporters.' 46 Stat. 759, 19 U.S.C.  1641(a), 19 U.S.C.A.  1641(a). Elaborate regulations define the investigation to be made of the character and reputation of the applicant and his experience in customs matters. 31A Code Fed.Reg.  11.3(b). The applicant is then directed to appear before an examining subcommittee which determines the 'applicant's knowledge of customs law and procedure and his fitness to render valuable serv- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 202, 205]\n\u00a0\n ice to importers and exporters.' 31A Code Fed.Reg.  11.3(e)(f). On approval of a favorable report of the sub-committee by the Committee on Enrollment and Disbarment of the Treasury Department, a license issues. 31A Code Fed.Reg.  11.3(f)(g), 11.4. 'A licensed customhouse broker requires no further enrollment under the regulations in this part for the transaction, within the customs districts in which he is licensed, of any business relating specifically to the importation or exportation of merchandise under customs or internal-revenue laws.' 31A Code Fed.Reg.  11.5.\n Union's license authorizes it to do business in District No. 34 which embraces both Portal, North Dakota, and Noyes, Minnesota. 19 Code Fed.Reg .  1.2. The regulations require it to keep records of its financial transactions as customhouse broker, and its books and papers must be kept on file available for at least five years. 31A Code Fed.Reg.  11.8. Business relations with those who have been denied a license because of moral turpitude or those whose license has been revoked are prohibited, and the licensee is under a duty not to promote evasion of obligations to the Government. Prompt payment and accounting of funds due to the Government or his client are required of the broker, and responsible and ethical conduct is generally enjoined. 31A Code Fed.Reg.  11.9.\n Does this scheme of federal regulation of the business of customhouse brokers preclude the requirement of Minne- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 202, 206]\n\u00a0\n sota legislation which the Supreme Court of that State has enforced against Union? This brings us to a consideration of the precise demand against which Union protests. Minnesota has not singled out the customhouse brokerage business for legislation nor has she made requirements of foreign corporations doing customhouse brokerage business. What is in controversy is the applicability of a general law of Minnesota dealing with all foreign corporations. More specifically,  20 of the Minnesota Foreign Corporation Act requires a certificate of any foreign corporation doing business in the State as a prerequisite for maintaining an action in a court of that State. In addition a filing fee of five dollars and initial license fee of fifty dollars is exacted on making application for a certificate of authority.  21(a)(1), 6. Such an application must contain the name of the corporation, its home state or country, the address of its principal office and that of its proposed registered office in Minnesota, the names and addresses of its directors and officers, a statement of its aggregate number of authorized shares and kindred information.  5. The applicant must furthermore consent to the service of process upon it and appoint an agent upon whom service can be made, and in lieu of such appointment or if the agent cannot be found, service may be made upon the Secretary of State.  5(6), 13(a)(2). A foreign corporation doing business in Minnesota without a certificate of authority is subject to a penalty not exceeding $1,000 and 'an additional penalty not exceeding $100.00 for each month or fraction thereof during which it shall continue to transact business in this state without a certificate of authority therefor.'  20(c). Having obtained such a certificate, the corporation is required to file annual reports on the basis of which an annual fee is assessed. The measure of the fee is substantially the same as that set for domestic corporations but in its computation the property \n\n[322 \nU.S. 202, 207]\n\u00a0\n and gross receipts of a foreign corporation are allocated between those derived from within and those derived from without Minnesota and credit is given for the latter.  15; cf. Minn.L.1935, c. 230,  2.\n We have before us only one narrow aspect of this Minnesota legislation, namely the power of Minnesota to deny to Union access to its courts because it has not obtained a certificate required of all foreign corporations doing business in the State. We have not before us the taxing power of Minnesota over such a business as that of Union, for we do not know the extent or nature of the power to tax that Minnesota would claim against Union.\n Of course Minnesota could not deny access to its courts to Union merely because it is engaged in the customs brokerage business. See Second Employers' Liability Cases, Mondou v. N.Y., N.H. & H.R. Co., \n223 \nU.S. 1\n, 32 S.Ct. 169. 56 L.Ed. 327, 38 L.R.A.,N.S., 44, and Douglas v. New York, New Haven & H.R. Co., \n279 \nU.S. 377\n, 49 S.Ct. 355. But the limited and defined control which federal authority has thus far seen fit to assert over customhouse brokers does not deny to Minnesota the power to subject Union to the same demand which it makes of all other foreign corporations seeking the facilities of Minnesota's courts. The federal requirements and this state requirement can move freely within the orbits of their respective purposes without impinging upon one another. The federal regulations are concerned solely with the relations of the customhouse broker to the United States and to the importer and exporter. The limited federal supervision of the financial activities of Union is restricted to these federal interests. Such supervision does not touch the interest of the State in the protection of those who have other dealings with Union, and therefore does not preempt appropriate means for their protection.\n In a situation like the present, where an enterprise touches different and not common interests between Na- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 202, 208]\n\u00a0\n tion and State, our task is that of harmonizing these interests without sacrificing either. The proper attitude of mind for making such an accommodation is illustrated by Federal Compress Co. v. McLean, \n291 \nU.S. 17\n, 54 S.Ct. 267. The Tariff Act of 1930 in this case, as the Warehousing Act in that case, confers upon licensees certain privileges, and secures to the Federal Government by means of these licensing provisions a measure of control over those engaged in the customhouse brokerage business. But such circumscribed control by the Federal Government does not imply immunity from control by the State within the sphere of its special interests. 'The government exercises that control in the furtherance of a governmental purpose to secure fair and uniform business practices. But the appellant, in the enjoyment of the privilege, is engaged in its own behalf, not the government's, in the conduct of a private business for profit.' Federal Compress Co. v. McLean, supra, 291 U.S. at pages 22, 23, 54 S.Ct. at page 269. The state and federal regulations here applicable have their separate spheres of operation. The Federal Government has dealt with the manner in which customhouse brokerage is carried on. Minnesota, however, is legitimately concerned with safeguarding the interests of its own people in business dealings with corporations not of its own chartering but who do business within its borders. Union's business is localized in Minnesota, it buys materials and services from people in that State, it enters into business relationships, as this case, a suit against its former president, illustrates, wholly outside of the arrangements it makes with importers or exporters. To safeguard responsibility in all such dealings, dealings quite outside transactions immediately connected with import and export, Minnesota has made the same exactions of Union as of every other foreign corporation engaged in similar transactions. The Federal Government has recognized that there is such a \n\n[322 \nU.S. 202, 209]\n\u00a0\n proper field for state regulation complementary to federal regulation, for the Treasury has provided that 'a licensee having a license in force in one district may on application to the Committee be granted a license to transact business in another district without further examination, provided it appears on investigation that the licensee is authorized to do business in the State or States in which such other district is situated'. 31A Code Fed.Reg.  11.6. Those who are responsible for protecting the interests of the revenue as well as of commerce have thus given emphatic indication that a State has a legitimate interest in the regulation of those engaged in the brokerage business within its borders. Where the Government has provided for collaboration the courts should not find conflict. See Savage v. Jones, \n225 \nU.S. 501\n, 32 S.Ct. 715, and Kelly v. Washington, \n302 \nU.S. 1\n, 58 S.Ct. 87.\n This brings us to the final question. Does the Minnesota legislation do that which the Commerce Clause was designed to prevent-does it express hostility toward those engaged in foreign commerce or practically obstruct its conduct? What we have said makes it abundantly clear that the business of Union is related to the process of foreign commerce. As the trial court found, the customhouse broker in clearing the shipments, 'aids in the collection of customs duties and facilitates the free flow of commerce between a foreign country and the United States'. The fees exacted by customhouse brokers 'are charges upon the commerce itself'; they are charges for services afforded in the movement of goods beyond the boundaries of a State. See Hopkins v. United States, \n171 \nU.S. 578, 591\n, 592 S., 19 S.Ct. 40, 45; Wickard v. Filburn, \n317 \nU.S. 111, 122\n, 63 S.Ct. 82, 87.\n But the Commerce Clause does not cut the States off from all legislative relation to foreign and interstate commerce. South Carolina State Hwy. Dept. v. Barnwell Bros., \n\n[322 \nU.S. 202, 210]\n\u00a0\n \n303 \nU.S. 177, 625\n, 58 S.Ct. 510; Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, \n303 \nU.S. 250\n, 58 S.Ct. 546, 115 A.L.R. 944. Such commerce interpenetrates the States and no undisputed generality about the freedom of commerce from state encroachment can delimit in advance the interacting areas of state and national power when Congress has not by legislation foreclosed state action. The incidence of the particular state enactment must determine whether it has transgressed the power left to the States to protect their special state interests although it is related to a phase of a more extensive commercial process.\n The information here sought of all foreign corporations by Minnesota as a basis for granting them certificates to do business within her borders is a conventional means of assuring responsibility and fair dealing on the part of foreign corporations coming into a State. Apart from any question of interference with foreign commerce such a requirement is plainly within the regulatory power of a State. But, as we have noted, while the business of Union is that of a customhouse broker, its activities are not confined to its services at the port of entry. It has localized its business, and to function effectively it must have a wide variety of dealings with the people in the community. The same considerations that justify the particular regulatory measure alone before us, namely the requirement of a certificate of authority in the case of foreign corporations carrying on business other than customhouse brokerage, apply to the carrying on of Union's business in Minnesota. The burden, such as it is, falls on foreign businesses that commingle with Minnesota people, and the burden, a fee of fifty dollars, is sufficiently small fairly to represent the cost of governmental supervision of foreign business enterprises coming into Minnesota. In short, it is a supervisory and not a fiscal measure. As such it imposes costs upon the State which \n\n[322 \nU.S. 202, 211]\n\u00a0\n those who are supervised must, as is often the case, themselves pay. See Clyde Mallory Lines v. Alabama, \n296 \nU.S. 261, 267\n, 56 S.Ct. 194, 196.\n We have considered literally scores of cases in which the States have exerted authority over foreign corporations and in doing so have dealt with aspects of interstate and foreign commerce. Whatever may be the generalities to which these cases gave utterance and about which there has been, on the whole, relatively little disagreement, the fate of state legislation in these cases has not been determined by these generalities but by the weight of the circumstances and the practical and experienced judgment in applying these generalities to the particular instances. To review them to any extent would be writing the history of the adjudicatory process in relation to the Commerce Clause. Suffice it to say that we have not here a case of a foreign corporation merely coming into Minnesota to contribute to or to conclude a unitary interstate transaction, see International Text-Book Co. v. Pigg, \n217 \nU.S. 91\n, 30 S.Ct. 481, 27 L.R.A.,N.S., 493, 18 Ann.Cas. 1103; Dahnke-Walker Milling Co. v. Bondurant, \n257 \nU.S. 282\n, 42 S.Ct. 106, nor of the State's withholding 'the right to sue even in a single instance until the corporation renders itself amenable to suit in all the courts of the state by whosoever chooses to sue it there.' Sioux Remedy Co. v. Cope, \n235 \nU.S. 197, 205\n, 35 S.Ct. 57, 60. The business of Union, we have seen, is localized in Minnesota, and Minnesota, in the requirement before us, merely seeks to regularize its conduct. Nor is there here an attempt to tax property or gross receipts earned outside the State as was the case in Looney v. Crane Co., \n245 \nU.S. 178\n, 38 S.Ct. 85. In the absence of applicable federal regulation, a State may impose non- discriminatory regulations on those engaged in foreign commerce 'for the purpose of insuring the public safety and convenience; ... a license fee no larger in amount than is reasonably \n\n[322 \nU.S. 202, 212]\n\u00a0\n required to defray the expense of administering the regulations may be demanded.' Sprout v. South Bend, \n277 \nU.S. 163, 169\n, 48 S.Ct. 502, 504, 62 A.L.R. 45.\n The Commerce Clause does not deprive Minnesota of the power to protect the special interest that has been brought into play by Union's localized pursuit of its share in the comprehensive process of foreign commerce. To deny the States the power to protect such special interests when Congress has not seen fit to exert its own legislative power would be to give an immunity to detached aspects of commerce unrelated to the objectives of the Commerce Clause. By its own force that Clause does not imply relief to those engaged in interstate or foreign commerce from the duty of paying an appropriate share for the maintenance of the various state governments. Nor does it preclude a State from giving needful protection to its citizens in the course of their contacts with businesses conducted by outsiders when the legislation by which this is accomplished is general in its scope, is not aimed at interstate or foreign commerce, and involves merely burdens incident to effective administration. And so we conclude that in denying Union the right to go to her courts because Union did not obtain a certificate to carry on its business as required by the Foreign Corporation Act, Minnesota offended neither federal legislation nor the Commerce Clause.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice JACKSON and Mr. Justice RUTLEDGE dissent. \n\n\n\n","120":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v. BALLARD(1944)\nNo. 472\nArgued: Decided: April 24, 1944\n\n\n\n Mr. Charles Fahy, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D.C., for petitioner. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 78, 79]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Roland Rich Woolley and Joseph F. Rank, both of Los Angeles, Cal., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondents were indicted and convicted for using, and conspiring to use, the mails to defraud.  215 Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C.  338, 18 U.S.C. A.  338;  37 Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C.  88, 18 U.S.C.A.  88. The indictment was in twelve counts. It charged a scheme to defraud by organizing and promoting the I Am movement through the use of the mails. The charge was that certain designated corporations were formed, literature distributed and sold, funds solicited, and memberships in the I Am movement sought 'by means of false and fraudulent representations, pretenses and promises'. The false representations charged were eighteen in number. It is sufficient at this point to say that they covered respondents' alleged religious doctrines or beliefs. They were all set forth in the first count. The following are representative:\n'that Guy W. Ballard, now deceased, alias Saint Germain, Jesus, George Washington, and Godfre Ray King, had been selected and thereby designated by the alleged 'ascertained masters,' Saint Germain, as a divine messenger; and that the words of 'ascended masters' and the words of the alleged divine entity, Saint Germain, would be transmitted to mankind through the medium of the said Guy W. Ballard;\n\n'that Guy W. Ballard, during his lifetime, and Edna W. Ballard, and Donald Ballard, by reason of their alleged high spiritual attainments and righteous conduct, had been selected as divine messengers through which the words of the alleged 'ascended masters,' in- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 78, 80]\n\u00a0\n cluding the alleged Saint Germain, would be communicated to mankind under the teachings commonly known as the 'I Am' movement;\n\n'that Guy W. Ballard, during his lifetime, and Edna W. Ballard and Donald Ballard had, by reason of supernatural attainments, the power to heal persons of ailments and diseases and to make well persons afflicted with any diseases, injuries, or ailments, and did falsely represent to persons intended to be defrauded that the three designated persons had the ability and power to cure persons of those diseases normally classified as curable and also of diseases which are ordinarily classified by the medical profession as being incurable diseases; and did further represent that the three designated persons had in fact cured either by the activity of one, either, or all of said persons, hundreds of persons afflicted with diseases and ailments;'\n\n Each of the representations enumerated in the indictment was followed by the charge that respondents 'well knew' it was false. After enumerating the eighteen misrepresentations the indictment also alleged:\n'At the time of making all of the afore-alleged representations by the defendants, and each of them, the defendants, and each of them, well knew that all of said aforementioned representations were false and untrue and were made with the intention on the part of the defendants, and each of them, to cheat, wrong, and defraud persons intended to be defrauded, and to obtain from persons intended to be defrauded by the defendants, money, property, and other things of value and to convert the same to the use and the benefit of the defendants, and each of them;'\n\n The indictment contained twelve counts, one of which charged a conspiracy to defraud. The first count set forth all of the eighteen representations, as we have said. Each of the other counts incorporated and realleged all of them and added no additional ones. There was a demurrer and a motion to quash each of which asserted among other things that the indictment attacked the religious beliefs \n\n[322 \nU.S. 78, 81]\n\u00a0\n of respondents and sought to restrict the free exercise of their religion in violation of the Constitution of the United States. These motions were denied by the District Court. Early in the trial, however, objections were raised to the admission of certain evidence concerning respondents' religious beliefs. The court conferred with counsel in absence of the jury and with the acquiescence of counsel for the United States and for respondents confined the issues on this phase of the case to the question of the good faith of respondents. At the request of counsel for both sides the court advised the jury of that action in the following language:\n'Now, gentlemen, here is the issue in this case:\n\n'First, the defendants in this case made certain representations of belief in a divinity and in a supernatural power. Some of the teachings of the defendants, representations, might seem extremely improbable to a great many people. For instance, the appearance of Jesus to dictate some of the works that we have had introduced in evidence, as testified to here at the opening transcription, or shaking hands with Jesus, to some people that might seem highly improbable. I point that out as one of the many statements.\n\n'Whether that is true or not is not the concern of this Court and is not the concern of the jury-and they are going to be told so in their instructions. As far as this Court sees the issue, it is immaterial what these defendants preached or wrote or taught in their classes. They are not going to be permitted to speculate on the actuality of the happening of those incidents. Now, I think I have made that as clear as I can. Therefore, the religious beliefs of these defendants cannot be an issue in this court.\n\n'The issue is: Did these defendants honestly and in good faith believe those things? If they did, they should be acquitted. I cannot make it any clearer than that.\n\n'If these defendants did not believe those things, they did not believe that Jesus came down and dic- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 78, 82]\n\u00a0\n tated, or that Saint Germain came down and dictated, did not believe the things that they wrote, the things that they preached, but used the mail for the purpose of getting money, the jury should find them guilty. Therefore, gentlemen, religion cannot come into this case.'\n\n The District Court reiterated that admonition in the charge to the jury and made it abundantly clear. The following portion of the charge is typical:\n'The question of the defendants' good faith is the cardinal question in this case. You are not to be concerned with the religious belief of the defendants, or any of them. The jury will be called upon to pass on the question of whether or not the defendants honestly and in good faith believed the representations which are set forth in the indictment, and honestly and in good faith believed that the benefits which they represented would flow from their belief to those who embraced and followed their teachings, or whether these representations were mere pretenses without honest belief on the part of the defendants or any of them, and, were the representations made for the purpose of procuring money, and were the mails used for this purpose.'\n\n As we have said, counsel for the defense acquiesced in this treatment of the matter, made no objection to it during the trial, and indeed treated it without protest as the law of the case throughout the proceedings prior to the verdict. Respondents did not change their position before the District Court after verdict and contend that the truth or verity of their religious doctrines or beliefs should have been submitted to the jury. In their motion for new trial they did contend, however, that the withdrawal of these issues from the jury was error because it was in effect an amendment of the indictment. That was also one of their specifications of errors on appeal. And other errors urged on appeal included the overruling of the demurrer to the indictment and the motion to quash, and the \n\n[322 \nU.S. 78, 83]\n\u00a0\n disallowance of proof of the truth of respondents' religious doctrines or beliefs.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the judgment of conviction and granted a new trial, one judge dissenting. 138 F.2d 540. In its view the restriction of the issue in question to that of good faith was error. Its reason was that the scheme to defraud alleged in the indictment was that respondents made the eighteen alleged false representations; and that to prove that defendants devised the scheme described in the indictment 'it was necessary to prove that they schemed to make some, at least, of the ( eighteen) representations ... and that some, at least, of the representations which they schemed to make were false.' 138 F.2d 545. One judge thought that the ruling of the District Court was also error because it was 'as prejudicial to the issue of honest belief as to the issue of purposeful misrepresentation.' Id., 138 F.2d at page 546.\n The case is here on a petition for a writ of certiorari which we granted because of the importance of the question presented.\n The United States contends that the District Court withdrew from the jury's consideration only the truth or falsity of those representations which related to religious concepts or beliefs and that there were representations charged in the indictment which fell within a different category. \n1\n The argument is that this latter group of \n\n[322 \nU.S. 78, 84]\n\u00a0\n representations was submitted to the jury, that they were adequate to constitute an offense under the Act, and that they were supported by the requisite evidence. It is thus sought to bring the case within the rule of Hall v. United States, \n168 \nU.S. 632, 639\n, 640 S., 18 s.Ct. 237, 239, 240, which held that where an indictment contained 'all the necessary averments to constitute an offense created by the statute', a conviction would not be set aside because a 'totally immaterial fact' was averred but not proved. We do not stop to ascertain the relevancy of that rule to this case, for we are of the view that all of the representations charged in the indictment which related at least in part to the religious doctrines or beliefs of respondents were withheld from the jury. The trial judge did not differentiate them. He referred in the charge to the 'religious beliefs' and 'doctrines taught by the defendants' as matters withheld from the jury. And in stating that the issue of good faith was the 'cardinal question' in the case he charged, as already noted, that 'The jury will be called upon to pass on the question of whether or not the defendants honestly and in good faith believed the representations which are set forth in the indictment.' Nowhere in the charge were any of the separate representations submitted to the jury. A careful reading of the whole charge leads us to agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals on this phase of the case that the only issue submitted to the jury was the question as stated by the District Court, of respondents' 'belief in their representations and promises.'\n The United States contends that respondents acquiesced in the withdrawal from the jury of the truth of their reli- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 78, 85]\n\u00a0\n gious doctrines or beliefs and that their consent bars them from insisting on a different course once that one turned out to be unsuccessful. Reliance for that position is sought in Johnson v. United States, \n318 \nU.S. 189\n, 63 S.Ct. 549. That case stands for the proposition that, apart from situations involving an unfair trial, an appellate court will not grant a new trial to a defendant on the ground of improper introduction of evidence or improper comment by the prosecutor, where the defendant acquiesced in that course and made no objection to it. In fairness to respondents that principle cannot be applied here. The real objection of respondents is not that the truth of their religious doctrines or beliefs should have been submitted to the jury. Their demurrer and motion to quash made clear their position that that issue should be withheld from the jury on the basis of the First Amendment. Moreover, their position at all times was and still is that the court should have gone the whole way and withheld from the jury both that issue and the issue of their good faith. Their demurrer and motion to quash asked for dismissal of the entire indictment. Their argument that the truth of their religious doctrines or beliefs should have gone to the jury when the question of their good faith was submitted was and is merely an alternative argument. They never forsook their position that the indictment should have been dismissed and that none of it was good. Moreover, respondents' motion for new trial challenged the propriety of the action of the District Court in withdrawing from the jury the issue of the truth of their religious doctrines or beliefs without also withdrawing the question of their good faith. So we conclude that the rule of Johnson v. United States, supra, does not prevent respondents from reasserting now that no part of the indictment should have been submitted to the jury.\n As we have noted, the Circuit Court of Appeals held that the question of the truth of the representations concerning \n\n[322 \nU.S. 78, 86]\n\u00a0\n respondent's religious doctrines or beliefs should have been submitted to the jury. And it remanded the case for a new trial. It may be that the Circuit Court of Appeals took that action because it did not think that the indictment could be properly construed as charging a scheme to defraud by means other than misrepresentations of respondents' religious doctrines or beliefs. Or that court may have concluded that the withdrawal of the issue of the truth of those religious doctrines or beliefs was unwarranted because it resulted in a substantial change in the character of the crime charged. But on whichever basis that court rested its action, we do not agree that the truth or verity of respondents' religious doctrines or beliefs should have been submitted to the jury. Whatever this particular indictment might require, the First Amendment precludes such a course, as the United States seems to concede. 'The law knows no heresy, and is committed to the support of no dogma, the establishment of no sect.' Watson v. Jones, 13 Wall. 679, 728. The First Amendment has a dual aspect. It not only 'forestalls compulsion by law of the acceptance of any creed or the practice of any form of worship' but also 'safeguards the free exercise of the chosen form of religion.' Cantwell v. State of Connecticut, \n310 \nU.S. 296, 303\n, 60 S.Ct. 900, 903, 128 A.L. R. 1352. 'Thus the Amendment embraces two concepts,-freedom to believe and freedom to act. The first is absolute but, in the nature of things, the second cannot be.' Id., 310 U.S. at pages 303, 304, 60 S.Ct. at page 903, 128 A.L.R. 1352. Freedom of thought, which includes freedom of religious belief, is basic in a society of free men. West Virginia State Board of Education by Barnette, \n319 \nU.S. 624\n, 63 S.Ct. 1178, 147 A.L.R. 674. It embraces the right to maintain theories of life and of death and of the hereafter which are rank heresy to followers of the orthodox faiths. Heresy trials are foreign to our Constitution. Men may believe what they cannot prove. They may not be put to the proof of their religious doctrines or beliefs. Religious experiences which are as real as life to some may be incomprehensible to others. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 78, 87]\n\u00a0\n Yet the fact that they may be beyond the ken of mortals does not mean that they can be made suspect before the law. Many take their gospel from the New Testament. But it would hardly be supposed that they could be tried before a jury charged with the duty of determining whether those teachings contained false representations. The miracles of the New Testament, the Divinity of Christ, life after death, the power of prayer are deep in the religious convictions of many. If one could be sent to jail because a jury in a hostile environment found those teachings false, little indeed would be left of religious freedom. The Fathers of the Constitution were not unaware of the varied and extreme views of religious sects, of the violence of disagreement among them, and of the lack of any one religious creed on which all men would agree. They fashioned a charter of government which envisaged the widest possible toleration of conflicting views. Man's relation to his God was made no concern of the state. He was granted the right to worship as he pleased and to answer to no man for the verity of his religious views. The religious views espoused by respondents might seem incredible, if not preposterous, to most people. But if those doctrines are subject to trial before a jury charged with finding their truth or falsity, then the same can be done with the religious beliefs of any sect. When the triers of fact undertake that task, they enter a forbidden domain. The First Amendment does not select any one group or any one type of religiion for preferred treatment. It puts them all in that position. Murdock v. Pennsylvania, \n319 \nU.S. 105\n, 63 S.Ct. 870, 891, 146 A.L.R. 81. As stated in Davis v. Beason, \n133 \nU.S. 333, 342\n, 10 S.Ct. 299, 300. 'With man's relations to his Maker and the obligations he may think they impose, and the manner in which an expression shall be made by him of his belief on those subjects, no interference can be permitted, provided always the laws of society, designed to secure its peace and prosperity, and the morals of its people, are not interfered with.' See Prince \n\n[322 \nU.S. 78, 88]\n\u00a0\n v. Massachusetts, \n321 \nU.S. 158\n, 64 S.Ct. 438. So we conclude that the District Court ruled properly when it withheld from the jury all questions concerning the truth or falsity of the religious beliefs or doctrines of respondents.\n Respondents maintain that the reversal of the judgment of conviction was justified on other distinct grounds. The Circuit Court of Appeals did not reach those questions. Respondents may, of course, urge them here in support of the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals. Langnes v. Green, \n282 \nU.S. 531, 538\n, 539 S., 51 S.Ct. 243, 246; Story Parchment Co. v. Paterson Co., \n282 \nU.S. 555, 560\n, 567 S., 568, 51 S.Ct. 248, 252. But since attention was centered on the issues which we have discussed, the remaining questions were not fully presented to this Court either in the briefs or oral argument. In view of these circumstances we deem it more appropriate to remand the cause to the Circuit Court of Appeals so that it may pass on the questions reserved. Lutcher & Moore Lumber Co. v. Knight, \n217 \nU.S. 257, 267\n, 268 S., 30 S.Ct. 505, 509, 510; Brown v. Fletcher, \n237 \nU.S. 583\n, 35 S.Ct. 750. If any questions of importance survive and are presented here, we will then have the benefit of the views of the Circuit Court of Appeals. Until that additional consideration is had, we cannot be sure that it will be necessary to pass on any of the other constitutional issues which respondents claim to have reserved.\n The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to the Circuit Court of Appeals for further proceedings in conformity to this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE, dissenting.\n I am not prepared to say that the constitutional guaranty of freedom of religion affords immunity from criminal prosecution for the fraudulent procurement of money by false statements as to one's religious experiences, \n\n[322 \nU.S. 78, 89]\n\u00a0\n more than it renders polygamy or libel immune from criminal prosecution. Davis v. Beason, \n133 \nU.S. 333\n, 10 S.Ct. 299; see Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, \n315 \nU.S. 568, 572\n, 62 S.Ct. 766, 769; cf. Patterson v. Colorado, \n205 \nU.S. 454, 462\n, 27 S.Ct. 556, 558, 10 Ann.Cas. 689; Near v. Minnesota, \n283 \nU.S. 697, 715\n, 51 S.Ct. 625, 630. I cannot say that freedom of thought and worship includes freedom to procure money by making knowingly false statements about one's religious experiences. To go no further, if it were shown that a defendant in this case had asserted as a part of the alleged fraudulent scheme, that he had physically shaken hands with St. Germain in San Francisco on a day named, or that, as the indictment here alleges, by the exertion of his spiritual power he 'had in fact cured ... hundreds of persons afflicted with diseases and ailments', I should not doubt that it would be open to the Government to submit to the jury proof that he had never been in San Francisco and that no such cures had ever been effected. In any event I see no occasion for making any pronouncement on this subject in the present case.\n The indictment charges respondents' use of the mails to defraud and a conspiracy to commit that offense by false statements of their religious experiences which had not in fact occurred. But it also charged that the representations were 'falssly and fraudulently' made, that respondents 'well knew' that these representations were untrue, and that they were made by respondents with the intent to cheat and defraud those to whom they were made. With the assent of the prosecution and the defense the trial judge withdrew from the consideration of the jury the question whether the alleged religious experiences had in fact occurred, but submitted to the jury the single issue whether petitioners honestly believed that they had occurred, with the instruction that if the jury did not so find, then it should return a verdict of guilty. On this \n\n[322 \nU.S. 78, 90]\n\u00a0\n issue the jury, on ample evidence that respondents were without belief in the statements which they had made to their victims, found a verdict of guilty. The state of one's mind is a fact as capable of fraudulent misrepresentation as is one's physical condition or the state of his bodily health. See Seven Cases v. United States, \n239 \nU.S. 510, 517\n, 36 S. Ct. 190, 193, L.R.A.1916D, 164; cf. Durland v. United States, \n161 \nU.S. 306, 313\n, 16 S.Ct. 508, 511. There are no exceptions to the charge and no contention that the trial court rejected any relevant evidence which petitioners sought to offer. Since the indictment and the evidence support the conviction, it is irrelevant whether the religious experiences alleged did or did not in fact occur or whether that issue could or could not, for constitutional reasons, have been rightly submitted to the jury. Certainly none of respondents' constitutional rights are violated if they are prosecuted for the fraudulent procurement of money by false representations as to their beliefs, religious or otherwise.\n Obviously if the question whether the religious experiences in fact occurred could not constitutionally have been submitted to the jury the court rightly withdrew it. If it could have been submitted I know of no reason why the parties could not, with the advice of counsel, assent to its withdrawal from the jury. And where, as here, the indictment charges two sets of false statements, each independently sufficient to sustain the conviction, I cannot accept respondents' contention that the withdrawal of one set and the submission of the other to the jury amounted to an amendment of the indictment.\n An indictment is amended when it is so altered as to charge a different offense from that found by the grand jury. Ex parte Bain, \n121 \nU.S. 1\n, 7 S.Ct. 781. But here there was no alteration of the indictment, Salinger v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 542, 549\n, 47 S.Ct. 173, 175, nor did the court's action, in effect, and anything to it by submitting to the jury matters which \n\n[322 \nU.S. 78, 91]\n\u00a0\n it did not charge. United States v. Norris, \n281 \nU.S. 619, 622\n, 50 S.Ct. 424, 425. In Salinger v. United States, supra, 272 U.S. at pages 548, 549, 47 S.Ct. at page 175, we explicitly held that where an indictment charges several offenses, or the commission of one offense in several ways, the withdrawal from the jury's consideration of one offense or one alleged method of committing it does not constitute a forbidden amendment of the indictment. See also Goto v. Lane, \n265 \nU.S. 393, 402\n, 403 S., 44 S.Ct. 525, 527; Ford v. United States, \n273 \nU.S. 593, 602\n, 47 S.Ct. 531, 534. Were the rule otherwise the common practice of withdrawing from the jury's consideration one count of an indictment while submitting others for its verdict, sustained in Dealy v. United States, \n152 \nU.S. 539, 542\n, 14 S.Ct. 680, 681, would be a fatal error.\n We may assume that under some circumstances the submission to the jury of part only of the matters alleged in the indictment might resuit in such surprise to the defendant as to amount to the denial of a fair trial. But, as in the analogous case of a variance between pleading and proof, a conviction can be reversed only upon a showing of injury to the 'substantial rights' of the accused. Berger v. United States, \n295 \nU.S. 78, 82\n, 55 S.Ct. 629, 630. Here no claim of surprise has been or could be made. The indictment plainly charged both falsity of, and lack of good faith belief in the representations made, and it was agreed at the outset of the trial, without objection from the defendants, that only the issue of respondents' good faith belief in the representations of religious experiences would be submitted to the jury. Respondents, who were represented by counsel, at no time in the course of the trial offered any objection to this limitation of the issues, or any contention that it would result in a prohibited amendment of the indictment. So far as appears from the record before us the point was raised for the first time in the specifications of errors in the Circuit Court of Appeals. It is asserted that it was argued to the District Court on \n\n[322 \nU.S. 78, 92]\n\u00a0\n motions for new trial and in arrest of judgment. If so, there was still no surprise by a ruling to which, as we have said, respondents' counsel assented when it was made.\n On the issue submitted to the jury in this case it properly rendered a verdict of guilty. As no legally sufficient reason for disturbing it appears, I think the judgment below should be reversed and that of the District Court reinstated.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS and Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER join in this opinion.\n\n Mr. Justice JACKSON, dissenting.\n I should say the defendants have done just that for which they are indicted. If I might agree to their conviction without creating a precedent, I cheerfully would do so. I can see in their teachings nothing but humbug, untained by any trace of truth. But that does not dispose of the constitutional question whether misrepresentation of religious experience or belief is prosecutable; it rather emphasizes the danger of such prosecutions.\n The Ballard family claimed miraculous communication with the spirit world and supernatural power to heal the sick. They were brought to trial for mail fraud on an indictment which charged that their representations were false and that they 'well knew' they were false. The trial judge, obviously troubled, ruled that the court could not try whether the statements were untrue, but could inquire whether the defendants knew them to be untrue; and, if so, they could be convicted.\n I find it difficult to reconcile this conclusion with our traditional religious freedoms.\n In the first place, as a matter of either practice or philosophy I do not see how we can separate an issue as to what is believed from considerations as to what is believable. The most convincing proof that one believes his statements is to show that they have been true in his expe- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 78, 93]\n\u00a0\n rience. Likewise, that one knowingly falsified is best proved by showing that what he said happened never did happen. How can the Government prove these persons knew something to be false which it cannot prove to be false? If we try religious sincerity severed from religious verity, we isolate the dispute from the very considerations which in common experience provide its most reliable answer.\n In the second place, any inquiry into intellectual honesty in religion raises profound psychological problems. William James, who wrote on these matters as a scientist, reminds us that it is not theology and ceremonies which keep religion going. Its vitality is in the religious experiences of many people. 'If you ask what these experiences are, they are conversations with the unseen, voices and visions, responses to prayer, changes of heart, deliverances from fear, inflowings of help, assurances of support, whenever certain persons set their own internal attitude in certain appropriate ways.' \n1\n If religious liberty includes, as it must, the right to communicate such experiences to others, it seems to me an impossible task for juries to separate fancied ones from real ones, dreams from happenings, and hallucinations from true clairvoyance. Such experiences, like some tones and colors, have existence for one, but none at all for another. They cannot be verified to the minds of those whose field of consciousness does not include religious insight. When one comes to trial which turns on any aspect of religious belief or representation, unbelieves among his judges are likely not to understand and are almost certain not to believe him.\n And then I do not know what degree of skepticism or disbelief in a religious representation amounts to actionable fraud. James points out that 'Faith means belief \n\n[322 \nU.S. 78, 94]\n\u00a0\n in something concerning which doubt is theoretically possible.' \n2\n Belief in what one may demonstrate to the senses is not faith. All schools of religious thought make enormous assumptions, generally on the basis of revelations authenticated by some sign or miracle. The appeal in such matters is to a very different plane of credility than is invoked by representations of secular fact in commerce. Some who profess belief in the Bible read literally what others read as allegory or metaphor, as they read Aesop's fables. Religious symbolism is even used by some with the same mental reservations one has in teaching of Santa Claus or Uncle Sam or Easter bunnies or dispassionate judges. It is hard in matters so mystical to say how literally one is bound to believe the doctrine he teaches and even more difficult to say how far it is reliance upon a teacher's literal belief which induces followers to give him money.\n There appear to be persons-let us hope not many-who find refreshment and courage in the teachings of the 'I Am' cult. If the members of the sect get comfort from the celestial guidance of their 'Saint Germain,' however doubtful it seems to me, it is hard to say that they do not get what they pay for. Scores of sects flourish in this country by teaching what to me are queer notions. It is plain that there is wide variety in American religious taste. The Ballards are not alone in catering to it with a pretty dubious product.\n The chief wrong which false prophets do to their following is not financial. The collections aggregate a tempting total, but individual payments are not ruinous. I doubt if the vigilance of the law is equal to making money stick by over-credulous people. But the real harm is on the mental and spiritual plane. There are those who hunger and thirst after higher values which they feel wanting in \n\n[322 \nU.S. 78, 95]\n\u00a0\n their humdrum lives. They live in mental confusion or moral anarchy and seek vaguely for truth and beauty and moral support. When they are deluded and then disillusioned, cynicism and confusion follow. The wrong of these things, as I see it, is not in the money the victims part with half so much as in the mental and spiritual poison they get. But that is precisely the thing the Constitution put beyond the reach of the prosecutor, for the price of freedom of religion or of speech or of the press is that we must put up with, and even pay for, a good deal of rubbish.\n Prosecutions of this character easily could degenerate into religious persecution. I do not doubt that religious leaders may be convicted of fraud for making false representations on matters other than faith or experience, as for example if one represents that funds are being used to construct a church when in fact they are being used for personal purposes. But that is not this case, which reaches into wholly dangerous ground. When does less than full belief in a professed credo become actionable fraud if one is soliciting gifts or legacies? Such inquiries may discomfort orthodox as well as unconventional religious teachers, for even the most regular of them are sometimes accused of taking their orthodoxy with a grain of salt.\n I would dismiss the indictment and have done with this business of judicially examining other people's faiths. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Petitioner has placed three representations in this group: (1) A portion of the scheme as to healing which we have already quoted and which alleged that respondents 'had in fact cured either by the activity of one, either, or all of said persons, hundreds of persons afflicted with diseases and ailments'; (2) The portion of the scheme relating to certain religious experiences described in certain books (Unveiled Mysteries and The Magic Presence) and concerning which the indictment alleged 'that the defendants represented that Guy W. Ballard, Edna W. Ballard, and Donald Ballard actually encountered the experiences pertaining to each of their said names as related and set forth in said books, whereas in truth and in fact none of said persons did encounter the experiences'; (3) The part of the scheme concerning phonograph records sold by respondents on representations that they would bestow on purchasers 'great blessings and rewards in their aim to achieve salvation' whereas respondents 'well knew that said ... records were manmade and had no ability to aid in achieving salvation.' \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] William James, Collected Essays and Reviews, pp. 427, 428; see generally his Varieties of Religious Experience and The Will to Believe.

BAUSCH & LOMB OPTICAL CO.(1944)\nNo. 62\nArgued: December 8, 1943Decided: April 10, 1944\n\n\n\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 707, 708]\n\u00a0\n Hon. Wendell Berge, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n Mr. Bethuel M. Webster, of New York City, for Soft-Lite Lens Co. Inc., et al.\n Mr. Whitney North Seymour, of New York City, for Bausch & Lomb Optical Co., et al.\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The United States of America brought suit in the District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Bausch & Lomb Optical Company, a corporation, and the Soft-Lite Lens Company, Inc., and several of the chief officers of each, to restrain violations of the Sherman Act. Jurisdiction was conferred on the trial court by Section 4 of the Act, 15 U.S.C.  4, 15 U.S.C.A.  4 and upon this Court by Section 2 of the \n\n[321 \nU.S. 707, 709]\n\u00a0\n Act of February 11, 1903, 15 U.S.C.  29, 15 U.S.C.A.  29, and Judicial Code  238, 28 U.S.C.A.  345.\n The complaint alleged that Bausch & Lomb and Soft-Lite and their officers contracted, combined and conspired to restrain trade in pink tinted lenses for eyeglasses, contrary to Sections 1 and 3 of the Sherman Act. \n1\n The allegations of the complaint were upheld by the trial court as to Soft-Lite and certain of its officers and dismissed as to Bausch & Lomb and its officers. United States v. Bausch & Lomb Optical Co., D.C., 45 F. Supp. 387.\n The findings and opinion upon which the decree is molded show that Soft-Lite is the sole distributor of pink \n\n[321 \nU.S. 707, 710]\n\u00a0\n tinted lenses under the trade name 'Softlite.' Their plan of dealing follows. As no patents or secret processes are relied upon and as Soft- Lite limits itself to distribution only, the trade name, salesmanship and business experience of Soft-Lite are the qualities upon which it must primarily depend for its profits as a distributor. Soft-Lite buys its lenses from Bausch & Lomb. It sells to wholesalers, who in turn sell to retailers, who in turn sell to the public. Laying aside the variations in operating costs of wholesalers as compared with other wholesalers and of retailers as compared with other retailers, the opportunity for profits which can be divided between Soft-Lite, the wholesalers and the retailers, depends upon the difference between the price per lens that Soft-Lite pays Bausch & Lomb and the price the ultimate consumer pays the retailer. A wider spread between original purchase and final prices, which is maintained by artificial fixing of the prices demanded from the ultimate consumer, furnishes the links of the distribution chain more profit for division among themselves. This is true regardless of volume or price although these factors, of course, affect the aggregate profits available for division among the dealers who have a part in distribution. In its self-restricted field, Soft-Lite is successful. Roughly speaking, for the years 1938, 1939 and 1940 in the United States it has sold one-third of the pink tinted lenses for one-half of the gross receipts. Other manufacturers than Bausch & Lomb and other distributors than Soft-Lite do the remainder of the business.\n Soft-Lite has arrangements with Bausch & Lomb for the purchase from them of lenses and blanks, with wholesalers of optical glass for the supply of this material to retail opticians, and in turn with these retailers for sales promotion. This is an integrated plant for the distribution of Soft-Lite's optical specialty, the pink tinted glass for easing eye strain. The plan of distribution for this \n\n[321 \nU.S. 707, 711]\n\u00a0\n commodity has developed over more than a quarter of a century of experience.\n The arrangement with Bausch & Lomb had its origin in 1924. At that time this manufacturer of optical glass undertook to grind pink tinted lenses for Soft-Lite out of foreign glass imported by the latter, but very soon the two parties arranged for Bausch & Lomb to manufacture the glass as well. At the very beginning Bausch & Lomb agreed that any orders for pink tinted lenses which it might receive would be transmitted to Soft- Lite. A list of Soft-Lite customers, wholesale and retail, was furnished Bausch & Lomb. It appeared better to both seller and buyer to extend their arrangement by a contract in which Bausch & Lomb undertook to manufacture and sell pink tinted glass and lenses of Soft-Lite. To avoid the danger to Soft-Lite's business of indiscriminate selling by Bausch & Lomb of this pink glass specialty, Bausch & Lomb agreed that it would not sell pink tinted glass to lens manufacturers or pink tinted lenses to the optical trade. Soft-Lite buys exclusively from Bausch & Lomb.\n The legal position of Bausch & Lomb and Soft-Lite is that of buyer and seller. Their relations through the years have been close, friendly and mutually satisfactory. Bausch & Lomb knows generally of the Soft-Lite distribution system, both as manufacturer for an active customer and as an owner of stock in wholesale optical goods companies, which subsidiary companies handled a large part of Soft-Lite's goods as jobbers. The officials of the two corporations carried on discussions and correspondence with respect to wholesale customers, retail outlets, prices, advertising policies, the standing of dealers, and general trade information. As to trade adjuncts for optical glass distribution such as cleaning cloths, lens cabinets, etc., Soft-Lite and Bausch & Lomb cooperated even to the ex- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 707, 712]\n\u00a0\n tent of agreeing to charge identical prices for such marketing aids.\n In 1926, the arrangement between Bausch & Lomb and Soft-Lite was given a somewhat more formal character by a letter of the manufacturer advising its customer as follows:\n'Since the very beginning of our relations with you, in connection with this transaction, it has been understood that we would safeguard your interests in every way and it has never been our intention to make competition for you by either marketing a tinted lens of our own or producing similar tinted glass for other manufacturers and it is our intention to abide by this understanding.\n\n'On the other hand, however, it is difficult to foresee the progress of science in producing glass possessing better properties than is obtainable at the present time and in that event we feel certain that you would not in any way desire to impede our progress in that direction.\n\n'We hope that this may be sufficient guarantee to you that we do not wish to do anything that would look like competition in connection with the Soft-Lite and we naturally expect that your efforts in the sale of same will be continued as at present for an indefinite period unless by consent of both parties concerned a different arrangement is agreed upon.\n\n'Yours very truly,\n\n'Bausch & Lomb Optical Company.\n\n'P. S. Tinted lenses such as Crookes, Fieuzal, Smoke, Amber, etc. which we are now manufacturing it is understood will not come under the above arrangement.'\n\n Minor variations in the plan have occurred since that letter. Bausch & Lomb patented a lens called 'Nokrome.' Soft-Lite was advised that when Soft-Lite glass was used in the Nokrome lens, Soft-Lite should have exclusive distribution. There were other patented lenses manufac- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 707, 713]\n\u00a0\n tured by Bausch & Lomb. Sometimes these lenses were ground from pink tinted glass and sometimes from other colors. Since these patented lenses were distributed by Bausch & Lomb under a licensee system, interference arose. Soft-Lite and Bausch & Lomb made mutually satisfactory adjustments so that their respective retailers might have some of the advantages of dealing in the Bausch & Lomb patented lenses ground out of Soft-Lite glass.\n Again, Soft-Lite was released from its obligation to take second quality lenses and Bausch & Lomb agreed to sell them only in foreign countries where Soft-Lite had no offices and at prices acceptable to both Soft-Lite and Bausch & Lomb.\n Reference has been made to the fact that Bausch & Lomb owned stock in optical wholesale companies which distributed Soft-Lite lenses and blanks. A stipulation stated that\n'Bausch & Lomb, through its ownership of a majority of the outstanding voting stock of each said wholesale companies, has power to coordinate and control the sales and pricing policies of said wholesale companies.'\n\n These subsidiaries were acquired by Bausch & Lomb 'at intervals subsequent to the original arrangement with Soft-Lite.' They now are the largest outlet for Soft-Lite Lenses, taking sixty per cent of Soft-Lite sales. They were substantial customers of Soft-Lite before they became affiliates of Bausch & Lomb. Soft-Lite is treated by its wholesale customers alike whether or not the customers are Bausch & Lomb affiliates. It is equally true that all wholesalers have cooperated with Soft-Lite in the development of its system.\n Bausch & Lomb thus profited from the Soft-Lite business in two ways: first, by profit made in manufacturing and selling to Soft-Lite; second, by sharing, through stock \n\n[321 \nU.S. 707, 714]\n\u00a0\n ownership of wholesale distributors of Soft-Lite's goods, in the profits which lay between the Soft-Lite selling price and the consumer purchase price. Bausch & Lomb, the evidence shows, understood well as early as 1925 the advantages to itself through these subsidiaries of the Soft-Lite Plan, which secured an increased profit for division among distributing agencies. As a consequence, Bausch & Lomb concerned itself with prices charged to wholesalers by Soft-Lite, discussed each step of the price mark-up from Soft-Lite up to the consumer, insisted that reductions in its prices to Soft-Lite should be passed along the distribution line, and through its affiliated corporations cooperated in the price arrangements and the elimination of undesirable retailers.\n Soft-Lite's control of distribution did not cease with this sale of its goods to optical wholesalers. It sought as wholesale outlets distributors who were free from business alliances with Soft-Lite's competitors. It sold only to wholesalers who were willing to cooperate with its policy. These wholesalers it designated as dealers and sold its goods only through them. Soft-Lite's wholesalers were allowed to resell only to retailers who held licenses from Soft-Lite. When retailers were licensed, the wholesalers were notified that they were at liberty to sell to the specified retailer. On the cancellation of the license, the wholesalers were notified in writing that the retailer was no longer entitled to receive Soft-Lite lenses. If a wholesaler did business with unapproved retailers, it was excluded from Soft-Lite's list of designated wholesalers. The wholesalers were required to distribute with each pair of Soft-Lite lenses a numbered certificate called a 'Protection Certificate.' By this certificate the wholesale outlet for Soft-Lite lenses found in the hands of unlicensed retailers could be traced by Soft-Lite. The wholesalers were told that the certificates were intended for \n\n[321 \nU.S. 707, 715]\n\u00a0\n this purpose. Soft-Lite indicated to the wholesalers the prices to be received by them from retailers by means of published price lists. Through these price lists, made available to wholesalers and retailers alike, the retailers could determine the prices wholesalers were to charge.\n It was determined by the District Court (and this finding is without challenge) that Soft-Lite and the wholesalers understood that material deviation would result in the discontinuance of the offending wholesaler as an outlet.\n Soft-Lite's plan of distribution was rounded out by its arrangements with the retail optical concerns. As we have just pointed out, the retailers knew from the published lists the prices the wholesalers were expected to charge them. The retailers were selected by Soft-Lite with care equal to that used in selecting wholesalers. Soft-Lite, in the words of its brief, was 'manufactured and advertised as a quality product, Soft- Lite must be sold as such.' 'Ethical' retailer opticians and optometrists were sought. Those who quoted prices in their advertisements or operated as adjuncts to department or jewelry stores were frowned upon. Retail prices to consumers were not fixed by Soft-Lite. It seems to be admitted, however, that the retailer was required to maintain prevailing local price schedules. An application form dated February 1, 1939, for retail stock licensees calls for representations to that effect from the Soft-Lite representative recommending the application and the approval of a Soft- Lite wholesaler. This practice apparently applied to all retailers. The District Court found that retailers agreed to sell the lenses at prices prevailing in the locality and that Soft-Lite required retailers to sell the pink tinted lenses 'at a premium over comparable untinted lenses.'\n Under its present system, Soft-Lite grants a revocable, exclusive and nontransferable 'license' to the retailer to \n\n[321 \nU.S. 707, 716]\n\u00a0\n buy Soft-Lite lenses and lens blanks from 'licensed' Soft-Lite distributors or wholesale 'licensees' and to resell the lenses at prevailing prices in the locally where the retailer is located. In turn the licensee agrees to promote the sale of Soft-Lite lenses and to do nothing to injure their prestige. The licensee was required to state that he understood that the substitution of other lenses for Soft-Lite would adversely affect that prestige. The licensee further agreed to sell only under the trade names and mark of Soft-Lite and only to the consumer or patient. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The retailer's agreement to conform to the license requirements was enforced by surveillance through Soft-Lite's salesmen and by cancellation of the retailer's license if he failed to abide by its terms. Wholesalers were notified of such cancellation.\n The Miller-Tydings Act of August 17, 1937, 50 Stat. 693, 15 U.S.C.A.  1, amended the Sherman Act so as to permit minimum prices for the resale of a commodity which bears the trade mark of the distributor in states where contracts of that description are legal by statute so far as intrastate transactions are concerned, and beginning in 1940 Soft-Lite has entered into resale price maintenance contracts with a number of wholesalers, presumably in conformity with the Miller-Tydings Act. The District Court was of the view that these contracts 'came into existence as a patch upon an illegal system of distribution of which they have become an integral part.'\n It is accepted by all parties that the transactions of Bausch & Lomb and Soft-Lite are in interstate commerce as the term 'commerce' is used in the Sherman Act. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 707, 717]\n\u00a0\n The judgment of the District Court determined that Soft-Lite and certain of its officers had contracted and conspired with optical wholesalers and retailers to violate the Sherman Anti-Trust Act in the following particulars:\n'(a) by entering into so-called 'license' agreements with optical retailers which fix the prices at which said retailers shall sell Soft- Lite lenses; (b) by entering into so-called 'license' agreements with optical retailers which provide that said retailers will sell such lenses only to the public; (c) by entering into agreements with wholesale customers which provide that the saie wholesalers will sell Soft-Lite lenses and blanks only to retailers who are designated as 'licensees' by the defendant Soft-Lite Lens Company, Inc.; (d) by entering into agreements with wholesale customers which fix the prices at which said wholesalers shall sell Soft-Lite lenses and blanks; (e) by entering into 'Fair Trade' resale price maintenance contracts with said wholesalers as an integral part of the illegal distribution system of Soft-Lite blanks and lenses; and (f) by enforcing the agreements set forth in subdivisions ( a) through (e) of this paragraph.'\n\n The judgment directs Soft-Lite to cancel its license agreements with retailers and its Fair Trade resale price maintenance contracts and agreements with wholesalers fixing prices and restricting their resales to Soft-Lite's retail licensees. Soft-Lite and its agents are enjoined from enforcing these contracts or using identification devices, such as the 'Protection Certificates,' for tracing resales of lenses or blanks purchased from Soft-Lite. They are likewise forbidden to enter into any other agreement similar in effect or purpose to those adjudged unlawful, except the Fair Trade contracts. These latter may be renegotiated after six months from the notices of cancellation which the judgment directs to issue. There is also a prohibition against Soft-Lite's and its officers' system- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 707, 718]\n\u00a0\n atically suggesting resale prices on lens or blanks for said six months. Bausch & Lomb and various individuals are adjudged to be free of the violations which are charged in the complaint. The right to inspect records and to interview officers and employees is reserved to the Department of Justice in the manner set out below. \n3\n Finally, jurisdiction of the case is retained for further orders or directions, including modification or termination of any of the provisions as well as their enforcement. Cf. Sugar Institute v. United States, \n297 \nU.S. 553, 605\n, 56 S. Ct. 629, 644.\n Two appeals are before us. The Government seeks to establish that the agreement of Bausch & Lomb not to sell pink tinted glass or lenses to any competitor of Soft-Lite and not to compete with Soft-Lite in the marketing of any \n\n[321 \nU.S. 707, 719]\n\u00a0\n pink tinted lens unreasonably restrains commerce in violation of the Sherman Act. By its appeal, the Government urges also a broadening of the decree by the substitution of a permanent instead of a six months' injunction against new Fair Trade agreements and against systematic suggestion of resale prices by Soft-Lite. It also asks an addition to the decree requiring Soft-Lite to sell its product without discrimination to any person offering to pay cash therefor.\n The other appeal is by Soft-Lite and those of its officers who are enjoined. This appeal attacks the provisions of the judgment cancelling agreements of Soft-Lite with wholesalers to charge uniform prices to retailers, enjoining systematic suggestions of resale prices and execution of Fair Trade resale price maintenance contracts even for six months, and allowing future discovery by the Department of Justice in order to police the decree.\n Since the alleged illegality of the Soft-Lite distribution system is the heart of the scheme which the Government attacks, we shall examine first the judgment from the standpoint of Soft-Lite's objections to it and then from that of the Government's desired additions as to Soft-Lite.\n As the Court is equally divided upon the issue raised in the Government's appeal in No. 62 by its request for a reversal of the provision of the judgment which dismisses Bausch & Lomb and its officers from the proceeding, that provision stands affirmed.\n\n\n I.\n\n\n Our task of examining Soft-Lite's objections is simplified by the frank recognition of those appellants that 'the retail license provisions binding dealers to sell at locally prevailing prices and only to the public constitute illegal restraints.' Our former decisions compel this conclu- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 707, 720]\n\u00a0\n sion. Price fixing, reasonable or unreasonable, is 'unlawful per se.' United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., Inc., \n310 \nU.S. 150, 218\n, 60 S.Ct. 811, 842; United States v. Trenton Potteries, \n273 \nU.S. 392, 397\n, 47 S.Ct. 377, 379, 50 A.L.R. 989; Ethyl Gasoline Corp. v. United States, \n309 \nU.S. 436, 458\n, 60 S.Ct. 618, 626; Fashion Originators' Guild v. Trade Comm'n, \n312 \nU.S. 457, 465\n, 668 S., 61 S. Ct. 703, 706. The retailer's price to his customer is the single source of stable profits for all handlers.\n These illegal contracts cannot be considered, however, as happenings completely insulated from other incidents of the Soft-Lite distribution system. When we turn to the provisions of the decree which are attacked here by Soft-Lite, requiring it to cancel its resale price agreements with wholesalers as well as retailers and to avoid such requirements for six months either by contract or suggestion, and thereafter to act only in accordance with the Miller-Tydings Act, we must first note that it is plain that the arrangements for price maintenance in the wholesalers' sales to retailers are an integral part of the whole distribution system. Not only are Soft-Lite wholesalers carefully selected and cooperative but they may sell only to Soft-Lite's retail licensees. Undesirable wholesalers are excluded from the system and the District Court found that by means of published wholesale price lists, put in the hands of wholesalers and retailers alike, resale prices of wholesalers are designated by Soft-Lite. The requirement of the wholesalers' recommendation as to the business character of the applicant for a retail license, the evidence of espionage, the limitation of resales to Soft-Lite retail licensees, the existence of the 'Protection Certificate' to mark the wholesaler who might violate the arrangement, the unformity of the prices, as prescribed in Soft-Lite's published lists, which are charged retailers by wholesalers-all amply support, indeed require, the inference of the trial court that a conspiracy to maintain prices down the distribution system existed between the wholesalers and Soft-Lite through the years prior to this suit. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 707, 721]\n\u00a0\n Soft-Lite is the distributor of an unpatented article. It sells to its wholesalers at prices satisfactory to itself. Beyond that point it may not project its power over the prices of its wholesale customers by agreement. A distributor of a trade-marked article may not lawfully limit by agreement, express or implied, the price at which or the persons to whom its purchaser may resell, except as the seller moves along the route which is marked by the Miller-Tydings Act. Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Park & Sons Co., \n220 \nU.S. 373, 404\n, 31 S.Ct. 376, 383. Even the additional protection of a copyright, Bobbs-Merrill Co. v. Straus, \n210 \nU.S. 339\n, 28 S.Ct. 722; Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. United States, \n306 \nU.S. 208, 221\n, 59 S.Ct. 467, 472, and cases cited, or of a patent, United States v. Masonite Corp., \n316 \nU.S. 265, 276\n, 62 S.Ct. 1070, 1076; Mercoid Corp. v. Mid-Continent Investment Co., \n320 \nU.S. 661\n, 64 S.Ct. 268, at pages 270, 271, and cases cited, add nothing to a distributor's power to control prices of resale by a purchaser. The same thing is true as to restriction of customers. Fashion Guild v. Trade Comm'n, \n312 \nU.S. 457, 465\n, 61 S.Ct. 703, 706; Standard Sanitary Mfg. Co. v. United States, \n226 \nU.S. 20\n, 47-49, 33 S.Ct. 9, 14, 15; Montague & Co. v. Lowry, \n193 \nU.S. 38, 45\n, 24 S.Ct. 307, 309.\n Not only do the appellants urge that conspiracy between Soft-Lite and the wholesalers should not be found from the foregoing evidence but they also say that they come within the scope of certain of our cases which are said to indicate that a simple refusal to sell to customers who will not resell at prices fixed by the seller is permissible under the Sherman Act. They cite United States v. Colgate & Co., \n250 \nU.S. 300\n, 39 S.Ct. 465, 7 A.L.R. 443; Federal Trade Commission v. Beech-Nut Packing Co., \n257 \nU.S. 441, 452\n, 453 S., 42 S.Ct. 150, 154, 19 A.L.R. 882; Federal Trade Commission v. Sinclair Refining Co., \n261 \nU.S. 463, 475\n, 476 S., 43 S.Ct. 450, 453, 454; and Federal Trade Commission v. Curtis Publishing Co., \n260 \nU.S. 568, 582\n, 43 S.Ct. 210, 213. None of these cases involve, as the present case does, an agreement between the seller and purchaser to maintain resale prices. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 707, 722]\n\u00a0\n The Colgate case turned upon the sufficiency on demurrer of an indictment under the Sherman Act against a manufacturer for requiring its dealers to maintain prices. As the indictment was construed to allege only specification of resale prices by the manufacturer and refusal to deal with customers who did not maintain them, this Court held the indictment insufficient as no reference was made in it to a purpose to monopolize and in such a posture the Sherman Act 'does not restrict the long recognized right of trader or manufacturer engaged in an entirely private business, freely to exercise this own independent discretion as to parties with whom he will deal; and, of course, he may announce in advance the circumstances under which he will refuse to sell.' 250 U.S. at pages 302, 306, 307, 39 S. Ct. at pages 466-468, 7 A.L.R. 443. Cf. United States v. A. Schrader's Sons, \n252 \nU.S. 85, 99\n, 40 S.Ct. 251, 253.\n The Beech-Nut case recognizes that a simple refusal to sell to others who do not maintain the first seller's fixed resale prices4 is lawful but adds as to the Sherman Act, 'He (the seller) may not, consistently with the act, go beyond the exercise of this right, and by contracts or combinations, express or implied, unduly hinder or obstruct the free and natural flow of commerce in the channels of interstate trade.' 257 U.S. at page 453, 42 S.Ct. at page 154, 19 A.L.R. 882. The Beech-Nut Company, without agreements, was found to suppress the freedom of competition by coercion of its customers through special agents of the company, by reports of competitors about customers who violated resale prices, and by boycotts of price cutters. 257 U.S. pages 451, 454, 455, 42 S.Ct. at pages 153-155, 19 A.L.R. 882. As the decision as to the Curtis Company involved only selling agencies, 260 U.S. at page 581, 43 S.Ct. at page 213, and that as to Sinclair the restricted use of a distributor's gasoline tanks, 261 U.S. at page 474, 43 S.Ct. at page 453, they are inapplicable to a consideration of a refusal by a distributor to sell except to chosen dealers. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 707, 723]\n\u00a0\n As in the Beech-Nut case, there is more here than more acquiescence of wholesalers in Soft-Lite's published resale price list. The wholesalers accepted Soft-Lite's proffer of a plan of distribution by cooperating in prices, limitation of sales to and approval of retail licensees. That is sufficient. Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. United States, \n306 \nU.S. 208, 226\n, 227 S., 59 S.Ct. 467, 474; United States v. Masonite Corp., \n316 \nU.S. 265, 274\n, 275 S., 62 S.Ct. 1070, 1075, 1076; Sugar Institute v. United States, \n297 \nU.S. 553, 601\n, 56 S.Ct. 629, 643.\n So far as the wholesalers are concerned, Soft-Lite and its officers conspired and combined among themselves and with at least some of the wholesalers to restrain commerce by designating selected wholesalers as sub-distributors of Soft-Lite products, by fixing resale prices and by limiting the customers of the wholesalers to those recommended by the wholesalers and approved by Soft-Life-all in violation of the Sherman Act. This finding justifies the order directing cancellation of the wholesale arrangements and cessation by Soft-Lite of systematic price suggestions. Whether this conspiracy and combination was achieved by agreement or by acquiescence of the wholesalers coupled with assistance in effectuating its purpose is immaterial.\n Soft-Lite makes objection also to the clause of the decree which holds null and void certain resale price maintenance contracts entered into by Soft-Lite and many of its wholesalers after the passage of the Miller-Tydings Amendment to the Sherman Act on August 17, 1937, 50 Stat. 693, 15 U.S.C.A.  1. See note 1, supra. Objections on the same grounds apply to other clauses of the decree forbidding enforcement of these existing 'Fair Trade' contracts with wholesalers and Soft-Lite's entering into any others until six months after certain notices of cancellation which are required by the decree but which have not yet been given owing to this appeal. Soft-Lite contends that the 'Fair Trade' agreements are strictly within the terms of the Miller-Tydings \n\n[321 \nU.S. 707, 724]\n\u00a0\n Act and we assume the correctness of that position. \n5\n The disadvantage at which these clauses place Soft-Lite towards its customers and competitors is pointed out.\n The District Court [45 F.Supp. 399] said that these contracts 'came into existence as a patch upon an illegal system of distribution' and as an integral part of that system. As some wholesalers do certain cutting and edging work on the blanks for sale to retailers who do not do this grinding for themselves, the 'Fair Trade' contracts for fixing resale prices apply only to those sales, known as 'stock' sales, where the lenses and blanks are resold in the same form in which they come from Soft-Lite. See United States v. Univis Lens Co., \n316 \nU.S. 241, 253\n, 254 S., 62 S.Ct. 1088, 1094, 1095. We think that where a distribution system exists, prior to the making of such price maintenance contracts, which is illegal because of unallowable price fixing contracts and where that illegality necessarily persists in part because a portion of the resales are not covered by the 'Fair Trade' contracts, as just explained, subsequent price maintenance contracts, otherwise valid, should be cancelled, along with the invalid arrangements, in order that the ground may be cleansed effectually from the vice of the former illegality. Equity has power to eradicate the evils of a condemned scheme by prohibition of the use of admittedly valid parts of an invalid whole. United States v. Univis Lens Co., \n316 \nU.S. 241, 254\n, 62 S.Ct. 1088, 1095; Ethyl Gasoline Corp. v. United States, \n309 \nU.S. 436, 461\n, 60 S.Ct. 618, 627. Cf. Standard Oil Co. v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 1, 78\n, 31 S.Ct. 502, 523, 34 L.R.A.,N.S., 834, Ann.Cas.1912D, 734; United States v. Union Pacific R. Co., \n226 \nU.S. 61, 96\n, 33 S.Ct. 53, 61; Id., \n226 \nU.S. 470, 476\n, 477 S., 33 S.Ct. 162, 165; Aikens v. Wisconsin, \n195 \nU.S. 194, 205\n, 206 S., 25 S.Ct. 3, 5, 6.\n The last objection brought forward by Soft-Lite to the decree is that paragraph 9, which is set out in full in note \n\n[321 \nU.S. 707, 725]\n\u00a0\n 3, is an unconstitutional exercise of judicial power by virtue of the provisions of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments or, at any rate, an improper use of the trial court's discretion.\n The first sentence requires Soft-Lite to permit authorized representatives of the Department of Justice to have access to all records and documents of Soft-Lite which are in Soft-Lite's control, 'relating to any of the matters contained in this judgment ... subject to any legally recognized privilege.' 6 The second sentence we construe to forbid Soft- Lite or its officers from directing its personnel to refuse to discuss with investigators of the Department the affairs of Soft-Lite relating to any of the matters contained in the judgment and from barring from their property investigators who may appear unprovided with search warrants. This second sentence purports to give no other right of investigation of the affairs of the appellants. The third and last sentence directs the defendants to submit on the written request of the Department such reports in writing 'with respect to any of the matters contained in this judgment' as may be necessary to enforce it.\n There is nothing in the United States Code relating to monopolies and combinations in restraint of trade which makes provision for such broad visitatorial powers. Without this statutory authority, United States officials could not require the corporation to submit to this examination without a search warrant. Go-Bart Importing Co. v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 344\n, 356-358, 51 S.Ct. 153; United States v. Louisville & N. R. Co., \n236 \nU.S. 318\n, 329-338, 35 S.Ct. 363, 366-369. Cf. Guthrie v. Harkness, \n199 \nU.S. 148, 158\n, 26 S.Ct. 4, 7, 4 Ann. Cas. 433. The provision was evi- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 707, 726]\n\u00a0\n dently sought and allowed to enable the Government to obtain information as to the operations of Soft-Lite subsequent to the judgment declaring Soft-Lite's distribution operations unlawful, to guide the responsible officials of the Department of Justice in their duty to protecting the public against a continuance of the illegal combination and conspiracy without the necessity of the expense and difficulty of extended investigation or renewed hearings under the jurisdiction retained for modification or enforcement. If reasonably necessary to wipe out the illegal distribution system, we see no constitutional objection to the employment by equity of this method. In the immediately preceding paragraphs of this opinion which discuss the power of the trial court to compel the cancellation of 'Fair Trade' agreements, executed during and as a part of the unlawful distribution system, we cited important precedents of this Court which uphold equity's authority to use quite drastic measures to achieve freedom from the influence of the unlawful restraint of trade. These precedents are applicable here. The test is whether or not the required action reasonably tends to dissipate the restraints and prevent evasions. Doubts are to 'be resolved in favor of the government and against the conspirators.' Local 167 v. United States, \n291 \nU.S. 293, 299\n, 54 S.Ct. 396, 399; Warner & Co. v. Lilly & Co., \n265 \nU.S. 526, 532\n, 44 S.Ct. 615, 618\n\n\n The Fifth Amendment does not protect a corporation against self- incrimination through compulsory production of its papers, Wilson v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 361, 375\n, 31 S.Ct. 538, 542, Ann.Cas. 1912D, 558; Hale v. Henkel, \n201 \nU.S. 43\n, 74-75, 26 S.Ct. 370, 378, 379; Wheeler v. United States, \n226 \nU.S. 478\n, 33 S.Ct. 158, although it does protect an individual, Boyd v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 616\n, 6 S.Ct. 524. A corporation is chartered with special powers only. Its creator, the State, may examine into its records to see whether or not the privileges have been abused. Our dual form of government necessarily authorizes the United States to \n\n[321 \nU.S. 707, 727]\n\u00a0\n exercise these powers in the vindication of its own laws. Hale v. Henkel, supra. The Boyd case pointed out that, as to individuals, the extortion of his private papers by subpoena was not only compelling self-incrimination but was also an unreasonable search and seizure within the Fourth Amendment. 116 U.S. at page 634, 6 S.Ct. at page 534. Upon further examination of the problem of the interrelation of the two Amendments in Hale v. Henkel, 201 U.S. at pages 72, 73, 26 S.Ct. at page 378, this Court reached the conclusion that the Fourth Amendment was not intended to interfere with 'the power of courts to compel, through a subpoena duces tecum, the production, upon a trial in court, of documentary evidence,' so long as the scope of the subpoena was reasonable. The power of Congress to require disclosure of corporate documents, a question adverted in Hale v. Henkel, 201 U.S. at page 77, 26 S.Ct. at page 380, but not decided, was upheld in United States v. Louisville & N.R. Co., supra. The scope of equity's power, Sherman Act, Sec. 4, 26 Stat. 209, 15 U.S.C.A.  4 to obviate continued restraint on trade in accordance with the Congressional direction as to the use of the injunction against violators of the Sherman Act is no more restricted in its field than that of Congress.\n The appropriateness of the visitatorial remedy raises a different question. Of course, a mere prohibition of the precise scheme would be ineffectual to prevent restraints. United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Association, \n166 \nU.S. 290, 308\n, 17 S.Ct. 540, 546. The circumstances of each case control the breadth of the order. National Labor Relations Board v. Express Pub. Co., \n312 \nU.S. 426, 436\n, 61 S.Ct. 693, 699. The other provisions of the decree are important. If in the present case, Soft-Lite was required for the indefinite future to sell its goods to any buyer with cash to pay the purchase price, there would not be the same need for visitatorial powers. The first sentence of the provision of the decree under discussion compels the disclosure only of papers relating to the matters contained in the judgment. This we think is limited \n\n[321 \nU.S. 707, 728]\n\u00a0\n sufficiently to satisfy the rule as to necessary certainty. Wilson v. United States, supra. We cannot say that the first two sentences of the 9th paragraph of the decree, as herein construed, were beyond the discretion of the trial judge. We are of the view that the third sentence, relating to reports, is too indefinite for judicial enforcement and therefore improper. Cf. Swift & Co. v. United States, \n196 \nU.S. 375, 400\n, 402 S., 25 S.Ct. 276, 281.\n\n\n II.\n\n\n The United States seeks extensions of the decree as entered against Soft-Lite. In the Government's view the existing prohibitions, although coupled with the retention of jurisdiction for further orders or directions, including modification and enforcement, are insufficient to prevent continuance of the purposes and effects of the unlawful Soft-Lite distribution system. Specifically, we are asked to direct the inclusion of requirements that Soft-Lite file 'with the district court a written instrument providing that it will sell its product, without discrimination, to any person offering to pay cash therefor.'\n The Sherman Act is intended to prevent unreasonable restraints of commerce. The Clayton amendment, 38 Stat. 731, 15 U.S.C.A.  12 et seq. outlawed agreements with customers which restricted the customer from dealing with the products of a competitor of the seller. Persons injured by unlawful restraints may recover threefold damages. The Federal courts have jurisdiction of suits to enjoin violations. Congress has been liberal in enacting remedies to enforce the antimonopoly statutes. But in no instance has it indicated an intention to interfere with ordinary commercial practices. In a business, such as Soft-Lite, which deals in a specialty of a luxury or near-luxury character, the right to select its customers may well be the most essential factor in the maintenance of the highest standards of \n\n[321 \nU.S. 707, 729]\n\u00a0\n service. We are, as the District Court apparently was, loath to deny to Soft-Lite this privilege of selection. United States v. Colgate & Co., \n250 \nU.S. 300, 307\n, 39 S.Ct. 465, 468, 7 A.L.R. 443; Federal Trade Comm'n v. Raymond Co., \n263 \nU.S. 565, 573\n, 44 S.Ct. 162, 164, 30 A.L.R. 1114. We have no reason to doubt that Soft-Lite will conform meticulously to the requirements of the decree. When it is shown to the trial court that it has not done so will be an appropriate time for the Government to urge this addition to the decree.\n What we have just said as to the Government's request for a requirement of sales by Soft-Lite to all applicants for its commodities is relevant to the Government's other request for modification of the decree to make permanent the six months' prohibition against Soft-Lite's systematically suggesting resale prices on its lenses and the execution of resale price maintenance contracts under the Miller-Tydings Act. The path is narrow between the permissible selection of customers under the decision in Colgate & Co. and unlawful arrangements as to prices under this decree, but we think Soft-Lite is entitled to traverse it, after a reasonable interim to dissipate unlawful advantages, with such aid as Congress has given by the Miller-Tydings Act. The suggestion for a permanent injunction is unacceptable.\n These conclusions lead us to modify the judgment by striking out the last sentence of paragraph 9, quoted in note 3. As so modified the judgment is affirmed.\n Modified.\n Mr. Justice JACKSON took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 26 Stat. 209, as amended 50 Stat. 693, 15 U.S.C.A.  1, 3:\n\"Section 1.

Gen., for petitioner.\n Messrs. H. Cecil Kilpatrick and Richard S. Doyle, both of Washington, D.C., for respondent. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 730, 731]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent, a general contractor of long experience in constructing federal buildings, was awarded a contract by the United States to construct certain buildings at the Veterans' Administration Facility at Roanoke, Virginia. After completing the contract, respondent filed a claim with the Veterans' Administration for certain expenses which he claimed were caused by the delay of a mechanical contractor and for other expenses alleged to have been imposed on him by the arbitrary, capricious and unfair conduct of Government agents at the work site. The claim was rejected and this suit in the Court of Claims followed. Judgment in the sum of $130,911.08 was awarded by that court to respondent, 99 Ct.Cl. 71. We granted certiorari because of important questions of interpretation of the Government construction contract used in this case. \n 1\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n I.\n\n\n Respondent's contract provided that the construction work was to be completed within 420 days from the receipt of notice to proceed. Concurrently, one R. J. Redmon was awarded a mechanical contract2 by the United \n\n[321 \nU.S. 730, 732]\n\u00a0\n States to perform the plumbing, heating and electrical work in the buildings to be constructed by respondent. Redmon's work was to be commenced promptly after receipt of notice to proceed and was to be completed at a date not later than that provided in respondent's contract.\n Respondent proceeded promptly wirh the construction work. He planned to complete the work within 314 days instead of the 420 days allowed him by the contract. However, no representative of Redmon reported at the work site until nearly three months after he received notice to proceed. The contracting officer had previously made many urgent demands that Redmon proceed with his work and had advised him that the progress of respondent's construction work was being delayed by his failure to start work; Redmon had also been threatened with termination of his contract. He finally started work, but made slow progress. At no time did Redmon have adequate equipment or a sufficient number of men on the job properly to carry on the work called for by his contract, nor was he financially able at this time to complete his work. The Court of Claims found that reasonable inquiry by the Government would have disclosed these facts but that no such inquiry was made because of false statements and reports made to the contracting officer by the Government agents in charge of the work at the site.\n Several months later, Redmon advised the contracting officer that he was unable to proceed with his contract. Redmon's surety secured a substitute and every effort was made to overcome the delay. As a result, respondent was able to finish his construction work within the required 420 days but not within the 314 days as he had planned. The court below found that respondent was unreasonably delayed for a period of three and one-half months due to the failure of the United States promptly to terminate \n\n[321 \nU.S. 730, 733]\n\u00a0\n Redmon's right to proceed, that the cost of the delay to respondent was $ 51,249.52, and that the United States was liable therefor.\n We are of the opinion, however, that nothing in the Government construction contract used in this case imposed an obligation or duty on the Government to aid respondent in completing his contract prior to the stipulated completion date and that it was error for the Court of Claims to award damages to respondent based upon a breach of this non-existent obligation.\n If the parties did intend to impose such an obligation or duty on the Government, they failed to embody that intention expressly in the contract. Article 13 of the contract merely obligates the contractor to cooperate with other Government contractors and to refrain from committing or permitting any act which would delay such other contractors. Article 9 imposes liquidated damages upon the contractor for delay in completing his work unless due to such unforeseeable causes as 'acts of the Government.' Nowhere is there spelled out any duty on the Government to take affirmative steps to prevent a contractor from unreasonably delaying or interfering with the attempt of another contractor to finish ahead of his schedule.\n Nor is there anything in the context of the contract to lead us to believe that the parties meant more than they said, or that the contract implies something that was not expressed. The Government and respondent covenanted that the construction work would be completed within 420 days; Redmon's contract was grounded on this same time estimate. They cannot be said to have executed these contracts in contemplation of the then unrevealed intention of respondent to complete his work three and one-half months early. The fact that respondent subsequently gave notice of this intention to all the other parties con- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 730, 734]\n\u00a0\n cerned could not give rise to a new obligation on the Government to compel accelerated performance from Redmon.\n Respondent had the undoubted right to finish his construction work in less time than the stipulated 420 days, but he could not be forced to do so under the terms of the contract. To hold that he can exact damages from the Government for failing to cooperate fully in changing the contract by shortening the time provisions would be to imply a grossly unequal obligation. We cannot sanction such liability without more explicit language in the contract. Compare H. E. Crook Co. v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 4\n, 46 S.Ct. 184; United States v. Rice, \n317 \nU.S. 61\n, 63 S. Ct. 120.\n\n\n II.\n\n\n The Court of Claims, in addition to awarding damages for the Government's delay in terminating Redmon's contract, awarded respondent $ 79,661.56 damages for extra labor and materials, excess wages and miscellaneous costs found to be the result of unauthorized acts, rulings and instructions of the Government superintendent and his assistant. The court also found that these acts, rulings and instructions were unreasonable and in many instances arbitrary, capricious and so grossly erroneous as to imply bad faith.\n Assuming without deciding that the actions complained of were unauthorized, unreasonable and arbitrary, we cannot conclude that reocvery of the resulting damages was proper in this case. Article 15 of the contract in suit provides that all disputes 'concerning questions arising under this contract shall be decided by the contracting officer or his duly authorized representative, subject to written appeal by the contractor within 30 days to the head of the department concerned or his duly authorized representative, whose decision shall be final and conclusive upon the parties thereto as to such questions.' All \n\n[321 \nU.S. 730, 735]\n\u00a0\n of the items on which the recovery of $79,661.56 was based were the subject of 'disputes concerning questions arising under this contract.' Respondent appealed some of the decisions or instructions of the Government superintendent to the contracting officer, which resulted in at least one ruling favorable to respondent. \n3\n As to the adverse rulings, however, respondent made no further appeal to the head of the appropriate department or his authorized representative. Moreover, the remaining items which were the subject of sharp dispute between respondent and the superintendent were not even appealed by respondent to the contracting officer. And where the contracting officer could be said to have acquiesced in the superintendent's rulings, no attempt was made to appeal further to the departmental head.\n Respondent has thus chosen not to follow 'the only avenue for relief,' United States v. Callahan Walker Const. Co., \n317 \nU.S. 56, 61\n, 63 S.Ct. 113, 115, available for the settlement of disputes concerning questions arising under this contract. In Article 15 the parties clearly set forth an administrative procedure for respondent to follow. Such a procedure provided a complete and reasonable means of correcting the abuses alleged to exist in this case. Arbitrary rulings and actions of subordinate officers are often adjusted most easily and satisfactorily by their superiors. Furthermore, Article 15 provided the Government with an opportunity to mitigate or avoid damages by correcting errors or excesses of its subordinate officers. Having accepted and agreed to these provisions, respondent was not free to disregard them without due cause, accumulate large damages and then sue for recovery in the Court of Claims. Nor can the Government be so easily deprived of the benefits of the administrative machinery it has created to adjudicate disputes and to avoid large damage claims. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 730, 736]\n\u00a0\n The Court of Claims sought to justify respondent's failure to pursue the procedure outlined in Article 15. It found that the superintendent and his assistant acted so unreasonably as to make it impossible for respondent to invoke the appeal procedure without subjecting himself to punishment and reprisals. It also found that respondent reasonably concluded that 'the best and most practical way of handling the matter of protests' was informally through conferences with the contracting officer in Washington; the latter, however, was often unable or unwilling to help him. Thus the court ruled that respondent was excused from following the procedure set forth in the contract. We cannot agree. Even if the conduct of the Government superintendent or contracting officer, or their assistants, was so flagrantly unreasonable or so grossly erroneous as to imply bad faith, the appeal provisions of the contract must be exhausted before relief is sought in the courts. There was no finding or evidence that appeal to the head of the appropriate department or to his authorized representative would have been futile or prejudicial. Compare United States v. L. P. & J. A. Smith, \n256 \nU.S. 11, 16\n, 41 S.Ct. 413, 414; Ripley v. United States, \n223 \nU.S. 695, 702\n, 750 S., 32 S.Ct. 352, 355. We cannot on this record attribute to the departmental head the alleged unreasonable attitude of his subordinates. Nor can we assume that the departmental head would have adopted an arbitrary attitude or refused to grant respondent the relief to which he may have been entitled. Moreover, nothing in the record suggests that he could not effectively supervise his subordinates or provide full and prompt relief. Thus, absent a valid excuse for not appealing the disputed items to the departmental head pursuant to Article 15, respondent cannot assert a claim for damages in the Court of Claims. If it were shown that the appeal procedure provided in the contract was in fact inadequate for the correction of the alleged unreasonable attitude of the subordinate Government officials, we would have quite a \n\n[321 \nU.S. 730, 737]\n\u00a0\n different case. But here we must insist, not that respondent turn square corners, but that he exhaust the ample remedies agreed upon.\n\n\n III.\n\n\n Included in the $79,661.56 award of miscellaneous damages was one item of $9,730.27 on a claim to the use of the Roanoke Marble & Granite Company, Inc., a subcontractor of respondent who furnished the materials and performed the labor necessary to install the title, terrazzo, marble and soapstone work called for in respondent's contract with the Government. This award was based upon extra labor costs incurred under conditions erroneously exacted by the Government superintendent. Respondent appealed this matter to the contracting officer, who finally rendered a decision in favor of respondent and the subcontractor. The Government has not reimbursed either respondent or the subcontractor for these excess labor costs; nor has respondent paid the subcontractor for such costs. The court below made no finding, and the subcontract as introduced in the record does not expressly indicate, that respondent was liable to the subcontractor for the acts of the Government upon which the claim was based.\n Clearly the subcontractor could not recover this claim in a suit against the United States, for there was no express or implied contract between him and the Government. Merritt v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 338\n, 45 S.Ct. 278. But it does not follow that respondent is barred from suing for this amount. Respondent was the only person legally bound to perform his contract with the Government and he had the undoubted right to recover from the Government the contract price for the title, terrazzo, marble and soapstone work whether that work was performed personally or through another. This necessarily implies the right to recover extra costs and services wrongfully demanded of respondent under the contract, regardless of whether such \n\n[321 \nU.S. 730, 738]\n\u00a0\n costs were incurred or such services were performed personally or through a subcontractor. Respondent's contract with the Government is thus sufficient to sustain an action for extra costs wrongfully demanded under that contract. Hunt v. United States, \n257 \nU.S. 125\n, 42 S.Ct. 5.\n The decision of the Court of Claims is reversed as to all items except the claim of $9,730.27. We affirm the judgment as to the latter claim.\n Reversed in part.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER, dissenting in part.\n Those dealing with the Government must no doubt turn square corners. While agents for private principals may waive or modify provisions in contracts which circumstances have rendered harsh, provisions in government contracts cannot be so alleviated. But in order to enforce the terms of a government contract courts must first construe them. And there is neither law nor policy that requires that courts in construing the terms of a government contract should turn squarer corners than if the same terms were contained in a contract between private parties. 'A government contract should be interpreted as are contracts between individuals, with a view to ascertaining the intention of the parties and to give it effect accordingly, if that can be done consistently with the terms of the instrument.' Hollerbach v. United States, \n233 \nU.S. 165, 171\n, 172 S., 34 S.Ct. 553, 555, 556. Like all other writings that do not have the precision of mathematical terms, government contracts have interstices that secrete relevant implications. Neither a statute which provides that contracts shall be reduced to writing, nor the parol evidence rule 'precludes reliance upon a warranty implied by law.' United States v. Spearin, \n248 \nU.S. 132, 138\n, 39 S.Ct. 59, 61. Unless the terms of a contract are so explicit as to preclude it, the presupposition of fair dealing surely must underlie a government as well as a private contract. Ripley v. United \n\n[321 \nU.S. 730, 739]\n\u00a0\n States, \n223 \nU.S. 695, 701\n, 702 S., 750, 32 S.Ct. 352, 355; United States v. L. P. & J. A. Smith, \n256 \nU.S. 11, 16\n, 41 S.Ct. 413, 414.\n Accordingly, provisions in a government contract defining methods for settling controversies by appeal to the contracting branch of the Government presuppose effective resort to such methods of settling questions that arise in carrying out a contract-they presuppose that administrative remedies as a condition to judicial relief are not rendered futile and nugatory. This does not of course question the good faith of the head of the Veterans' Administration. But where the man on the spot, in his daily relations with the contractor, shows the kind of arbitrary attitude found by the Court of Claims, he cannot be effectively supervised by the head of a department. In any event, the burden of incurring the subordinate's future hostility by appeals to the head of a department should not be cast on the contractor. The findings of the Court of Claims in this case can only mean that it would have been wholly futile, and worse than futile, to invoke the explicit provisions of the contract for resort to administrative relief. Therefore, as a reciprocal duty of the Government, the contract brings into operation the implied warranty that those who have in effective keeping the administrative machinery for settling controversies will not prevent its utilization for all practical purposes.\n The Court of Claims awarded respondent $79,661.56 to compensate for losses and increased costs resulting from the unreasonable and improper requirements imposed upon the contractor by the Government's superintendent of construction and his assistant. The circumstances surrounding the various items which go to make up this sum differ in details, but the basis on which the Court of Claims found for the contractor is the same.\n The findings of fact of the court below tell a story of arbitrary impositions. From the outset, the superintend- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 730, 740]\n\u00a0\n ing government officers required the contractor 'to do things admittedly not required of him under the contract on threat of reprisals for refusal.' These were not empty threats. The evidence shows that an unauthorized and unreasonable order to erect outside scaffolding for laying bricks was enforced by rejecting brickwork which was not precisely uniform to a maximum of one-sixteenth of an inch by measurement, and exacting of plaintiff mortar joints that did not vary more than one-eighth of an inch by measurement. That these rejections and exactions were wilful and oppressive became clear when all objections ceased as soon as the contractor decided to comply and erect the outside scaffolds. This is but one illustration of what was apparently a systematic practice of unjustified demands and vexations.\n The Court of Claims found that the superintendent and his assistant 'resented plaintiff's making protest to the contracting officer, thereby rendering it impossible for plaintiff effectively to protest in writing in each instance to the contracting officer through the defendant's officer at the site of the work. ... The contracting officer in those cases involving unreasonable and arbitrary acts and instructions of of officers at the site of the work stated to plaintiff that he understood and appreciated the troubles and difficulties under which plaintiff was having to perform the work but there was practically nothing he could do about it and that plaintiff should keep him informed but that plaintiff 'would just have to do the best he could to get along' with the officers and inspectors at the site of the work, to the end that the work be completed as soon as possible.' If there is substantial evidence supporting these findings, this Court's power of review is confined to questions of law. 53 Stat. 752, 28 U.S.C.  288, 28 U.S.C.A.  288.\n For all but one item, there can be no doubt that the evidence is adequate and the award in accordance with \n\n[321 \nU.S. 730, 741]\n\u00a0\n law. The contractor was awarded $107.50 for the extra cost of temperature steel used by order of the superintendent of construction in slabs reinforced with two-way rods. The record makes clear that the contract specifications supported this order of the superintendent, in that no distinction was made as to whether the slabs were reinforced by one-way or two-way rods, and the fact that the contracting officer subsequently relieved the contractor of this requirement as to two-way rods does not justify the award. In view of what I deem to be legal principles governing the construction of contracts, I should therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Claims for damages resulting from the acts of the superintending officers after deducting $107.50.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS joins in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The form of Government contract here involved was 'U.S. Government Form P.W.A. 51,' the critical provisions of which are substantially the same as those in the standard form of Government construction contract. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The terms and conditions of both respondent's and Redmon's contracts were identical, differing only in the description of the work to be performed. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See Part III, infra. \n\n\n\n\n","123":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v.

Marvin Smith, of Washington, D.C., for appellant.\n Mr. H. Albert Young, of Wilmington, Del., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case concerns the construction of the Federal Denture Act of 1942, 56 Stat. 1087, 18 U.S.C.  420f to 420 \n\n[323 \nU.S. 273, 274]\n\u00a0\n h (Supp.1943), 18 U.S.C.A.  420f to 420h, which provides that '... it shall be unlawful, in the course of the conduct of a business of constructing or supplying dentures from casts or impressions sent through the mails or in interstate commerce, to use the mails or any instrumentality of interstate commerce for the purpose of sending or bringing into ...' a State or Territory any denture the cast of which was taken by a person not licensed to practice dentistry in the State into which the denture is sent. An information, filed October 4, 1943, in the District Court for the District of Delaware, charged that appellees put into the mails at Chicago for delivery in Houston, Delaware, dentures in violation of the Delaware laws pertaining to dental practice, and thereby violated the Federal Denture Act. The information was quashed on the ground that prosecution of appellees could only be had where the illegal dentures were deposited. D.C., 53 F.Supp. 596. A second information, adding counts alleging transmission into and delivery in Delaware, was quashed by entry of a formal order referring to the court's earlier opinion. \n1\n The Government has appealed directly to this Court under the Criminal Appeals Act. 34 Stat. 1246, as amended, 18 U.S.C.  682 (Supp. 1943), 18 U.S.C.A.  682.\n Must these appellees be tried in the Northern district of Illinois or may they be tried in the district of any State through which the dentures were carried including Delaware, the place of delivery? Has Congress authorized such discretion in the enforcement of this Act? If it has, there is an end to the matter, for Congress may constitutionally make the practices which led to the Federal Denture Act triable in any federal district through which an offending denture is transported. Armour Packing Co. v. \n\n[323 \nU.S. 273, 275]\n\u00a0\n United States, \n209 \nU.S. 56\n, 28 S.Ct. 428. An accused is so triable, if a fair reading of the Act requires it. But if the enactment reasonably permits the trial of the sender of outlawed dentures to be confined to the district of sending, and that of the importer to the district into which they are brought, such construction should be placed upon the Act. Such construction, while not required by the compulsions of Article III,  2 of the Constitution and of the Sixth Amendment, is more consonant with the considerations of historic experience and policy which underlie those safeguards in the Constitution regarding the trial of crimes.\n Aware of the unfairness and hardship to which trial in an environment alien to the accused exposes him, the Framers wrote into the Constitution that 'The Trial of all Crimes ... shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed ....' Article III,  2, cl. 3. As though to underscore the importance of this safeguard, it was reinforced by the provision of the Bill of Rights requiring trial 'by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed.' Sixth Amendment. By utilizing the doctrine of a continuing offense, Congress may, to be sure, provide that the locality of a crime shall extend over the whole area through which force propelled by an offender operates. Thus, an illegal use of the mails or of other instruments of commerce may subject the user to prosecution in the district where he sent the goods, or in the district of their arrival, or in any intervening district. Plainly enough, such leeway not only opens the door to needless hardship to an accused by prosecution remote from home nd from appropriate facilities for defense. It also leads to the appearance of abuses, if not to abuses, in the selection of what may be deemed a tribunal favorable to the prosecution. \n\n[323 \nU.S. 273, 276]\n\u00a0\n These are matters that touch closely the fair administration of criminal justice and public confidence in it, on which it ultimately rests. These are important factors in any consideration of the effective enforcement of the criminal law. They have been adverted to, from time to time, by eminent judges; and Congress has not been unmindful of them. Questions of venue in criminal cases, therefore, are not merely matters of formal legal procedure. They raise deep issues of public policy in the light of which legislation must be construed. If an enactment of Congress equally permits the underlying spirit of the constitutional concern for trial in the vicinage to be respected rather than to be disrespected, construction should go in the direction of constitutional policy even though not commanded by it.\n It is significant that when Congress desires to give a choice of trial, it does so by specific venue provisions giving jurisdiction to prosecute in any criminal court of the United States through which a process of wrongdoing moves. Such was the situation in Armour Packing Co. v. United States, supra. The offense there was under the Elkins Act for the transportation of goods at illegal freight rates, and Congress specifically provided for prosecution in any district 'through which the transportation may have been conducted.' 32 Stat. 847, as amended, 49 U.S. C.  41(1), 49 U.S.C.A.  41(1).\n In the Federal Denture Act Congress did not make provision for trial in any district through which the goods were shipped. The absence of such a provision would in itself be significant. Its significance is enhanced when it appears that the attention of Congress was directed by the Postmaster General to the desirability of authority for a discretionary trial either at the place of shipment or at the place or receipt. He wrote to the Chairman of the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce 'that consideration should be given to the advisability of having \n\n[323 \nU.S. 273, 277]\n\u00a0\n the measure provide for prosecution of violators in the jurisdiction where the material is caused to be delivered as well as in the jurisdiction from which it is sent'. Hearings before Subcommittee of House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce on H.R. 5674, 77th Cong., 2d Sess. (1942) p. 3. And the Committee also invited the viewpoint of representatives of the Department of Justice 'on the language of the bill'. Id. at 28. In view of the keen awareness of enforcing officials as well as that of the members of the Committee on Interstate Commerce of the problems raised by venue in criminal trials, it is inadmissible to suggest either oversight on the part of Congress in failing to make provision for choice of venue or to make the cavalier assumption that that which is specifically provided for in other enactments-i.e., trial in more than one district-was authorized but through parsimony of language left unexpressed in the Federal Denture Act.\n The absence of a venue provision such as that which Congress wrote into the Elkins Act is far more rationally explained by due regard to the difference between the offenses under the Elkins and the Federal Denture Acts respectively. The venue provision under the Elkins Act underlines the offense defined by that Act, which was not the illegal sending or the bringing of goods but their 'transportation'. That-transportation-is inescapably a process, a continuing phenomenon. The Federal Denture Act did not make 'transportation' the offense. It proscribed the use of the mails for 'the purpose of sending or bringing into any State' unlawful dentures. The Act thereby hit two types of violators-the sender and the unlicensed dentist who brings in dentures from without. It is a reasonable and not a strained construction to read the statute to mean that the crime of the sender is complete when he uses the mails in Chicago, and the crime of the unlicensed dentist in California or Florida or Delaware, who orders the dentures from Chicago, is committed in the \n\n[323 \nU.S. 273, 278]\n\u00a0\n State into which he brings the dentures. As a result, the trial of the sender is restricted to Illinois and that of the unlicensed dentist to Delaware or Florida or California. The illicit sender in Chicago cannot be hauled for trial across the continent, and, conversely, the unlicensed dentist cannot be compelled to stand trial in Chicago.\n The large policy back of the constitutional safeguards counsels against the unrestricted construction for which the Government contends when Congress has not commanded it; and no considerations of expediency require it. Prosecutions of federal crimes are under the general supervision of the Attorney General of the United States; United States Attorneys do not exercise autonomous authority. The vindication of the Federal Denture Act therefore does not depend upon the willingness of some local United States Attorney to prosecute on behalf of a local victim. While it might facilitate the Government's prosecution in a case like this to have its witnesses near the place of trial, there must be balanced against the inconvenience of transporting the Government's witnesses to trial at the place of the sender the serious hardship of defending prosecutions in places remote from home (including the accused's difficulties, financial and otherwise, see R.S.  878, 28 U.S.C.  656, 28 U.S.C.A.  656, of marshalling his witnesses), as well as the temptation to abuses, already referred to, in the administration of criminal justice. Inasmuch as the statute permits and does not forbid this construction, the judgment below should be affirmed.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY, concurring.\n I join in the opinion of the Court and believe that the judgment should be affirmed.\n Congress has the constitutional power to fix venue at any place where a crime occurs. Our problem here is to \n\n[323 \nU.S. 273, 279]\n\u00a0\n determine, in the absence of a specific venue provision, where the crime outlawed by the Federal Denture Act occurred for purposes of venue.\n The Act prohibits the use of the mails for the purpose of sending or bringing into any state certain prohibited articles. It is undisputed that when a defendant places a prohibited article in the mails in Illinois for the purpose of sending it into Delaware he has completed a statutory offense. Hence he is triable in Illinois. But to hold that the statutory crime also encompasses the receipt of the prohibited article in Delaware, justifying a trial at that point, requires an implication that I am unwilling to make in the absence of more explicit Congressional language.\n Very often the difference between liberty and imprisonment in cases where the direct evidence offered by the government and the defendant is evenly balanced depends upon the presence of character witnesses. The defendant is more likely to obtain their presence in the district of his residence, which in this instance is usually the place where the prohibited article is mailed. The inconvenience, expense and loss of time involved in transplanting these witnesses to testify in trials far removed from their homes are often too great to warrant their use. Moreover, they are likely to lose much of their effectiveness before a distant jury that knows nothing of their reputations. Such factors make it difficult for me to conclude, where Congress has not said so specifically, that we should construe the Federal Denture Act as covering more than the first sufficient and punishable use of the mails insofar as the sender of a prohibited article is concerned. The principle of narrow construction of criminal statutes does not warrant interpreting the 'use' of the mails to cover all possible uses in light of the foregoing considerations. \n\n[323 \nU.S. 273, 280]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice REED, dissenting.\n The statute under consideration condemns the 'use' of 'the mails or any instrumentality of interstate commerce for the purpose of sending or bringing into any State or Territory' any denture which has been made without compliance with the laws of that State or Territory, relating to the furnishing of such appliances. The Court narrowly interprets the term 'use' to condemn as criminal only the first use of the mails; in this way the Court restricts venue for prosecution to Illinois for trial of an offender who mails a denture in Illinois which is subsequently delivered through 'use' of the mails in Delaware. We think, however, that the statute condemns and makes criminal any use of the mails for the prohibited purpose. Under this interpretation the respondents' use of the mails is punishable in Delaware and the dismissal of the information in this case should be reversed.\n The venue of a crime may be fixed at any place where the acts denounced as crimes occur. \n1\n There is no disagreement as to this rule of law. The Court reaches its conclusion upon venue under the Federal Denture Act not upon any compulsion of Constitution or statute but because a restriction of the venue to the place of mailing seemed to it more consonant with the underlying purposes of the Constitutional provisions as to venue. These purposes are thought, as the Court expresses it, to include a trial in an environment which is not alien to the accused.\n We think the Court misapprehends the purpose of the Constitutional provisions. We understand them to as- \n\n[323 \nU.S. 273, 281]\n\u00a0\n sure a trial in the place where the crime is committed and not to be concerned with the domicile of the criminal nor with his familiarity with the environment of the place of trial. Haas v. Henkel, \n216 \nU.S. 462\n, 30 S. Ct. 249, 17 Ann.Cas. 1112. Indeed in the present information nothing appears as to residence or domicile of the accused or as to their place of business.\n Congress by its specification of the precise acts denounced as crimes fixes venue at the place where those acts are committed. Our inquiry, then, must be directed to a determination of what constitutes the crime denounced by the Denture Act. The statute condemns as unlawful the 'use' of the 'mails or any instrumentality of interstate commerce for the purpose of sending or bringing into any State' the prohibited dentures. It is not the deposit of the article or its delivery which is forbidden but the use of the transportation facilities. The sending or bringing of the dentures is not denounced as a substantive crime apart from the use of mails or instrumentalities to accomplish the purpose. The crime consists of the use of the mails to send a prohibited denture 'into' or bring it 'into' another state. The language leads us to the conclusion that a use for the prohibited purpose occurs at whatever place the proscribed denture is handled by the mails or an instrumentality of commerce.\n The 'use' for the 'purpose' results in a continuous offense. \n2\n Since the offense is committed wherever the mails or the instrumentalities of interstate commerce are used for the purpose of sending or bringing the denture into a state contrary to the statute and the act has no provision otherwise limiting the place of trial, the venue is at what- \n\n[323 \nU.S. 273, 282]\n\u00a0\n ever place these acts are committed. One of the places in the present case is Delaware 'into' which the dentures were brought by appellees' use of the mails in that state. \n3\n If this analysis is correct, there was no occasion for Congress to follow the suggestion as to venue of the Postmaster General to which the Court refers.\n The title of the act indicates that it is directed at practices thought to lead to dental disorders and 'to prevent the circumvention of certain State or Territorial laws regulating the practice of dentistry.' 56 Stat. 1087. These state laws regulated the fabrication of prosthetic dental appliances. From the hearings4 it is clear that the purpose of Congress was to protect the public against the evils of ill-fitting dental appliances by restricting interstate commerce to dental appliances which were approved by licensed practitioners of the state into which the appliances were brought. Such was declared to be its purpose by the report of the Senate Committee. S.Rep. No. 1779, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 1. As the injury would occur normally at the place of delivery and as the act is designed to protect only those states which have laws regulating the furnishing of appliances by unlicensed practitioners, Congress would naturally enact legislation which might punish violations in the state of delivery. \n\n[323 \nU.S. 273, 283]\n\u00a0\n The prosecuting officers of that state would be most interested in enforcement and would best understand the scope of the laws of the state of delivery. Congress would not wish to leave immune shipments from foreign countries. Cf. United States v.

LAUDANI(1944)\nNo. 71\nArgued: Decided: January 3, 1944\n\n\n\n Mr. Chester T. Lane, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Harold Simandl, of Newark, N.J., for respondent. \n\n[320 \nU.S. 543, 544]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Indictments returned in a United States District Court in New Jersey charged that the respondent Laudani, while acting as a company foreman with authority to employ and discharge workers on a public works project financed in part by the United States, had contrary to Section 1 of an Act of June 13, 1943,1 forced certain of his subordinates to give him part of their wages in order to keep their jobs. Laudani moved to quash assigning as one ground that the indictments failed to charge conduct prohibited by this Act since they did not contain allegations that he was the employer of the coerced men or that he had acted as agent of the employer in forcing the payments. The gist of his contention was that the prohibition of the Act extends only to employers and persons who act in concert with them. The District Court concluded that the Act applied to a foreman such as Laudani, overruled his motion, and a jury convicted him. The Circuit Court of Appeals accepted Laudani's contention, reversed the judgment, and directed that the indictments be quashed. 134 F.2d 847. The public importance of the question presented prompted us to grant certiorari.\n Both the language and history of the Kickback Act argue against the conclusion that Congress intended its prohibition to apply only to employers and not to foremen who exercise many of the powers of employers. The Act \n\n[320 \nU.S. 543, 545]\n\u00a0\n punishes 'whoever' shall induce any person employed on a federally financed work 'to give up any part of the compensation to which he is entitled under his contract of employment' by force, intimidation, threat of procuring dismissal from such employment, or by any other manner whatsoever.' \n2\n The sweep of the word 'whoever', if that word stood alone, would be wide enough to include not only an employer but any other person. And the coercive methods of inducement expressly prohibited by the Act are methods in which at least some persons other than employers could engage without legal cause or excuse.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals pointed out, however, that if the word 'whoever' be given its broadest scope the Act might include common blackmailers who have no relationship to their victims' employment. In an effort to avoid what it considered to be such an extreme application of the Act, the Court focused attention on the clause 'to give up any part of the compensation to which he is entitled under his contract of employment.' Viewing this clause as proof that the purpose of Congress was to protect the employees' contractual rights to receive wages from their employer, the Court reasoned that no one but the employer or one acting on his behalf possessed 'the requisite privity of contract' with the employees to be capable of impairing these rights. Having thus emphasized the Congressional reference to a 'contract of employment', the Court stated broadly that, 'What happens to the compensation after the employee has received it in full, and wholly without relation to or effect upon his contract of employment, is a matter with which this statute does not purport to deal.' (134 F.2d 849, 850.)\n The Court's statement might have been pertinent had the indictments here been against a common blackmailer, extortioner, or some other person not alleged to have been \n\n[320 \nU.S. 543, 546]\n\u00a0\n vested by the employer with power to fix and terminate the employer- employee status. But we think that the coerced surrender of wages by employees at the instance of a company foreman given authority by his employer to hire and discharge them cannot properly be said to bear no relation to or have no effect upon their contracts of employment, especially where, as here alleged, the surrender of wages was induced by the foreman's express threat to dismiss all employees who did not comply with his demand. Execution of such a threat against employees unwilling to pay would immediately and completely have terminated their employment contracts. We find nothing in the Act which suggests that, under these circumstances, a foreman must be deemed incapable of violating its provisions merely because he may not stand in that relationship to employees which the Circuit Court characterized as 'privity of contract.'\n The purpose of the Act under consideration is to extend protection not merely to the legal form of employment contracts but to the substantive rights of workers actually to receive the benefit of the wage schedules which Congress has provided for them. The evil aimed at was the wrongful deprivation of full work payments. The Act was adopted near the bottom of a great business depression as one part of a broad Congressional program the goal of which was to strengthen the domestic economy by increasing the purchasing power of the nation's consumers. To this end, Congress enacted legislation designed to relieve widespread unemployment and enable working people to earn just and reasonable wages. A large program for federal financing of public works was established,3 and legislation was passed requiring gov- \n\n[320 \nU.S. 543, 547]\n\u00a0\n ernment contractors to pay certain minimum wage rates. \n4\n It was the purpose of the Kickback Act to assure that the federal funds thus provided for workers should actually be received by them for their own use except where diverted under authority of law or a worker's voluntary agreement. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n In view of this background, we cannot hold that Congress intended to exclude from the Act's proscription a foreman with the authority Laudani is alleged to have possessed. Foremen vested with full power to employ and discharge subordinates could frustrate the objective of the Act just as effectively as could their employers, and foremen not given such broad powers might nevertheless be able to use their authority to accomplish the same result. That foremen not only could but might do this very thing was testified at Senate hearings when the \n\n[320 \nU.S. 543, 548]\n\u00a0\n problem of 'kickbacks' was under study. \n6\n And the members of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary reporting the bill used language broad enough to include foremen among others when they said that hearings had revealed, 'that large sums of money have been extracted from the pockets of American labor, to enrich contractors, subcontractors, and their officials.' \n7\n\u00a0\n\n To hold that a company foreman vested with sufficient power substantially to affect his subordinates' contracts of employment is within the Act's proscription is not to hold that the Act applies to every extortioner, blackmailer, or other person who extracts money from one who has previously received it for labor on a federally financed project. We need not, at this time, attempt to delineate the outside scope of the Act's applications. But the purpose of the legislation, no less than its language, shows that the power to employ and discharge brings an employing company's foreman within its prohibition.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and the cause is remanded to that court for consideration and disposition of other questions not here involved.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This Act is commonly known as the 'Kickback' Act.

United \n\n[322 \nU.S. 65, 66]\n\u00a0\n States, \n318 \nU.S. 332\n, 63 S.Ct. 608. In view of the importance to federal criminal justice of proper application of the McNabb doctrine, we brought the case here. \n321 \nU.S. 756\n, 64 S.Ct. 485.\n Practically the whole body of the law of evidence governing criminal trials in the federal courts has been judge-made. See United States v. Reid, 12 How. 361, and Funk v. United States, \n290 \nU.S. 371\n, 54 S.Ct. 212, 93 A.L.R. 1136. Naturally these evidentiary rules have not remained unchanged. They have adapted themselves to progressive notions of relevance in the pursuit of truth through adversary litigation, and have reflected dominant conceptions of standards appropriate for the effective and civilized administration of law. As this Court when making a new departure in this field took occasion to say a decade ago, 'The public policy of one generation may not, under changed conditions, be the public policy of another.' Funk v. United States, supra, 290 U.S. at page 381, 54 S.Ct. at page 215, 93 A.L.R. 1136. The McNabb decision was merely another expression of this historic tradition, whereby rules of evidence for criminal trials in the federal courts are made a part of living law and not treated as a mere collection of wooden rules in a game.\n That case respected the policy underlying enactments of Congress as well as that of a massive body of state legislation which, whatever may be the minor variations of language, require that arresting officers shall with reasonable promptness bring arrested persons before a committing authority. Such legislation, we said in the McNabb case, 'constitutes an important safeguard-not only in assuring protection for the innocent but also in securing conviction of the guilty by methods that commend themselves to a progressive and self-confident society. For this procedural requirement checks resort to those reprehensible practices known as the 'third degree' which, though universally rejected as indefensible, still find their way into use. It aims to avoid all the evil im- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 65, 67]\n\u00a0\n plications of secret interrogation of persons accused of crime. It reflects not a sentimental but a sturdy view of law enforcement. It outlaws easy but self-defeating ways in which brutality is substituted for brains as an instrument of crime detection. A statute carrying such purposes is expressive of a general legislative policy to which courts should not be heedless when appropriate situations call for its application.' 318 U.S. at page 344, 63 S.Ct. at page 614.\n In the circumstances of the McNabb case we found such an appropriate situation, in that the defendants were illegally detained under aggravating circumstances: one of them was subjected to unremitting questioning by half a dozen police officers for five or six hours and the other two for two days. We held that 'a conviction resting on evidence secured through such a flagrant disregard of the procedure which Congress has commanded cannot be allowed to stand without making the courts themselves accomplices in wilful disobedience of law. Congress has not explicitly forbidden the use of evidence so procured. But to permit such evidence to be made the basis of a conviction in the federal courts would stultify the policy which Congress has enacted into law.' 318 U.S. at page 345, 63 S.Ct. at page 615. For like reasons it was held in the Nardone case that where wiretapping is prohibited by Congress the fruits of illegal wiretapping constitute illicit evidence and are therefore inadmissible. Nardone v. United States, \n302 \nU.S. 379\n, 58 S.Ct. 275; Id., \n308 \nU.S. 338\n, 60 S.Ct. 266. Inexcusable detention for the purpose of illegally extracting evidence from an accused, and the successful extraction of such inculpatory statements by continuous questioning for many hours under psychological pressure, were the decisive features in the McNabb case which led us to rule that a conviction on such evidence could not stand.\n We are dealing with the admissibility of evidence in criminal trials in the federal courts. Review by this \n\n[322 \nU.S. 65, 68]\n\u00a0\n Court of state convictions presents a very different situation, confined as it is within very narrow limits. Our sole authority is to ascertain whether that which a state court permitted violated the basic safeguards of the Fourteenth Amendment. Therefore, in cases coming from the state courts in matters of this sort, we are concerned solely with determining whether a confession is the result of torture, physical or psychological, and not the offspring of reasoned choice. How difficult and often elusive an inquiry this implies, our decisions make manifest. And for the important relation between illegal incommunicado detention and 'third- degree' practices, see IV, Report, National Commission on Law Observance and Enforcement (better known as the Wickersham Commission) (1931) pp. 4, 35 et seq., 152; and the debates in the House of Commons on the Savidge case, 217 H.C. Deb. (5th ser. 1928) pp. 1216-1220, 1303-1339, 1921-1931, and Inquiry in Regard to the Interrogation by the Police of Miss Savidge, Cmd. 3147 (1928); Report of the Royal Commission on Police Powers and Procedure, Cmd. 3297 (1929). But under the duty of formulating rules of evidence for federal prosecutions, we are not confined to the constitutional question of ascertaining when a confession comes of a free choice and when it is extorted by force, however subtly applied. See United States v. Oppenheimer, \n242 \nU.S. 85, 88\n, 37 S.Ct. 68, 69, 3 L.R.A. 516. The McNabb decision was an exercise of our duty to formulate policy appropriate for criminal trials in the federal courts. We adhere to that decision and to the views on which it was based. For cases in which applications of the McNabb doctrine by circuit courts of appeals were left unchallenged by the Government, see United States v. Haupt, 7 Cir., 136 F.2d 661; Gros v. United States, 9 Cir., 136 F.2d 878; Runnels v. United States, 9 Cir., 138 F.2d 346. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 65, 69]\n\u00a0\n But the foundations for application of the McNabb doctrine are here totally lacking. Unlike the situation in other countries, see, for instance,  25 and 26 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872,1 under the prevailing American criminal procedure, as was pointed out in the McNabb case, 'The mere fact that a confession was made while in the custody of the police does not render in inadmissible.' 318 U.S. at page 346, 63 S.Ct. at page 615. Under the circumstances of this case, the trial courts were quite right in admitting, for the juries' judgment, the testimony relating to Mitchell's oral confessions as well as the property recovered as a result of his consent to a search of his home. As the issues come before us the facts are not in dispute and are quickly told.\n In August and early October 1942, two houses in the District of Columbia were broken into and from each property was stolen. The trail of police investigation led to Mitchell who was taken into custody at his home at 7 o'clock in the evening on Monday, October 12, 1942, and driven by two police officers to the precinct station. Within a few minutes of his arrival at the police station, Mitchell admitted guilt, told the officers of various items of stolen property to be found in his home and consented to their going to his home to recover the property. \n2\n It is \n\n[322 \nU.S. 65, 70]\n\u00a0\n these admissions and that property which supported the convictions, and which were deemed by the court below to have been inadmissible. Obviously the circumstances of disclosure by Mitchell are wholly different from those which brought about the disclosures by the McNabbs. Here there was no disclosure induced by illegal detention, no evidence was obtained in violation of any legal rights, but instead the consent to a search of his home, the prompt acknowledgment by an accused of his guilt, and the subsequent rueing apparently of such spontaneous cooperation and concession of guilt.\n But the circumstances of legality attending the making of these oral statements are nullified, it is suggested, by what followed. For not until eight days after the statements were made was Mitchell arraigned before a committing magistrate. Undoubtedly his detention during this period was illegal. The police explanation of this illegality is that Mitchell was kept in such custody without protest through a desire to aid the police in clearing up thirty housebreakings, the booty from which was found in his home. Illegality is illegality, and officers of the law should deem themselves special guardians of the law. But in any event, the illegality of Mitchell's detention does not retroactively change the circumstances under which he made the disclosures. These, we have seen, were not elicited through illegality. Their admission, therefore, would not be use by the Government of the fruits of wrongdoing by its officers. Being relevant, they could be excluded only as a punitive measure against unrelated wrongdoing by the police. Our duty in shaping rules of evidence relates to the propriety of admitting evidence. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 65, 71]\n\u00a0\n This power is not to be used as an indirect mode of disciplining misconduct.\n Judgment reversed.\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice RUTLEDGE concur in the result.\n Mr. Justice BLACK dissents.\n\n Mr. Justice REED.\n As I understand McNabb v. United States, \n318 \nU.S. 332\n, 63 S.Ct. 608, as explained by the Court's opinion of today, the McNabb rule is that where there has been illegal detention of a prisoner, joined with other circumstances which are deemed by this Court to be contrary to proper conduct of Federal prosecutions, the confession will not be admitted. Further, this refusal of admission is required even though the detention plus the conduct do not together amount to duress or coercion. If the above understanding is correct, it is for me a desirable modification of the McNabb case.\n However, even as explained I do not agree that the rule works a wise change in Federal procedure.\n In my view detention without commitment is only on factor for consideration in raching a conclusion as to whether or not a confession is voluntary. The juristic theory under which a confession should be admitted or barred is bottomed on the testimonial trustworthiness of the confession. If the confession is freely made without inducement or menace, it is admissible. If otherwise made, it is not, for if brought about by false promises or real threats, it has no weight as proper proof of guilt. Ziang Sung Wan v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 1, 14\n, 45 S.Ct. 1, 3; Wilson v. United States, \n162 \nU.S. 613, 622\n, 16 S.Ct. 895, 899; 3 Wigmore Evidence, 1940 Ed.,  882.\n As the present record shows no evidence of such coercion, I concur in the result. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n]  25: 'No confession made to a Police officer, shall be proved as against a person accused of any offence.'\n  26: 'No confession made by any person whilst he is in the custody of a Police officer, unless it be made in the immediate presence of a Magistrate, shall be proved as against such person.' \n[\nFootnote 2\n] In both cases Mitchell denied the testimony of the officers that he had in fact made prompt and spontaneous confession and consent to the search of his home, and on the basis of such denial motions were made to exclude the evidence. The trial judges ruled that whether these statements were in fact made in the circumstances narrated were questions of fact for the juries. As such they were left to the juries, and we here accept their verdict as did the court below. Mitchell, it must be emphasized, merely denied that he made these statements and so did not contest the time of making them. While at the trial there was a claim by Mitchell that he was abused by the police officers, in the state of the record that issue is not here. \n\n\n\n\n","126":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v. MYERS(1944)\nNo. 142\nArgued: Decided: January 3, 1944\n\n\n\n As Amended on Petition for Clarification of Opinion Feb. 28, 1944. \n\n[320 \nU.S. 561, 562]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Francis M. Shea, Asst. Atty. Gen., for petitioner.\n Mr. Robert M. Drysdale, of Detroit, Mich., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These five suits were filed in the Court of Claims by respondents, who are customs inspectors stationed at the Port of Detroit. \n1\n They have been selected as test cases from a larger number of similar suits. No significant difference in the claims as to services rendered or otherwise is pointed out to us, and we see none. Even the periods for which recovery is sought, September 1, 1931, through August 31, 1937, are identical. We shall therefore state the issues and explain our conclusion in terms of the Myers case only, and its determination requires a like result in the other cases.\n The precise issue is whether or not the provisions of Section 5 of the Act of February 13, 1911, as amended,2 and Sections 401, \n\n[320 \nU.S. 561, 563]\n\u00a0\n 450 and 451 of the Tariff Act of 1930,3 entitle Mr. Myers to extra compensation over and above his regular salary as customs inspector for night, Sunday and holiday serv- \n\n[320 \nU.S. 561, 564]\n\u00a0\n ices performed during the stated period. Its solution depends upon whether or not, when Section 5 speaks of 'overtime services,' it includes, first, any authorized service rendered \n\n[320 \nU.S. 561, 565]\n\u00a0\n between 5 o'clock P.M. and 8'clock A.M., without regard to whether this service is within the regular hours of his assignment to duty, and, second, Sundays and holidays without regard to the tim of day when the authorized services are performed. The Court of Claims entered judgment for claimant for both nighttime and Sunday and holiday services. 99 Ct.Cl. 158.\n As the difficulties of applying the statute continually arise at any port where the normal working hours of the customs employees named in the section are not limited to 8 A.M. to 5 P.M. with Sundays and holidays off, we granted certiorari to review the judgment of the Court of Claims. \n320 \nU.S. 722\n, 64 S.Ct. 45. We think the judgment should be reversed as to nighttime services and affirmed as to Sunday and holiday services.\n The Port of Detroit possesses a wide variety of transportation facilities which connect it with Canada and which require customs inspection of merchandise, baggage and passengers. \n4\n Evidently a rotation of assignments of posts and hours among inspectors at Detroit was carried out by the collector. Mr. Myers had either night or Sunday and holiday service or both at all the various posts of duty which are listed in the note. He was paid his annual salary throughout the period. This was a base pay of $2,100, subject to additions and subtractions which were generally applicable to government employees. \n5\n The claim is for service performed at night- \n\n[320 \nU.S. 561, 566]\n\u00a0\n time6 on weekdays, Sundays and holidays, and in daytime on Sundays and holidays.\n At the threshold the Government urges that the statutes heretofore quoted do not create an obligation on the part of the United States to pay the extra compensation which is sought. A carrier may procure customs service at night only by special license, and the statutes say the extra compensation shall be paid 'by the licensee' to the collector of customs who shall pay the same 'to the inspectors.' \n7\n As the extra compensation here sued for was not collected in whole or part from the carriers concerned, it is urged that the United States is not liable to the plaintiff. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n The legislative history shows that the proponents of extra compensation constantly made the point that the Government would not be out of pocket by the legislation. \n9\n Where the United States stood as a protector of Indians with statutory authority, carefully marked out by a series of enactments, to collect sums for the benefit of \n\n[320 \nU.S. 561, 567]\n\u00a0\n its dependents, we held that the Government's failure to collect did not give rise to a liability. Creek Nation v. United States, \n318 \nU.S. 629, 637\n, 639 S., 63 S.Ct. 784, 788, 789. In that case we said that authorization to collect did not create a mandatory duty, particularly where the Indians also might have sued. Likewise, under similar circumstances, we have determined that over-collection did not create liability for reimbursement. United States v. Algoma Lumber Co., \n305 \nU.S. 415, 418\n, 419 S., 423, 59 S.Ct. 267, 269, 271. But here the United States is neither protector nor agent. It is an employer who issues orders to the inspectors directing the performance of services. The work is done under the statutes. No inspector may 'receive any salary in connection with his services as such an official or employee from any source other than the Government of the United States.' Act of March 3, 1917, c. 163, 39 Stat. 1106, 5 U.S.C.A .  66. These payments are made by the licensees to the collector at rates fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury. This is extra compensation over and above the annual salary, not a payment from licensees. Section 451 requires a bond from the licensee to 'pay the compensation and expenses of the customs officers,' but the payment must be made to the collector under Section 5. These facts lead us to the view that the statutes create an obligation on the part of the United States to pay the inspectors such sums as they may earn under their provisions. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n[320 \nU.S. 561, 568]\n\u00a0\n We come then to an examination of the extent of the obligation under the several sections heretofore quoted in notes 2 and 3. From the earliest days, customs inspections have normally proceeded in daylight. By special license, the work of the customs might be performed at night. \n11\n Inspectors were on duty continuously and at first were paid on a per diem basis. \n12\n By the Act of March 3, 1873, R.S. Section 2871, the practice of licensees of paying extra compensation for nighttime service13 (between sunset and sunrise) was formalized by authorizing the collector to fix reasonable extra compensation and to collect and distribute it among the inspectors. The provisions of that section gradually were extended to additional employees and to different circumstances. 23 Stat. 53, 59; 34 Stat. 633. In 1911 further changes were made by an Act for lading and unlading vessels. 36 Stat. 901. Section 5 under examination here emerges there in nearly its present form. Extra compensation for nighttime services was continued and was authorized for the first time for Sundays and holidays. 14 The latest changes were made in \n\n[320 \nU.S. 561, 569]\n\u00a0\n Section 5 in 1920. 'Night' services became 'overtime' services. Sundays and holidays were placed at the beginning of the section in juxtaposition with 'hours' which were fixed at from 8 A.M. to 5 P.M. The last proviso vesting authority in the Collector of Customs to regulate the hours of employees 'so as to agree with prevailing working hours in said ports' was added. \n15\n The Tariff Act of 1922, Sections 401, 450 and 451, extended the provisions of Section 5 of the lading and unlading act so as to cover passengers and baggage arriving by vehicle. These sections as they now appear in the Tariff Act of 1930 are in note 3, supra.\n The Collector of Customs at Detroit, during the years in question, assigned inspectors to tours of duty of eight hours each day, which tours might be at any time within a twenty-four hour period. \n16\n The length of the weekly tour varied with the post and with the state of the federal legislation. The findings of the Court of Claims as to the actual results are set out in the note below. \n17\n In the \n\n[320 \nU.S. 561, 570]\n\u00a0\n administration of customs, regulations based on the sections of the Tariff Act of 1930 and Section 5 of the Act of 1911 were issued by the Treasury Department. Customs Reg- \n\n[320 \nU.S. 561, 571]\n\u00a0\n ulations 1931 and 1937. So far as here pertinent they are substantially alike. \n18\n\u00a0\n\n The legislative history of the various acts makes clear the intention of Congress to allow extra compensation only when there are overtime services in the sense of work hours in addition to the regular daily tour of duty without regard to the period within the twenty-four hours when the regular daily tour is performed. Congressman Moore \n\n[320 \nU.S. 561, 572]\n\u00a0\n explained the purpose as follows (Hearings on H.R. 9525, 61st Cong., 2d Sess. at p. 470):19\n'Mr. Fordney. The Compensation for night work would be more than twice the compensation for day work?\n\n'Mr. Moore. I think not, but so long as a man works in the daytime and then continues his work through the night, if the expense does not come out of the Government he should be paid double.'\n\n At the hearings, just prior to the 1920 amendment to Section 5, the understanding apparently was that extra compensation would begin only after a day's work of ten or eleven hours. The pay of an inspector was per diem and was paid for each day in the year. The Treasury Department wrote to the Chairman:\n'The department has under consideration a plan whereby boarding officers and inspectors of customs will be assigned to duty in eight-hour shifts and will not, therefore, be called upon to work overtime and no extra compensation paid to officers assigned to the night shift. In order to carry out such plan it will be necessary to secure additional appropriations, and pending the adoption of the plan it will, of course, be necessary to detail inspectors and other employees for night work.'20\n\n There are other references in the hearings to the use of the 'shift' system to secure twenty-four hour service without extra compensation. The legal basis for a collector's authority to assign inspectors in this way is the last proviso of Section 5, note 2, supra. It gives the collector authority in those ports where customary working hours are other than 8 A. M. to 5 P.M. to regulate the hours \n\n[320 \nU.S. 561, 573]\n\u00a0\n of inspectors so as to agree with prevailing working hours in the ports. In speaking of the provision after its adoption, an official of the Customs Inspectors Association said at a hearing on an immigration inspectors bill (Hearings on S.1504, S.1774 and S.2188, 67th Cong., 1st and 2d sess., p. 130): 'To meet the condition at New Orleans, where the hours of labor are from 7 o'clock a.m. to 4 o'clock p.m., this proviso at the end of the bill was put in allowing collectors to adjust the inspectors' hours to the customary working hours at ports where the practices are different. This proviso also applies to the Canadian border at places where traffic is continuous during the 24 hours, such being the 'customary working hours'-and the inspectors work in 8-hour shifts without overtime.' \n21\n\u00a0\n\n When we examine the language of Section 5, either without extrinsic aid or with the benefit of the historical and legislative background, we find convincing authority to support the Government's view as to the meaning of overtime. 'Overtime' as we pointed out above was substituted by the 1920 amendment of Section 5 for 'nighttime' services. The section requires employees to 'remain' on duty. The usual instance of the payment of extra compensation would be for work after 5 P.M. by an inspector who had previously worked full time. The Government is correct in its interpretation of the last proviso of Section 5 as permitting shifts in an inspector's regular hours of work. Night assignments are an old administrative practice. It is true that the proviso apparently was passed to meet a New Orleans situation but the language is general. It does not restrict the collector to minor variations in hours. We are led to the conclusion that overtime, as applied to week days, refers to hours longer than the daily limit of 8 A.M. to 5 P.M., nine hours with one \n\n[320 \nU.S. 561, 574]\n\u00a0\n hour for food and rest. Furthermore, these tours of duty under the proviso are movable within the twenty-four hour period in accordance with prevailing working hours and the requirements of the service.\n We do not see that International Ry. Co. v. Davidson, \n257 \nU.S. 506\n, 42 S.Ct. 179, 181, decides otherwise. That was a suit to enjoin the Collector from enforcing the license provisions of Section 5, note 2, supra, as to passengers and baggage, against an international bridge. These were held inapplicable to bridges. In speaking of Section 5, the opinion stated: 'This substituted section defines what shall be deemed overtime, how the rate of extra pay shall be fixed, and what the work is, for which extra compensation shall be paid.' It did not, however, interpret the statute or consider the proviso both of which we are called upon to do here. Contra, see Ferguson v. Port Huron & Sarnia Ferry Co., D. C., 13 F.2d 489, 492.\n As to Sundays and holidays, we construe the statute to require extra compensation for inspectors without regard to the hours of the day or whether such services are additional to a regular weekly tour of duty. Before Section 5 there was no authority to pay extra compensation for Sunday and holiday work. Revised Statutes, Section 2871, allowed extra pay for nighttime work only. Somewhat indirectly the Act of February 13, 1911, gave Sunday and holiday pay and the 1920 amendment made the right to that extra compensation clear by saying extra compensation shall be paid inspectors 'who may be required to remain on duty between the hours of five o'clock postmeridian and eight o'clock antemeridian, or on Sundays or holidays.' This language and the Customs Regulations, note 18, supra, give an employee who works regular hours weekdays in daytime extra pay for Sunday and holiday work. The statute covers also those who work outside the statutory normal hours. Logically, if Sundays and holidays were not to receive extra compensation, without regard to whether services on those days were over- \n\n[320 \nU.S. 561, 575]\n\u00a0\n time, there would have been no occasion to add Sundays and holidays to the overtime. Overtime would cover every situation.\n The proviso of Section 5 does not give the Collector of Customs authority to make assignments which deprive inspectors of this Sunday and holiday pay. It authorizes adjustments of hours but specifically forbids alteration of overtime pay. It is silent as to Sundays and holidays which leaves the earlier grant of extra compensation for those days in effect. Overtime pay is also applicable to Sundays and holidays when inspectors work longer than nine hours with one hour for food and rest. The rate of overtime extra compensation on Sundays and holidays is the same as the rate for weekdays. The administrative practice is uncertain. It does not support a contrary conclusion. The Government cites excerpts from testimony on amendatory bills, not here directly involved, which indicate the extra compensation is paid for Sundays and holidays. \n22\n Findings 5 and 6 of the Court of Claims, note 17, supra, show that extra compensation was paid at times for Sunday and holiday services. \n23\n\u00a0\n\n Two further contentions of the Government require consideration. It is said that Section 5 of the 1911 Act as \n\n[320 \nU.S. 561, 576]\n\u00a0\n amended does not apply to services rendered at a bridge or tunnel. This Court so held in 1922. International Ry. Co. v. Davidson, \n257 \nU.S. 506, 512\n, 42 S.Ct. 179, 181. At that time, the section's application was limited to 'vessel or other conveyance.' Since then Sections 401, 450 and 451 of the Tariff Act of 1922, 42 Stat. 858, 948, 954, and of the Tariff Act of 1930, note 3, supra, have expanded the instrumentalities to include every contrivance capable of being use as a means of transportation on land or water. \n24\n The difference in definition, we think, brings bridges and tunnels under the overtime pay requirements of Section 5.\n Finally the Government urges that in awarding compensation for 'overtime' services credit should be allowed to it for that part of the base pay received for such services. We think the Congressional intention to give extra compensation precludes such a claim. The inspectors in addition to their regular salaries for week days are entitled to the statutory additional pay for overtime, sundays and holdays.\n The judgment of the Court of Claims is reversed and the proceeding remanded to that Court for determination of the claim of the inspectors in accordance with this opinion.\n Reversed in part.\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE is of the opinion that the judgment should be reversed in its entirety and the suits dismissed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Federal Register, August 25, 1937; Code of Federal Regulations, Title 19, Customs Duties, Chap. 1, Bureau of Customs. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 41 Stat. 402, c. 61, 19 U.S.C.  267, 19 U.S.C.A.  267:\n'Sec. 5.

Before the opening of the Ambassador Bridge November 15, 1929, all customs inspectors at the port of Detroit were regularly assigned to eight-hour tours of duty, which might be any period of that length within the 24 hours of any day of the week, including Sundays and holidays. They did not receive for nighttime services performed on such tours weekdays, Sundays, or holidays, any excess pay, but they did receive excess pay for daytime service so performed on Sundays or holidays. The inspectors had an eight-hour day and a 56-hour week.\n\n'This practice, however, did not wholly prevail at the Michigan Central Railway, where for certain periods prior to November 15, 1929, excess pay was not allowed for daytime service on Sundays or holidays.\n\n'6. Upon the opening of the Ambassador Bridge November 15, 1929, there was a change in practice at the port of Detroit.\n\n'At the Detroit and Windsor Ferry, the Walkerville Ferry, the Detroit and Canada Tunnel, the Ambassador Bridge, and the freight yard of the Michigan Central Railway, the customs inspectors were given an eight-hour day and a 48-hour week. \n\n'Excess pay was discontinued for daytime service performed on Sundays or holidays, within the 48-hour week. No excess pay was given for nighttime service performed Sundays, holidays, or weekdays, within the 48- hour week.\n\n'At the Michigan Central Railway passenger station and the Wabash Railway and Pere Marquette Railway ferries, and the Grand Trunk Railway Slip Dock the hours continued as before, with an eight-hour day and a 56- hour week. Excess pay was continued at these last four places for daytime service performed on Sundays and holidays, even though within the 56-hour limit, but no excess pay was given for nighttime service there on Sundays, holidays, or weekdays, performed within the 56-hour period.\n\n'After March 3, 1931, the date of going into effect of the Saturday half-holiday for Federal employees, the hours of employment per week were reduced to 44 at the Detroit and Windsor Ferry, the Walkerville Ferry, the Detroit and Canada Tunnel, the Ambassador Bridge and the freight yard of the Michigan Central Railway, and to 52 hours per week at the passenger station of the Michigan Central Railway, at the Wabash Railway and Pere Marquette Railway ferries, and at the Grand Trunk Railway Slip Dock, with conditions of excess pay as before but within and based upon the new period of 44 hours. Pay in excess of their annual salaries was given to inspectors for time served in excess of 44 hours per week at the passenger station of the Michigan Central Railway, at the Wabash Railway and Pere Marquette Railway ferries and at the Grand Trunk Railway Slip Dock notwithstanding the 52-hour week.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] The references are to the 1937 editions:\n'Art. 1242.

Freund, of Washington, D.C., for appellant.\n Mr. Harry B. Miller, of Lexington, Ky., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These cases come here under the Criminal Appeals Act. The District Court sustained demurrers to indictments \n\n[322 \nU.S. 385, 386]\n\u00a0\n for conspiracies forbidden by  19 of the Criminal Code. \n1\n The section provides: 'If two or more persons conspire to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any citizen in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States, ...' they shall be punished.\n As the cases present identical questions it will suffice to state No. 716. The indictment charged that a general election was held November 3, 1942, in Harlan County, Kentucky, for the purpose of electing a Senator of the United States, at which election the defendants served as the duly qualified officers of election; that they conspired to injure and oppress divers citizens of the United States who were legally entitled to vote at the polling places where the defendants officiated, in the free exercise and enjoyment of the rights and privileges guaranteed to the citizens by the Constitution and laws of the United States, namely, the right and privilege to express by their votes their choice of a candidate for Senator and their right to have their expressions of choice given full value and effect by not having their votes impaired, lessened, diminished, diluted and destroyed by fictitious ballots fraudulently cast and counted, recorded, returned, and certified. The indictment charged that the defendants, pursuant to their plan, tore from the official ballot book and stub book furnished them, blank unvoted ballots and marked, forged, and voted the same for the candidate of a given party, opposing the candidate for whom the injured voters had voted, in order to deprive the latter of their rights to have their votes cast, counted, certified and recorded and given full value and effect; that the defendants inserted the false ballots they had so prepared into the ballot box, and returned them, together with the other ballots lawfully cast, so as to create a false and fictitious return respecting the votes lawfully cast. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 385, 387]\n\u00a0\n The appellees demurred to the indictment, as failing to state facts sufficient to constitute a crime against the United The demurrer attacked the indictment on other grounds raising questions which, if decided, would not be reviewable here under the Criminal Appeals Act, 18 U.S.C.A.  682. The District Court decided only that the indictment charged no offense against the laws of the United States. This ruling presents the question for decision.\n The appellees do not deny the power of Congress to punish the conspiracy described in the indictment. In the light of our decisions, they could not well advance such a contention. \n2\n The inquiry is whether the provision of  19 embraces a conspiracy by election officers to stuff a ballot box in an election at which a member of the Congress of the United States is to be elected.\n In United States v. Mosley, \n238 \nU.S. 383\n, 35 S.Ct. 904, 905, this court reversed a judgment sustaining a demurrer to an indictment which charged a conspiracy of election officers to render false returns by disregarding certain precinct returns and thus falsifying the count of the vote cast. After stating that  19 is constitutional and validly extends 'some protection, at least, to the right to vote for Members of Congress,' the court added: 'We regard it as equally unquestionable that the right to have one's vote counted is as open to protection by Congress as the right to put a ballot in a box.' The court then traced the history of  19 from its origin as one section of the Enforcement Act of May 31, 1870,3 which contained other sections more specifically aimed at election frauds, and the survival of  19 as a statute of the United States notwithstanding the repeal of those other sections. The conclusion was that  19 protected personal rights of a citizen including the right to cast his ballot, and held that to re- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 385, 388]\n\u00a0\n fuse to count and return the vote as cast was as much an infringement of that personal right as to exclude the voter from the polling place. The case affirms that the elector's right intended to be protected is not only that to cast his ballot but that to have it honestly counted.\n The decision was not reached without a strong dissent, which emphasized the probability that Congress did not intend to cover by  6 of the Act (now  19) the right to cast a ballot and to have it counted, but to deal with those rights in other sections of the act. And it was thought this view was strengthened by the repeal, February 8, 1894,4 of the sections which dealt with bribery and other election frauds, including  4, which, to some extent, overlapped  6, if the latter were construed to comprehend the right to cast a ballot and to have it counted. Notwithstanding that dissent, the Mosley case has stood as authority to the present time. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n The court below thought the present cases controlled by United States v. Bathgate, \n246 \nU.S. 220\n, 38 S.Ct. 269. That case involved an indictment charging persons with conspiring to deprive a candidate for office of rights secured to him by the Constitution and laws of the United States, in violation of  19, and to deprive other voters of their rights, by the bribery of voters who participated in an election at which members of Congress were candidates. This court affirmed a decision of the district court sustaining a demurrer to the indictment, and distinguished the Mosley case on several first, that, in the Enforcement Act, bribery of voters had been specifically made a criminal offense but the section so providing had been repealed; secondly, that the ground on which the Mosley case went \n\n[322 \nU.S. 385, 389]\n\u00a0\n was that the conspiracy there was directed at the personal right of the elector to cast his own vote and to have it honestly counted, a right not involved in the Bathgate case.\n If the voters' rights protected by  19 are those defined by the Mosley case, the frustration charged to have been intended by the defendants in the present cases violates them. For election officers knowingly to prepare false ballots, place them in the box, and return them, is certainly to prevent an honest count by the return board of the votes lawfully cast. The mathematical result may not be the same as would ensue throwing out or frustrating the count of votes lawfully cast. But the action pursuant to the conspiracy here charged constitutes the rendering of a return which, to some extent, falsifies the count of votes legally cast. We are unable to distinguish a conspiracy so to act from that which was held a violation of  19 in the Mosley case.\n It is urged that any attempted distinction between the conduct described in the Bathgate case and that referred to in the Mosley case is illogical and insubstantial; that bribery of voters as badly distorts the result of an election and as effectively denies a free and fair choice by the voters as does ballot box stuffing or refusal to return or count the ballots. Much is to be said for this view. The legislative history does not clearly disclose the Congressional purpose in the repeal of the other sections of the Enforcement Act, while leaving  6 (now  19) in force. Section 19 can hardly have been inadvertently left on the statute books. Perhaps Congress thought it had an application other than that given it by this court in the Mosley case. On the other hand, Congress may have intended the result this court reached in the Mosley decision. We think it unprofitable to speculate upon the matter for Congress has not spoken since the decisions in question were an- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 385, 390]\n\u00a0\n nounced, and the distinction taken by those decisions has stood for over a quarter of a century. Observance of that distinction places the instant case within the ruling in the Mosley case and outside that in the Bathgate case.\n Our conclusion is contrary to that of the court below and requires that the judgments be reversed.\n So ordered.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice BLACK and Mr. Justice REED concur, dissenting.\n The question is not whether stuffing of the ballot box should be punished. Kentucky has made that reprehensible practice a crime. See Ky. Rev.Stat.1942,  124.220; Commonwealth v. Anderson, 151 Ky. 537, 152 S.W. 552; Tackett v. Commonwealth, 285 Ky. 83, 146 S.W.2d 937. Cf. Ky.Rev.Stat. 1942,  124.180(8). And it is a crime under Kentucky law whether it occurs in an election for state officials or for United States Senator. Id.,  124.280(2). The question here is whether the general language of  19 of the Criminal Code should be construed to superimpose a federal crime on this state crime.\n Under  19 of the Enforcement Act of May 31, 1870, 16 Stat. 144, the stuffing of this ballot box would have been a federal offense. \n1\n That provision was a part of the compre- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 385, 391]\n\u00a0\n hensive 'reconstruction' legislation passed after the Civil War. It was repealed by the Act of February 8, 1894, 28 Stat. 36-an Act which was designed to restore control of election frauds to the States. The Committee Report (H.Rep.No. No. 18, 53d Cong., 1st Sess., p. 7) which sponsored the repeal stated:\n'Let every trace of the reconstruction measures be wiped from the statute books; let the States of this great Union understand that the elections are in their own hands, and if there be fraud, coercion, or force used they will be the first to feel it. Responding to a universal sentiment throughout the country for greater purity in elections many of our States have enacted laws to protect the voter and to purify the ballot. These, under the guidance of State officers, have worked efficiently, satisfactorily, and beneficently; and if these Federal statutes are repealed that sentiment will receive an impetus which, if the cause \n\n[322 \nU.S. 385, 392]\n\u00a0\n still exists, will carry such enactments in every State in the Union.'\n\n This Court now writes into the law what Congress struck out 50 years ago. The Court now restores federal control in a domain where Congress decided the States should have exclusive jurisdiction. I think if such an intrusion on historic states' rights is to be made, it should be done by the legislative branch of government. I cannot believe that Congress intended to preserve by the general language of  19 the same detailed federal controls over elections which were contained in the much despised 'reconstruction' legislation.\n The Court, of course, does not go quite that far. It recognizes that bribery of voters is not a federal offense. United States v. Bathgate, \n246 \nU.S. 220\n, 38 S.Ct. 269. But he who bribes voters and purchases their votes corrupts the electoral process and dilutes my vote as much as he who stuffs the allot box. If one is a federal crime under  19, I fail to see why the other is not also.\n Congress has ample power to legislate in this field and to protect the election of its members from fraud and corruption. United States v. Classic, \n313 \nU.S. 299\n, 61 S.Ct. 1031. I would leave to Congress any extension of federal control over elections. I would restrict  19 to those cases where a voter is deprived of his right to cast a ballot or to have his ballot counted. United States v. Mosley, \n238 \nU.S. 383\n, 35 S.Ct. 904. That is the 'right or privilege' the 'free exercise' of which is protected by  19. If it is said that that distinction is not a logical one, my answer is that it is nevertheless a practical one. Once we go beyond that point, logic would require us to construe  19 so as to make federal offenses out of all frauds which corrupt the electoral process, distort the count, or dilute the honest vote. The vast interests involved in that proposal emphasize the legislative quality of an expansive construction of  19. We should leave that expansion to Congress. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 385, 393]\n\u00a0\n That view is supported by another consideration. The double jeopardy provision of the Fifth Amendment does not bar a federal prosecution even though a conviction based on the same acts has been obtained under state law. Jerome v. United States, \n318 \nU.S. 101, 105\n, 63 S.Ct. 483, 486, and cases cited. Therefore when it is urged that Congress has created offenses which traditionally have been left for state action and which duplicate state crimes, we should be reluctant to expand the defined federal offenses 'beyond the clear requirements of the terms of the statute.' Id. I know of no situation where that principle could be more appropriately recognized than in the field of the elections where there is comprehensive state regulation. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 18 U.S.C.  51, 18 U.S.C.A.  51. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Ex parte Yarbrough, \n110 \nU.S. 651, 657\n, 658 S., 661, 663, 4 S.Ct. 152, 154, 155, 157, 158; United States v.

Eckert, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought in the Court of Claims to recover an overpayment of income taxes made by respondent. The United States conceded that the amount claimed was owed. But the Comptroller General, pursuant to his power under  305 of the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, 42 Stat. 20, 31 U.S.C.  71, 31 U.S.C.A.  71, settled and adjusted the claim by offsetting against it an amount which he concluded respondent owed the United States under a contract. Since the latter claim equalled the overassessment on the income taxes, the Comptroller General refused to authorize a refund to respondent. This suit followed. The Court of Claims denied the offset and entered judgment for respondent in the amount claimed with interest. 53 F.Supp. 717. The case is here on a petition for a writ of certiorari1 which we \n\n[323 \nU.S. 106, 108]\n\u00a0\n granted because of an asserted conflict of the decision below with United States v. American Packing & Provision Co., 10 Cir., 122 F.2d 445 and United States v. Kansas Flour Corp., \n314 \nU.S. 212\n, 62 S.Ct. 232.\n The contract under which the claim against respondent was asserted was made in November, 1935. Respondent agreed to supply rice to the Navy Department at the bid prices specified in the contract. A typical price provision listed 290,000 pounds of rice at a unit price (per pound) of . 046\u00f5 or a total price of $13,340. The contract contained the following provision:\n'Prices bid herein include any federal tax heretofore imposed by the Congress which is applicable to the material on this bid. Any sales tax, duties, imposts, revenues, excise or other taxes which may hereafter (the date set for the opening of this bid) be imposed by the Congress and made applicable to the material on this bid will be charged to the Government and entered on invoices as a separate item.'\n\n Respondent made the required deliveries to the United States and received the full price specified in the contract. Respondent was the first domestic processor of the rice and accordingly paid the processing taxes imposed by the Agricultural Adjustment Act, 48 Stat. 31, 7 U.S.C.  609, 611, 7 U.S.C.A.  609, 611, from April 1, 1935, until September 20, 1935. Before paying the processing tax on the rice processed for the month of October, 1935, respondent obtained an injunction against its collection. The tax was held invalid in United States v. Butler, \n297 \nU.S. 1\n, 56 S.Ct. 312, 102 A.L.R. 914, decided January 6, 1936. Consequently respondent never paid the processing taxes on the rice supplied to the United States under the November, 1935, contract. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[323 \nU.S. 106, 109]\n\u00a0\n The tax was a federal tax 'applicable' to the rice within the meaning of the contract. United States v. Glenn L. Martin Co., \n308 \nU.S. 62, 65\n, 60 S.Ct. 32, 34, 124 A.L.R. 1017. Its amount was known, and the vendor was responsible by regulation for its payment. United States v. Kansas Flour Mills Corp., supra, 314 U.S. page 214, 62 S.Ct. page 234. It is therefore arguable that the vendor fixed the bid price to provide a margin of profit after payment of those taxes for which it was responsible, that the price was designed to offset pro tanto the amount of the taxes, and that if they were not paid, the price should be reduced. That is the position taken by the United States and it relies on the following statement in United States v. Kansas Flour Mills Corp., supra, 314 U.S. pages 216, 217, 62 S.Ct. page 235: 'In the contracts in question, the Government did not buy for resale. Unless it received the tax it suffered a definite disadvantage. Its purpose, as shown by the contracts, was to balance the tax element in the price paid with the tax collected. The Government, which could not pass on the tax on resale, was thus protected, not against a fall in the market price but against a loss in its tax revenues.' But we were there only answering the argument that since the vendor did not undertake to pay the tax, the rule in private contracts should be followed and no readjustment of the price made where the tax was not paid. The difference between the cases was that in the latter situation the vendee presumably passed on the tax while the United States did not since it did not buy for resale. The vital fact in United States v. .kansas Flour Mills Corp. was the provision in the contract for an up-or-down revision of the price in \n\n[323 \nU.S. 106, 110]\n\u00a0\n case of a change in the processing tax by Congress. It provided that if a processing tax was thereafter 'imposed or changed by the Congress', the contract price was to be 'increased or decreased accordingly.' It was held that the decision in United States v. Butler and its recognition in the Revenue Act of 1936 amounted to a downward change calling for a decrease in the contract price. 314 U.S. page 217, 62 S.Ct. page 236. There is no such provision in the present contract. The clause that the bid prices includes 'any Federal tax heretofore imposed by the Congress which is applicable to the material' must be read in the context of this particular contract. When it is so read, a result different from that reached in United States v. Kansas Flour Mills Corp. is indicated.\n The present contract provides for payment by the United States of sales and other taxes thereafter imposed by Congress and made applicable to the rice. But while it makes that provision for upward readjustment of the price, it provides for no downward revision in case of subsequent changes in any tax. That silence gains added significance here in view of the fact that at the time the contract was made the payment of these processing taxes was being hotly contested and the litigation resulting in United States v. Butler, supra, was well under way. The inference is strong therefore that the parties intended the price to be firm, except as it might be increased through the imposition of new taxes. The provision for the inclusion of applicable taxes provides a formula for determining the price to be billed. Since the tax in question could not by the terms of the contract be billed to the United States, there was no overcharge. If the contractor lawfully avoids payment of a tax he reduces his cost and increases his profit. But in absence of a provision which authorizes it the reduction of cost is hardly the basis of a refund to the United States. As the Court of Claims points out, it is hard to see how the vendor could be re- \n\n[323 \nU.S. 106, 111]\n\u00a0\n quired to pay the United States any savings which it made as a result of reductions in tariff duties. Yet the difference between them and other taxes under this contract is not apparent. Although there will be exceptions, in general the United States as a contractor must be treated as other contractors under analogous situations. When problems of the interpretation of its contracts arise the law of contracts governs. Hollerbach v. United States, \n233 \nU.S. 165, 171\n, 172 S., 34 S.Ct. 553, 555; United States v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., \n315 \nU.S. 289, 298\n, 299 S., 62 S.Ct. 581, 586, 587. We will treat it like any other contractor and not revise the contract which it draws on the ground that a more prudent one might have been made. United States v. American Surety Co ., \n322 \nU.S. 96\n, 64 S.Ct. 866.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice BLACK dissents. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Act of February 13, 1925,  3(b), 43 Stat. 939, amended by the Act of May 22, 1939, 53 Stat. 752, 28 U.S.C.  288(b), 28 U.S.C.A.  288(b). \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Respondent did, however, pay an unjust enrichment tax of $72,072.30 on account of being relieved of the processing tax. See Title III of the Revenue Act of 1936, 49 Stat. 1648, 1734, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code,  700 et seq. It was computed and assessed upon the basis of inclusion of units involved in this suit. If those units had been excluded, the unjust enrichment tax would have been reduced by $1,706.59. If respondent is required to reduce its price by the amount of the unpaid processing tax, it is not subject to the unjust enrichment tax on these transactions. See United States v. Kansas Flour Mills Corp., supra, 314 U.S. page 216, note 6, 62 S.Ct. page 235. The United States concedes that if it prevails the respondent is entitled to recover $1,706.59. \n\n\n\n\n","129":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v. WHITE(1944)\nNo. 366\nArgued: March 6, 1944Decided: June 12, 1944\n\n\n\n\n[322 \nU.S. 694, 695]\n\u00a0\n Tom C. Clark, Asst. Atty. Gen., for petitioner.\n Mr. Robert J. Fitzsimmons, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n During the course of a grand jury investigation into alleged irregularities in the construction of the Mechanicsburg Naval Supply Depot, the District Court of the United States for the Middle District of Pennsylvania issued a subpoena duces tecum directed to 'Local No. 542, International Union of Operating Engineers.' This subpoena required the union to produce before the grand jury on January 11, 1943, copies of its constitution and by-laws and specifically enumerated union records showing its collections of work-permit fees, including the amounts paid therefor and the identity of the payors from January 1, 1942, to the date of the issuance of the subpoena, December 28, 1942\n\n\n The United States marshal served the subpoena on the president of the union. On January 11, 1943, respondent appeared before the grand jury, describing himself as 'assistant supervisor' of the union. Although he was not shown to be the authorized custodian of the union's books, he had the demanded documents in his possession. He \n\n[322 \nU.S. 694, 696]\n\u00a0\n had not been subpoenaed personally to testify nor personally directed by the subpoena duces tecum to produce the union's records. Moreover, there was no effort or indicated intention to examine him personally as a witness. Nevertheless he declined to produce the demanded documents 'upon the ground that they might tend to incriminate Local Union 542, International Union of Operating Engineers, myself as an officer thereof, or individually.' He reiterated his refusal after consulting counsel.\n He was immediately cited for contempt of court and during the hearing on the contempt repeated his refusal once again. He based his refusal on the opinion of his counsel that 'great uncertainty exists today as to what may or may not constitute a violation of Section 276(b), Title 40, of the United States Code (40 U.S.C.A.  276b).'1 He made no effort, although he apparently was willing, to tender the records for the judge's inspection in support of his assertion that their contents would tend to incriminate him or the union. The District Court held his refusal inexcusable, adjudged him guilty of contempt of court and sentenced him to thirty days in prison.\n The court below reversed the District Court's judgment by a divided vote. 3 Cir., 137 F.2d 24. The majority held that the records of an unincorporated labor union were the property of all its members and that, if respondent were a \n\n[322 \nU.S. 694, 697]\n\u00a0\n union member and if the books and records would have tended to incriminate him, he properly could refuse to produce them before the grand jury. The court below accordingly remanded the case to the District Court with directions to sustain the claim of privilege if after further inquiry it should determine that respondent was in fact a member of the union and that the documents would tend to incriminate him as an individual. We granted certiorari, \n320 \nU.S. 729\n, 64 S.Ct. 189, because of the novel and important question of constitutional law which is presented. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The only issue in this case relates to the nature and scope of the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination. We are not concerned here with a complete delineation of the legal status of unincorporated labor unions. We express no opinion as to the legality or desirability of incorporating such unions or as to the necessity of considering them as separate entities apart from their members for purposes other than the one posed by the narrow issue in this case. Nor do we question the obvious fact that business corporations, by virtue of their creation by the state and because of the nature and purpose of their activities, differ in many significant respects from unions, religious bodies, trade associations, social clubs and other types of organizations, and accordingly owe different obligations to the federal and state gov- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 694, 698]\n\u00a0\n ernments. Our attention is directed solely to the right of an officer of a union to claim the privilege against self-incrimination under the circumstances here presented.\n Respondent contends that an officer of an unincorporated labor union possesses a constitutional right to refuse to produce, in compliance with a subpoena duces tecum, records of the union which are in his custody and which might tend to incriminate him. He relies upon the 'unreasonable search and seizure' clause of the Fourth Amendment and the explicit guarantee of the Fifth Amendment that no person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself. We hold, however, that neither the Fourth nor the Fifth Amendment, both of which are directed primarily to the protection of individual and personal rights, requires the recognition of a privilege against self-incrimination under the circumstances of this case.\n The constitutional privilege against self-incrimination is essentially a personal one, applying only to natural individuals. It grows out of the high sentiment and regard of our jurisprudence for conducting criminal trials and investigatory proceedings upon a plane of dignity, humanity and impartiality. It is designed to prevent the use of legal process to force from the lips of the accused individual the evidence necessary to convict him or to force him to produce and authenticate any personal documents or effects that might incriminate him. Physical torture and other less violent but equally reprehensible modes of compelling the production of incriminating evidence are thereby avoided. The prosecutors are forced to search for independent evidence instead of relying upon proof extracted from individuals by force of law. The immediate and potential evils of compulsory self-disclosure transcend any difficulties that the exercise of the privilege may impose on society in the detection and prosecution of crime. While the privilege is subject to abuse and mis- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 694, 699]\n\u00a0\n use, it is firmly embedded in our constitutional and legal frameworks as a bulwark against iniquitous methods of prosecution. It protects the individual from any disclosure, in the form of oral testimony, documents or chattels, sought by legal process against him as a witness.\n Since the privilege against self-incrimination is a purely personal one, it cannot be utilized by or on behalf of any organization, such as a corporation. Hale v. Henkel, \n201 \nU.S. 43\n, 26 S.Ct. 370; Wilson v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 361\n, 31 S.Ct. 538, Ann.Cas. 1912D, 558; Essgee Co. v. United States, \n262 \nU.S. 151\n, 43 S.Ct. 514. See also United States v. Invader Oil Corp., D.C., 5 F.2d 715. Moreover, the papers and effects which the privilege protects must be the private property of the person claiming the privilege, or at least in his possession in a purely personal capacity. Boyd v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 616\n, 6 S.Ct. 524. But individuals, when acting as representatives of a collective group, cannot be said to be exercising their personal rights and duties nor to be entitled to their purely personal privileges. Rather they assume the rights, duties and privileges of the artificial entity or association of which they are agents or officers and they are bound by its obligations. In their official capacity, therefore, they have no privilege against self-incrimination. And the official records and documents of the organization that are held by them in a representative rather than in a personal capacity cannot be the subject of the personal privilege against self-incrimination, even though production of the papers might tend to incriminate them personally. Wilson v. United States, supra; Dreier v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 394\n, 31 S.Ct. 550; Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n221 \nU.S. 612\n, 31 S.Ct. 621; Wheeler v. United States, \n226 \nU.S. 478\n, 33 S.Ct. 158; Grant v. United States, \n227 \nU.S. 74\n, 33 S.Ct. 190; Essgee Co. v. United States, supra. Such records and papers are not the private records of the individual members or officers of the organization. Usually, if not always, they are open to inspection by the members and this right may be enforced on ap- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 694, 700]\n\u00a0\n propriate occasions by available legal procedures. See Guthrie v. Harkness, \n199 \nU.S. 148, 153\n, 26 S.Ct. 4, 5, 4 Ann.Cas. 433. They therefore embody no element of personal privacy and carry with them no claim of personal privilege.\n The reason underlying the restriction of this constitutional privilege to natural individuals acting in their own private capacity is clear. The scope and nature of the economic activities of incorporated and unincorporated organizations and their representatives demand that the constitutional power of the federal and state governments to regulate those activities be correspondingly effective. The greater portion of evidence of wrongdoing by an organization or its representatives is usually to be found in the official records and documents of that organization. Were the cloak of the privilege to be thrown around these impersonal records and documents, effective enforcement of many federal and state laws would be impossible. See Hale v. Henkel, supra, \n201 \nU.S. 70, 74\n, 26 S.Ct. 377, 379; 8 Wigmore on Evidence, 3rd Ed.,  2259a. The framers of the constitutional guarantee against compulsory self- disclosure, who were interested primarily in protecting individual civil liberties, cannot be said to have intended the privilege to be available to protect economic or other interests of such organizations so as to nullify appropriate governmental regulations.\n The fact that the state charters corporations and has visitorial powers over them provides a convenient vehicle for justification of governmental investigation of corporate books and records. Hale v. Henkel, supra; Wilson v. United States, supra. But the absence of that fact as to a particular type of organization does not lessen the public necessity for making reasonable regulations of its activities effective, nor does it confer upon such an organization the purely personal privilege against self-incrimination. Basically, the power to compel the production of the records of any organization, whether it be incor- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 694, 701]\n\u00a0\n porated or not, arises out of the inherent and necessary power of the federal and state governments to enforce their laws, with the privilege against self-incrimination being limited to its historic function of protecting only the natural individual from compulsory incrimination through his own testimony or personal records.\n It follows that labor unions, as well as their officers and agents acting in their official capacity, cannot invoke this personal privilege. This conclusion is not reached by any mechanical comparison of unions with corporations or with other entities nor by any determination of whether unions technically may be regarded as legal personalities for any or all purposes. The test, rather, is whether one can fairly say under all the circumstances that a particular type of organization has a character so impersonal in the scope of its membership and activities that it cannot be said to embody or represent the purely private or personal interests of its constituents, but rather to embody their common or group interests only. If so, the privilege cannot be invoked on behalf of the organization or its representatives in their official capacity. Labor unions-national or local, incorporated or unincorporated-clearly meet that test.\n Structurally and functionally, a labor union is an institution which involves more than the private or personal interests of its members. It represents organized, institutional activity as contrasted with wholly individual activity. This difference is as well defined as that existing between individual members of the union. The union's existence in fact, and for some purposes in law, is as perpetual as that of any corporation, not being dependent upon the life of any member. It normally operates under its own constitution, rules and by-laws which, in controversies between member and union, are often enforced by the courts. The union engages in a multitude of business and other official concerted activities, none of which \n\n[322 \nU.S. 694, 702]\n\u00a0\n can be said to be the private undertakings of the members. \n3\n Duly elected union officers have no authority to do or sanction anything other than that which the union may lawfully do; nor have they authority to act for the members in matters affecting only the individual rights of such members. The union owns separate real and personal property, even though the title may nominally be in the names of its members or trustees. \n4\n The official union books and records are distinct from the personal books and records of the individuals, in the same manner as the union treasury exists apart from the private and personal funds of the members. See United States v. B. Goedde & Co., D.C., 40 F.Supp. 523, 534. And no member or officer has the right to use them for criminal purposes or for his purely private affairs. The actions of one individual member no more bind the union than they bind another individual member unless there is proof that the union authorized or ratified the acts in question. At the same time, the members are not subject to either criminal or civil liability for the acts of the union or its officers as such unless it is shown that they personally authorized or participated in the particular acts. See Lawlor v. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 694, 703]\n\u00a0\n Loewe, \n235 \nU.S. 522\n, 35 S.Ct. 170; Eagle Glass & Mfg. Co. v. Rowe, \n245 \nU.S. 275\n, 38 S.Ct. 80.\n Moreover, this Court in United Mine Workers of America v. Coronado Coal Co., \n259 \nU.S. 344\n, 42 S.Ct. 570, 27 A.L.R. 762, held that labor unions might be made parties defendant in suits for damages under the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.A.  1-7, 15 note, by service of process on their officers.\n Both common law rules and legislative enactments have granted many substantive rights to labor unions as separate functioning institutions. In United Mine Workers of America v. Coronado Coal Co., supra, \n259 \nU.S. 385, 386\n, 42 S.Ct. 574, 27 A.L.R. 762, this Court pointed out that 'the growth and necessities of these great labor organizations have brought affirmative legal recognition of their existence and usefulness and provisions for their protection, which their members have found necessary. Their right to maintain strikes when they do not violate law or the rights of others, has been declared. The embezzlement of funds by their officers has been especially denounced as a crime. The so-called union label, which is a quasi trade-mark to indicate the origin of manufactured product in union labor, has been protected against pirating and deceptive use by the statutes of most of the states, and in many states authority to sue to enjoin its use has been conferred on unions. They have been given distinct and separate representation and the right to appear to represent union interests in statutory arbitrations, and before official labor boards.' Even greater substantive rights have been granted labor unions by federal and state legislation subsequent to the statutes enumerated in the opinion in that case. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n[322 \nU.S. 694, 704]\n\u00a0\n These various considerations compel the conclusion that respondent could not claim the personal privilege against self-incrimination under these circumstances. The subpoena duces tecum was directed to the union and demanded the production only of its official documents and records. Respondent could not claim the privilege on behalf of the union because the union did not itself possess such a privilege. Moreover, the privilege is personal to the individual called as a witness, making it impossible for him to set up the privilege of a third person as an excuse for a refusal to answer or to produce documents. Hence respondent could not rely upon any possible privilege that the union might have. Hale v. Henkel, supra, \n201 \nU.S. 69, 70\n, 26 S.Ct. 376, 377; McAlister v. Henkel, \n201 \nU.S. 90\n, 26 S.Ct. 385. Nor could respondent claim the privilege on behalf of himself as an officer of the union or as an individual. The documents he sought to place under the protective shield of the privilege were official union documents held by him in his capacity as a representative of the union. No valid claim was made that any part of them constituted his own private papers. He thus could not object that the union's books and records might incriminate him as an officer or as an individual.\n It is unnecessary to determine whether or not respondent was a member of the union in question, for in either event he could not invoke the privilege against self-incrimination under these facts. It is likewise immaterial whether the union was subject to the provisions of the statute in relation to which the grand jury was making \n\n[322 \nU.S. 694, 705]\n\u00a0\n its investigation. The exclusion of the union from the benefits of the purely personal privilege does not depend upon the nature of the particular investigation or proceeding. The union does not acquire the privilege by reason of the fact that it is not charged with a crime or that it may not be subject to liability under the statute in question. The union and its officers acting in their official capacity lack the privilege at all times of insulating the union's books and records against reasonable demands of governmental authorities.\n The judgment of the court below must be reversed and that of the District Court affirmed.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS, Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER and Mr. Justice JACKSON concur in the result. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This was a reference to the so-called 'Kickback' Act, which was before us in United States v. Laudani, \n329 \nU.S. 543\n, 64 S.Ct. 315, 149 A.L. R. 492. Section 1 of the Act provides that whoever shall induce any person employed in the construction, prosecution or completion of any public building or work financed in whole or in part by the United States, or in the repair thereof, to give up part of his compensation by force, intimidation, threat or procuring dismissal from employment, or by any other manner whatsoever shall be fined not more than $5,000, or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.

See Nye v. United States, \n313 \nU.S. 33, 43\n, 44 S., 61 S.Ct. 810, 813, 814. It appears, however, that at the contempt hearing an extensive colloquy took place between the district judge and counsel with respect to the perfecting of the appeal and respondent at that time made in effect an oral application for appeal which was allowed by the court within the meaning of the Act of February 13, 1925. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] In United Mine Workers of America v. Coronado Coal Co., \n259 \nU.S. 344, 385\n, 42 S.Ct. 570, 574, 27 A.L.R. 762, this Court described the union there involved in the following terms: 'The membership of the union has reached 450,000. The dues received from them for the national and district organizations make a very large annual total, and the obligations assumed in traveling expenses, holding of conventions, and general overhead cost, but most of all in strikes, are so heavy that an extensive financial business is carried on, money is borrowed, notes are given to banks, and in every way the union acts as a business entity, distinct from its members. No organized corporation has greater unity of action, and in none is more power centered in the governing executive bodies.' \n[\nFootnote 4\n] Lloyd, The Law Relating to Unincorporated Associations (1938) 165ff .; Wrightington, The Law of Unincorporated Associations (2d ed. 1923) 336ff. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Outstanding examples of federal legislation enacted subsequent to the Coronado case giving recognition to union personality are the National Labor Relations Act, 49 Stat. 449, 29 U.S.C.  151 et seq., 29 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq., the Railway Labor Act, 44 Stat. 577, 45 U.S.C.  151, 45 U.S. C.A.  151 et seq., and the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 47 Stat. 70, 29 U.S.C.  101, 29 U.S.C.A.  101 et seq.

GLOBE OIL & REFINING CO.(1944)\nNo. 392\nArgued: March 3, 1944Decided: May 29, 1944\n\n\n\n\n[322 \nU.S. 471, 472]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William D. Whitney, of New York City, and Charles M. Thomas, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Thorley von Holst and J. Bernhard Thiess, both of Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner sued the respondent for infringement of United States Patents No. 1,392,629, dated October 4, 1921, and No. 1,537,593, dated May 12, 1925. The former was issued to Carbon P. Dubbs; the latter, to Gustav Egloff. These patents cover the Dubbs process for converting heavy crude oils to lighter oils, especially gasoline. The claimed infringement arises from the respondent's use for the purpose of such conversion of the 'Winkler Koch process' in apparatus designed and installed by the Winkler Koch Engineering Company. The district court dismissed the bill on findings of fact to the effect that Patent No. 1,392,629 was valid but not infringed, and that Patent No. 1,537,593 was invalid, without findings on the issue of infringement. \n1\n The majority of the Circuit Court of Appeals found both patents not infringed and did not pass on their validity; Judge Lindley was of opinion that the Dubbs patent was infringed but that both patents were invalid. \n2\n The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit \n\n[322 \nU.S. 471, 473]\n\u00a0\n found the same patents to be valid and infringed by the use of a process substantially similar to respondent's in Root Refining Co. v. Universal Products Co., 3 Cir., 78 F.2d 991. To resolve the conflict thus presented we granted certiorari, \n320 \nU.S. 730\n, 64 S.Ct. 194.\n Where the questions presented by the contested claims of infringement and validity are purely factual, this Court ordinarily accepts the concurrent conclusions of the district court and Circuit Court of Appeals in these cases. Goodyear Co. v. Ray-O-Vac Co., \n321 \nU.S. 275\n, 64 S.Ct. 593. But in resolving conflicting views of two Circuit Courts of Appeals as to a single patent, we are obliged to undertake an independent reexamination of the factual questions. Sanitary Refrigerator Co. v. Winters, \n280 \nU.S. 30, 35\n, 36 S., 50 S.Ct. 9, 10.\n The patents and the allegedly infringing process concern commercial methods for converting petroleum, as it is found in nature, into the gasoline in everyday use as motor fuel. The experts who testified in the district court have stated some of the theoretical background of the processes used, and a brief summary of this material may facilitate understanding of the process involved.\n Layman and chemist alike are of course familiar with the conception of the atoms of 'chemical elements' as the basic building blocks of ordinary chemical compounds. \n3\n The atoms of the 'elements' have the capacity to combine with the atoms of other elements to form the molecules of 'chemical compounds,' whose properties seem to depend directly upon the nature of the molecule. In the field of oil chemistry, the outstanding fact is the extraordinary ability of carbon and hydrogen to combine with each other into molecules containing widely varying numbers of carbon atoms with different proportions of hydrogen atoms in an almost unlimited number of different \n\n[322 \nU.S. 471, 474]\n\u00a0\n structural arrangements. These combinations, generically termed hydrocarbons, are present in great variety in crude oil.\n The hydrocarbons differ widely from one another in their physical properties, particularly in the property of volatility, which is of prime importance in motor fuels. As one might expect, the hydrocarbons composed of large molecules with many carbon atoms are heavy, sluggish liquids with relatively high boiling points; they are not suitable for use as gasoline. Those with smaller molecules are much more volatile-indeed, the very smallest are gases at ordinary temperatures.\n The initial step in the preparation of gasoline from crude oil involves no molecular change; it consists merely in separating the light hydrocarbons in the natural mixture from the heavy hydrocarbons. This step is accomplished by heating the oil until it vaporizes and then carrying the vapors through a device familiar to industrial chemistry under the name of a fractionating tower. Such a tower is in effect a series of condensers in which the vapor mixture is cooled and the liquid condensate drawn off in separate steps. First the high boiling point constituents, reaching a liquid phase after relatively little cooling, are condensed and withdrawn; this process is repeated on the remaining constituents in successive steps as the vapors cool, until there remain only those low boiling point hydrocarbons suitable for use as gasoline.\n By fractional distillation alone, a typical sample of Mid-Continent crude oil might yield approximately 25% gasoline, 5-7% kerosene, 30% gas oil, and a balance of 38-40% fuel oil. The fraction remaining after the distillation of gasoline or gasoline and kerosene is termed 'topped crude.'\n For many years the commercial petroleum industry carried the production of gasoline from crude oil no farther than this initial step of separating it from the mixture. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 471, 475]\n\u00a0\n But with the introduction of the automobile, the demand for gasoline increased rapidly, and it became necessary to develop commercial apparatus for the conversion of heavy hydrocarbon molecules to light hydrocarbon molecules by the chemical process known as 'cracking.' \n4\n Chemists had long known that by heating the heavier hydrocarbons to temperatures of the order of 750-900 Fahrenheit, it was possible to decompose the heavy molecules into lighter molecules with fewer carbon atoms, with the maximum decomposition resulting from fairly prolonged application of heat. \n5\n The breakdown of the heavy molecules into lighter ones was accompanied, however, by a concurrent phenomenon-namely, the formation of even heavier hydrocarbons and the deposit of solid matter called 'coke' or 'carbon.' Likewise, at the temperatures used the oil boiled, and if the vapors were not released (and they could not be if heat was to be applied for a long period of time), high pressures developed in the still. And as the cracking operation yielded products of increasing volatility, this pressure would, apparently, rise as the reaction progressed.\n The engineering problems involved in the reduction of the laboratory knowledge of cracking to commercial practice were formidable, since the pressures and temperatures employed carried severe risks of fire and explosion. The first commercial process was introduced about 1913-the so- called Burton process. Burton heated the charge-gas oil-in a simple tank, or shell still. The tank was not continuously fed; a charge of 8250 gallons was pumped into it and brought to a temperature of 700-750 over a \n\n[322 \nU.S. 471, 476]\n\u00a0\n period of some 12 hours under autogenous gas pressure of 75 pounds. The cracking operation was then continued for 24 hours. The vapors liberated in the still were conducted through an inclined line to an aerial condenser, where the heavier and less volatile vapors were liquefied and drained back into the still through the same vapor line, there to be mixed with the unvaporized residue and subjected to further cracking. This first fraction of the vapors was called 'reflux condensate'; the unliquefied vapors were carried to a second condenser and liquefied as 'pressure distillate,' a liquid convertible by further refining operations not here relevant to commercial gasoline.\n The coke deposited during cracking tended to cause uneven heating of the shell still, with resultant formation of weak spots and danger of explosion. Consequently, it was necessary to shut down the still after about 24 hours of cracking to permit the coke to be cleaned out. The cleaning and pre-heating processes consumed about half the operating time; the gasoline yield ranged only about 25-28% of the gas oil charge; and the menace of explosion was serious. The Burton process was modified and improved somewhat in 1915 by the introduction of the Burton-Clark process, which differed in that it did not apply heat directly to the shell still, but instead circulated the oil in the still by convection through a separate heating coil. This improvement increased the yield to some 30-32%. The Burton-Clark process constituted the general industrial practice at the time of Dubbs' patent.\n Chemical engineers in the refining industry were engaged in continuous research looking to the solution of the coking problem and the development of a process which might operate continuously, without wasteful periodic shut-downs of expensive plant equipment. The processes in suit are among the results of their efforts.\n Dubbs Patent No. 1,392,629, the alleged infringement of which forms the basis of this action, covers a process first \n\n[322 \nU.S. 471, 477]\n\u00a0\n demonstrated in a pilot plant at Independence, Kansas, in 1919. The oil charge is fed through a nest of heated tubes-called 'B tubes'-about four inches in diameter-a heating process not unlike that used in Burton-Clark. The heated oil is then delivered to tubes of about ten inches diameter-'C tubes'-which are only partly filled with liquid oil. The C tubes are insulated, but unheated or only lightly heated to prevent the escape of heat by radiation. Here the vapor generated as the result of heating and cracking passes from the liquid oil and is carried to vapor line condensers of the same general kind used in the Burton system. The first vapors to condense-that is, the reflux condensate-are returned to the B tubes for further heating and cracking; the lighter vapors are carried to a second condenser to become gasoline. The unvaporized residue of liquids and suspended solid particles in the C tubes is continuously withdrawn from the system; thus only the light oils of the reflux condensate, which have but a limited tendency to form coke, are recycled through the B tubes. Such deposit of coke in the lightly heated C tubes as occurs involves no marked danger of explosion, and it precludes clogging of the smaller superheated B tubes. Gas oil subjected to the Dubbs process has been made to yield 40-50% gasoline, and continuous runs of from ten to twenty days are usual.\n In the commercial practice of the Dubbs patent, a simple vapor separation tank usually takes the place of the C tubes.\n The points of similarity and dissimilarity to the Burton-Clark process are worth noting. Burton-Clark subjected to prolonged heating the unvaporized hydrocarbons as well as the light reflux condensate. Since these heavy hydrocarbons have the greatest tendency to form still heavier oils and to deposit carbon, their withdrawal from the apparatus was an important advance. The continuous feed system of the Dubbs apparatus was also regarded as an \n\n[322 \nU.S. 471, 478]\n\u00a0\n improvement on Burton's batch process. Burton-Clark circulated through the heating tubes the heavy oils formed during cracking; Dubbs permitted only a mixture of fresh oil and reflux condensate to pass through his furnace coil.\n The Egloff patent covers an improvement on the Dubbs process.\n As we pointed out at pp. 2, 3, (64 S.Ct. 1112) supra, the initial step in the separation of gasoline from crude oil is fractional distillation; then gas oil, the fraction next below gasoline and kerosene, is subjected to cracking in a special apparatus. The fuel oil fraction has such a strong tendency to form very heavy hydrocarbons and coke that it is undesirable as a charge for the high-temperature heating coil in the cracking systems. \n6\n What Egloff proposed was a relatively mild heating of the heavy oils in a separate furnace-thus fuel oil or topped crude might be used as a charge. The temperature and pressure would be sufficient to occasion a mild cracking; the vapors might then be delivered to the same vapor separation tank used with the high temperature heating tubes, and the reflux condensate from these vapors might be used as the charge for the high temperature tubes. The substantial effect is to subject fuel oil or topped crude, from which the charge for a Dubbs plant was often separated by separate distillation, to a distillation and mild cracking operation, using the vapor separating tank and the condenser apparatus of the Dubbs plant instead of using separate apparatus to prepare the Dubbs charge.\n The apparatus of respondent's Winkler-Koch process closely resembles the apparatus of the Dubbs-Egloff system. Oil is heated in either the high- temperature or low-temperature furnace, depending on the kind of oil used; \n\n[322 \nU.S. 471, 479]\n\u00a0\n the heated oil is delivered to a vapor separation tank; the reflux condensate flows back to the high-temperature coil for further cracking.\n The differences between the processes, as distinguished from the apparatus, are more marked. Dubbs taught the heating of the oil charge in the B tubes 'without substantial vaporization.' Thus the illustrative run in the patent suggests the heating of oil to a temperature of 750 to 860 F ., with a pressure of about 100 pounds to the square inch, resulting from vaporization, maintained in both B and C tubes. In the respondent's process, oil enters the heating coils at a temperature of 590 and leaves at a temperature of 940 ; a pressure of 500 pounds to the square inch is maintained in the heating coil. Some 85% of the oil by weight and 95% by volume reaches a vapor phase in the heating coils. The oil in mixed liquid and vapor phase enters the vapor separation tank through a pressure reduction valve, so that the pressure in the tank is 26 pounds as compared to the 500 pounds of the heating coil.\n The courts below believed that these differences were sufficient to prevent the respondent's process from infringing the claims of the Dubbs patent. A typical claim is Claim 5, as follows:\n'5. A continuous process for cracking hydrocarbons consisting in passing the same in a stream in an advancing direction from an inlet point to a discharge point separated and entirely disassociated from the inlet point, subjecting the material in the first stage of its travel to a cracking temperature while preventing substantial vaporization, affording a vaporization space above the stream during the second stage of the travel thereof to said discharge point, taking off the vapors from said vapor space and subjecting them to a condensing action, discharging into the stream at a point remote from that where vaporization occurs a portion of the condensates and maintain- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 471, 480]\n\u00a0\n ing a vapor pressure on the material under treatment during distillation and condensation.'\n\n It is apparent that the issue of infringement of the Dubbs patent turns on the construction to be given the words, 'without substantial vaporization,' as they are used in the claim. The petitioner argues that what is claimed is that there is no release of vapors from the liquid in the B tubes; the respondent argues that it is meant that no liquid oil passes into a vapor phase in the B tubes, that is, that there is no vapor generation in the B tubes.\n Either construction would be consistent with the operation of a cracking process. By applying sufficient pressure, it is possible to prevent the generation of vapor from oil even at the relatively high cracking temperatures. The gasoline yielded by cracking oil in liquid phase is chemically different from that yielded by vapor phase cracking, and at the date of the patent, the liquid phase product was preferred. The yield of vapor cracking was a malodorous yellow mixture requiring additional refining operations to make it marketable; however, since 1919 gasoline formed by vapor cracking has become more highly regarded because of its superior antiknock characteristics.\n The parties are wholly at odds as to the nature of the process taught by Dubbs in his patent specifications. The petitioner contends that cracking takes place in the B tubes with resultant generation of vapor, and that in the C tubes the vapor is merely set free from the liquid oil. The respondent argues that the only function of the B tubes is to furnish enough heat to cause cracking, and that the oil actually cracks while it is in the C tubes. The cracking process, it will be remembered, requires that the oil be kept at a high temperature for some time if substantial gasoline is to be formed, and the respondent compares the process taught by Dubbs to the familiar fireless cooker, in which a vessel with heat- keeping qualities is \n\n[322 \nU.S. 471, 481]\n\u00a0\n first heated and then removed from the flame while cooking goes on with the heat first supplied.\n The patent several times refers to the B tubes as 'cracking tubes' or as the 'cracking zone.' In its relevant parts, the patent describes the process in the following terms:\n'Describing the operation of the process, the material to be treated is drawn from any suitable source by means of the pump J and discharged therefrom through line J into and through tubes B and during the time they ( sic) are passing through said tubes, they (sic) are subjected to sufficient heat to cause the desired amount of cracking. Said oil is then passed into the tubes C which are only partially filled with the oil and as the oil passes through these tubes, there is a liberation of vapors from same and which vapors pass up through the vapor tubes D, E. ...\n\n'A light fire may be maintained under the tubes C as shown in the drawings or said tubes may be heavily insulated ... to prevent loss of heat by radiation and thereby dispense with the fire under the tubes C . ... The per cent. of vapors generated from the oil as it passes through the tubes C will depend on the amount of heat acquired by said oil while passing through the 4 coils.'\n\n The petitioner refers, also, to Claim 5, which specifies 'a vaporization space above the stream' in the C tubes. These words, we are told, must necessarily refer to a space in which vapors are released, not generated. This does not advance petitioner's argument, however, as the space referred to, as shown by the subsequent words of Claim 5, is simply space to hold released vapor, that is 'vapor space.' Neither vapor separation nor vapor generation takes place in the space above the stream.\n Respondent too supports its argument that not even generation of vapors was envisaged by the Dubbs patent limitation against 'substantial vaporization' by reference to the patent. It points out that as the patent does not define 'vaporization,' the word is used in the accepted \n\n[322 \nU.S. 471, 482]\n\u00a0\n sense of chemical nomenclature. The use of the word 'vaporization' in the patent to show what takes place in the C coils is stressed by respondent as indicative of the meaning with which the word was used by Dubb's. \n7\n The respondent says this means generation as well as release of vapors because the patent says, 'The per cent of vapors generated from the oil as it passes through the tubes C will depend on the amount of heat acquired by said oil while passing through the 4 (B) coils.' It is said that the patent consistently describes the charge in the B tubes as 'oil,' and never as vapor or mixed oil and vapor or foam.\n The petitioner argues that the reading of the patent which respondent asks would result in an inoperative process under the conditions of the illustrative run. It seems to be conceded that oil heated to 750 at 100 pounds pressure would not vaporize, but in order for cracking to take place in the C tubes, it would be necessary to furnish some additional heat to replace that consumed in the cracking reaction. At the higher temperature suggested in the illustrative run, much higher pressures than the 100 pounds called for become necessary to preclude vaporization, although the heated oil would, in cooling from the higher temperatures, provide the heat necessary for the cracking reaction in the C tubes. But even though experimentation at low pressures would show generation of vapor in the B tubes, this will not control the language of the claim.\n We agree with respondent's position as to the teaching of the patent. We are of the view that 'without substantial vaporization' as used in the patent means that the generation and release of vapors in the B tubes is to be avoided so that the charge will enter the C tubes for \n\n[322 \nU.S. 471, 483]\n\u00a0\n cracking as nearly as may be in the liquid phase. It clearly appears from the history of Dubbs' application in the Patent Office that the use of the phrase was purposeful. It was inserted after the Patent Office had disallowed claims without the phrase and it was evidently added to clarify the description of the steps of the process and the claims of novelty. Cf. Exhibit Supply Co. v. Ace Corp., \n315 \nU.S. 126, 136\n, 62 S.Ct. 513, 518. The importance is evident from the history of the trade since, as pointed out above, at the time of Dubbs' application gasoline obtained by cracking the charge in liquid phase was more desirable than the gasoline obtained from vapor phase cracking. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n The distinction made by the controverted phrase is of practical importance. Dubbs patented a process for converting hydrocarbons through cracking. The difficulty in the prior art was carbon deposit or coking. If in this process the cracking operation is pressed to substantial completion in the B tubes, the patent seems to fail to teach a method of preventing coking in those tubes. Coke there will certainly be as a result of the cracking; what would prevent its deposit? It may be possible to prevent the deposit of carbon by maintaining a rapid turbulent flow; indeed, we are told that this is the device used in the commercial application of both parties' processes, and Behimer, another engineer working in the cracking field, attributed the failure of a similar apparatus (see Patent No. 1,883,850) to the want of a pump of sufficiently high pressure to maintain the necessary velocity of flow. But the patent, while it calls for a pump to inject the charge into the B tubes, does not point out the need of using rapid flow for this purpose; the pressure within the apparatus is expressly referred solely to vaporization. One building a device according to Dubbs' teaching might, if he read \n\n[322 \nU.S. 471, 484]\n\u00a0\n the patent as teaching that cracking was to occur in the B tubes, content himself with using relatively short B tubes and a correspondingly slow flow to furnish cracking time. That procedure would presumably lead to coking; the patent, however, does not describe how that result may be avoided.\n There is a reason of controlling importance why the protection of the Dubbs patent must be limited to a process in which cracking takes place largely in the C tubes.\n As a reward for inventions and to encourage their disclosure, the United States offers a seventeen-year monopoly to an inventor who refrains from keeping his invention a trade secret. But the quid pro quo is disclosure of a process or device in sufficient detail to enable one skilled in the art to practice the invention once the period of the monopoly has expired; and the same precision of disclosure is likewise essential to warn the industry concerned of the precise scope of the monopoly asserted. Bene v. Jeantet, \n129 \nU.S. 683, 685\n, 686 S., 9 S.Ct. 428, 429; General Electric Co. v. Wabash Corp., \n304 \nU.S. 364, 368\n, 58 S.Ct. 899, 901\n\n\n In a process patent in the refining of oil, preciseness of description is essential. It is a crowded art. Hope for success for new patented processes with slight variations from those in use caused large expenditures in testing their efficiency by important companies with staffs of specialists who were skilled in the art. Among the processes cited to us as prior art advances on Burton-Clark, those of Hall Patent No. 1,175,910, Alexander Patent No. 1,407,619, and Behimer Patent No. 1,883, 850 were embodied in experimental plants, and the testimony is replete with references to such other contemporary experimental or working cracking systems as the Holmes-Manley, Fleming, and Cross processes. The claim is the measure of the grant. Smith v. Snow, \n294 \nU.S. 1, 11\n, 55 S.Ct. 279, 283. The claim is required to be specific for the very purpose \n\n[322 \nU.S. 471, 485]\n\u00a0\n of protecting the public against extension of the scope of the patent. White v. Dunbar, \n119 \nU.S. 47, 52\n, 7 S.Ct. 72, 74; Minerals Separation v. Butte &c Min'g Co., \n250 \nU.S. 336, 347\n, 39 S.Ct. 496, 499; Knick v. Bowes 'Seal Fast' Corporation, 8 Cir., 25 F.2d 442, 443. The applicants for the patent thought the phrase 'without substantial vaporization' in the B tubes important. While varying the details of a process does not avoid infringement, Tilghman v. Proctor, \n102 \nU.S. 707\n, when the accused process does not substantially follow the mode taught in the patent, there is no infringement. In view of the importance of the direction as to the non-generation of vapors in the B tubes, as hereinbefore pointed out, we do not think a process which relies on vaporization in the B tubes can be said to infringe the patented process.\n The Egloff patent does not require extended consideration. It may fairly be said that the Egloff patent, described above at pp. 5-6, was an improvement on the Dubbs system. The improvement consisted in providing a clean charging stock for the B tubes by heating crude or fuel oil in coils which are contained in a separate heating apparatus from the one used to heat the cleaned stock, and discharging it in a liquid phase into an expansion chamber. The unvaporized oil is withdrawn from the expansion chamber and does not reenter the system. The vapor is liquefied in a partial condenser or dephlegmator, and the reflux condensate is pumped as a charge into the B tubes of apparatus substantially similar in form and operation of the Dubbs patent. The reflux condensate after passing through the B coils reenters the same expansion chamber that is used for its preparation. \n9\n Noth- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 471, 486]\n\u00a0\n ing is said in the Egloff patent as to vaporization in the B tubes.\n It seems obvious that the Dubbs patent anticipated all the steps of the process except the separate treatment of the heavy oil. The clean charge of the reflux condensate was brought about by the withdrawal of the residue of unvaporized oil, and this withdrawal was old in the art. \n10\n As there is nothing in the claims or specification to show any reliance upon where vaporization, whether by generation or liberation, takes place, such difference as there may be between this patent and Dubbs as to that phenomenon is not significant. But we see nothing in the addition of the extra still that involves invention. In retrospect, it appears almost inevitable that once a satisfactory continuous feed cracking apparatus was developed, chemical engineers would promptly design equipment for integrating the initial distillation of crude or fuel oil, with whatever cracking might be practicable, with the gas oil cracking process to form a continuous operation. Retrospective simplicity is often a misleading test of invention where it appears that the patentee's conception in fact solved a recognized problem that had baffled the contemporary art; but in this case Egloff advanced his improvement shortly after Dubbs disclosed the underlying process and before Dubbs' system had had wide commercial use; hence contemporary workers had no occasion to deal with what- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 471, 487]\n\u00a0\n ever engineering problems might have been involved. We have, therefore, a conception which is on its face too obvious to constitute patentable invention, and which was advanced shortly after any need of it arose. We think the district court was right in finding the Egloff patent invalid.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Universal Oil Products Co. v.

The application and effect of the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942,1 and the Act of October 2, 1942,2 are involved.\n The petitioners, who were intervenors before the Commission, appealed from its order to the District Court of the District of Columbia, which set aside the order as arbitrary and illegal. \n3\n The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia reversed the District Court. \n4\n Understanding of the questions presented requires a detailed statement of their historical background.\n The Commission was created, and its powers and duties defined by Act of Congress in 1913, supplemented in 1926, 1935, and 1939.5 References will be to the District of Columbia Code, 1940 edition. The statutes require public utilities within the District to furnish safe and adequate facilities, just and reasonable service, at reasonable, just and nondiscriminatory rates, and to obey the lawful orders of the Commission ( 43-301). There are detailed provisions respecting rates and depreciation ( 43-315). For the purpose of its functions, the Commission is directed to value 'the property of every public utility within the District of Columbia actually used and useful for the convenience of the public at the fair value thereof at the time of said valuation.' ( 43-306.) Nothing in the statute is to \n\n[321 \nU.S. 489, 492]\n\u00a0\n be 'taken to prohibit a public utility, with the consent of the commission, from providing a sliding scale of rates and dividends according to what is commonly known as the Boston sliding scale, or other financial device that may be practicable and advantageous to the parties interested.' But no such arrangement is lawful until found by the Commission, after investigation, to be reasonable, just, and not inconsistent with the purposes of the Act. Such arrangement must operate under the supervision and regulation of the Commission, may be altered and amended, and may be terminated by the Commission ( 43-317). Usual powers to fix rates, charges, and make rules and regulations are conferred ( 43-411). The Commission may make rules and regulations to govern its proceedings and to regulate the mode and manner of investigations and hearings before it ( 43-402). Appeal from its orders is authorized, and the scope of review defined ( 43-705, 43-706).\n Pursuant to its authority, the Commission initiated in 1931, and concluded in 1935 a proceeding for the valuation of the property of the Washington Gas Light Company, at an expense of some $750,000 and arrived at a depreciated rate base as of 1932. It then entered upon a further inquiry as to rates. After this had lasted some time it approved and adopted a sliding scale arrangement, which involved a rate base, to be adjusted annually by adding net property additions at cost, a rate of return, and a rate of accrual to retirement reserve, in the light of which the rates of the company were to be adjusted annually. It found that the plan was practical and would be advantageous to all parties interested. This plan calls for an annual determination of the rate of return earned during the 'test year', and of the amount available for rate increase or decrease for the succeeding 'rate year', and schedules and regulations to accomplish such increase or decrease. Such determination is to be made after public \n\n[321 \nU.S. 489, 493]\n\u00a0\n notice and opportunity for hearing. The plan defines a rate year as 'the twelve months' period from September 1st to August 31st, inclusive,' and the test year as 'the twelve months' period ending ... June 30th preceding the rate year.' At the inception of the plan, rates were reduced by some $800,000 annually, and subsequent annual hearings and determinations resulted in rate reductions in each year after 1935, except in 1937 and 1941, when no changes were made.\n The duration of the system was not prescribed but in its order the Commission stated that it construed the statute to permit a termination upon reasonable notice, and found that ninety days' written notice of termination by Commission or Company would be reasonable.\n March 20, 1942, the Commission issued its order of investigation in conformity with the sliding scale arrangement. After preliminary investigation by its agents and the representatives of the company, the Commission, pursuant to statutory requirement, issued, on July 21, 1942, notice of hearing as to rates, charges, and regulations which were to become effective September 1, 1942, in accordance with the sliding scale arrangement. The Price Administrator was given leave to intervene and was represented at a prehearing conference and at all hearings, and his counsel was permitted to cross-examine witnesses and to offer testimony. These began August 18 and continued on August 19, September 4, 8, 11, and 14, and closed on the last named date. The Commission stated that it would welcome testimony with relation to the aims and purposes of the Office of Price Administration during the national emergency and the relation of those aims and purposes to the proceedings, and expressed the hope that the Administrator, as intervenor, would develop testimony along lines which would enable the Commission to determine whether an increase should be granted in view \n\n[321 \nU.S. 489, 494]\n\u00a0\n of the national emergency. The Administrator's counsel offered evidence, cross-examined witnesses, argued and filed a brief.\n On application of other parties, the proceedings were reopened and further hearing had September 30th. Counsel for the Administrator participated and filed a second brief. The hearings were again closed, and, October 13, the Commission issued its findings, opinion and order.\n The petitioners' standing in the proceedings deserves notice. Section 302(c) of the Emergency Price Control Act of 19426 provides: 'Nothing in this Act shall be construed to authorize the regulation of ... rates charged by any common carrier or other public utility.' \n7\n The admission of the Administrator as intervenor was, therefore, not pursuant to statute but was governed by the Commission's rules. The Commission had provided for intervention in its rules. Rule 7.3 is: 'The Commission may grant or deny a petition for leave to intervene, or may grant the petition upon such conditions and limitations as it may prescribe.' Rule 7.5 is: 'The granting of a petition to intervene shall not have the effect of changing or enlarging the issues in the proceeding, except where such change or enlargement is expressly requested in the petition and is expressly granted by the Commission after opportunity for hearing upon the question has been afforded all other parties.'\n After final submission, and before promulgation of the Commission's order, the Emergency Price Control Act was amended by the Act of October 2, 1942, which, while prohibiting the President from suspending that portion of the original Act exempting public utilities from the scope of the statute, provided: 'That no common carrier or other \n\n[321 \nU.S. 489, 495]\n\u00a0\n public utility shall make any general increase in its rates or charges which were in effect on September 15, 1942, unless it first gives thirty days notice to the President, or such agency as he may designate, and consents to the timely intervention by such agency before the Federal, State, or municipal authority having jurisdiction to consider such increase.' 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix,  961.\n On the showing of the Commission's staff, the company would have been entitled, under the sliding scale, to an increase in rates of $324,718. The increase approved by the Commission was $201,424, effective September 1, 1942. In its order, however, the Commission directed the company's attention to the provisions of the Act of October 2, 1942, and quoted its language. Accordingly the company, October 14, 1942, served notice upon the Director of Economic Stabilization, who had been designated for the purpose by the President, of the proposed increase in rates together with a copy of the Commission's order and later consented to his intervention. The court below has found that the requisite notice and consent to intervention was given by the company in accordance with the Act.\n Counsel who had participated in all the prior proceedings for the Administrator filed with the Commission October 19 a petition in the name of the Administrator, and on behalf of the Director, asking that the Commission vacate its order and reopen the proceedings to allow the Director to intervene. The Commission reopened the proceeding and set a hearing for November 2 'for the purpose of receiving from the Office of Price Administration, on behalf of the Director of Economic Stabilization, additional evidence relating to the inflationary effect, if any, of the increase in rates authorized by order No. 2401, and intervention is granted for such purpose.' When the reopened proceedings came on for hearing, the same counsel who had theretofore participated in behalf of the Administrator appeared before the Commission, offered no \n\n[321 \nU.S. 489, 496]\n\u00a0\n witnesses, but renewed a motion previously filed that the proceeding be reopened 'without restriction as to the type of evidence to be presented' and that the Commission vacate its order. The motion was denied, the Commission announcing that it was ready to receive evidence in accordance with the order reopening the proceeding. The petitioners offered no evidence. On being asked whether they had any testimony to present in accordance with the order to reopen the proceedings they asked for a continuance so that they might consult their associates. The request was granted. On November 4, counsel recalled a witness for further examination but offered no other evidence. The proceedings were then closed for the third time without the offer of any testimony relating to the national economic policy developed under the Emergency Price Control Act as amended 'and the effect thereon of increase in rates or charges of common carriers or other public utilities.'\n The Commission reconsidered the record and the testimony and, November 9, issued its order in which it reviewed the proceedings and found that the evidence adduced failed to show that the rates authorized by order No. 2401 were unduly inflationary. It denied the Director's petition to vacate the order. Thereafter the company put the new rates into effect as of November 16th. On appeal by the petitioners, the District Court held that the action of the Commission, in the light of the record, was arbitrary and illegal, and vacated the order. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the Commission had afforded petitioners full opportunity for a hearing upon any question which, under the law and the rules of the Commission, was open in the proceeding and that it was not arbitrary or illegal for the Commission, on the record made, to deny the abandonment of the sliding scale plan and the prosecution of an entirely new rate investigation involving fair value, depreciation, rate of return \n\n[321 \nU.S. 489, 497]\n\u00a0\n and other elements commonly considered in such an investigation.\n The petitioners seek vacation of the order on the ground that the Commission denied them a full and fair hearing. This contention is based upon the substantive contention that under the Acts of January 30 and October 2, 1942, they were entitled to demand that the Commission enlarge the scope of the hearing and convert the inquiry into one whether an increase of rates was necessary to the company to prevent hardship. The Commission on the other hand, insists that it was entitled to conduct the proceedings in accordance with its statutory powers as they existed prior to 1942, and, at most, accord the petitioners a full hearing as to the effect of any order in its relation to inflation in the war emergency. Thus it appears that the controversy is essentially one between two governmental agencies as to whether the powers of the one or the other are preponderant in the circumstances.\n In view of the petitioners' insistence that they were entitled, in effect, to control and direct the inquiry without regard to the statutory powers of the Commission, we shall first examine the extent of the authority conferred upon petitioners by Congress.\n The Emergency Price Control Act of 1942, while it gives the Administrator power over prices of 'commodities', which are not generally regulated by public authority, specifically and expressly withholds from the Administrator jurisdiction over public utility rates. And, as we have noted, the Stabilization Act of October 2, 1942, did not alter this prohibition but required merely that no utility should generally increase rates in effect September 15, 1942, unless it first gave thirty days' notice to the President or his representative and consented to the timely intervention of that representative before the federal, state, or municipal authority having jurisdiction to consider the increase. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 489, 498]\n\u00a0\n It is not clear that this language confers a right of intervention. The bill as passed by the Senate contained a provision that there should be no increase in utility rates unless they were approved by the President. The House refused to concur, with the result that only the language now contained in the proviso appeared in the bill. The assertion that, while the Price Administrator or the Director may present his views to the regulatory body 'he had nothing to say about its decision', was made and not contradicted on the Senate floor in discussion of the conference report. Evidently Congress intended to grant the Administrator plenary control over commodity prices, since they generally were not the subject of local regulation, but in both the original Act and the amendment, as this court has recently said in Davies Warehouse Co. v. Bowles, \n321 \nU.S. 144, 154\n, 64 S.Ct. 474, 480, was careful 'to avoid paralyzing or extinguishing local institutions'. Thus it limited the right of the Executive to notice by the utility and the utility's consent that the Executive might be heard by the regulatory body having final authority in the premises.\n If the petitioners were admitted as intervenors by a state commission, or by the District Commission, which is a respondent here, they might, of course, be admitted to participation in the proceeding upon reasonable terms; and one of the most usual procedural rules is that an intervenor is admitted to the proceeding as it stands, and in respect of the pending issues, but is not permitted to enlarge those issues or compel an alteration of the nature of the proceeding. To this effect was the Commission's rule on the subject. It would seem then that, in the absence of clear legislative mandate to the contrary, the petitioners should not possess greater rights than other intervenors.\n This the petitioners deny. They say that, notwithstanding the absence of any categorical enactment, the general purpose of the original Act and its supplement \n\n[321 \nU.S. 489, 499]\n\u00a0\n show that Congress intended to prohibit state and local regulatory authorities from permitting any increase in utility rates which was not shown to be necessary to prevent actual hardship. We are asked then, not only to revise the views expressed in Davies Warehouse Co. v. Bowles, supra, as to the scope of the Acts, but to infer from a general expression of congressional policy, the limitation of existing powers conferred by law on regulatory commissions throughout the nation, both state and federal, and the endowment of a different federal agency with new and superior rights and powers. \n8\n This we are unable to do.\n The other contention of the petitioners stems from their view as to the effect of the Emergency Price Control Act and the Stabilization Act. They insisted below that they were denied a fair hearing because the Commission refused, in the current proceeding, to alter and enlarge the scope and the character of the inquiry. It will be remembered that, under the Commission's existing order, a termination of the sliding scale arrangement required ninety days' written notice. There was no application of any rate payer or any purpose of the Commission in the spring of 1942 to abrogate the arrangement. On the contrary, the Commission gave the required notice for the usual annual adjustment under the plan; and, after the necessary investigations by its agents, gave notice of hearing with respect to such adjustment. At that point, and at a time when no notice of increase of rates was required by any Act of Congress, the Administrator, upon his application was permitted to intervene in the proceeding.\n In his petition, and at the hearings, he asserted and reiterated that he had the right to go into the propriety of the rate base, the operating expenses, including depreciation expenses, taxes, and rate of return, summarizing his \n\n[321 \nU.S. 489, 500]\n\u00a0\n demand as 'a full and complete inquiry for the purpose of determining what are fair and reasonable rates. ...' The petitioners now insist that their desire was limited to examination of certain factors involved in the sliding scale. But the courts below did not so understand. The District Court, which sustained the appeal, said (48 F.Supp. 704): 'The Commission was requested to reconsider the basic principle of the sliding scale arrangement ....' The Court of Appeals said (137 F.2d 559) 'the Price Administrator departed from the field committed to his care and demanded that the Commission suspend the application of the sliding scale, and reexamine its basis in a complete investigation of all the elements that enter into the determination of a utility rate by a regulatory body.' These characterizations of the Administrator's contentions before the Commission are supported by the record.\n If we consider the petitioners' present position we find that the Commission heard all evidence offered, and says it weighed it. The Administrator urged that the straight line method of depreciation embodied in the sinking find plan must be discarded in favor of a sinking fund method under the force of decisions of this court, a position unsupported by our cases, and evidence was offered to show the result which would ensue the substitution. Some testimony was adduced as to rate of return, and the Commission's report shows this was considered. In short, if the inquiry was limited to the issues comprehended in the Commission's order of investigation, the petitioners were afforded every opportunity for a full hearing. On the subject respecting which the petitioners were especially competent to enlighten the Commission,-namely the inflationary effect of a rate increase of 2.28% for one year, amounting, on the average, to three cents per month per customer, in the light of wage increases and increased commodity prices and overall conditions in the national \n\n[321 \nU.S. 489, 501]\n\u00a0\n economy,-no evidence was tendered by petitioners, in response to repeated invitations by the Commission.\n The judgment is affirmed.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice BLACK and Mr. Justice MURPHY concur, dissenting.\n This case goes hand in hand with Davies Warehouse Co. v. Bowles, \n321 \nU.S. 144\n, 64 S.Ct. 474. That decision expanded the 'public utility' exemption in the Emergency Price Control Act to include a wide variety of enterprises. The present decision illustrates the value of that preferred treatment.\n The Stabilization Act prohibits any 'utility' from making 'any general increase in its rates or charges which were in effect on September 15, 1942' without giving the President's agent the right to intervene in the proceedings. The present decision goes far towards making that provision ineffective. It allows the commission so to shape the issues of the rate proceeding as to exclude the data most relevant to a determination of whether any rate increase should be allowed. The power of a commission to shape the issues as it desires and to restrict the Director of Economic Stabilization to those issues is not a power which is apt to be neglected. The Director may of course proclaim against rate increases. But he does not need the right to intervene to prove that rate increases are inflationary. That is self-evident. The right to intervene, if it is not a right to introduce relevant data bearing on the true earnings and returns of the utility, is an empty right indeed.\n I agree that Congress did not transfer rate-making powers from the commissions to the Director. I agree that Congress must have contemplated that some rate increases might take place or else it would have treated \n\n[321 \nU.S. 489, 502]\n\u00a0\n the whole problem quite differently. But I find not the slightest indication that the Director was to be denied a full hearing. And I do not see how a full hearing could be accorded unless he was given the opportunity to establish, if he could, that the case under consideration showed no real hardship, that wartime demands were not causing the company to suffer, that its financial integrity and its ability to render service remained unimpaired, that its property was not being confiscated, that it was not being treated unfairly as compared with other companies.\n We are told that this company has an inflated rate base of some $1, 000,000. We are told that its excessive charges for depreciation expense were over $225,000 a year as compared with the rate increase of about $200, 000 a year. We are told that a full hearing would have disclosed that the company was in fact earning more than 6 1\/2%. I do not know what the evidence would show. But an offer of proof in a rate case could not be more relevant.\n I believe, moreover, that when Congress halted general rate increases and gave the Director a right to intervene, it did not sanction rate increases regardless of need and regardless of inflationary effect. I think it meant to make utility commissions at least partial participants in the war against inflation and gave them a sector of the front to control. Though it did not remove the established standards for rate- making I do not think it intended utility commissions to proceed in disregard of the requirements of emergency price control and unmindful of the dangers of general rate increases. To the contrary, I think Congress intended that there should be as great an accommodation as possible between the old standards and the new wartime necessities. The failure of the commission to make that accommodation is best illustrated perhaps by its treatment of taxes. The commission allowed the company to deduct as operating expenses all income taxes up to and including 31%. That this amount \n\n[321 \nU.S. 489, 503]\n\u00a0\n includes wartime taxes is evident from the fact that the highest corporate tax rate which prevailed from 1936 to 1939 was 19%. We all know that the extraordinary expenditures incurred for the defense of the nation started with the Revenue Act of 1940, 26 U.S.C.A.Int.Rev.Acts. It has been accepted practice to deduct income taxes as well as other taxes from operating expenses in determining rates for public utilities. Galveston Electric Co. v. Galveston, \n258 \nU.S. 388, 399\n, 42 S.ct. 351, 356. But this is war, not business-as-usual. When income taxes are passed on to consumers, the inflationary effect is obvious. And it is self- evident that the ability to pass present wartime income taxes on to others is a remarkable privilege indeed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 56 Stat. 23, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix,  901 et seq. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 56 Stat. 765, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix,  961 et seq. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Byrnes v.

Rockwell, of Washington, D.C., for respondent. \n\n[323 \nU.S. 248, 250]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In an attempt to settle a labor dispute at the plant of petitioner company, an agreement approved by the Board was signed by a C.I.O. union, an Independent union, and the company. At a consent election held pursuant to this agreement, Independent won a majority of the votes cast,1 and was certified by the Board as bargaining representative. The company then signed a union shop contract with Independent, with knowledge-so the Board has found-that Independent intended, by refusing membership to C.I.O. employees, to oust them from their jobs. Independent refused to admit C.I. O. men to membership and the company discharged them.\n In a subsequent unfair labor practice proceeding the Board found that ( 1) Independent had been set up, maintained, and used by the petitioner to frustrate the threatened unionization of its plant by the C.I.O., and (2), the union shop contract was made by the company with knowledge that Independent intended to use the contract as a means of bringing about the discharge of former C.I.O. employees by denying them membership in Independent. The Board held that the conduct of the company in both these instances constituted unfair labor practices. It entered an order requiring petitioner to disestablish Independent, denominated by it a 'company union'; to cease and desist from giving effect to the union shop contract between it and Independent; and to reinstate with back pay forty- three employees, found to have been discharged because of their affiliation with the C.I.O., and because of their failure to belong to Independent, as required by the union shop contract. \n2\n The Circuit Court of Appeals ordered enforcement of the \n\n[323 \nU.S. 248, 251]\n\u00a0\n Order. \n3\n We granted certiorari because of the importance to the administration of the Act of the questions involved. \n322 \nU.S. 721\n, 64 S.Ct. 1262.\n The Board's findings if valid support the entire order. This is so because Section 8(3) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  158(3)4 does not permit such a contract to be made between a company and a labor organization which it has 'established, maintained, or assisted.' \n5\n The Board therefore is authorized by the Act to order disestablishment of such unions and to order an employer to renounce such contracts. \n6\n Nor can the company, if the Board's findings are well-grounded, defend its discharge of the C.I.O. employees on the ground that the contract with Independent required it to do so. It is contended that the Board's findings are not supported by substantial evidence. As shown by its analysis, the Board gave careful consideration to the evidence before it relating to the unfair labor practices which occurred both before and after the settlement agreement and the certification. The Circuit Court of Appeals unreservedly affirmed the Board's findings, and we find ample substantiating evidence in the record to justify that affirmance. We need therefore but briefly refer to the circumstances leading to the Board's order.\n The findings of the Board establish the fact of an abiding hostility on the part of the company to any recognition of a C.I.O. union. This hostility we must take it extended to any employee who did or who might affiliate \n\n[323 \nU.S. 248, 252]\n\u00a0\n himself with the C.I.O. union. The company apparently preferred to close down this one of its two plants rather than to bargain collectively with the C.I.O. It publicly proclaimed through one of its foremen that '... the ones that did not sign up with the C.I.O. didn't have anything to worry about ... the company would see that they was taken care of.' The settlement agreement plainly implied that the old employees could retain their jobs with the company simply by becoming members of whichever union would win the election. Nevertheless, the company entered into an agreement with Independent which inevitably resulted in bringing about the discharge of a large bloc of C.I.O. men and their president.\n The contract was executed after notice to the company by the business manager of Independent that Independent must have the right to refuse membership to old C.I.O. employees who might jeopardize its majority. This business manager, who had himself originally been recommended to Independent by a company employee, wrote the company, prior to the making of the contract, that Independent insisted upon a closed shop agreement because it wanted a 'legal means of disposing of any present employees' who might affect its majority, and 'who are unfavorable to our interests.' The contract further significantly provided that the company would be released from the clause requiring it to retain in its employ union men only, if Independent should lose its majority and the C.I.O. win it. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n Neither the Board nor the court below found that the company engaged in a conspiracy to bring about the dis- \n\n[323 \nU.S. 248, 253]\n\u00a0\n charged of former C.I.O. members. Both of them, however, have found that the contract was signed with knowledge on the part of the company that Independent proposed to refuse to admit them to membership and thus accomplish the very same purpose. By the plan carried out the company has been able to achieve that which the Board found was its object from the beginning, namely, to rid itself of C.I.O. members, categorized by its foreman as 'agitators.'\n It is contended that the Board's finding as to company domination has no support in the evidence because the evidence as to company domination antedated the settlement and certification, and hence was improperly admitted. The argument is that the Board cannot go behind the settlement and certification. The petitioner does not argue that any language appearing in the Labor Relations Act denies this power to the Board, but relies upon general principles on which the judicial rule governing estoppel is based. Only recently we had occasion to note that the differences in origin and function between administrative bodies and courts 'preclude wholesale transplantation of the rules of procedure, trial and review which have evolved from the history and experience of courts.' Federal Communications Commission v. Pottsville Broadcasting Co., \n309 \nU.S. 134, 143\n, 60 S.Ct. 437, 441. With reference to the attempted settlement of disputes, as in the performance of other duties imposed upon it by the Act, the Board has power to fashion its procedure to achieve the Act's purpose to protect employees from unfair labor practices. We cannot, by incorporating the judicial concept of estoppel into its procedure, render the Board powerless to prevent an obvious frustration of the Act's purposes.\n To prevent disputes like the one here involved, the Board has from the very beginning encouraged compro- \n\n[323 \nU.S. 248, 254]\n\u00a0\n mises and settlements. \n8\n The purpose of such attempted settlements has been to end labor disputes, and so far as possible to extinguish all the elements giving rise to them. The attempted settlement here wholly failed to prevent the wholesale discard of employees as a result of their union affiliations. The purpose of the settlement was thereby defeated. Upon this failure, when the Board's further action was properly invoked, it became its duty to take fresh steps to prevent frustration of the Act. To meet such situations the Board has established as a working rule the principle that it ordinarily will respect the terms of a settlement agreement approved by it. 9 It has consistently gone behind such agreements, however, where subsequent events have demonstrated that efforts at adjustment have failed to accomplish their purpose, or where there has been a subsequent unfair labor practice. 10 We \n\n[323 \nU.S. 248, 255]\n\u00a0\n think this rule adopted by the Board is appropriate to accomplish the Act's purpose with fairness to all concerned. Consequently, since the Board correctly found that there was a subsequent unfair labor practice, it was justified in considering evidence as to petitioner's conduct, both before and after the settlement and certification.\n The company denies the existence of a subsequent unfair labor practice. It attacks the Board's conclusion that it was an unfair labor practice to execute the union shop contract with knowledge that Independent at that time intended to deny membership to C.I.O. employees because of their former affiliations with the C.I.O. It admits that had there been no union shop agreement, discharge of employees on account of their membership in the C.I.O. would have been an unlawful discrimination contrary to Section 8(3) of the Act. But the proviso in Section 8(3) permits union shop agreements. It follows therefore, the company argues, that, inasmuch as such agreements contemplate discharge of those who are not members of the contracting union, and inasmuch as the company has no control over admission to union membership, the contract is valid and the company must discharge non-union members, regardless of the union's discriminatory purpose, and the company's knowledge of such purpose. This argument we cannot accept.\n The duties of a bargaining agent selected under the terms of the Act extend beyond the mere representation of the interests of its own group members. By its selection as bargaining representative, it has become the agent of all the employees, charged with the responsibility of representing their interests fairly and impartially. Otherwise, employees who are not members of a selected union at the time it is chosen by the majority would be \n\n[323 \nU.S. 248, 256]\n\u00a0\n left without adequate representation. No employee can be deprived of his employment because of his prior affiliation with any particular union. The Labor Relations Act was designed to wipe out such discrimination in industrial relations. Numerous decisions of this Court dealing with the Act have established beyond doubt that workers shall not be discriminatorily discharged because of their affiliation with a union. We do not construe the provision authorizing a closed shop contract as indicating an intention on the part of Congress to authorize a majority of workers and a company, as in the instant case, to penalize minority groups of workers by depriving them of that full freedom of association and self- organization which it was the prime purpose of the Act to protect for all workers. It was as much a deprivation of the rights of these minority employees for the company discriminatorily to discharge them in collaboration with Independent as it would have been had the company done it alone. To permit it to do so by indirection, through the medium of a 'union' of its own creation, would be to sanction a readily-contrived mechanism for evasion of the Act.\n One final argument remains. The company, it is said, bargained with Independent because it was compelled to do so by law. The union shop contract to which the company at first objected, but into which it entered against the advice of counsel, was the result of that bargaining. The company, it is pointed out, persistently though unsuccessfully sought to persuade Independent to admit C.I.O. workers as members of Independent. Hence, we are told, the company did all in its power to prevent the discharges and should not be held responsible for them. Two answers suggest themselves: First, that the company was not compelled by law to enter into a contract under which it knew that discriminatory discharges of its employees were bound to occur; second, the record discloses that \n\n[323 \nU.S. 248, 257]\n\u00a0\n there was more the company could and should have done to prevent these discriminatory discharges even after the contract was executed. Immediately after the discharge of this large group of employees, the Labor Board complained to the company. The company appealed in writing to Independent's business manager to admit the men to membership, and thus make possible their reinstatement. This appeal was rejected. The Board then called to the company's attention our decision in National Labor Relations Board v. Electric Vacuum Cleaner Co., \n315 \nU.S. 685\n, 62 S.Ct. 846, asserting that under its authority the men had been illegally discharged and should be reinstated. In subsequent correspondence, the Board suggested to the company that if it should later be required to reinstate the discharged employees, it would have only itself to blame, since it had voluntarily dispensed with their services. It insisted that the company was taking a needless risk of liability becuase if the Board should hear charges and dismiss them, the men could then be discharged, but if on the other hand, the Board should sustain the complaint, the discharged employees 'would have retained their positions and your client would have no further liability because of their wrongful discharge.' The Board's representative at that time wrote the company, 'I again beseech you to return them to work pending a decision of the National Labor Relations Board on this question.'\n It follows from what we have said that we affirm the judgment of the court below approving the order of the Board in its entirety.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice JACKSON, dissenting.\n A more complete statement of the facts than is found in the Court's opinion is necessary to disclose the reasons why the CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice ROBERTS, Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER, and I dissent. \n\n[323 \nU.S. 248, 258]\n\u00a0\n The Wallace Manufacturing Company employs about 200 employees and makes clothespins and similar wood products at Richwood, a small community in West Virginia. In July 1941 a union affiliated with the C.I.O., which after the practice of the Court's opinion we will call the C.I.O., began to organize these employees, and the Company engaged in counter measures. Without detailing the evidence or considering the merits of the Company's objections we will assume that the Company during this period was guilty of unfair labor practices.\n On September 25, the C.I.O. called a strike. About October 2, the Independent union, one of the petitioners here, came into being. On October 10, 1941, the C.I.O. filed charges with the Labor Board, alleging among other things that the Company had violated the Act by sponsoring the formation of the Independent. Again, without weighing the evidence or the objections of the Company or of the Independent, we will assume that the Company was guilty.\n On October 14, the Independent demanded recognition as bargaining representative of the employees, and on October 31, it filed with the Labor Board a petition for investigation and certification of it as the representative of the Company's employees.\n The Board, however, did not proceed on either the complaint or the request for certification. Instead, as the Government states, 'During the ensuing two and one-half months, representatives of petitioner (the company), the Board, and the two unions engaged in negotiations looking toward settlement of the entire controversy, including disposition of the Union's charge and the Independent's petition.' Again, without considering the Company's or the Independent's objection or evidence, we will assume that during this two and a half months the Company engaged in unfair labor practices. The strike was proceeding, however, with much bitterness and some \n\n[323 \nU.S. 248, 259]\n\u00a0\n violence. On December 30, the strike then being in its fourth month, the C. I.O. by telegram offered, with the approval of the Labor Board, to enter into a consent election 'with you and your Company Union, on the condition that when we prove a majority and become the exclusive bargaining agency for all your employees, that as a condition of employment all eligible employees must become members of Local Union 129, U.C.W.O.C.' The closed- shop proposal was thus first brought forward by the C.I.O. On January 13, the C.I.O. and the Independent and the Company signed an agreement that the plant should be opened, that everyone should return to work, that the Company would not in any way influence its employees for or against either union, and that the unions would not exercise any coercion. The Company agreed to recognize as exclusive bargaining agent whichever union was proved by a vote conducted by the Board to represent a majority of its employees and to start negotiations immediately after the result of the election was determined and to grant a union shop. All parties are agreed that they employed 'union shop' as the equivalent of 'closed shop.' There is no finding and no evidence that at the time the company entered into this obligation it had any foreknowledge as to which union would win or what the practice of either as to admission of members would be, nor is there any evidence that either union had decided upon any policy in anticipation of victory. There is no charge, no finding, and no evidence that the Company has not performed its part of this agreement scrupulously.\n The parties took this agreement to the office of the Board's regional manager and on January 19 two agreements were drawn: One by which the C.I. O. withdrew the charges of domination and other charges; and the other for a consent election to determine the employees' choice of representative. Both of these agreements, after \n\n[323 \nU.S. 248, 260]\n\u00a0\n signature by all the parties, were approved in writing by the Regional Director, acting on behalf of the National Labor Relations Board and with full knowledge of the agreement that the Company would give to the winner a closed shop. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The employees, without distinction as to union affiliation, all returned to work. The election was held January 30, under the auspices of the Board. Of the 186 valid votes cast, the Independent received 98, the C. I.O. 83, and 5 votes were cast for neither. The C.I.O. filed no objections, and the Board on February 4 certified the Independent as the exclusive bargaining agent for the employees in the plant.\n Thereupon the Company bargained with the certified representative, as it was required by law to do. The evidence is uncontradicted that the Company was reluctant still to enter into a closed-shop agreement. The Independent, however, insisted that the Company perform the contract by which the strike had been settled. It stated its position in a letter in which it said: 'The 'Closed Shop' will, therefore, give us some control in preventing the hiring of additional employees who are unfavorable to our interests and who would further jeopardize our majority. It would also provide us with a legal means of disposing of any present employees, including Harvey Dodrill whom \n\n[323 \nU.S. 248, 261]\n\u00a0\n our members have declared by unanimous ballot that they will not work with, whose presence in the plant is unfavorable to our interests because those who are so unfavorable will not be permitted to become members of our organization and without such membership they would not be permitted to work in the plant under a closed shop contract which we respectfully insist that we must have.'\n This is the first knowledge it is claimed the Company had or should have had of the Independent's adoption of an exclusionary policy toward its rivals. The Company yielded, considering the union's membership policy as something it could not interfere with, and the closed shop contract was signed. It required that all present and future employees should become members of the Independent within ten days of the date of the contract or from the date of hiring. The contract and notice of the closed-shop arrangement were posted in the plant. On March 18, forty-three employees were dismissed, on demand of the Independent, as not eligible for employment because of non-membership in it. Later it appeared that twelve such dismissed employees never made application for membership in the Independent, and thirty-one members who had applied for membership had been rejected because when their applications came before the meeting in regular course they did not receive the number of ballots necessary under its by-laws to elect to membership. Whether the Company knew that they had applied for membership and had been rejected is disputed, but again we resolve the doubt against the Company and assume that the superintendent knew this fact at the time of discharge.\n There is no dispute, however, that when Mr. Wallace, the president of the company, learned of the discharge he attempted to persuade the Independent to allow these employees to be reinstated. On March 20, 1942, he wrote to the business agent of the Independent a letter. The Board has not found that it was not written in good faith. \n\n[323 \nU.S. 248, 262]\n\u00a0\n To the contrary, counsel for the Board with commendable candor stated that there is no evidence and that he made no contention that it was other than a good-faith statement of the Company's position. Among other things it says, 'When our Mr. Christmas talked to you on March 9th, you will recall that he appealed to you to see that the closed shop clause, which your Union insisted be included in the working agreement, should not be used in any way to unfairly prevent any person from working who wanted to work. We realize, of course, that the contract does not give the Company the right to tell the Union who to admit as members, and for that reason Mr. Christmas' talk with you and mine over the telephone could only be directed to the sense of fairness which we believe exists in the minds of your members.\n'Entirely aside from the fact that having to lay off this large number of experienced people will badly cripple our production which is urgently needed, we feel that it is indeed a sad situation where, account of some individual differences of opinion, people who have perhaps been friends and neighbors for many years cannot work together. I will appreciate your advising me what can be done.'\n\n The Regional Director of the Board was notified of the discharges and, as the Court's opinion states, he did urge the Company to disregard its closed-shop contract and re-employ non-members of the certified union. The Company's counsel reminded him that he had expressed concern about the closed-shop provision to the Regional Director when it was being negotiated, and that the Director had replied that he probably 'would have to agree to it as the C.I.O. certainly would have insisted upon it if they had prevailed in the election.' The Company insisted that 'membership in the union is beyond the Company's control' and that unless the union relented it would stand by the closed-shop contract. The Company sug- \n\n[323 \nU.S. 248, 263]\n\u00a0\n gested, however, to the Independent that it conduct interviews with those it had rejected and reconsider them individually. The Union by unanimous vote rejected the suggestion. The Regional Director of the Board also wrote to the head of the Independent about the individuals discharged 'because they were not members of your union. It develops that your union is unwilling to accept them into membership. I need not remind you of the seriousness of these charges.' The Board representatives were unable to persuade the union to accept the rejected members nor the Company to repudiate its agreement.\n At the opening of the hearing before the examiner July 9, 1942, the Company declared it was 'ready to take any steps which are necessary to the end that these people be put back to work, as it has been throughout, since this agreement was entered into.' It suggested that the attorney for the Board and the attorney for the Independent work out a settlement. The Board's attorney expressed 'to the representative of the Company my thanks for the suggestion.' Adjournment was taken and counsel for the union went from Summerville, the place of hearing, to Richwood and called a meeting of the Independent union. The Board attorney's objection kept further developments out of the record except that he stated, 'I am willing to let the record show that Mr. Ritchie (attorney for the Independent) made me a proposition which I was unable to accept and that I made him one which he was unable to accept.' The case therefore proceeded against the Company.\n The Board did not find any unfair labor practice on the part of the Company between the date of the settlement agreement and the election. In fact, it refused to accept the recommendation of the trial examiner for such a finding, saying that 'such interference, if any, was too trivial,' was known to the C.I.O., which made no objection to the certification, and had come to the knowledge of the Re- \n\n[323 \nU.S. 248, 264]\n\u00a0\n gional Director prior to the election. 'Nevertheless, he proceeded with the election, found it to be a fair one, and certified the Independent.'\n No unfair labor practices at any time after the settlement agreement are found or charged against the employer except the making and performing of the closed-shop agreement. The Board states its position as follows: 'The issue remains whether, by entering into the closed-shop contract with the Independent with knowledge that the Independent intended to exclude employees from membership and by discharging employees denied membership in the Independent, as set forth above, the respondent violated the Act. The respondent contends that it was bound to enter into a closed-shop contract by the terms of the election agreement between the respondent, the Union, and the Independent, and urges the Board to regard the discharges as proper since made pursuant to the closed-shop contract.\n'We do not agree. An employer may not enter into a closed-shop contract which to his knowledge is designed to operate as an instrument for effecting discrimination against his employees solely because of their prior union activities. The proviso in Section 8(3) of the Act permits an employer to enter into an agreement with the duly designated representative of his employees, requiring membership in that organization as a condition of employment. It is true that under the terms of the election agreement the respondent was bound to execute a union-shop contract with the victorious union. It by no means follows, however, that the respondent was also bound by the election agreement to acquiesce in a scheme to penalize employees whose choice of representatives was not that of the majority; nor can the proviso in Section 8(3) be thought to countenance such a result. ...\n\n'... The facts in the case make it apparent that the respondent ( Company) was put on notice that its (Inde- \n\n[323 \nU.S. 248, 265]\n\u00a0\n pendent's) real purpose was to bar from future employment with the respondent persons who had adhered to the charging Union in the election campaign. While the tripartite agreement of January 13, 1942, may have been valid when made, performance of its terms did not require the respondent knowingly to become a party to the Independent's plan to eliminate from respondent's pay roll employees solely because of their past union activities. On the contrary, when this unlawful scheme became known to it, the respondent not only had a right to abrogate the tripartite agreement, but also was under an affirmative obligation to do so. ... Under these circumstances, the closed-shop agreement cannot be deemed a defense, but a discriminatory device to insure perpetuation of the Independent and thus deprive employees of their statutory right to select bargaining representatives.'\n\n Holding that execution and performance of the closed-shop agreement after the settlement and certification by the Board were 'unfair labor practices,' the Board held them effective also to revive the old charges settled by the agreements and election and it went back to those events to find grounds on which to hold that the employer dominates the Independent.\n Accordingly it ordered that the Company disestablish and withdraw all recognition from the Independent as representative of any of its employees. It forbade 'any continuation, renewal, or modification of the existing contract which would perpetuate the conditions which have deprived employees' of their jobs; it ordered the Company to cease giving effect to any contract between it and the Independent or to any modification or extension thereof. It also ordered that the Company 'offer the aforesaid 43 employees immediate and full reinstatement to their former or substantially equivalent positions, without prejudice to their seniority or other rights and privileges, and to make them whole for any loss of pay they may have suffered.' \n\n[323 \nU.S. 248, 266]\n\u00a0\n The underlying question is, in the language of the Board's brief, 'Whether petitioner by entering into and discharging employees pursuant to the terms of the closed-shop contract with the Independent violated Section 8(3) and (1) of the Act. It is one of importance far beyond this little company and its two hundred employees.\n Section 8(3) makes it an unfair labor practice for an employer, by discrimination, to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization. If it ended there it would of course outlaw any closed shop, for the very essence of the closed shop is that the employer discriminates in employment to require membership in a particular union. To validate discrimination in such circumstances a proviso follows that no law of the United States 'shall preclude an employer from making an agreement with a labor organization (not established, maintained, or assisted by any action defined in this Act as an unfair labor practice) to require as a condition of employment membership therein, if such labor organization is the representative of the employees ....'\n At the time this closed shop agreement was made the Board had certified the Independent as representative of the employees. Under Section 8 it would have been an unfair labor practice had the Company refused to bargain with it. The Board made the certification, without objection by the defeated C.I.O. and with full knowledge that the Company was bound in law and in good faith to give the certified union a closed shop contract. We do not say, and it is not necessary now to decide, that the Board has no power to protect minorities at this stage of the proceedings. We do not mean to preclude the power of the Board, when the contract settling the strike, withdrawing charges against the company, and consenting to an election with a closed shop to the winner was brought to the Board, to have refused to dismiss charges and undertake an election unless each union agreed that, if it won \n\n[323 \nU.S. 248, 267]\n\u00a0\n a closed shop, it would open the union to membership from the losers on terms the Board deemed fair. Since no one could tell who would win, this would in any event have been an impartial arrangement. Even after the Independent won, the Board before certifying it might perhaps properly have made conditions as to reasonable terms to the defeated. But the Board made no conditions or reservations of the sort. Instead, it takes the position, and the Court is holding, that such conditions must be imposed on the union by the employer. He must see that the union with which he has been ordered to bargain makes proper terms for admission into that certified union of its former enemies and rivals. We think that the decision to that effect is not only unauthorized by Congress, but is utterly at war with the hands-off requirements which the law lays upon the employer, and that this decision is at war with one of the basic purposes of labor in its struggle to obtain this Act and of Congress in enacting it.\n Of course the closed shop is well known in labor relations. Its essential philosophy is that once the employees have chosen their representative union, it is entitled to bargain for the employer's help to maintain its control. Other employer aids to a dominant union, such as the check-off, are also conceded to unions by bargaining on behalf of a majority when they would not be at all permissible for the employer to use in the first place to influence the workmen to choose a particular union because he favored it. But the idea of the closed shop is that, while these acts of influence or pressure on workmen are unfair when exerted by the employer in his own interest, they are fair and lawful when enforced by him as an instrument of the union itself. A closed shop is the ultimate goal of most union endeavor, and not a few employers have found it a stabilizer of labor relations by putting out of their shops men who were antagonistic to the dominant union, thus ending strife for domination. It puts the employ- \n\n[323 \nU.S. 248, 268]\n\u00a0\n ment office under a veto of the union, which uses its own membership standards as a basis on which to exclude men from employment.\n Neither the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq., nor any other Act of Congress expressly or by implication gives to the Board any power to supervise union membership or to deal with union practices, however unfair they may be to members, to applicants, to minorities, to other unions, or to employers. This may or may not have been a mistake, but it was no oversight. We suppose that there is no right which organized labor of every shade of opinion in other matters would unite more strongly in demanding than the right of each union to control its own admissions to membership. Each union has insisted on its freedom to fix its own qualifications of applicants, to determine the vote by which individual admissions will be granted, to prescribe the initiation or admission fees, to fix the dues, to prescribe the duties to which members must be faithful and to decide when and why they may be expelled or disciplined. The exclusion of those whose loyalty is to a rival union or hostile organization is one of the most common and most understandable or practices, designed to defend the union against undermining, spying, and discord, and possible capture and delivery over to a rival. Some unions have battled to exclude Communists, some racketeers, and all to exclude those deemed disloyal to their purposes. See Williams v. Quill, 277 N.Y. 1, 7, 12 N.E.2d 547; Miller v. Ruehl, 166 Misc. 479, 2 N.Y.S.2d 394.\n There are those who think that the time has come when unions should be denied this control over their own affairs. However this may be, we only know that Congress has included no such principle expressly in the Act. If the Board should attempt to exercise it as we have suggested by way of a condition on its conducting an election or making a certification, a question of its statutory power \n\n[323 \nU.S. 248, 269]\n\u00a0\n to do so might arise, on which we express no opinion. It would at least be a forthright exercise of power over the unions by the Board itself acting in the public interest and would not require an employer to engage in interference with union affairs in direct violation of the Act.\n But the Court is deciding not only that without authority of Congress the admission practices of a labor organization having a closed shop may be policed, but also, contrary as we think to the Act, that the employer is empowered and required to do the policing. This we think defies both the express terms and the philosophy of the Act. The letter of the Act makes it a forbidden practice for an employer to 'interfere with' or 'restrain' employees in the 'right to self-organization.' We assume this employer knew the Independent would exercise its power over admission privileges to some extent to protect itself against infiltration of hostile elements. The Board must have known it, too. And both must have known the C.I.O. would, also, if it won. However, the Independent has not indiscriminately excluded all who were against it in the election. The C.I. O. had 83 votes; all but 43 of these voters seem to have been admitted to the Independent, and 12 of those never applied, making 31 apparently rejected. In view of the bitterness and duration of the strike, involving some shooting, it is not strange that good will did not descend on the victors at once. The Board may have expected more moderation when it conducted the consent election and certified the Independent. There is nothing to show that the Company did not, too. When it was found how harshly the Independent had behaved, the Company did try persuasion to get the union leaders to relent-the Company's own interests were to get back more of its experienced employees. How it could have done more without breaking both faith and the law, the Court does not point out, and we do not know. \n\n[323 \nU.S. 248, 270]\n\u00a0\n Of course, if the employer in a closed shop is to be reponsible for the discriminations or unfairness of the union, he must have a right to be informed about its admissions. If, in collective bargaining, a union asked a closed shop, the employer would have to demand to know the rules and practices about admission, the fees, the by-laws, the method of electing members. If he should demand this as a condition of collective bargaining, we should expect the Board to hold him guilty of unfair practices, and we have no doubt it would ask this Court to sustain it. Yet here the sole ground of penalizing this employer is that he did not do just that. Should the employer have made the union admit all of its former enemies? If not, by what standard could he allow it to select? Must it also be made to admit even those who would not sign applications or pay initiation fees claimed to be too onerous? The employer is required to reinstate with back pay a dozen who never even asked to join the certified union. But neither the Court nor the Board says what the employer should have required the union to adopt as an admission policy.\n The statute expressly permits a closed shop. It can be denied only when the certified union is 'established, maintained, or assisted' by unfair labor practices of the employer. But the statute cannot mean that the making and performance of a closed shop contract in itself is an unfair practice which invalidates a closed shop. To so interpret it would be to believe the Congress by this provision was perpetrating a hoax. But if it means that the union can have a closed shop and the employer will supervise its membership, it is a strange contradiction in an Act whose chief purpose was to sterilize the employers and to free workmen of the influence they exerted through control of the right to work.\n We can quite understand, and we do not mean to criticize, the motives which animated the Board. We are deal- \n\n[323 \nU.S. 248, 271]\n\u00a0\n ing here with an industry located in a small community where opportunities for other employment are probably not plentiful. It is not unlikely that denial of the right to work for this company will keep these men from earning a livelihood in a place they long have lived. In so far as the Board has been stirred by concern for individual and minority protection against arbitrary union action, we both understand and sympathize with their concern. The employer is the only one it can lay hands on, and the temptation is great to use him to protect minority rights in the labor movement. This and the other cases before us give ground for belief that the labor movement in the United States is passing into a new phase. The struggle of the unions for recognition and rights to bargain, and of workmen for the right to join without interference, seems to be culminating in a victory for labor forces. We appear now to be entering the phase of struggle to reconcile the rights of individuals and minorities with the power of those who controll collective bargaining groups. We have joined in the opinion in Steele v. L. & N.R. Co., \n323 \nU.S. 192\n, 65 S.Ct. 226. That case arose under the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C.A .  151 et seq., which contains no authorization whatever for a closed shop, on the contrary forbids the discrimination underlying the adoption of a closed shop, and deals with an industry and a labor group which never has had or sought a closed shop. But here we deal with a minority which the statute has subjected to closed-shop practices. Whether the closed shop, with or without the closed union, should or should not be permitted without supervision is in the domain of policy-making, which it is not for this Court to undertake. Neither do we find any authority in the National Labor Relations Board to undertake it.\n It happens to be an independent that won here. But counsel for the Board assured us on argument that this is not a one-way policy to require independent unions to admit their enemies. It would, as we understand it, \n\n[323 \nU.S. 248, 272]\n\u00a0\n have been applied in the same manner if the C.I.O. had won and had excluded some Independent members-on suspicion, perhaps, that they were company spies. The obstacle that this decision will interpose to all future bargaining for closed shops is likely to be felt by C.I.O. and A.F. of L. unions many times as often as by independents.\n Of course it is the employer who is penalized here, and on shallow and superficial examination it may seem like another victory for labor. The employer must pay many thousands of dollars for hours unworked, because it performed reluctantly but in good faith its closed-shop agreement made under authority of Congress and with knowledge and encouragement of the Board, and with the approval and instigation of the C. I.O. union whose members now gain back pay by its repudiation. We think this cannot be justified as an unfair labor practice outlawed by Congress. That resistance to closed-shop unions will likely be stiffened if employers must underwrite the fairness of closed-shop unions to applicants and members, and that a good deal labor has fought for may be jeopardized if the price of obtaining it is to have the union policed by the employer, are considerations beyond our concern. We can only view this as a very unfair construction of the statute to the employer and one not warranted by anything Congress has directed or authorized. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Of 207 eligible employees, 98 voted for Independent, 83 for the C.I.

HELMERICH & PAYNE(1944)\nNo. 27\nArgued: October 17, 1944Decided: November 6, 1944\n\n\n\n Mr. Irving J. Levy, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Eugene O. Monnet, of Tulsa, Okl., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n We are concerned here with the question whether certain provisions of employment contracts relating to the \n\n[323 \nU.S. 37, 38]\n\u00a0\n computation and application of regular and overtime wage rates conform to the requirements of Section 7(a) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 1060, 29 U.S.C.  201 et seq., 29 U.S.C.A.  201 et seq.\n Respondent is engaged in the production of oil and gas for interstate commerce and its employees admittedly are covered by the Act. Prior to October 24, 1938, the effective date of the Act, certain of respondent's employees worked eight, ten and twelve hour daily shifts, or 'tours,' and were paid a specified wage for each tour. These wages were in excess of the minimum required by the Act, though the number of tours per week would often cause an employee to work more than the maximum hours allowed by the Act without overtime pay being required.\n In order to maintain the same wage levels after the Act became effective, respondent made new employment contracts with the employees in question whereby they received their wages under the so-called 'Poxon' or split-day plan. This plan arbitrarily divided each regular tour into two parts for purposes of calculating and applying hourly wage rates. The first four hours of each eight hour tour, the first five hours of each ten hour tour and the first five hours of each twelve hour tour were assigned a specified hourly rate described as the 'base or regular rate.' The remaining hours in each tour were treated as 'overtime' and called for payment at one and one-half times the 'base or regular rate.' The contracts then recited that the 'base rate' set forth 'shall never apply to more than 40 hours in any work week.'\n These so-called 'regular' and 'overtime' hourly rates were calculated so as to insure that the total wages for each tour would continue the same as under the original contracts,1 thereby avoiding the necessity of increasing \n\n[323 \nU.S. 37, 39]\n\u00a0\n wages or decreasing hours of work as the statutory maximum workweek of 40 hours became effective. \n2\n Only in the extremely unlikely case where an employee's tours totalled more than 80 hours in a week3 did he become entitled to any pay in addition to the regular tour wages that he would have received prior to the adoption of the split-day plan. Until more than 80 hours had been worked the plan operated so that the employee could not be credited with more than 40 hours of 'regular' work, the remaining time being denominated 'overtime.' Hence, since the wages under the old system and under the split-day plan were identical, the original tour rates could be used as the simple method of computing wages for each pay period. The actual and regular workweek was accordingly shorn of all significance.\n The District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals both held that the split-day plan of compensation, under the decision of this Court in Walling v. Belo Corp., \n316 \nU.S. 624\n, 62 S.Ct. 1223, did not violate the provisions of Section 7(a) of the Fair Labor Standards Act. We cannot agree.\n Section 7(a) limits to 40 a week the number of hours that an employer may employ any of his employees subject to the Act, unless the employee receives compensation for his employment in excess of 40 hours at a rate 'not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which he is employed.' The split-day plan here in issue satisfies neither the purpose nor the mechanics of this requirement. \n\n[323 \nU.S. 37, 40]\n\u00a0\n As we pointed out in Overnight Motor Co. v. Missel, \n316 \nU.S. 572, 577\n, 578 S., 62 S.Ct. 1216, 1219, 1220, the Congressional purpose in enacting Section 7(a) was twofold: (1) to spread employment by placing financial pressure on the employer through the overtime pay requirement, see also Southland Gasoline Co. v. Bayley, \n319 \nU.S. 44, 48\n, 63 S.Ct. 917, 919; and (2) to compensate employees for the burden of a workweek in excess of the hours fixed in the Act. Yet neither objective could be attained under the split-day plan. It enabled respondent to avoid paying real overtime wages for at least the first 40 hours worked in excess of the statutory maximum workweek, thus negativing any possible effect such a payment might have had upon the spreading of employment. And the plan was so designed as to deprive the employees of their statutory right to receive for all hours worked in excess of the first regular 40 hours one and one-half times the actual regular rate. The statutory maximum workweek of 40 hours was by contract twisted into an 80 hour maximum workweek. No plan so obviously inconsistent with the statutory purpose can lay a claim to legality.\n The split-day plan, moreover, violated the basic rules for computing correctly the actual regular rate contemplated by Section 7(a). While the words 'regular rate' are not defined in the Act, they obviously mean the hourly rate actually paid for the normal, non-overtime workweek. Overnight Motor Co. v. Missel, supra. To compute this regular rate for respondent's employees, assuming the same wages and tours, required only the simple process of dividing the wages received for each tour by the number of hours in that tour. \n4\n This regular rate was \n\n[323 \nU.S. 37, 41]\n\u00a0\n then applicable to the first 40 hours regularly worked on the tours and the overtime rate (150% of the regular rate) became effective as to all hours worked in excess of 40.\n But respondent's plan made no effort to base the regular rate upon the wages actually received or upon the hours actually and regularly spent each week in working. Nor did it attempt to apply the regular rate to the first 40 hours actually and regularly worked. Instead the plan provided for a fictitious regular rate consisting of a figure somewhat lower than the rate actually received. This illusory rate was arbitrarily allocated to the first portion of each day's regular labor; the latter portion was designated 'overtime' and called for compensation at a rate one and one- half times the fictitious regular rate. Thus when an employee on regular eight hour tours had actually worked 40 hours, respondent could point to the employee's contract and claim that he had worked only 20 'regular' hours and 20 'overtime' hours. Hence he was entitled to no additional remuneration for work in excess of 40 hours except in the unlikely situation, which never in fact occurred, of his actually working more than 80 hours. The vice of respondent's plan lay in the fact that the contract regular rate did not represent the rate which was actually paid for ordinary, non-overtime hours, nor did it allow extra compensation to be paid for true overtime hours. It was derived not from the actual hours and wages but from ingenious mathematical manipulations, with the sole purpose being to perpetuate the pre-statutory wage scale. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n[323 \nU.S. 37, 42]\n\u00a0\n It is no answer that the artificial regular rate was a product of contract or that it was in excess of the statutory minimum. The Act clearly contemplates the setting of the regular rate in a bona fide manner through wage negotiations between employer and employee, provided that the statutory minimum is respected. But this freedom of contract does not include the right to compute the regular rate in a wholly unrealistic and artificial manner so as to negate the statutory purposes. Even when wages exceed the minimum prescribed by Congress, the parties to the contract must respect the statutory policy of requiring the employer to pay one and one-half times the regular hourly rate for all hours actually worked in excess of 40. Any other conclusion in this case would exalt ingenuity over reality and would open the door to insidious disregard of the rights protected by the Act.\n Nothing in this Court's decision in Walling v. Belo Corp., supra, sanctions the use of the split-day plan. The controversy there centered about the question whether the regular rate should be computed from the guaranteed weekly wage or whether it should be identical with the hourly rate set forth in the employment contract. There was no question, as here, pertaining to the applicability of the regular rate to the first 40 hours actually and regularly worked, with the overtime rate applying to all hours worked in excess thereof.\n One final point remains. Petitioner here filed a complaint in the District Court seeking, in part, an injunction to compel respondent to cease its use of the split-day contracts. Two months after the complaint was filed, but \n\n[323 \nU.S. 37, 43]\n\u00a0\n before the case came on for trial, respondent discontinued the use of these contracts and substituted different compensation plans not now before us. The District Court, however, denied the injunction on the merits insofar as the split-day contracts were concerned, and the court below affirmed on a like basis. 10 Cir., 138 F.2d 705. In granting certiorari upon the question of the legality of the split-day plan we asked for a discussion of the question whether respondent's discontinuance of the plan rendered the case moot. \n321 \nU.S. 759\n, 64 S.Ct. 788. We hold that the case is not moot under these circumstances. Despite respondent's voluntary cessation of the challenged conduct, a controversy between the parties over the legality of the split-day plan still remains. Voluntary discontinuance of an alleged illegal activity does not operate to remove a case from the ambit of judicial power. See Hecht Co. v. Bowles, \n321 \nU.S. 321, 327\n, 64 S.Ct. 587; Otis & Co. v. Securities and Exchange Commission, 6 Cir., 106 F.2d 579, 583, 584. Respondent has consistently urged the validity of the split-day plan and would presumably be free to resume the use of this illegal plan were not some effective restraint made. There is thus 'an actual controversy, and adverse interest,' Lord v. Veazie, 8 How. 251, 255, with a 'subject-matter on which the judgment of the court can operate,' Ex parte Baez, \n177 \nU.S. 378, 390\n, 20 S.Ct. 673, 677; St. Pierre v. United States, \n319 \nU.S. 41, 42\n, 63 S.Ct. 910, 911\n\n\n We accordingly reverse the judgment of the court below with directions to remand the case to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Thus the rotary helpers employed by respondent formerly received $7 for each eight hour tour. Under the split-day plan, they received a 'regular rate' of 70 cents an hour for the first four hours of each tour and an 'overtime' rate of $1.05 for each of the remaining four hours. This totalled $7 for the tour. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] During the first year after the effective date of the Act the maximum was 44 hours; during the second year 42 hours; and thereafter 40 hours. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] For an employee working on twelve hour tours, it was necessary to work at least 96 hours per week before becoming entitled to increased wages under the split-day plan. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] In this case the weekly wage divided by the number of hours actually worked in the week would have yielded the same regular rate. Under either computation, a rotary helper being paid $7 for each eight hour tour was receiving 87 1\/2 cents per hour. This was his regular rate regardless of the number of tours per week. That rate was applicable to the first 40 hours regularly worked, or to the first five tours. For all hours in excess of 40, the rotary helper was entitled to one and one-half times that rate, or $1.31 1\/4. We, of course, express no opinion as to the proper computation of the regular rate under other circumstances. Nor do we intend to indicate that the formula we have used as satisfying the statutory requirements is the only one which respondent could adopt as complying with them. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] In paragraph 70(4) of Interpretative Bulletin No. 4, as revised in November, 1940, the Administrator expressed his opinion that a plan similar to that of respondent's did not conform to the Act. While this opinion is not binding on the administration of the Act, it does 'carry persuasiveness as an expression of the view of those experienced in the administration of the Act and acting with the advice of a staff specializing in its interpretation and application.'

REUTER, INC.(1944)\nNo. 436\nArgued: March 10, 1944Decided: April 10, 1944\n\n\n\n\n[321 \nU.S. 671, 672]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Douglas B. Maggs, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Frank S. Normann, of New Orleans, La., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner brought this suit pursuant to  17 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of June 25, 1938, 52 Stat. 1060, 29 U.S.C.  201 et seq., 29 U.S.C.A.  201 et seq., to restrain respondent, a Louisiana corporation, from violating the Act. The District Court found violations of  6, 7, 15( a)(1)(2) and (5) of the Act and gave judgment permanently restraining respondent, 'its agents, servants, employees and attorneys, and all persons acting or claiming to act in its behalf or interest' from further violations. On appeal the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, 137 F.2d 315, and remanded the cause to the District Court for further proceedings. This Court granted certiorari, \n320 \nU.S. 731\n, 64 S.Ct. 205.\n The present proceeding is a motion to recall the writ of certiorari, submitted by the attorney who has appeared for respondent in this Court and in the two courts below. His motion is based upon the affidavit of James V. Reuter, described as the former president of the respondent corporation, from which it appears that on December 15, 1943, shortly after this Court had granted certiorari, Reuter and two others, being all the stockholders of respondent, duly \n\n[321 \nU.S. 671, 673]\n\u00a0\n signed a consent that the corporation be dissolved and that Reuter be designated its liquidator; and that one day later, on December 16, 1943, Reuter, as liquidator, certified that the corporation had been 'completely would up and is dissolved'. Upon filing the consent and certificate with the Secretary of State, with proof of publication of the notice of dissolution, the Secretary of State issued his certificate of December 31, 1943, certifying that the corporation 'stands dissolved'. See  54 of Act 250 of the Louisiana Legislature of 1928 as amended by  1 of Act 65 of 1932, and  62 and 64 of Act 250 of the Louisiana Legislature of 1928. The purpose of the dissolution is stated to have been to secure tax advantages.\n In support of the motion it is argued that since the corporation is, by Louisiana law, now dissolved without any prolongation of its life for the purpose of continuing pending litigation against it, see McCoy v. State Line Oil & Gas Co., 180 La. 579, 583, 157 So. 116, the case has become moot; and further that, for want of a party respondent, this Court is without power to render any effective judgment in the appellate proceeding now pending before it. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n In the present posture of the case we think it plain that the moving papers fail to establish that the case is moot \n\n[321 \nU.S. 671, 674]\n\u00a0\n or has abated merely because of the dissolution of the corporate defendant. See United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Ass'n, \n166 \nU.S. 290\n, 307-310, 17 S.Ct. 540, 546, 547; cf. Southern Pac. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Comm., \n219 \nU.S. 433, 452\n, 31 S.Ct. 288, 294; Southern Pac. Terminal Co. v. Interstate Commerce Comm., \n219 \nU.S. 498\n, 514- 516, 31 S.Ct. 279, 283, 284; Leonard and Leonard v. Earle, \n279 \nU.S. 392, 398\n, 49 S.Ct. 372, 374. The judgment rendered by the District Court determined, subject only to resort to the prescribed appellate review of the judgment, the right of the administrator to an injunction restraining the corporation and those associated or identified with it from violating the statute. Not only is such an injunction enforcible by contempt proceedings against the corporation, its agents and officers and those individuals associated with it in the conduct of its business, Wilson v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 361, 376\n, 377 S., 31 S.Ct. 538, 542, 543, Ann.Cas.1912D, 558; cf. In re Lennon, \n166 \nU.S. 548\n, 17 S.Ct. 658, but it may also, in appropriate circumstances, be enforced against those to whom the business may have been transferred, whether as a means of evading the judgment or for other reasons. The vitality of the judgment in such a case survives the dissolution of the corporate defendant. Southport Petroleum Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, \n315 \nU.S. 100, 106\n, 107 S., 62 S.Ct. 452, 455, 456. And see, to like effect, National Labor Relations Board v.

And these principles may be applied in fuller measure in furtherance of the public interest, which here the \n\n[321 \nU.S. 671, 675]\n\u00a0\n petitioner represents, than if only private interests were involved. See Virginian R. Co. v. System Federation, \n300 \nU.S. 515, 552\n, 57 S.Ct. 592, 601, and cases cited.\n Whether a family business, such as this one appears to be, has successfully avoided all responsibility for compliance with the judgment entered against the family corporation, by the simple expedient of dissolving it and continuing the business under the individual control of members of the family, as appears to have taken place here, is a question which it is unnecessary for us to decide on the basis of the scanty and not entirely enlightening affidavits now submitted to us. It is enough for present purposes, if the appellate procedure, rendered abortive by respondent's dissolution, has not deprived petitioner of the benefits of the judgment rendered in his favor by the District Court, that he is entitled to initiate proceedings to enforce the judgment against individuals who either disobey its command or participate in the evasion of its terms. In such proceedings the question as to how far the successor to the corporation is bound by the decree may be fully investigated by the District Court, with appropriate appellate review. The decisive question for us then is whether petitioner can be rightly deprived of the benefit of the District Court's judgment by respondent's invocation of the appellate procedure provided by the statute, followed by the frustration of that procedure by respondent's dissolution.\n It is true that this Court cannot, in the present state of the record, 2 render an effective judgment on the merits, because the sole respondent brought before us by the petition for certiorari, by reason of its dissolution, no longer has capacity to be sued, and no one has sought to procure substitution of any other person as party respondent. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 671, 676]\n\u00a0\n Such is the effect of dissolution under the Louisiana law. See McCoy v. State Line Oil & Gas Co., supra; Ortego v. Nehi Bottling Works, La.App., 182 So. 365, 367; compare Oklahoma Natural Gas Co. v. State of Oklahoma, \n273 \nU.S. 257\n, 47 S.Ct. 391. But the judgment of the District Court was entered against respondent before it was dissolved and while it was capable of being sued. Hence it was binding on respondent and, as we have been, on others who, in appropriate circumstances, may be brought within its reach. The dissolution of respondent, so long as the certificate of dissolution is not annulled, precludes enforcement of the judgment against it, but does not foreclose petitioner from asserting his rights against such order persons as may be bound by the judgment. Hence it does not follow, because the pending appellate proceeding has abated, that the judgment of the District Court has abated because of respondent's dissolution. Nor does it follow, because of this Court's inability to proceed with the appeal on the merits for want of a proper party respondent, that petitioner is to be deprived of the benefit of his judgment in the District Court, which the statute contemplates shall be undisturbed save only by pursuit to completion of the prescribed appellate procedure.\n It is a familiar practice of this Court that where for any reason the Court may not properly proceed with a case brought to it on appeal, or where for any reason it is without power to proceed with the appeal, it may nevertheless, in the exercise of its supervisory appellate power, make such disposition of the case as justice requires. When events subsequent to an appeal may affect the correctness of the judgment appealed from, this Court may vacate the judgment and remand the cause for further proceedings. State of Missouri ex rel. Wabash R. Co. v. Public Service Comm., \n273 \nU.S. 126, 131\n, 47 S.Ct. 311, 313; Patterson v.

When it is without jurisdiction to decide an appeal which should have been prosecuted to another court, it may vacate the judgment and remand the cause in order to enable the court below to enter a new judgment from which a proper appeal may be taken.

If a judgment has become moot, this Court may not consider its merits, but may make such disposition of the whole case as justice may require. United States v. Hamburg-American S.S. Co., \n239 \nU.S. 466, 477\n, 478 S., 36 S.Ct. 212, 216, 217; Heitmuller v. Stokes, \n256 \nU.S. 359, 362\n, 363 S., 41 S.Ct. 522, 523, 524; Brownlow v. Schwartz, \n261 \nU.S. 216, 218\n, 43 S.Ct. 263, 264.\n Here, for the reasons we have stated, it appears that petitioner is entitled to retain the benefit of the judgment entered in his favor by the District Court, subject only to the review of that judgment on appeal as the statute prescribes, and that that judgment is not shown to be moot or to have abated. But review of a judgment of the District Court contemplates more than a consideration of the case by the Circuit Court of Appeals alone. The losing party in that court may secure further review here upon certiorari, if he so desires and if this Court, in its discretion, grants the writ. Thus appellate review of the judgment of the District Court had not been completed when respondent was dissolved, and the full review contemplated by the statute was frustrated by that dissolution. By reason of that action, the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals, which is not final because the case is pending in this Court, cannot rightly be made the implement for depriving petitioner of the benefit of his judgment in the District Court. We conclude, therefore, that in the circumstances the only just and appropriate disposition which can be made of this case is that the judgment of the Court \n\n[321 \nU.S. 671, 678]\n\u00a0\n of Appeals be vacated, and the judgment of the District Court restored, as though respondent had taken no appeal.\n The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the cause will be remanded to the District Court, where petitioner will be free to take such proceedings for the enforcement of the judgment of the District Court, as he may deem advisable, and as may be proper in the circumstances of the case. Any order of the District Court will, of course, be subject to appropriate appellate review.\n So ordered.\n Vacated and remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In the McCoy case, it was held at pages 585, 586 of 180 La., 157 So. at page 118, that it is the duty of a liquidator of a corporation in dissolution to 'terminate in a legal manner ... by prosecuting, defending, or compromising it, all litigation pending in which the corporation is a party'. The court further stated that 'the Legislature had no intention of sanctioning the issuance of a certificate of dissolution' where the liquidator had failed to discharge that duty, to the injury of opposing litigants. The Louisiana court deemed it appropriate in that case to annul the certificate of dissolution of the corporation there involved, in view of its liquidator's failure to terminate in a legal manner, prior to dissolution, the suit there under consideration.\n We do not consider whether in this case this Court has a like power to annul the certificate of dissolution of respondent corporation, so as to permit the continuation of appellate proceedings here, for, as will appear, other disposition of the case seems more appropriate. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Compare note 1, supra. \n\n\n\n\n","136":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWALTON v. SOUTHERN PACKAGE CORPORATION(1944)\nNo. 159\nArgued: Decided: January 3, 1944\n\n\n\n Mr. Robert L. Stern, of Washington, D.C., for Administrator of Wage & Hour Division, U.S. Dept. of Labor, as amicus curiae.\n Mr. Elizabeth Hulen, of Jackson, Miss., for respondent.\n Mr. Charles F. Engle, of Natchez, Miss., for petitioner. \n\n[320 \nU.S. 540, 541]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit brought against the respondent by an employee, Fred Walton, in a Mississippi state court to recover overtime compensation and liquidated damages as authorized by Section 16(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. 1 Walton died before the case was tried and the suit was revived by his administratrix, the petitioner here. A judgment for the petitioner rendered by the trial court was reversed by the Mississippi Supreme Court2 on the ground that Walton had not been employed in the production of goods for interstate commerce or in 'any process or occupation necessary to the production thereof',3 and therefore was not covered by the Act. We granted certiorari because this interpretation of the Act raised a federal question of importance and because of the claim by petitioner that the interpretation was in conflict with our decision in A. B. Kirschbaum Co. v. Walling, \n316 \nU.S. 517\n, 62 S.Ct. 1116\n\n\n The case was tried on an agreed statement of facts which in brief summary showed:\n The respondent operated a plant in Mississippi in which veneer was manufactured from logs. A substantial portion of the manufactured product was destined for shipment in interstate commerce. Walton worked at the plant as a night watchman. His work week ex- \n\n[320 \nU.S. 540, 542]\n\u00a0\n ceeded the maximum hours prescribed by the Fair Labor Standards Act during the period in question. His duties were to make hourly rounds of the plant, punch the nightwatchman's clocks at various stations on the plant, and report any fires and trespassers. The fire insurance company which insured the plant's buildings, machinery, and fixtures required respondent to have a night watchman as a condition to granting reduced premium rates. Respondent's desire to obtain these reduced rates was the primary reason why Walton was employed. The plant was not operated at night while Walton was on duty and he did not physically assist in the manufacture of shipment of veneer.\n In holding that these facts fell short of proving that Walton's work was 'necessary to the production' of respondent's goods, the Mississippi Supreme Court particularly emphasized that Walton had no other duties to perform in addition to his regular duties as a night watchman; that he engaged in no manual activities connected with production; that he was not specially employed to protect goods assembled for manufacture or awaiting shipment in interstate commerce; and that no goods were manufactured during the hours he was on guard. Under our decision in the Kirschbaum, case, supra, no one of these facts standing alone, nor all of them together, can support the Court's conclusion that the nature of Walton's employment left him without the Act's protection. His duty was to aid in protecting the building, machinery, and equipment from injury or destruction by fire or trespass. The very fact that a fire insurance company was willing to reduce its premiums upon condition that a night watchman be kept on guard is evidence that a watchman would make a valuable contribution to the continuous production of respondent's goods. 'The maintenance of a safe, habitable building is indispensible to that activity.' A. B. Kirschbaum Co. v. Walling, supra, \n316 \nU.S. 524\n, 62 S.Ct. 1120. The relationship of Walton's employment to production was therefore not 'tenuous' but \n\n[320 \nU.S. 540, 543]\n\u00a0\n had that 'close and immediate tie with the process of production for commerce' which brought him within the coverage of the Act. Id., \n316 \nU.S. 525\n, 62 S.Ct. 1121.\n The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to the Mississippi Supreme Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS, considering himself bound by the decision in A. B. Kirschbaum Co. v. Walling, \n316 \nU.S. 517\n, 62 S.Ct. 1116, concurs in the result. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 52 Stat. 1069, U.S.C.

S.(1944)\nNo. 565\nArgued: March 10, 1944Decided: May 29, 1944\n\n\n\n Mr. Van B. Wake, of Milwaukee, Wis., for petitioner.\n Samuel O. Clark, Jr., Asst. Atty. Gen., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice RUTLEDGE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Wisconsin Gas and Electric Company is a Wisconsin corporation engaged in public utility and associated operations wholly within that State. In 1935 it declared a dividend from its public utility earnings, and in accord- \n\n[322 \nU.S. 526, 527]\n\u00a0\n ance with the requirements of Wisconsin's Privilege Dividend Tax Act ( Wisconsin Laws of 1935, c. 505,  3; c. 552), paid to the State two and one-half per cent of the amount of dividends thus declared. It now claims this sum, $3,750, as a deduction from its gross income for 1935 for federal income tax purposes.\n After the claim was disallowed and a deficiency assessed, the company paid the tax and brought this suit for refund under 28 U.S.C.  41(20), 28 U.S.C.A.  41(20). The District Court was of the opinion that the decision in Wisconsin v. J. C. Penney Co., \n311 \nU.S. 435\n, 61 S.Ct. 246, 130 A.L.R. 1229, required permitting the deduction under Section 23(c) of the Revenue Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 680, 688, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code  23( c). It therefore gave judgment for the company. 46 F.Supp. 929. The Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed on this question and, holding the deficiency correctly determined, reversed the judgment. 7 Cir., 138 F.2d 597. We granted certiorari, \n321 \nU.S. 757\n, 64 S.Ct. 523, because of the claimed conflict with the Penney case and the importance of the question in the administration of the revenue laws.\n Petitioner's claim for a refund rests on the assertion it was entitled to deduct the Privilege Dividend Tax payments under either Section 23(c) or Section 23(d) of the Revenue Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 680, 688, 689.\n Section 23(c) allows a taxpayer to deduct from gross income 'taxes paid or accrued within the taxable year.' The relevant Treasury Regulation, which is of long standing,1 includes among 'taxes paid' those imposed by any State, and provides: 'In general taxes are deductible only by the person upon whom they are imposed.' The question in this branch of the case, therefore, comes down to whether the Privilege Dividend Tax is 'imposed' upon the corporation declaring the dividends. \n\n[322 \nU.S. 526, 528]\n\u00a0\n Resolution of that question requires examination of the Wisconsin statute and its application and interpretation by the courts of that State. Keith v. Johnson, \n271 \nU.S. 1\n, 46 S.Ct. 415, 44 A.L.R. 1432; United States v. Kombst, \n286 \nU.S. 424\n, 52 S.Ct. 616; Magruder v. Supplee, \n316 \nU.S. 394\n, 62 S.Ct. 1162. In 1935 the state Act2 provided:\n'(1) For the privilege of declaring and receiving dividends, out of income derived from property located and business transacted in this state, there is hereby imposed a tax equal to two and one-half per centum of the amount of such dividends declared ... and paid by all corporations ( foreign and local) after the passage and publication of this act and prior to July 1, 1937. Such tax shall be deducted and withheld from such dividends payable to residents and nonresidents by the payor corporation.\n\n'(2) Every corporation required to deduct and withhold any tax under this section shall, on or before the last day of the month following the payment of the dividend, make return thereof and pay the tax to the tax commission, reporting such tax on the forms to be prescribed by the tax commission.\n\n'(3) Every such corporation hereby made liable for such tax, shall deduct the amount of such tax from the dividends so declared.'3\n\n The tax is aimed at corporate earnings 'derived from property located and business transacted in' Wisconsin. Doubtless all taxes on corporate earnings are, to a greater or lesser extent, translated into economic burdens upon the shareholder. And not all such taxes can be said, for \n\n[322 \nU.S. 526, 529]\n\u00a0\n that reason, to be 'imposed' upon the shareholder. Cf. Biddle v. Commissioner, \n302 \nU.S. 573\n, 58 S.Ct. 379. However, here the burden is placed upon him, not derivatively as through an income tax upon the corporation, but directly and exclusively. While corporate earnings are the target of this tax, its specific thrust, according to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, is at their transfer as dividends to the shareholder rather than at their receipt as income by the corporation. J. C. Penney Co. v. Tax Commission, 238 Wis. 69, 298 N.W. 186, 134 A.L.R. 908. It is not imposed until dividends are declared. When imposed it is to be deducted and withheld not from earnings received by the corporation, but 'from the dividends so declared.' The sums thus paid to the State are to be deducted from the fixed dividends owed to the preferred stockholder who cannot recover his loss from the corporation. Blied v. Wisconsin Foundry & Machine Co., 243 Wis. 221, 10 N.W.2d 142. And the corporation which seeks to leave the stockholder's dividend whole by absorbing the tax itself receives no credit therefor under those provisions of the Wisconsin income tax law comparable to Section 23(c), because the State 'puts the burden of this tax upon the stockholder and not upon the corporation.' Wisconsin Gas & Electric Co. v. Wisconsin Department of Taxation, 243 Wis. 216, 10 N.W. 2d 140, 146 A.L.R. 1212\n\n\n That Wisconsin has made the corporation its tax collector by requiring it to withhold payment of a portion of the dividends and to turn that portion over to the State does not make the tax one 'imposed' upon the corporation, at least under Section 23(c) and the relevant Treasury Regulation. Compare Eliot National Bank v. Gill, 1 Cir., 218 F. 600; Porter v. United States, 9 Cir., 27 F.2d 882. The fact is that the tax is extracted from fixed dividends owed to the stockholder, not merely from his common interest in corporate earnings. Under Wisconsin decisions the impact of the tax is focused narrowly and \n\n[322 \nU.S. 526, 530]\n\u00a0\n falls independently upon each recipient of the dividend without affecting the tax burden of the corporation or other shareholders. The operation thus disclosed for the tax amply sustains the emphatic declaration of the Wisconsin Supreme Court that it is imposed upon the shareholder, not upon the corporation. This view is complemented by the interpretation of the Bureau of Internal Revenue that the tax payments, although formally made by the corporation, are deductible by the shareholder. \n4\n We conclude that the Privilege Dividend Tax is not 'imposed' upon petitioner and therefore payments of it are not deductible under Section 23(c).\n There is of course no question in this case that Wisconsin has the power, under the Federal Constitution, to impose this tax. That question was involved in Wisconsin v. J. C. Penney Co., \n311 \nU.S. 435\n, 61 S.Ct. 246, 130 A.L.R. 1229, where this Court was concerned with dividends declared by a foreign corporation doing a local business in Wisconsin. The decision was that the relationship of the State to the enterprises there shown to have been carried on within its boundaries and under the protection of its police power was such that its taxing power could constitutionally reach earnings derived from those operations, regardless of how the impost was characterized by the State. The State's power to tax earnings of that character is not dependent upon whether the tax is hinged on the receipt of them as corporate income or on the transfer and receipt of them as dividends. Nor does it depend upon whether the tax here involved is 'imposed' upon the corporation or upon the stockholder. International Harvester Co. v. Wisconsin Department of Taxation, Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing Co. v. Wisconsin Department of Taxation, \n322 \nU.S. 435\n, 64 S.Ct. 1060. In this case, where the earnings of a Wisconsin corporation doing business solely in Wisconsin are the source of the \n\n[322 \nU.S. 526, 531]\n\u00a0\n dividends, the State's power to tax their transfer and impose that tax upon the stockholder cannot be doubted.\n Petitioner also urges that if the payments are not deductible from its gross income under Section 23(c), they are deductible under Section 23( d) as 'taxes imposed upon a shareholder of the corporation upon his interest as shareholder which are paid by the corporation without reimbursement from the shareholder.' 5 The Government responds that the Privilege Dividend Tax is not the kind of tax 'upon his interest as shareholder' which Section 23(d) contemplates, and that in any event it is not one which is 'paid by the the corporation without reimbursement from the shareholder' within the meaning of the section. Since we think the Government is correct in the latter contention we have no occasion to consider whether this tax is one 'upon his interest as shareholder.'\n The origins of the present Section 23(d) in the Revenue Act of 1921 disclose that its adoption was prompted by the plight of various banking corporations which paid and voluntarily absorbed the burden of certain local taxes imposed upon their shareholders, but were not permitted to deduct those payments from gross income. \n6\n This history suggests it is the voluntary assumption of the burden of the tax, rather than acting as tax collector and paying it for another on whom the burden falls, which underpins the \n\n[322 \nU.S. 526, 532]\n\u00a0\n deduction. And this is plainly demonstrated by the requirement that to be entitled to the deduction the corporation must not be reimbursed by the shareholder for paying the tax. To pay the tax with sums which have been deducted and withheld from dividends declared and distributed amounts to obtaining the reimbursement which renders the deduction unavailable. Hence petitioner cannot prevail on Section 23(d).\n Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice JACKSON.\n Since I think this tax was not one on the corporation (See dissent in International Harvester Company v. Wisconsin Department of Taxation, \n322 \nU.S. 435\n, 64 S.Ct. 1060), I see no basis for the corporation to claim a deduction under  23(c) of the Revenue Act of 1934. The tax was on the stockholder, and it was paid by the corporation. The Company would be entitled to deductions under  23(d) if it were not reimbursed. The credit given to the corporation against a declared dividend is in my opinion a 'reimbursement' of the corporation for payment of the tax if the Wisconsin Taxing Act is valid. Notwithstanding dissenting views on that subject, I consider myself now bound by the conclusion of the Court. Hence I agree that no right to a deduction exists. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Treasury Regulation 86, Art. 23(c)(1); cf.

Appendix,  901 et seq., as amended by the Inflation Control Act of October 2, 1942, 56 Stat. 765, 50 U.S.C.App.Supp. II,  961 et seq., 50 U.S.C.A. Appendix,  961 et seq., involves an unconstitutional delegation to the Price Administrator of the legislative power of Congress to control prices; (2) whether  204(d) of the Act was intended to preclude consideration by a district court of the validity of a maximum price regulation promulgated by the Administrator, as a defense to a criminal prosecution for its violation; (3) whether the exclusive statutory procedure set up by  203 and 204 of the Act for administrative and judicial review of regulations, with the accompanying stay provisions, provide a sufficiently adequate means of determining the validity of a price regulation to meet the demands of due process; and (4) whether, in view of this available method of review,  204(d) of the Act, if construed to preclude consideration of the validity of the regulation as a defense to a prosecution for violating it, contravenes the Sixth Amendment, or works an unconstitutional legislative interference with the judicial power.\n Petitioners in both of these cases were tried and convicted by the District Court for Massachusetts upon several counts of indictments charging violation of  4(a) and 205(b) of the Act by the willful sale of wholesale cuts of best at prices above the maximum prices prescribed by  1364.451-1364.455 of Revised Maximum Price Regulation No. 169, 7 Fed.Reg. 10381 et seq. Petitioners have not availed themselves of the procedure set up by  203 and 204 by which any person subject to a maximum price regulation may test its validity by protest to and hearing before the Administrator, whose determination may be \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 419]\n\u00a0\n reviewed on complaint to the Emergency Court of Appeals and by this Court on certiorari, see Lockerty v. Phillips, \n319 \nU.S. 182\n, 63 S.Ct. 1019. When the indictments were found the 60 days period allowed by the statute for filing protests had expired.\n In the course of the trial the District Court overruled or denied offers of proof, motions and requests for rulings, raising various questions as to the validity of the Act and Regulation, including those presented by the petitions for certiorari. In particular petitioners offered evidence, which the District Court excluded as irrelevant, for the purpose of showing that the Regulation did not conform to the standards prescribed by the Act and that it deprived petitioners of property without the due process of law guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment. They specifically raised the question reserved in Lockerty v. Phillips, supra, whether the validity of a regulation may be challenged in defense of a prosecution for its violation although it had not been tested by the prescribed administrative procedure and complaint to the Emergency Court of Appeals. The District Court convicted petitioners upon verdicts of guilty. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed, 137 F. 2d 850, and we granted certiorari, \n320 \nU.S. 730\n, 64 S.Ct. 190.\n\n\n I.\n\n\n The Emergency Price Control Act provides for the establishment of the Office of Price Administration under the direction of a Price Administrator appointed by the President, and sets up a comprehensive scheme for the promulgation by the Administrator of regulations or orders fixing such maximum prices of commodities and rents as will effectuate the purposes of the Act and conform to the standards which it prescribes. The Act was adopted as a temporary wartime measure, and provides in  1(b) for its termination on June 30, 1943, unless sooner \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 420]\n\u00a0\n terminated by Presidential proclamation or concurrent resolution of Congress. By the amendatory act of October 2, 1942, it was extended to June 30, 1944\n\n\n Section 1(a) declares that the Act is 'in the interest of the national defense and security and necessary to the effective prosecution of the present war', and that its purposes are:\n'to stabilize prices and to prevent speculative, unwarranted, and abnormal increases in prices and rents; to eliminate and prevent profiteering, hoarding, manipulation, speculation, and other disruptive practices resulting from abnormal market conditions or scarcities caused by or contributing to the national emergency; to assure that defense appropriations are not dissipated by excessive prices; to protect persons with relatively fixed and limited incomes, consumers, wage earners, investors, and persons dependent on life insurance, annuities, and pensions, from undue impairment of their standard of living; to prevent hardships to persons engaged in business, ... and to the Federal, State, and local governments, which would result from abnormal increases in prices; to assist in securing adequate production of commodities and facilities; to prevent a post emergency collapse of values; ....'\n\n The standards which are to guide the Administrator's exercise of his authority to fix prices, so far as now relevant, are prescribed by  2(a) and by  1 of the amendatory Act of October 2, 1942, and Executive Order 9250, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix,  901 note, promulgated under it. 7 Fed.Reg. 7871. By  2(a) the Administrator is authorized, after consultation with representative members of the industry so far as practicable, to promulgate regulations fixing prices of commodities which 'in his judgment will be generally fair and equitable and will effectuate the purposes of this Act' when, in his judgment, their prices 'have risen or threaten to rise to an extent or in a manner inconsistent with the purposes of this Act.' \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 421]\n\u00a0\n The section also directs that\n'So far as practicable, in establishing any maximum price, the Administrator shall ascertain and give due consideration to the prices prevailing between October 1 and October 15, 1941 (or if, in the case of any commodity, there are no prevailing prices between such dates, or the prevailing prices between such dates are not generally representative because of abnormal or seasonal market conditions or other cause, then to the prices prevailing during the nearest two-week period in which, in the judgment of the Administrator, the prices for such commodity are generally representative) ... and shall make adjustments for such relevant factors as he may determine and deem to be of general applicability, including .... Speculative fluctuations, general increases or decreases in costs of production, distribution, and transportation, and general increases or decreases in profits earned by sellers of the commodity or commodities, during and subsequent to the year ended October 1, 1941.'\n\n By the Act of October 2, 1942, the President is directed to stabilize prices, wages and salaries 'so far as practicable' on the basis of the levels which existed on September 15, 1942, except as otherwise provided in the Act. By Title I,  4 of Executive Order No. 9250, he has directed 'all departments and agencies of the Government' 'to stabilize the cost of living in accordance with the Act of October 2, 1942.'1\n Revised Maximum Price Regulation No. 169 was issued December 10, 1942, under authority of the Emergency Price Control Act as amended and Executive Order No. 9250. The Regulation established specific maximum \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 422]\n\u00a0\n prices for the sale at wholesale of specified cuts of beef and veal. As is required by  2(a) of the Act, it was accompanied by a 'statement of the considerations involved' in prescribing it. From the preamble to the Regulation and from the Statement of Considerations accompanying it, it appears that the prices fixed for sales at wholesale were slightly in excess of those prevailing between March 16 and March 28, 1942,2 and approximated those prevailing on September 15, 1942. Findings that the Regulation was necessary, that the prices which it fixed were fair and equitable, and that it otherwise conformed to the standards prescribed by the Act, appear in the Statement of Considerations.\n That Congress has constitutional authority to prescribe commodity prices as a war emergency measure, and that the Act was adopted by Congress in the exercise of that power, are not questioned here, and need not now be considered save as they have a bearing on the procedural \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 423]\n\u00a0\n features of the Act later to be considered which are challenged on constitutional grounds.\n Congress enacted the Emergency Price Control Act in pursuance of a defined policy and required that the prices fixed by the Administrator should further that policy and conform to standards prescribed by the Act. The boundaries of the field of the Administrator's permissible action are marked by the statute. It directs that the prices fixed shall effectuate the declared policy of the Act to stabilize commodity prices so as to prevent war-time inflation and its enumerated disruptive causes and effects. In addition the prices established must be fair and equitable, and in fixing them the Administrator is directed to give due consideration, so far as practicable, to prevailing prices during the designated base period, with prescribed administrative adjustments to compensate for enumerated disturbing factors affecting prices. In short the purposes of the Act specified in  1 denote the objective to be sought by the Administrator in fixing prices-the prevention of inflation and its enumerated consequences. The standards set out in  2 define the boundaries within which prices having that purpose must be fixed. It is enough to satisfy the statutory requirements that the Administrator finds that the prices fixed will tend to achieve that objective and will conform to those standards, and that the courts in an appropriate proceeding can see that substantial basis for those findings is not wanting.\n The Act is thus an exercise by Congress of its legislative power. In it Congress has stated the legislative objective, has prescribed the method of achieving that objective-maximum price fixing-and has laid down standards to guide the administrative determination of both the occasions for the exercise of the price-fixing power, and the particular prices to be established. Compare Field v. Clark, \n143 \nU.S. 649\n, 12 S.Ct. 495; Hampton Jr. & Co. v. United States, 276 \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 424]\n\u00a0\n U.S. 394, 48 S.Ct. 348; Currin v.

United States, \n320 \nU.S. 81\n, 63 S.Ct. 1375.\n The Act is unlike the National Industrial Recovery Act of June 16, 1933, 48 Stat. 195, considered in Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, \n295 \nU.S. 495\n, 55 S.Ct. 837, 97 A.L.R. 947, which proclaimed in the broadest terms its purpose 'to rehabilitate industry and to conserve natural resources.' It prescribed no method of attaining that end save by the establishment of codes of fair competition, the nature of whose permissible provisions was left undefined. It provided no standards to which those codes were to conform. The function of formulating the codes was delegated, not to a public official responsible to Congress or the Executive, but to private individuals engaged in the industries to be regulated. Compare Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins, supra, 310 U.S. at page 309, 60 S.Ct. at page 915.\n The Constitution as a continuously operative charter of government does not demand the impossible or the impracticable. It does not require that Congress find for itself every fact upon which it desires to base legislative action or that it make for itself detailed determinations which it has declared to be prerequisite to the application of the legislative policy to particular facts and circumstances impossible for Congress itself properly to investigate. The essentials of the legislative function are the determination of the legislative policy and its formulation and promulgation as a defined and binding rule of conduct-here the rule, with penal sanctions, that prices shall not be greater than those fixed by maximum price regulations which conform to standards and will tend to further the policy which Congress has established. These essentials are preserved when Congress has specified the basic conditions of fact upon whose existence or occurrence, \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 425]\n\u00a0\n ascertained from relevant data by a designated administrative agency, it directs that its statutory command shall be effective. It is no objection that the determination of facts and the inferences to be drawn from them in the light of the statutory standards and declaration of policy call for the exercise of judgment, and for the formulation of subsidiary administrative policy within the prescribed statutory framework. See Opp Cotton Mills v. Administrator, supra, 312 U.S. at pages 145, 146, 61 S.Ct. at pages 532, 533, and cases cited.\n Nor does the doctrine of separation of powers deny to Congress power to direct that an administrative officer properly designated for that purpose have ample latitude within which he is to ascertain the conditions which Congress has made prerequisite to the operation of its legislative command. Acting within its constitutional power to fix prices it is for Congress to say whether the data on the basis of which prices are to be fixed are to be confined within a narrow or a broad range. In either case the only concern of courts is to ascertain whether the will of Congress has been obeyed. This depends not upon the breadth of the definition of the facts or conditions which the administrative officer is to find but upon the determination whether the definition sufficiently marks the field within which the Administrator is to act so that it may be known whether he has kept within it in compliance with the legislative will.\n As we have said: 'The Constitution has never been regarded as denying to the Congress the necessary resources of flexibility and practicality ... to perform its function.' Currin v. Wallace, supra, 306 U.S. at page 15, 59 S.Ct. at page 387. Hence it is irrelevant that Congress might itself have prescribed the maximum prices or have provided a more rigid standard by which they are to be fixed; for example, that all prices should be frozen at the levels obtaining during a certain period or on a certain date. See Union Bridge Co. v. United States, \n204 \nU.S. 364, 386\n, 27 S.Ct. 367, 374. Congress is not confined \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 426]\n\u00a0\n to that method of executing its policy which involves the least possible delegation of discretion to administrative officers. Compare McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 413 et seq.. It is free to avoid the rigidity of such a system, which might well result in serious hardship, and to choose instead the flexibility attainable by the use of less restrictive standards. Cf. Hampton v. United States, supra, 276 U.S. pages 408, 409, 48 S.Ct. at pages 351, 352. Only if we could say that there is an absence of standards for the guidance of the Administrator's action, so that it would be impossible in a proper proceeding to ascertain whether the will of Congress has been obeyed, would we be justified in overriding its choice of means for effecting its declared purpose of preventing inflation.\n The standards prescribed by the present Act, with the aid of the 'statement of the considerations' required to be made by the Administrator, are sufficiently definite and precise to enable Congress, the courts and the public to ascertain whether the Administrator, in fixing the designated prices, has conformed to those standards. Compare Kiyoshi Hirabayashi v. United States, supra, 320 U.S. at page 104, 63 S.Ct. at page 1387. Hence we are unable to find in them an unauthorized delegation of legislative power. The authority to fix prices only when prices have risen or threaten to rise to an extent or in a manner inconsistent with the purpose of the Act to prevent inflation is no broader than the authority to fix maximum prices when deemed necessary to protect consumers against unreasonably high prices, sustained in Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins, supra, or the authority to take possession of and operate telegraph lines whenever deemed necessary for the national security or defense, upheld in Dakota Cent. Tel. Co. v. State of South Dakota, \n250 \nU.S. 163\n, 39 S.Ct. 507, 4 A.L.R. 1623; or the authority to suspend tariff provisions upon findings that the duties imposed by a foreign state are 'reciprocally unequal and unreasonable', held valid in Field v. Clark, supra (\n143 \nU.S. 649\n, 12 S.Ct. 504). \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 427]\n\u00a0\n The directions that the prices fixed shall be fair and equitable, that in addition they shall tend to promote the purposes of the Act, and that in promulgating them consideration shall be given to prices prevailing in a stated base period, confer no greater reach for administrative determination than the power to fix just and reasonable rates, see Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins, supra, and cases cited; or the power to approve consolidations in the 'public interest', sustained in New York Cent. Securities Corp. v. United States, \n287 \nU.S. 12, 24\n, 25 S., 53 S.Ct. 45, 48 (Compare United States v. Lowden, \n308 \nU.S. 225\n, 60 S.Ct. 248); or the power to regulate radio stations engaged in chain broadcasting 'as public interest, convenience or necessity requires', upheld in National Broadcasting Co. v. United States, supra, 319 U.S. at page 225, 63 S.Ct. at pages 1013, 1014; or the power to prohibit 'unfair methods of competition' not defined or forbidden by the common law, Federal Trade Commission v. R. F. Keppel & Bro., \n291 \nU.S. 304\n, 54 S.Ct. 423, 426; or the direction that in allotting marketing quotas among states and producers due consideration be given to a variety of economic factors, sustained in Mulford v. Smith, supra, 307 U.S. at pages 48, 49, 59 S.Ct. at page 652, 653; or the similar direction that in adjusting tariffs to meet differences in costs of production the President 'take into consideration' 'in so far as he finds it practicable' a variety of economic matters, sustained in Hampton Jr. & Co. v. United States, supra (\n276 \nU.S. 394\n, 48 S.Ct. 349); or the similar authority, in making classifications within an industry, to consider various named and unnamed 'relevant factors' and determine the respective weights attributable to each, held valid in Opp Cotton Mills v. Administrator, supra.\n\n\n II.\n\n\n We consider next the question whether the procedure which Congress has established for determining the validity of the Administrator's regulations is exclusive so as to preclude the defense of invalidity of the Regulation in this criminal prosecution for its violation under  4(a) and \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 428]\n\u00a0\n 205(b). Section 203(a) sets up a procedure by which 'any person subject to any provision of (a) regulation (or) order' may within 60 days after it is issued 'file a protest specifically setting forth objections to any such provision and affidavits or other written evidence in support of such objections.' He may similarly protest later, on grounds arising after the expiration of the original sixty days. The subsection directs that within a reasonable time and in no event more than thirty days after the filing of a protest or ninety days after the issue of the regulation protested, whichever is later, 'the Administrator shall either grant or deny such protest in whole or in part, notice such protest for hearing, or provide an opportunity to present further evidence in connection therewith. In the event that the Administrator denies any such protest in whole or in part, he shall inform the protestant of the grounds upon which such decision is based, and of any economic data and other facts of which the Administrator has taken official notice.'\n Section 204(c) creates a court to be known as the Emergency Court of Appeals consisting of United States district or circuit judges designated by the Chief Justice of the United States. Section 204(a) authorizes any person aggrieved by the denial or partial denial of his protest to file a complaint with the Emergency Court of Appeals within thirty days after the denial, praying that the regulation, order or price schedule protested be enjoined or set aside in whole or in part. The court may issue such an injunction only if it finds that the regulation, order or price schedule 'is not in accordance with law, or is arbitrary or capricious.' Subsection ( b). It is denied power to issue a temporary restraining order or interlocutory decree. Subsection (c). The effectiveness of any permanent injunction it may issue is postponed for thirty days, and if review by this Court is sought upon writ of certiorari, as authorized by subsection ( d), its effectiveness is further \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 429]\n\u00a0\n postponed until final disposition of the case by this Court by denial of certiorari or decision upon the merits. Subsection (b).\n Section 204(d) declares:\n'The Emergency Court of Appeals, and the Supreme Court upon review of judgments and orders of the Emergency Court of Appeals, shall have exclusive jurisdiction to determine the validity of any regulation or order issued under section 2, ... of any price schedule effective in accordance with the provisions of section 206, ... and of any provision of any such regulation, order, or price schedule. Except as provided in this section, no court, Federal, State, or Territorial, shall have jurisdiction or power to consider the validity of any such regulation, order, or price schedule, or to stay, restrain, enjoin, or set aside, in whole or in part, any provision of this Act authorizing the issuance of such regulations or orders, or making effective any such price schedule, or any provision of any such regulation, order, or price schedule, or to restrain or enjoin the enforcement of any such provision.'\n\n In Lockerty v. Phillips, supra, we held that these provisions conferred on the Emergency Court of Appeals, subject to review by this Court, exclusive equity jurisdiction to restrain enforcement of price regulations of the Administrator and that they withdrew such jurisdiction from all other courts. This was accomplished by the exercise of the constitutional power of Congress to prescribe the jurisdiction of inferior federal courts, and the jurisdiction of all state courts to determine federal questions, and to vest that jurisdiction in a single court, the Emergency Court of Appeals.\n The considerations which led us to that conclusion with respect to the equity jurisdiction of the district court, lead to the like conclusion as to its power to consider the validity of a price regulation as a defense to a criminal prosecution for its violation. The provisions of  204(d), con- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 430]\n\u00a0\n ferring upon the Emergency Court of Appeals and this Court 'exclusive jurisdiction to determine the validity of any regulation or order', coupled with the provision that 'no court, Federal, State, or Territorial, shall have jurisdiction or power to consider the validity of any such regulation', are broad enough in terms to deprive the district court of power to consider the validity of the Administrator's regulation or order as a defense to a criminal prosecution for its violation.\n That such was the intention of Congress appears from the report of the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency, recommending the adoption of the bill which contained the provisions of  204(d). After pointing out that the bill provided for exclusive jurisdiction of the Emergency Court and the Supreme Court to determine the validity of regulations or orders issued under section 2, the Committee said: 'The courts in which criminal or civil enforcement proceedings are brought have jurisdiction, concurrently with the Emergency Court, to determine the constitutional validity of the statute itself.' Sen.Rep. 931, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 25. That the Committee, in making this statement, intended to distinguish between the validity of the statute and that of a regulation, and to permit consideration only of the former in defense to a criminal prosecution, is further borne out by the fact that the bill as introduced in the House had provided that the Emergency Court of Appeals should have exclusive jurisdiction to determine the validity of the provisions of the Act authorizing price regulations, as well as of the regulations themselves. H.R. 5479, 77th Cong., 1st Sess., printed in Hearings before Committee on Banking and Currency, House of Representatives, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., on H.R. 5479, pp. 4, 7, 8.\n Congress, in thus authorizing consideration by the district court of the validity of the Act alone, gave clear indication that the validity of the Administrator's regula- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 431]\n\u00a0\n tions or orders should not be subject to attack in criminal prosecutions for their violation, at least before their invalidity had been adjudicated by recourse to the protest procedure prescribed by the statute. Such we conclude is the correct construction of the Act.\n\n\n III.\n\n\n We come to the question whether the provisions of the Act, so construed as to deprive petitioners of opportunity to attack the Regulation in a prosecution for its violation, deprive them of the due process of law guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment. At the trial, petitioners offered to prove that the Regulation would compel them to sell beef at such prices as would render it impossible for wholesalers such as they are, no matter how efficient, to conduct their business other than at a loss. Section 4(d) declares that 'Nothing in this Act shall be construed to require any person to sell any commodity ....' Petitioners were therefore not required by the Act, nor so far as appears by any other rule of law, to continue selling meat at wholesale if they could not do so without loss. But they argue that to impose on them the choice either of refraining from sales of beef at wholesale or of running the risk of numerous criminal prosecutions and suits for treble damages authorized by Sec. 205(e), without the benefit of any temporary injunction or stay pending determination by the prescribed statutory procedure of the Regulation's validity, is so harsh in its application to them as to deny them due process of law. In addition they urge the inadequacy of the administrative procedure and particularly of the sixty days period afforded by the Act within which to prepare and lodge a protest with the Administrator.\n In considering these asserted hardships, it is appropriate to take into account the purposes of the Act and the circumstances attending its enactment and application as a war-time emergency measure. The Act was adopted Jan- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 432]\n\u00a0\n uary 30, 1942, shortly after our declaration of war against Germany and Japan, when it was common knowledge, as is emphasized by the legislative history of the Act that there was grave danger of war-time inflation and the disorganization of our economy from excessive price rises. Congress was under pressing necessity of meeting this danger by a practicable and expeditious means which would operate with such promptness, regularity and consistency as would minimize the sudden development of commodity price disparities, accentuated by commodity shortages occasioned by the war.\n Inflation is accelerated and its consequences aggravated by price disparities not based on geographic or other relevant differentials. The harm resulting from delayed or unequal price control is beyond repair. And one of the problems involved in the prevention of inflation by establishment of a nation-wide system of price control is the disorganization which would result if enforcement of price orders were delayed or sporadic or were unequal or conflicting in different parts of the country. These evils might well arise if regulations with respect to which there was full opportunity for administrative revision were to be made ineffective by injunction or stay of their enforcement in advance of such revision or of final determination of their validity.\n Congress, in enacting the Emergency Price Control Act, was familiar with the consistent history of delay in utility rate cases. It had in mind the dangers to price control as a preventive of inflation if the validity and effectiveness of prescribed maximum prices were to be subject to the exigencies and delays of litigation originating in eighty-five district courts and continued by separate appeals through eleven separate courts of appeals to this Court, to say nothing of litigation conducted in state courts. See Sen. Rep. No. 931, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 23-5. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 433]\n\u00a0\n Congress sought to avoid or minimize these difficulties by the establishment of a single procedure for review of the Administrator's regulations, beginning with an appeal to the Administrator's specialized knowledge and experience gained in the administration of the Act, and affording to him an opportunity to modify the regulations and orders complained of before resort to judicial determination of their validity. The organization of such an exclusive procedure especially adapted to the exigencies and requirements of a nation-wide scheme of price regulation is, as we have seen, within the constitutional power of Congress to create inferior federal courts and prescribe their jurisdiction. The considerations which led to its creation are similar to, and certainly no weaker than, those which led this Court in Texas & P.R. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co., \n204 \nU.S. 426\n, 27 S.Ct. 350, 9 Ann.Cas. 1075, and the long line of cases following it, to require resort to the Interstate Commerce Commission and the special statutory method provided for review of its decisions in certain types of cases involving railway rates. As with the present statute, it was thought desirable to preface all judicial action by resort to expert administrative knowledge and experience, and thus minimize the confusion that would result from inconsistent decisions of district and circuit courts rendered without the aid of an administrative interpretation. In addition the present Act seeks further to avoid that confusion by restricting judicial review of the administrative determination to a single court. Such a procedure, so long as it affords to those affected a reasonable opportunity to be heard and present evidence, does not offend against due process. Bradley v. City of Richmond, \n227 \nU.S. 477\n, 33 S.Ct. 318; First Nat. Bank v. Board of Com'rs Weld County, \n264 \nU.S. 450\n, 44 S.Ct. 385; Anniston Mfg. Co. v. Davis, \n301 \nU.S. 337\n, 57 S.Ct. 816.\n Petitioners assert that they have been denied that opportunity because the sixty days period allowed for filing a protest is insufficient for that purpose; because the pro- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 434]\n\u00a0\n cedure before the Administrator is inadequate to ensure due process; because the statute precludes any interlocutory injunction staying enforcement of a price regulation before final adjudication of its validity; because the trial of the issue of validity of a regulation is excluded from the criminal trial for its violation; and because in any case there is nothing in the statute to prevent their conviction for violation of a regulation before they could secure a ruling on its validity. A sufficient answer to all these contentions is that petitioners have failed to seek the administrative remedy and the statutory review which were open to them and that they have not shown that had they done so any of the consequences which they apprehend would have ensued to any extent whatever, or if they should, that the statute withholds judicial remedies adequate to protect petitioners' rights.\n For the purposes of this case, in passing upon the sufficiency of the procedure on protest to the Administrator and complaint to the Emergency Court, it is irrelevant to suggest that the Administrator or the Court has in the past or may in the future deny due process. Action taken by them is reviewable in this Court and if contrary to due process will be corrected here. Hence we have no occasion to pass upon determinations of the Administrator or the Emergency Court, said to violate due process, which have never been brought here for review, and obviously, we cannot pass upon action which might have been taken on a protest by petitioners, who have never made a protest or in any way sought the remedy Congress has provided. In the absence of any proceeding before the Administrator we cannot assume that he would fail in the performance of any duty imposed on him by the Constitution and laws of the United States, or that he would deny due process to petitioners by 'loading the record against them' or denying such hearing as the Constitution prescribes. Plymouth Coal Co. v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, \n232 \nU.S. 531, 545\n, 34 S.Ct. 359, 363; Hall \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 435]\n\u00a0\n v. Geiger-Jones Co., \n242 \nU.S. 539, 554\n, 37 S.Ct. 217, 222, L. R.A. 1917F, 514, Ann.Cas.1917C, 643; State of Minnesota v. Probate Court, \n309 \nU.S. 270, 277\n, 60 S.Ct. 523, 527, 126 A.L.R. 530, and cases cited. Only if we could say in advance of resort to the statutory procedure that it is incapable of affording due process to petitioners could we conclude that they have shown any legal excuse for their failure to resort to it or that their constitutional rights have been or will be infringed. Natural Gas Co. v. Slattery, \n302 \nU.S. 300, 309\n, 58 S.Ct. 199, 203; Anniston Mfg. Co. v. Davis, supra, 301 U.S. at pages 356, 357, 57 S.Ct. at page 825; State of Minnesota v. Probate Court, supra, 309 U.S. at pages 275, 277, 60 S.Ct. at pages 526, 527, 126 A.L.R. 530. But upon a full examination of the provisions of the statute it is evident that the authorized procedure is not incapable of affording the protection to petitioners' rights required by due process.\n The regulations, which are given the force of law, are published in the Federal Register, and constructive notice of their contents is thus given all persons affected by them. 44 U.S.C.  307, 44 U.S.C.A.  307. The penal provisions of the statute are applicable only to violations of a regulation which are willful. Petitioners have not contended that they were unaware of the Regulation and the jury found that they knowingly violated it within eight days after its issue.\n The sixty days period allowed for protest of the Administrator's regulations cannot be said to be unreasonably short in view of the urgency and exigencies of wartime price regulation. \n3\n Here the Administrator is required to act initially upon the protest within thirty days after it is filed or ninety days after promulgation of the challenged regulation, by allowing the protest wholly or in part, or denying it or setting it down for hearing. (Section 203(a). \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 436]\n\u00a0\n But we cannot say that the Administrator would not have allowed ample time for the presentation of evidence. \n4\n And under  204(a) petitioners could have applied to the Emergency Court of Appeals for leave to introduce any additional evidence 'which could not reasonably' have been offered to the Administrator or included in the proceedings before him, and could have applied to the Administrator to modify or change his decision in the light of that evidence.\n Nor can we say that the administrative hearing provided by the statute will prove inadequate. We hold in Bowles v. Willingham, \n321 \nU.S. 503\n, 64 S.Ct. 641, that in the circumstances to which this Act was intended to apply, the failure to afford a hearing prior to the issue of a price regulation does not offend against due process. While the hearing on a protest may be restricted to the presentation of documentary evidence, affidavits and briefs, the Act contemplates, and the Administrator's regulations provide for, a full oral hearing upon a showing that written evidence and briefs 'will not permit the fair and expeditious disposition of the protest'.  203(a); Revised Procedural Regulation No. 1,  1300.39, 7 Fed.Reg. 8961. In advance of application to the Administrator for such a hearing we cannot well say whether its denial in any particular case would be a denial of due process. The Act requires the Administrator to inform the protestant of the grounds for his decision denying a protest, including all matters of which he has taken official notice.  203(a). In view of the provisions for the introduction of further evidence both before and after the Administrator has announced his determination, we cannot say that if petitioners had filed a protest ade- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 437]\n\u00a0\n quate opportunity would not have been afforded them to meet any arguments and evidence put forward by the Administrator, or that if such opportunity had been denied the denial would not have been corrected by the Emergency Court.\n The Emergency Court has power to review all questions of law, including the question whether the Administrator's determination is supported by evidence, and any question of the denial of due process or any procedural error appropriately raised in the course of the proceedings. No reason is advanced why petitioners could not, throughout the statutory proceeding, raise and preserve any due process objection to the statute, the regulations, or the procedure, and secure its full judicial review by the Emergency Court of Appeals and this Court. Compare White v. Johnson, \n282 \nU.S. 367, 374\n, 51 S.Ct. 115, 118.5\n In the circumstances of this case we find no denial of due process in the statutory prohibition of a temporary stay or injunction. The present statute is not open to the objection that petitioners are compelled to serve the public as in the case of a public utility, or that the only method by which they can test the validity of the regula- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 438]\n\u00a0\n tions promulgated under it is by violating the statute and thus subjecting themselves to the possible imposition of severe and cumulative penalties. See Ex parte Young, \n209 \nU.S. 123\n, 28 S.Ct. 441, 13 L.R.A.,N. S., 932, 14 Ann.Cas. 764; Wilcox v. Consolidated Gas Co., \n212 \nU.S. 19, 53\n, 54 S., 29 S.Ct. 192, 200, 48 L.R.A.,N.S., 1134, 15 Ann.Cas. 1034; Missouri Pac. R. Co. v. Tucker, \n230 \nU.S. 340\n, 33 S.Ct. 961; Oklahoma Operating Co. v. Love, \n252 \nU.S. 331\n, 40 S.Ct. 338. For as we have seen,  4(d) specifically provides that no one shall be compelled to sell any commodity, and the statute itself provides an expeditious means of testing the validity of any price regulation, without necessarily incurring any of the penalties of the Act. Compare Wadley Southern R. Co. v. State of Georgia, \n235 \nU.S. 651\n, 667-669, 35 S.Ct. 214, 220, 221.\n The petitioners are not confronted with the choice of abandoning their businesses or subjecting themselves to the penalties of the Act before they have sought and secured a determination of the Regulation's validity. It is true that if the Administrator denies a protest no stay or injunction may become effective before the final decision of the Emergency Court or of this Court if review here is sought. It is also true that the process of reaching a final decision may be time-consuming. But while courts have no power to suspend or ameliorate the operation of a regulation during the pendency of proceedings to determine its validity, we cannot say that the Administrator has no such power or assume that he would not exercise it in an appropriate case.\n The Administrator, who is the author of the regulations, is given wide discretion as to the time and conditions of their issue and continued effect. Section 2(a) authorizes him to issue such regulations as will effectuate the purposes of the Act, whenever, in his judgment, such action is necessary. Section 201(d) similarly authorizes him 'from time to time' to issue regulations when necessary and proper to effectuate the purposes of the Act. One of the objects of the protest provisions is to enable the Administrator more fully to inform himself as to the wisdom \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 439]\n\u00a0\n of a regulation through evidence of its effect on particular cases. In the light of that information he is authorized by  203(a) to grant or deny a protest 'in whole or in part.' And  204(a) authorizes the Administrator to modify or rescind a regulation 'at any time.' \n6\n Moreover  2(a) further authorizes the issue, in the Administrator's judgment, of temporary regulations, effective for sixty days, 'establishing as a maximum ... the price ... prevailing with respect to any commodity ... within five days prior to the date of issuance of such temporary regulations. ...'\n Under these sections the Administrator may not only alter or set aside the regulation, but he has wide scope for the exercise of his discretionary power to modify or suspend a regulation pending its administrative and judicial review. Hence we cannot assume that petitioners, had they applied to the Administrator, would not have secured all the relief to which they were entitled. The denial of a right to a restraining order or interlocutory injunction to one who has failed to apply for available administrative relief, not shown to be inadequate, is not a denial of due process. Natural Gas Co. v. Slattery, supra, 302 U.S. at page 310, 58 S.Ct. at page 204.\n In any event, we are unable to say that the denial of interlocutory relief pending a judicial determination of the validity of the regulation would in the special circumstances of this case, involve a denial of constitutional right. If the alternatives, as Congress could have concluded, were war-time inflation or the imposition on individuals of the burden of complying with a price regulation while its validity is being determined, Congress could constitutionally make the choice in favor of the protection of the public interest from the dangers of inflation. Compare \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 440]\n\u00a0\n Miller v. Schoene, \n276 \nU.S. 272\n, 48 S.Ct. 246, in which we held that the Fourteenth Amendment did not preclude a state from compelling the uncompensated destruction of private property in order to preserve important public interests from destruction.\n The award of an interlocutory injunction by courts of equity has never been regarded as strictly a matter of right, even though irreparable injury may otherwise result to the plaintiff. Compare Scripps-Howard Radio, Inc., v. Federal Communications Comm., \n316 \nU.S. 4, 10\n, 62 S.Ct. 875, 880, and cases cited. Even in suits in which only private interests are involved the award is a matter of sound judicial discretion, in the exercise of which the court balances the conveniences of the parties and possible injuries to them according as they may be affected by the granting or withholding of the injunction. Meccano, Ltd., v. John Wanamaker, \n253 \nU.S. 136, 141\n, 40 S.Ct. 463, 465; Rice & Adams Corp. v. Lathrop, \n278 \nU.S. 509, 514\n, 49 S.Ct. 220, 222. And it will avoid such inconvenience and injury so far as may be, by attaching conditions to the award, such as the requirement of an injunction bond conditioned upon payment of any damage caused by the injunction if the plaintiff's contentions are not sustained. Prendergast v. New York Tel. Co., \n262 \nU.S. 43, 51\n, 43 S.Ct. 466, 469; Ohio Oil Co. v. Conway, \n279 \nU.S. 813, 815\n, 49 S.Ct. 256, 257.\n But where an injunction is asked which will adversely affect a public interest for whose impairment, even temporarily, an injunction bond cannot compensate, the court may in the public interest withhold relief until a final determination of the rights of the parties, though the postponement may be burdensome to the plaintiff. \n7\n Virginian \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 441]\n\u00a0\n R. Co. v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 658, 672\n, 673 S., 47 S.Ct. 222, 228; Petroleum Exploration v. Public Service Commission, \n304 \nU.S. 209, 222\n, 223 S., 58 S.Ct. 834, 841, 842; Dryfoos v. Edwards, D.C., 284 F. 596, 603, affirmed \n251 \nU.S. 146\n, 40 S.Ct. 106; see Beaumont, S.L. & W.R. Co. v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 74, 91\n, 92 S., 51 S.Ct. 1, 7, 8. Compare State of Wisconsin v. State of Illinois, \n278 \nU.S. 367\n, 418-421, 49 S.Ct. 163, 171-173. This is but another application of the principle, declared in Virginian R. Co. v. System Federation, \n300 \nU.S. 515, 552\n, 57 S.Ct. 592, 601, that 'Courts of equity may, and frequently do, go much further both to give and withhold relief in furtherance of the public interest than they are accustomed to go when only private interests are involved.'\n Here, in the exercise of the power to protect the national economy from the disruptive influences of inflation in time of war Congress has seen fit to postpone injunctions restraining the operations of price regulations until their lawfulness could be ascertained by an appropriate and expeditious procedure. In so doing it has done only what a court of equity could have done, in the exercise of its discretion to protect the public interest. What the courts \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 442]\n\u00a0\n could do Congress can do as the guardian of the public interest of the nation in time of war. The legislative formulation of what would otherwise be a rule of judicial discretion is not a denial of due process or a usurpation of judicial functions. Cf. Demorest v. City Bank Farmers Trust Co., \n321 \nU.S. 36\n, 64 S.Ct. 384.8\n Our decisions leave no doubt that when justified by compelling public interest the legislature may authorize summary action subject to later judicial review of its validity. It may insist on the immediate collection of taxes. Phillips v. Commissioner, \n283 \nU.S. 589\n, 595-597, 51 S.Ct. 608, 611, and cases cited. It may take possession of property presumptively abandoned by its owner, prior to determination of \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 443]\n\u00a0\n its actual abandonment, Anderson Nat. Bank v. Luckett, \n321 \nU.S. 233\n, 64 S. Ct. 599. For the protection of public health it may order the summary destruction of property without prior notice or hearing. North American Cold Storage Co. v. City of Chicago, \n211 \nU.S. 306\n, 29 S.Ct. 101, 15 Ann.Cas. 276; Adams v. City of Milwaukee, \n228 \nU.S. 572, 584\n, 33 S. Ct. 610, 613. It may summarily requisition property immediately needed for the prosecution of the war. Compare United States v. Pfitsch, \n256 \nU.S. 547\n, 41 S.Ct. 569. As a measure of public protection the property of alien enemies may be seized, and property believed to be owned by enemies taken without prior determination of its true ownership. Central Union Trust Co. v. Garvan, \n254 \nU.S. 554, 556\n, 41 S. Ct. 214; Stoehr v. Wallace, \n255 \nU.S. 239, 245\n, 41 S.Ct. 293, 296. Similarly public necessity in time of war may justify allowing tenants to remain in possession against the will of the landlord, Block v. Hirsh, \n256 \nU.S. 135\n, 41 S.Ct. 458, 16 A.L.R. 165; Marcus Brown Holding Co. v. Feldman, \n256 \nU.S. 170\n, 41 S.Ct. 465. Even the personal liberty of the citizen may be temporarily restrained as a measure of public safety. Kiyoshi Hirabayashi v. United States, supra; cf. Jacobson v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts, \n197 \nU.S. 11\n, 25 S.Ct. 358, 3 Ann.Cas. 765. Measured by these standards we find no denial of due process under the circumstances in which this Act was adopted and must be applied, in its denial of any judicial stay pending determination of a regulation's validity.\n\n\n IV.\n\n\n As we have seen Congress, through its power to define the jurisdiction of inferior federal courts and to create such courts for the exercise of the judicial power, could, subject to other constitutional limitations, create the Emergency Court of Appeals, give to it exclusive equity jurisdiction to determine the validity of price regulations prescribed by the Administrator, and foreclose any further or other consideration of the validity of a regulation as a defense to a prosecution for its violation. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 444]\n\u00a0\n Unlike most penal statutes and regulations whose validity can be determined only by running the risk of violation, see Douglas v. City of Jeanette, \n319 \nU.S. 157, 163\n, 63 S.Ct. 877, 881, 882, the present statute provides a mode of testing the validity of a regulation by an independent administrative proceeding. There is no constitutional requirement that that test be made in one tribunal rather than in another, so long as there is an opportunity to be heard and for judicial review which satisfies the demands of due process, as is the case here. This was recognized in Bradley v. City of Richmond, supra, and in Wadley Southern R. Co. v. State of Georgia, supra, 235 U.S. at pages 667, 669, 35 S.Ct. at pages 220, 221, and has never been doubted by this Court. And we are pointed to no principle of law or provision of the Constitution which precludes Congress from making criminal the violation of an administrative regulation, by one who has failed to avail himself of an adequate separate procedure for the adjudication of its validity, or which precludes the practice, in many ways desirable, of splitting the trial for violations of an administrative regulation by committing the determination of the issue of its validity to the agency which created it, and the issue of violation to a court which is given jurisdiction to punish violations. Such a requirement presents no novel constitutional issue.\n No procedural principle is more familiar to this Court than that a constitutional right may be forfeited in criminal as well as civil cases by the failure to make timely assertion of the right before a tribunal having jurisdiction to determine it. O'Neil v. State of Vermont, \n144 \nU.S. 323, 331\n, 12 S.Ct. 693, 696; Barbour v. State of Georgia, \n249 \nU.S. 454, 460\n, 39 S.Ct. 316, 317; Whitney v. People of State of California, \n274 \nU.S. 357, 360\n, 362 S., 380, 47 S.Ct. 641, 642, 643, 650. Courts may for that reason refuse to consider a constitutional objection even though a like objection had previously been sustained in a case in which it was properly taken. Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v. Watson, \n287 \nU.S. 86\n, 53 S.Ct. 32, 86 A.L.R. 174. While this Court in its \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 445]\n\u00a0\n discretion sometimes departs from this rule in cases from lower federal courts, it invariably adheres to it in cases from state courts, see Brandeis J. concurring in Whitney v. People of State of California, supra, 274 U.S. at page 380, 47 S.Ct. at page 650, and it could hardly be maintained that it is beyond legislative power to make the rule inflexible in all cases. Compare Woolsey v. Best, \n299 \nU.S. 1\n, 57 S.Ct. 2, with Ex parte Siebold, \n100 \nU.S. 371\n.\n For more than fifty years it has been a penal offense for shippers and interstate rail carriers to fail to observe the duly filed tariffs fixing freight rates-including, since 1906, rates prescribed by the Commission-even though the validity of those rates is open to attack only in a separate administrative proceeding before the Interstate Commerce Commission. 49 U.S.C.  6(7), 10(1), 49 U.S.C.A.  6(7), 10(1); Armour Packing Co. v. United States, \n209 \nU.S. 56, 81\n, 28 S.Ct. 428, 435; United States v. Adams Express Co., \n229 \nU.S. 381, 388\n, 33 S.Ct. 878. It is no defense to a prosecution for departure from a rate fixed by the filed tariffs that the rate is unreasonable or otherwise unlawful, where its infirmity has not first been established by an independent proceeding before the Interstate Commerce Commission, and the denial of the defense in such a case does not violate any provision of the Constitution. United States v. Vacuum Oil Co., D.C., 158 F. 536, 539-541; Lehigh Valley R. Co. v. United States, 3 Cir., 188 F. 879, 887, 888. See also United States v. Standard Oil Co., D.C., 155 F. 305, 309, 310, reversed on other grounds, 7 Cir., 164 F. 376. Compare Pennsylvania R. Co. v. International Coal Min. Co., \n230 \nU.S. 184, 196\n, 197 S., 33 S.Ct. 893, 895, 896; Arizona Grocery Co. v. Atchison, T. & S.F.R. Co., \n284 \nU.S. 370, 384\n, 52 S.Ct. 183, 184. Similarly it has been held that one who has failed to avail himself of the statutory method of review of orders of the Secretary of Agriculture under the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921, or of the Federal Radio Commission under the Radio Act of 1927, cannot enjoin threatened prosecutions for violation of those orders, United States v. Corrick, \n298 \nU.S. 435, 440\n, 56 S.Ct. 829, 831; \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 446]\n\u00a0\n White v. Johnson, supra, 282 U.S. at pages 373, 374, 51 S.Ct. at page 118. See also Natural Gas Co. v. Slattery, supra, 302 U.S. at pages 309, 310, 58 S.Ct. at pages 203, 204.9\n The analogy of such a procedure to the present, by which violation of a price regulation is made penal, unless the offender has established its unlawfulness by an independent statutory proceeding, is complete and obvious. As we have pointed out such a requirement is objectionable only if by statutory command or in operation it will deny, to those charged with violations, an adequate opportunity to be heard on the question of validity. And, as we have seen, petitioners fail to show that such is the necessary effect of the present statute, or that if so applied as to deprive them of an adequate opportunity to establish the invalidity of a regulation there would not be adequate means of securing appropriate judicial relief in the course either of the statutory proceeding or of the criminal trial. During the present term of court we have held that one charged with criminal violations of an order of his draft board may not challenge the validity of the order if he has failed to pursue to completion the exclusive administrative remedies provided by the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940. Falbo v. United States, \n320 \nU.S. 549\n, 64 S.Ct. 346; and see Bowles v. United States, \n319 \nU.S. 33\n, 63 S.Ct. 912. We perceive no tenable ground for distinguishing that case from this.\n We have no occasion to decide whether one charged with criminal violation of a duly promulgated price regulation \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 447]\n\u00a0\n may defend on the ground that the regulation is unconstitutional on its face. Nor do we consider whether one who is forced to trial and convicted of violation of a regulation, while diligently seeking determination of its validity by the statutory procedure may thus be deprived of the defense that the regulation is invalid. There is no contention that the present regulation is void on its face, petitioners have taken no step to challenge its validity by the procedure which was open to them and it does not appear that they have been deprived of the opportunity to do so. Even though the statute should be deemed to require it, any ruling at the criminal trial which would preclude the accused from showing that he had had no opportunity to establish the invalidity of the regulation by resort to the statutory procedure, would be reviewable on appeal on constitutional grounds. It will be time enough to decide questions not involved in this case when they are brought to us for decision, as they may be, whether they arise in the Emergency Court of Appeals or in the district court upon a criminal trial.\n In the exercise of the equity jurisdiction of the Emergency Court of Appeals to test the validity of a price regulation, a jury trial is not mandatory under the Seventh Amendment. Cf. Block v. Hirsh, supra, 256 U.S. at page 158, 41 S.Ct. at page 460, 16 A.L.R. 165. Nor has there been any denial in the present criminal proceeding of the right, guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment, to a trial by a jury of the state and district where the crime was committed. Subject to the requirements of due process, which are here satisfied, Congress could make criminal the violation of a price regulation. The indictment charged a violation of the regulation in the district of trial, and the question whether petitioners had committed the crime thus charged in the indictment and defined by Congress, namely, whether they had violated the statute by willful disobedience of a price regulation promulgated by the \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 448]\n\u00a0\n Administrator, was properly submitted to the jury. Cf. Falbo v. United States, supra.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS.\n I dissent. I find it unnecessary to discuss certain of the questions treated in the opinion of the court. I am of opinion that the Act unconstitutionally delegates legislative power to the Administrator. As I read the opinion of the court it holds the Act valid on the ground that sufficiently precise standards are prescribed to confine the Administrator's regulations and orders within fixed limits, and that judicial review is provided effectively to prohibit his transgression of those limits. I believe that analysis demonstrates the contrary. I proceed, therefore, to examine the statute.\n The Powers Conferred.\n When, in his judgment, commodity prices have risen, or threaten to rise, 'to an extent or in a manner inconsistent with the purposes' of the Act the Administrator may establish 'such maximum price or maximum prices as in his judgment will be generally fair and equitable and will effectuate the purposes' of the Act.\n'So far as practicable' in establishing any maximum price he is to ascertain the prices prevailing in a specified period in 1941 but may use another period nearest to that specified because necessary data for the period specified is not available; and may make adjustments 'for such relevant factors as he may determine and deem to be of general applicability,' including several factors mentioned. Before issuing any regulation he shall 'so far as practicable' advise with representative members of the industry affected.\n\n Any regulation may provide for adjustments and reasonable exceptions which, in the Administrator's judg- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 449]\n\u00a0\n ment, are necessary and proper to effectuate the purposes of the Act. If, in his judgment, such action is necessary or proper to effectuate the purposes of the Act, he may, by regulation or order, regulate or prohibit speculative or manipulative practices or hoarding in connection with any commodity (50 U.S.C.A.Appendix  902, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix  902).\n It will be seen that whether, and, if so, when, the price of any commodity1 shall be regulated depends on the judgment of the Administrator as to the necessity or propriety of such price regulation in effectuating the purposes of the Act.\n The Supposed Standards for the Administrator's Guidance.\n The Act provides that any regulation or order must be 'generally fair and equitable' in the Administrator's judgment; but coupled with this injunction is another that the order and regulation must be such as, in the judgment of the Administrator, is necessary or proper to effectuate the purposes of the Act.\n I turn, therefore, to the stated purposes to ascertain what, if any, limits the statute places upon the Administrator's exercise of his powers.\n Section 1(a), 50 U.S.C.Appendix,  901(a), 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix,  901( a), states seven purposes, which should be set forth separately as follows:\n'to stabilize prices and to prevent speculative, unwarranted, and abnormal increases in prices and rents;'\n\n In order to exercise his power anent this purpose the Administrator will have to form a judgment as to what stabilization means, and what are speculative, unwarranted and abnormal increases in price. It hardly need be said that men may differ radically as to the connotation of these terms and that it would be very difficult to convict \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 450]\n\u00a0\n anyone of error of judgment in so classifying a given economic phenomenon.\n'to eliminate and prevent profiteering, hoarding, manipulation, speculation, and other disruptive practices resulting from abnormal market conditions or scarcities caused by or contributing to the national emergency;'\n\n To accomplish this purpose the Administrator must form a judgment as to what constitutes profiteering, hoarding, manipulation or speculation. As if the administrative discretion were not sufficiently broad there is added the phrase 'other disruptive practices', which seems to leave the Administrator at large in the formation of opinion as to whether any practice is disruptive.\n'to assure that defense appropriations are not dissipated by excessive prices;'\n\n It is not clear-to me at least-what is the limit of this purpose. I can conceive that an honest Administrator might, without laying himself open to the charge of exceeding his powers, make any kind of order or regulation based upon the view that otherwise defense appropriations by Congress might be dissipated by what he considers excessive prices. How his exercise of judgment in connection with this purpose could be thought excessive it is impossible for me to say.\n'to protect persons with relatively fixed and limited incomes, consumers, wage earners, investors, and persons dependent on life insurance, annuities, and pensions, from undue impairment of their standard of living;'\n\n The Administrator's judgment that any price policy will tend to affect the classes mentioned in this purpose from what he may decide to be 'undue impairment of their standard of living' would seem to be so sweeping that it would be impossible to convict him of an error of judgment in any conclusion he might reach.\n'to prevent hardships to persons engaged in business, to schools, universities, and other institutions, and to the \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 451]\n\u00a0\n Federal, State, and local governments, which would result from abnormal increases in prices;'\n\n Of course Congress might have included in the catalogue of beneficiaries churches, hospitals, labor unions, banks and trust companies and other praiseworthy organizations, without rendering the 'standard' any more vague.\n'to assist in securing adequate production of commodities and facilities;'\n\n Here is a purpose which seems, to some extent at least, to permit the easing of price restrictions; for it would appear that diminishment of price would hardly assist in promoting production. Thus the Administrator, and he alone, is to balance two competing policies and strike the happy mean between them. Who shall say his conclusion is so indubitably wrong as to be properly characterized as 'arbitrary or capricious'.\n'to prevent a post emergency collapse of values;'\n\n This purpose, or 'standard', seems to permit adoption by the Administrator of any conceivable policy. I have difficulty in envisaging any price policy in support of which some economic data or opinion could not be cited to show that it would tend to prevent post emergency collapse of values.\n These seven purposes must, I submit, be considered as separate and independent. Any action taken by the Administrator which, in his judgment, promotes any one or more of them is within the granted power. If, in his judgment, any action by him is necessary or appropriate to the accomplishment of one or more of them, the Act gives sanction to his order or regulation.\n Reflection will demonstrate that in fact the Act sets no limits upon the discretion or judgment of the Administrator. His commission is to take any action with respect to prices which he believes will preserve what he deems a sound economy during the emergency and prevent what he considers to be a disruption of such a sound economy \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 452]\n\u00a0\n in the post war period. His judgment, founded as it may be, on his studies and investigations, as well as other economic data, even though contrary to the great weight of current opinion or authority, is the final touchstone of the validity of his action.\n I shall not repeat what I have said in Bowles v. Willingham, \n321 \nU.S. 503\n, 64 S.Ct. 641. I have there quoted the so-called standards prescribed in the National Industrial Recovery Act. Comparison of them with those of the present Act, and perusal of what was said concerning them in A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, \n295 \nU.S. 495\n, 55 S.Ct. 837, 97 A.L.R. 947, leaves no doubt that the decision is now overruled. There, as here, the 'code' or regulation, to become effective, had to be found by the Executive to 'tend to effectuate the policy' of the Act. (See footnote 3, p. 521.)\n The Administrator's Procedure.\n I have not yet spoken of the statutory provisions respecting the permissible procedure of the Administrator in imposing prices. Sec. 202(a), 50 U.S.C.Appendix,  922(a), 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix,  922(a) authorizes him to make such studies and investigations and to obtain such information as he deems necessary or proper to assist him in prescribing any regulation or order, or in the administration and enforcement of the Act and regulations, orders, and price schedules thereunder. The remaining subsections give him broad powers to compel disclosure of information. And he may take official notice of economic data and other facts, including facts found as a result of his investigations and studies ( 203(b), 50 U. S.C.Appendix,  923(b), 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix,  923(b).\n Each regulation or order must be accompanied by a 'statement of the considerations involved' in its issue ( 2(a), 50 U.S.C.Appendix,  902(a) 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix,  902(a). This is not a statement or finding of fact. Webster defines a term 'consideration' as 'that which is, or should be, considered as a ground of opinion or action; motive; reason.' The citizen, \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 453]\n\u00a0\n therefore, is merely to be advised of the reasons for the Administrator's action.\n How is he to proceed if he desires to challenge that action? The answer is found in  203, 50 U.S.C.Appendix,  923, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix,  923. Within a specified time after the issue of a regulation any person subject to any provision of it may file a protest 'specifically setting forth objections to any such provision and affidavits or other written evidence in support of such objections.' The Administrator may receive statements in support of the regulations and incorporate them in his proceedings. Within a time fixed he must (1) grant or deny the protest in whole or in part, (2) note it for hearing, or (3) provide an opportunity to present further evidence. His is the choice.\n If he denies the protest in whole or in part he must inform the protestant of the grounds upon which his decision was based and of any economic data or other facts of which he has taken official notice.\n This, then, is the first opportunity the protestant has to know on what the Administrator has based his 'considerations' or reasons for action. As the Emergency Court of Appeals held in Lakemore Company v. Brown, 137 F.2d 355, 359:2\n'Thus, consistently with statutory requirements, the Administrator could have waited until he had entered his order denying the protest before informing the protestant of the economic data of which he had taken official notice and of the economic conclusions which he had derived therefrom and the other grounds upon which the denial was based.'\n\n And it is to be observed that, after seeing the protestant's affidavits and the evidence, the Administrator may load the record with all sorts of material, articles, opinions, \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 454]\n\u00a0\n compilations, and what not-pure hearsay-subject to no cross-examination, to persuade the court that his order could, 'in his judgment', promote one of the 'purposes' of the Act.\n Thus is the 'record' weighted against formal complaint in court.\n Chatlos v. Brown, Em.App., 136 F.2d 490, Spaeth v. Brown, Em.App., 137 F.2d 669, and Bibb Manufacturing Co. v. Bowles, Em.App., 140 F.2d 459, amongst other cases, indicate the sort of data-although they do not exclude the use of other sorts-on which the Administrator seems to be accustomed, and to be entitled, to act. He need make no findings of fact.\n The Court Review.\n The protestant who is aggrieved by the denial or partial denial of his protest may, within a set time, file a complaint with a specially created Emergency Court of Appeals 'specifying his objections and praying that the regulation, order, or price schedule protested be enjoined or set aside in whole or in part.' The court is given exclusive jurisdiction and all other courts are forbidden to take jurisdiction to grant such relief. The court may set aside the order, dismiss the complaint, or remand the proceeding. Upon the filing and service of the complaint, the Administrator is to certify and file a transcript of such portion of the proceedings before him as are material to the complaint ( 204(a), 50 U.S. C.Appendix,  924(a), 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix,  924(a).\n The section proceeds:\n'No objection to such regulation, order, or price schedule, and no evidence in support of any objection thereto, shall be considered by the court, unless such objection shall have been set forth by the complainant in the protest or such evidence shall be contained in the transcript. If application is made to the court by either party for leave to introduce additional evidence which was either offered to the Administrator and not admitted, or which could not \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 455]\n\u00a0\n reasonably have been offered to the Administrator or included by the Administrator in such proceedings, and the court determines that such evidence should be admitted, the court shall order the evidence to be presented to the Administrator. The Administrator shall promptly receive the same, and such other evidence as he deems necessary or proper, and thereupon he shall certify and file with the court a transcript thereof and any modification made in the regulation, order, or price schedule as a result thereof; except that on request by the Administrator, any such evidence shall be presented directly to the court.'\n\n It is not difficult to picture the plight of the protestant. The Administrator's statement of considerations, without more, constitutes proof in the cause.\n In Montgomery Ward & Co. v. Bowles, Em.App., 138 F.2d 669, 670, the Administrator in his statement of considerations said that he took official notice of three propositions of the most general scope. No evidence in support of these or of any other facts upon which he relied was included in the transcript. The complainant suggested to the court the omission of pertinent matter, namely, the evidence in support of the propositions of which the Administrator said he took official notice, the evidence of various other assertions of fact in his opinion, and the particular facts and evidence upon which he based the conclusions expressed in his statement of considerations that 'the maximum prices established in this regulation are fair and equitable.' The Administrator objected to the suggestion and the court rejected it. It was held that the Act requires 'only a summary statement of the basic facts which justify the regulation.'\n Referring to  204(b), 50 U.S.C. Appendix,  924(b), 50 U.S.C.A. Appendix,  924(b), the court held that the requirement that the complainant must establish 'to the satisfaction of the court' that the regulation, order, or price schedule is not in accordance with law or is arbitrary or capricious throws upon the protestant \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 456]\n\u00a0\n the burden 'to bring forward and satisfactorily prove the invalidating facts', and added: 'Unless and until he does so the regulation is to be taken as valid and the existence of a state of facts which justify it is to be assumed without the necessity of proof thereof by the Administrator.'\n The court added that the protestant is given means of carrying this burden by filing affidavits and other evidence, but omits to refer to the fact that these affidavits and other evidence must be addressed to the Administrator's order and his most general and sweeping statement of considerations, which merely means his reasons for making the order. These affidavits and this evidence under the procedure prescribed are to be put in before the protestant even knows what data the Administrator relied upon or sees the Administrator's opinion denying his protest. It is hardly necessary to dilate upon the burden thus placed on a protestant or the extent to which he is compelled to fill the record with what he may think relevant matter only to find that he has been shooting at straws. The court further adverted to the fact that the Act permits the protestant to state in detail in connection with his protest the nature and sources of any further evidence not subject to his control upon which he believes he can rely in support of the facts alleged in his protest. Here again the protestant is under the same handicap. He must disclose all he has in mind to the Administrator before the Administrator makes any disclosure to him of the facts and data upon which that official has relied.\n Finally the court refers to the privilege given the protestant to file a brief with the Administrator and to 'request an oral hearing', without mentioning the facts that the brief can be addressed only to the reasons given in the statement of consideration, and that the Administrator is at liberty to deny the request.\n A procedure better designed to prevent the making of an issue between parties can hardly be conceived. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 457]\n\u00a0\n And the extent of the burden is further emphasized by what the Emergency Court of Appeals has said in Lakemore Co. v. Brown, supra:\n'It is objected that the Administrator thus in effect has prejudged the case; that as witness, immune from cross-examination, he has rendered an opinion which concludes the matter which is before him as judge.\n\n'This overlooks the fact that the Administrator, from the necessities of the case, does not come with a virgin mind to the consideration of a protest. He has previously performed the official act of issuing the regulation, the terms of which of course reflect his conclusions on many economic, administrative and legal questions. In this sense, he necessarily approaches consideration of a protest with certain 'preconceived notions'-to use complainant's phrase. It is the object of the protest procedure to give the Administrator a chance to reconsider any challenged provisions in the regulation in the light of further evidence or arguments which may be advanced by the protestant. What the Administrator did here was to lay his cards on the table in the protest proceedings, offering protestant an opportunity to play its trump cards, if it had any.\n\n'Of course such statements of economic conclusions thus incorporated in the record are not 'evidence.' Section 204(a) requires the transcript of the protest proceedings, filed in this court, to 'include a statement setting forth, so far as practicable, the economic data and other facts of which the Administrator has taken official notice.' Insofar as any economic generalizations or conclusions formulated by the Administrator constitute indispensable steps in his process of reasoning in denying the protest, it is for this court to say whether they have any rational basis, in performance of our statutory duty to consider whether the regulation or order should be set aside in whole or in part as being 'arbitrary or capricious.' This is so, whether the Administrator includes such generalizations and con- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 458]\n\u00a0\n clusions in his opinion accompanying the denial of the protest or, as in this case, incorporates them into the record of the protest proceedings at an earlier stage in order to afford protestant an opportunity for rebuttal.'\n\n To this may be added what the Emergency Court said in Madison Park Corporation v. Bowles, 140 F.2d 316, 324:\n'We do not decide that this Court should limit the application of the term 'generally fair and equitable' standards mentioned in the law and in discussions of its enactment while pending in Congress. It may be possible that a case will occur in which the effect of a regulation established by the Administrator clearly will be shown to be generally unfair and inequitable on grounds not mentioned. But in such a case the reasons must be clear and compelling. The Act provides the Administrator may establish such rents as in his judgment will be generally fair and equitable. Review in this Court is plainly limited. It may not substitute its judgment for the judgment of the Administrator, but may act in review only when it finds the regulation is not in accordance with law or is arbitrary and capricious. Thus if the Court finds any reasonable basis to support the view that the regulation deals fairly and equitably with the industry concerned, the regulation must stand.' (Italics in original.)\n\n When these cumulative burdens placed upon the protestant who seeks review are fairly appraised it becomes apparent that he must carry an insupportable load, and that, in truth, the court review is a solemn farce in which the Emergency Court of Appeals, and this court, on certiorari, must go through a series of motions which look like judicial review but in fact are nothing but a catalogue of reasons why, under the scheme of the Act, the courts are unable to say that the Administrator has exceeded the discretion vested in him.\n No court is competent, on a mass of economic opinion consisting of studies by subordinates of the Administrator, \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 459]\n\u00a0\n charts and graphs prepared in support of the studies, and economic essays gathered hither and yon, to demonstrate, beyond doubt, that the considerations or conclusions of the Administrator from such material cannot support the Administrator's judgment that what he has done by way of regulation or price schedule tends to prevent post war collapse of values, or to prevent dissipation of defense appropriations through excessive prices, or to prevent impairment of the standard of living of persons dependent on life insurance, or to prevent hardship to schools-to enumerate but a few of the stated purposes of the Act.\n It is not surprising that, in the thirty-one cases decided by the Emergency Court of Appeals of which I have found reports, complaints have been dismissed in twenty-eight, and but three have been remanded to the Administrator for further proceedings. \n3\n Two of the three involved no question of merits under the statutory provisions.\n The War Power.\n The Emergency Court of Appeals in Taylor v. Brown, 137 F.2d 654, overruled a challenge to the constitutional validity of the Act's delegation of legislative power to the Administrator by invocation of the 'War Power' of Congress, the powers embodied in Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution 'to declare War', 'to raise and support Armies', 'to provide and maintain a Navy,' and 'to make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution' those powers. After showing, what needs no argument, that these powers of Congress are very different from those to be exercised in peace, the court then-without a sign that it realizes the great gap in the process-assumes that one of Congress' war powers is the power to transfer its legislative function to a delegate. By the \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 460]\n\u00a0\n same reasoning it could close this court or take away the constitutional prerogatives of the President as 'War measures'.\n I am not sure how far this court's present opinion adopts the same view. There are references in it to the war emergency, and yet the reasoning and the authorities cited seem to indicate that the delegation would be good in peace time and in respect of peace time administration. And the Emergency Court of Appeals, in spite of its decision in Taylor v. Brown, supra, and its statement in Philadelphia Coke Co. v. Bowles, 139 F. 2d 349, that, as the Act is an exercise of the war power and therefore does not deprive citizens of property without due process, has, nevertheless, weighed provisions of the Act as against the guaranty of the Fifth Amendment in Wilson v. Brown, 137 F.2d 348, and in Avant v. Bowles, 139 F.2d 702.\n I am sure that my brethren, no more than I, would say that Congress may set aside the Constitution during war. If not, may it suspend any of its provisions? The question deserves a fair answer. My view is that it may not suspend any of the provisions of the instrument. What any of the branches of government do in war must find warrant in the charter and not in its nullification, either directly or stealthily by evasion and equivocation. But if the court puts its decision on the war power I think it should say so. The citizens of this country will then know that in war the function of legislation may be surrendered to an autocrat whose 'judgment' will constitute the law; and that his judgment will be enforced by federal officials pursuant to civil judgments, and criminal punishments will be imposed by courts as matters of routine.\n If, on the contrary, such a delegation as is here disclosed is to be sustained even in peacetime, we should know it.\n\n Mr. Justice RUTLEDGE, dissenting.\n I agree with the Court's conclusions upon the substantive issues. But I am unable to believe that the trial af- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 461]\n\u00a0\n forded the petitioners conformed to constitutional requirements. The matter is of such importance as requires a statement of the reasons for dissent.\n The Emergency Price Control legislation is unusual, if not unique. It is streamlined law in both substance and procedure. More than any other legislation except perhaps the Selective Service Act, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix ,  301 et seq., in the combined effect of its provisions it attenuates the rights of affected individuals. The Congress regarded this as necessary, though it sought to preserve as much of individual right as it felt was consistent with controlling wartime inflation. To that judgment we owe all deference, saving only what we owe to the Constitution.\n War such as we now fight calls into play the full power of government in extreme emergency. It compels invention of legal, as of martial tools adequate for the times' necessity. Inevitably some will be strange, if also life-saving, instruments for a people accustomed to peace and the normal working of constitutional limitations. Citizens must surrender or forego exercising rights which in other times could not be impaired. But not all are lost. War expands the nation's power. But it does not suspend the judicial duty to guard whatever liberties will not imperil the paramount national interest.\n\n\n I.\n\n\n Judged by normal peacetime standards, over-all nation-wide price control hardly has accepted place in our institutions. Notwithstanding the considerable expansion of recent years in this respect, the extension has been piecemeal. \n1\n Until now it has not enveloped the entire economy. \n2\n Whether control so extensive might be upheld in some emergency not created by war need not now be de- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 462]\n\u00a0\n cided. That it can be supported in the present circumstances and for the declared purposes there can be no doubt. It is enough, as the Court points out, that legal foundation exists in the nation's power to make war, as this has been given to Congress and the Chief Executive. Cf. Kiyoshi Hirabayashi v. United States, \n320 \nU.S. 81\n, 63 S.Ct. 1375.3\n The foundation has relevance for each of the issues. And generally it has significance for the application of peacetime precedents. Decisions made then with limitations, explicit or implied, not affected by influence of the war power and the conditions of a state of war, cannot be wholly conclusive in their limiting effect upon the exercise of war-making authority. Care must be taken therefore, in applying them, both to see that they are observed so far as the dominant necessity permits and to be equally sure they are not misapplied to hamstring essential authority. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n As it is with the substantive control, so it is with delegating legislative power. War begets necessities for this, as for imposing substantive controls, not required by the lesser exigencies of more normal periods. In this respect certainly there is as much room for difference as exists when Congress is dealing wholly with internal matters and when it is acting with the President about foreign affairs. Cf. United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., \n299 \nU.S. 304\n, 57 S.Ct. 216. Not only the broader power of Congress, but its conjunction in the particular delegation with the wider authority of the President, both as chief magistrate and as commander-in-chief, goes to sustain the greater delegation. Cf. Kiyoshi Hirabayashi v. United States, supra. But the present legislation, as the Court's opinion demon- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 463]\n\u00a0\n strates, does not go beyond the limits allowed by peacetime precedents in the substantive delegation. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n II.\n\n\n My difficulty arises from the Act's procedural provisions. They too are unusual. That is true, though each save one has been used before, and sustained, in separate applications. No previous legislation has presented quite this combination of procedural devices. \n6\n In the combination, if in nothing more, unique quality would be found. But there is more.\n Congress sought to accomplish two procedural objectives. One was to afford a narrow but sufficient method for securing review and revision of the regulations. At the same time the Act created broad and ready methods for enforcement. The short effect of the procedure is to give the individual a single channel for questioning the validity of a regulation, through the protest procedure and the Emergency Court of Appeals, with review of its decisions here on certiorari. Section 204. On the other hand, the varied and widely available means for enforcement include criminal proceedings, suits in equity, and suits for recovery of civil penalties, in the federal district courts and in the state courts. Section 205(a), (b ), (c). See also Section \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 464]\n\u00a0\n 205(d), (e), (f).7 And in all these enforcement proceedings the mandate of Section 204(d) is that the court shall have no 'jurisdiction or power to consider the validity of' a regulation, order or price schedule. The statute thus affords the individual, to question a regulation's validity, one route and that a very narrow one, open only briefly. The administrator and others, to enforce it, have many. And in the enforcement proceedings the issues are cut down so that, in a practical sense, little else than the fact whether a violation of the regulation as written has occurred or is threatened may be inquired into.8\n Disparity in remedial and penal measures does not necessarily invalidate the procedure, though it has relevance to adequacy of the remedy allowed the individual. \n9\n Congress has broad discretion to open and close the doors to litigation. In doing so it may take account of the necessities presented by such a situation as it was dealing with here. To follow the usual course of legislation and permit challenge by restraining orders, injunctions, stay orders and the normal processes of litigation would have been, in this case, to lock the barn door after the horse had been stolen. There was therefore compelling reason for Congress to balance the scales of litigation unevenly, if only it did not go too far. In no other way could it protect the paramount national interest. If the result, within the permissible limits, is harsh or inconvenient for \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 465]\n\u00a0\n the individual, that is but part of the price he, with all others, must pay for living in a nation which ordinarily gives him so much of protection but in a world which has not been organized to give it security against events so disruptive of democratic procedures.\n I have no difficulty with the provision which confers jurisdiction upon the Emergency Court of Appeals to determine the validity of price regulations or, if that had been all, with the mandate which makes its jurisdiction in that respect exclusive. Equally clear is the power of Congress to deprive the other federal courts of jurisdiction to issue stay orders, restraining orders, injunctions or other relief to prevent the operation of price regulations or to set them aside. So much may be rested on Congress' plenary authority to define and control the jurisdiction of the federal courts. Constitution, Article III, Section 2; Lockerty v. Phillips, \n319 \nU.S. 182\n, 63 S.Ct. 1019. It may be taken too, for the purposes of this case, that Congress' power to channel enforcement of federal authority through the federal courts sustains the like prohibitions it has placed on the state courts. \n10\n Without more, the statute's provisions would seem to be unquestionably within the Congressional power. Cf. Myers v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., \n303 \nU.S. 41\n, 58 S.Ct. 459.\n Congress however was not content to create a single national tribunal, give it exclusive jurisdiction to determine all cases arising under the statute, and deny jurisdiction over them to all other courts. \n11\n It provided for en- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 466]\n\u00a0\n forcement by civil and criminal proceedings in the federal district courts and in the state courts throughout the country.\n This, too, it could do, though only if adequate proceedings, in the constitutional sense, were authorized. And I agree that the enforcing jurisdiction would not be made inadequate merely by the fact that no stay order or other relief could be had pending the outcome of litigation. Confronted as the nation was with the imminent danger of inflation and therefore the necessity that price controls should become effective at once and continue so without interruption at least until invalidated in particular instances, Congress could require individuals to sustain, in deference to the paramount public interest, whatever harm might ensue during the period of litigation and until each had demonstrated the invalidity of the regulation as it affected himself. \n12\n Runaway inflation could not have been avoided in any other way. The lid had to go on, go on tight and stay tight. This necessity united with the general presumption of validity which attaches to legislation13 and Congress' power to control the jurisdiction of the courts to sustain its denial of power to all courts, including the enforcing courts, the Emergency Court and this one, 14 to suspend operation of the regulations pending final determination of validity. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 467]\n\u00a0\n The crux of this case comes, as I see it, in the question whether Congress can confer jurisdiction upon federal and state courts in the enforcement proceedings, more particularly the criminal suit, and at the same time deny them 'jurisdiction or power to consider the validity' of the regulations for which enforcement is thus sought. This question which the Court now says 'presents no novel constitutional issue' was expressly and carefully reserved in Lockerty v. Phillips, supra. The prohibition is the statute's most novel feature. In combination with others it gives the procedure a culminating summary touch and presents questions different from those arising from the other features.\n The prohibition is unqualified. It makes no distinction between regulations invalid on constitutional grounds and others merely departing in some respect from statutory limitations, which Congress might waive, or by the criterion whether invalidity appears on the face of the regulation or only by proof of facts. If the purpose and effect are to forbid the enforcing court to consider all questions of validity and thus to require it to enforce regulations which are or may be invalid for constitutional reasons, doubt arises in two respects. First, broad as is Congress' power to confer or withhold jurisdiction, there has been none heretofore to confer it and at the same time deprive the parties affected of opportunity to call in question in a criminal trial whether the law, be it statute or \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 468]\n\u00a0\n regulation,15 upon which the jurisdiction is exercised squares with the fundamental law. Nor has it been held that Congress can forbid a court invested with the judicial power under Article III to consider this question, when called upon to give effect to a statutory or other mandate.\n It is one thing for Congress to withhold jurisdiction. It is entirely another to confer it and direct that it be exercised in a manner inconsistent with constitutional requirements or, what in some instances may be the same thing, without regard to them. Once it is held that Congress can require the courts criminally to enforce unconstitutional laws or statutes, including regulations, or to do so without regard for their validity, the way will have been found to circumvent the supreme law and, what is more, to make the courts parties to doing so. This Congress cannot do. There are limits to the judicial power. Congress may impose others. And in some matters Congress or the President has final say under the Constitution. But whenever the judicial power is called into play, it is responsible directly to the fundamental law and no other authority can intervene to force or authorize the judicial body to disregard it. The problem therefore is not solely one of individual right or due process of law. It is equally one of the separation and independence of the powers of government and of the constitutional integrity of the judicial process, more especially in criminal trials.\n\n\n III.\n\n\n The idea is entirely novel that regulations may have a greater immunity to judicial scrutiny than statutes have, with respect to the power of Congress to require the courts to enforce them without regard to constitutional require- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 469]\n\u00a0\n ments. At a time when administrative action assumes more and more of the law-making function,16 it would seem the balance of advantage, if any, should be the other way. But there is none. The statute has impact upon individuals only through the regulations. They are in effect part of the Act itself, unless invalid. If invalid, they rule, just as the statute does, until set aside. And, in respect to constitutional requirements, they have no more immunity than the statute itself. \n17\n\u00a0\n\n Clearly Congress could not require judicial enforcement of an unconstitutional statute. The same is true of an unconstitutional regulation. And it is conceded that Congress could not have compelled judicial enforcement of all price regulations, without regard to their validity, if it had not given opportunity for attack upon them through the Emergency Court or if that opportunity is inadequate. But because the opportunity is afforded and is deemed adequate in the unusual circumstances, at any rate for some of its purposes, and because it was not followed, the Court holds that criminal enforcement must be given and the enforcing court cannot consider the question of validity. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 470]\n\u00a0\n If I understand it, the argument to sustain the conviction, in its broadest form, rests upon the proposition that Congress, by providing in one proceeding a constitutionally adequate mode for deciding upon the validity of a law or regulation, and requiring this to be followed within a limited time, can cut off all other right to question it and make that determination, or the failure to secure it in time, conclusive for all purposes and in all other proceedings. The proposition cannot be accepted in that broad form. To do so would mean, for instance, that if in this case a regulation had prescribed one maximum price for sales by merchants of one race or religion and a lower one for distributors of another, the judicial power of the United States would have to be exercised to convict the latter for selling at the formers' price, if they had not availed themselves of the limited review afforded by this Act. It hardly would be consistent with accepted ideas of due process or equal protection for any court to impose penalty or restraint in such a case. \n18\n And I cannot imagine this Court as sustaining such a conviction or any other as imposing it. \n19\n\u00a0\n\n The illustration is extreme and improbable of occurrence. But it serves to test the broad contention. Such a doctrine established as generally applicable would contain seeds of influence too dangerous for acceptance, more especially for the determination of criminal matters. No authority compels or enjoins this. And I am unwilling to give the idea adherence in particular applications without stating qualification which confines its possible effects \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 471]\n\u00a0\n to situations where the gravest dangers to the nation's interest exist and cannot be escaped in any other way.\n The question narrows therefore to the inquiry, in what circumstances and under what conditions may Congress, by offering the individual a single chance to challenge a law or an order, foreclose for him all further opportunity to question it, though requiring the courts to enforce it by criminal processes? This question is the most important one in the case and demands explicit attention. 'It is easy enough to say that a party has enough of a remedy if statutory review of the order is available and if he does not choose to employ that procedure he should be foreclosed from raising elsewhere the questions that could have been raised in that proceeding.' \n20\n But to make this easy assumption is at once to decide the rock-bottom issue and, in my opinion, one this Court has not determined heretofore with effects upon the criminal process like those produced in this case. \n21\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n IV.\n\n\n It is true that in a variety of situations and for a variety of reasons a person is foreclosed from raising issues, including some constitutional ones, where he has failed to exercise an earlier opportunity. Thus ordinarily issues cannot be raised on appeal which were not presented in \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 472]\n\u00a0\n the trial court. And a variant is that federal questions not raised in the state courts generally will not be considered here. \n22\n\u00a0\n\n But such instances of foreclosure, whether legislative or judicial in origin, do not support the broader basis of argument in this case. Two things are to be emphasized. One is that the previous opportunity is in an earlier phase of the same proceeding, not as here a separate and independent one of wholly different character. In other words, the determination of guilt or other matter ultimately in issue is not cut up into two separate, distinct and independent proceedings in different tribunals, in which neither body has power to consider and decide all the issues, but each can determine them only in part. The other thing for stress is that the foreclosure by failure to take the earlier chance is not universally effective. And this is true particularly of constitutional questions, some of which may be raised at any time. \n23\n While Congress has plenary power to confer \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 473]\n\u00a0\n or withhold appellate jurisdiction, cf. Ex parte McCardle, 7 Wall. 506, it has not so far been held, and it does not follow, that Congress can confer it, yet deny the appellate court 'power to consider' constitutional questions relating to the law in issue.\n If the foreclosure is not always effective when the earlier phase of litigation is wholly judicial, it hardly should be when this consists of administrative or of both administrative and judicial proceedings, still less when these are civil in character and the later enforcement phase is criminal. In the enforcement of administrative orders the courts have been assiduous, perhaps at times extremely so,24 to see that constitutional protections to the persons affected are observed. By trial and error, ways have been found to give the administrative process scope for effective action and yet to maintain individual security against abuse, especially in respect to constitutional rights. \n25\n The instances closest to the problem here have provided for attaching penalties, including criminal sanctions, to violations of orders. But generally by one method or another means have been supplied for postponing their impact, at any rate irrevocably, until after the order's validity has \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 474]\n\u00a0\n been established. \n26\n And in that effort this Court has joined. \n27\n\u00a0\n\n Whatever may be the limitations on judicial review in criminal proceedings under other administrative enforcement patterns,28 no one of these arrangements goes as far as the combination presented by this Act. It restricts the individual's right to review to the protest procedure and appeal through the Emergency Court of Appeals. Both are short-cut proceedings, trimmed almost to the bone of due process, even for wholly civil purposes, and pared down further by a short statute of limitations. Protest must be filed within the sixty-day period. After that time, no protest can be made and no review can be \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 475]\n\u00a0\n had, except upon grounds arising later. Section 203(a).29 The only right is to submit written evidence and argument to the administrator. Section 203(c). There is none to present additional evidence to the court. \n30\n Necessarily there is none of cross-examination. No court can suspend the order unless or until a judgment of the Emergency Court invalidating it becomes final. \n31\n The penalties, civil and criminal, attach at once on violation and, it would seem, until the contrary is decided, with finality. 32 At any rate \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 476]\n\u00a0\n that is the statute's purport. In short, the statute as drawn makes not only the regulation but also the penalties immediately and fully effective without regard to whether protest is made, the protest proceeding is carried to conclusion, or what the conclusion may be, except, and this is by inference, that violation after the order finally is held invalid may not be punishable.\n This is the scope and reach of the statute. It is greater than any this Court heretofore has sustained. \n33\n It places \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 477]\n\u00a0\n the affected individual just where the Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Lamar in Wadley Southern Ry. Co. v. Georgia, \n235 \nU.S. 651, 662\n, 35 S.Ct. 214, 218, said he could not be put: 'He must ... obey what may finally be held to be a void order, or disobey what may ultimately be held to be a lawful order.' Yet the Court holds this special proceeding 'adequate' and therefore effective to foreclose all opportunity for defense in a criminal prosecution on the ground the regulation is void.\n This is no answer. A procedure so summary, imposing such risks, does not meet the requirements heretofore considered essential to the determination or foreclosure of issues material to guilt in criminal causes. It makes no difference that petitioners did not follow the special procedure. The very question, posed in the Court's own terms, is whether, if they had followed it, the remedy would be adequate constitutionally. It cannot be, under previously accepted ideas, if for one who follows it to a favorable judgment the penalty yet may fall. That question the Court does not decide. Unless it is decided, the question of adequacy, in any sense heretofore received, has not been determined, or an entirely new conception of adequacy has been approved. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 478]\n\u00a0\n v.\n But there is a deeper fault, even if we assume what neither the statute nor the Court's opinion today justifies, that a potential offender who successfully challenges the constitutionality of a regulation or begins a challenge on constitutional grounds in the Emergency Court at any time before or during the criminal prosecution, cannot be convicted, at least until after final decision that the order is valid. There still remain those cases where he has either challenged unsuccessfully in the Emergency Court or has not challenged at all. In them the would-be offender is subject to criminal prosecution without a right to question in the criminal trial the constitutionality of the regulation on which his prosecution and conviction hinge. And this seems to be true without distinction as to the character of the ground on which he seeks to make the issue. To say that this does not operate unconstitutionally on the accused because he has the choice of refraining from violation or of testing the constitutional questions in a civil proceeding beforehand entirely misses the point. The fact is that if he violates the regulation he must be convicted, in a trial in which either an earlier and summary civil determination or the complete absence of a determination forecloses him on a crucial constitutional question. In short, his trial for the crime is either in two parts in two courts or on only a portion of the issues material to guilt in one court. This may be all very well for some civil proceedings. But, so far as I know, criminal proceedings of this character never before have received the sanction of Congress or of this Court. That, like many other criminals, an offender here can be punished for making the wrong guess as to the constitutionality of the regulation, I have no doubt. But that, unlike all other criminals, he can be convicted on a trial in two parts, one so summary and civil and the other criminal \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 479]\n\u00a0\n or, in the alternative, on a trial which shuts out what may be the most important of the issues material to his guilt, I do deny.\n The Sixth Amendment guarantees to the accused 'in all criminal prosecutions ... the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed ....' By Article III, Section 2, 'The Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury; and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed ....' And, by the same section, 'The judicial Power,' which is vested in the supreme and inferior courts by Section 1, 'shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made ... under their Authority.'\n By these provisions the purpose hardly is to be supposed to authorize splitting up a criminal trial into separate segments, with some of the issues essential to guilt triable before one court in the state and district where the crime was committed and others, equally essential, triable in another court in a highly summary civil proceeding held elsewhere, or to dispense with trial on them because that proceeding has not been followed. \n34\n If the validity of the \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 480]\n\u00a0\n order, on constitutional or other grounds, has any substantial relationship to the petitioners' guilt, and it cannot be denied that it does, the short effect of the procedure is to chop up their trial into two separate, successive and distinct parts or proceedings, in each of which only some of the issues determinative of guilt can be tried, the two being connected only by the thread of finality which runs from the decision of the first into the second. The effect is to segregate out of the trial proper issues, whether of law or of fact, relating to the validity of the law for violation of which the defendants are charged, and to leave to the criminal court only the determination of whether a violation of the regulation as written actually took place and whether in some other respect the statute itself is invalid. If Congress can remove these questions, it can remove also all questions of validity of the statute or, it would seem, of law.\n The consequences of this splitting hardly need further noting. On facts and issues material to validity of the regulation the persons charged are deprived of a full trial in the state or district where the crime occurs, even if the Emergency Court sits there, as it is not required to do. Their right to try those constitutional issues both of fact and of law on which a criminal conviction ultimately will hinge, is restricted rigidly to the introduction of written evidence before the administrator in a proceeding barely adequate, even under special circumstances like these, to meet the requirements of due process of law in civil proceedings. The court which makes the decision on these issues cannot consider the facts constituting the violation. It has no power to pass judgment of guilty or not guilty upon the whole of the evidence. It can only pronounce \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 481]\n\u00a0\n the law valid or invalid in a setting wholly apart from any charge of crime, from the facts alleged as its commission, and from the usual protections which surround its trial.\n On the other hand the special tribunal's judgment, rendered it may be on disputed facts as well as law, becomes binding against the accused, in the later proceeding. He cannot then dispute it, regardless of whether meanwhile the facts have changed35 or new and additional evidence has been discovered and might be tendered with conclusive effect, if it were admissible. He can tender no evidence on what may be the most vital issue in his case and one, it may likewise be, that the evidence then available would sustain overwhelmingly. The trial court must shut its eyes to all such offers of proof and, moreover, to any such issue of law.\n\n\n VI.\n\n\n A procedure so piecemeal, so chopped up, so disruptive of constitutional guaranties in relation to trials for crime, should not and, in my judgment, cannot be validated, as to such proceedings, under the Constitution. Even war does not suspend the protections which are inherently part and parcel of our criminal process. Such a dissection of the trial for crime could be supported, under our system, only upon some such notions as waiver and estoppel or res judicata, whether or not embodied in legislation. \n36\n These too are strange and inadequate vehicles for trying whether the citizen has been guilty of criminal conduct. They bar defense, while keeping prosecution open, before it begins. \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 482]\n\u00a0\n Res judicata, by virtue of a judgment in some prior civil proceeding, where different constitutional guaranties relating to the mode and course of trial have play, has not done duty heretofore to replace either proof of facts before a jury or decision of constitutional questions necessary to make up the sum of guilt in the criminal proceeding itself. Congress can invade the judicial function in criminal cases no more by compelling the court to dispense with proof, jury trial or other constitutionally required characteristics than it can by denying all effect of finality to judicial judgments. Cf. Schneiderman v. United States, \n320 \nU.S. 118\n, concurring opinion at pages 167, 168, 63 S.Ct. 1333, at pages 1356, 1357. And while, as noted above, notions of waiver and estoppel have had place in criminal proceedings to an extent not wholly defined, in some instances harshly and artificially,37 they have not had effect heretofore to enable Congress to force a waiver of defense upon the individual by offering a choice between two kinds of trial, neither of which satisfies constitutional requirements for criminal trials. Certainly when the consequences are so novel and far reaching as they may be under this procedure, both for the individual and for the judicial system, these conceptions should not be given legal establishment to bring them into being.\n To state the question often is to decide it. And it may do this by failure to reveal fully what is at stake. The question is not merely whether the protest proceeding is adequate in the constitutional sense for some of the purposes pertinent to that proceeding. It is rather what effect shall be given to the civil determination in the later and entirely different criminal trial. It is whether, by substituting that civil proceeding for decision of basic issues in the criminal trial itself, Congress can foreclose \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 483]\n\u00a0\n the accused from having them decided in that trial and thereby deprive him of the protections in trial guaranteed all persons charged with crime and thus of full and adequate defense. It is not the equivalent of that sort of defense to force one to initiate a curtailed civil suit or to cut him off shortly from all defense on the issues allocated to it, if he does not do so. Again, the question is not merely whether the individual can waive his constitutional trial of the issue of validity. It is rather whether Congress can force him to do so in the manner attempted and, beyond this, whether he and Congress together, in the combined effects of what they do, can so strip the criminal forum of its power and of its duty to abide the law of the land. And if the issue is further whether Congress can do this in some situations, respecting some issues, under more usual safeguards, the question requires attention to these important limitations. \n38\n\u00a0\n\n The procedural pattern is one which may be adapted to the trial of almost any crime. Once approved, it is bound to spawn progeny. If in one case Congress thus can withdraw from the criminal court the power to consider the validity of the regulations on which the charge is based, it can do so for other cases, unless limitations are pointed out clearly and specifically. And it can do so for statutes as well. In short the way will have been found to avoid, if not altogether the power of the courts to review legislation for consistency with the Constitution,39 then in part at least their obligation to observe its commands and more especially the guaranteed protections of persons charged with crime in the trial of their causes. This is not merely control or definition of jurisdiction. It \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 484]\n\u00a0\n is rather unwarranted abridgement of the judicial power in the criminal process, unless at the very least it is confined specifically to situations where the special proceeding provides a fair and equal substitute for full defense in the criminal trial or other adequate safeguard is afforded against punishment for violating an order which itself violates or may violate basic rights. So much should not be accomplished merely by giving to the failure to take advantage of opportunity for summary civil determination, coupled with a short statute of limitations upon its availability, the effect of a full and final criminal adjudication. To do this hardly observes the substance of 'adequacy' in criminal trials.\n From what has been said it seems clear that Congress cannot forbid the enforcing court, exercising the criminal jurisdiction, to consider the constitutional validity of an order invalid on its face. Any other view would permit Congress to compel the courts to enforce unconstitutional laws. Nor, in my opinion, can Congress forbid consideration of validity in all cases, if it can in any, where the invalidity appears only from proof of facts extrinsic to the regulation. Again the racial or religious line is obvious and pertinent. If, for instance, one charged criminally with violating the regulation should tender proof it was being enforced in a manner to deny him the equal protection of the laws, because of his racial or religious connections, it is difficult to believe the evidence could be excluded consistently with the judicial obligation. The Constitution does not make judicial observance or enforcement of its basic guaranties depend on whether their violation appears from the face of legislation or only from its application to proven facts. Snowden v. Hughes, \n321 \nU.S. 1\n, 64 S. Ct. 397; Yick Wo v. Hopkins, \n118 \nU.S. 356, 373\n, 374 S., 6 S.Ct. 1064, 1072, 1073; United States v. Carolene Products Co., \n304 \nU.S. 144\n, 152-154, 58 S.Ct. 778, 783, 784.\n For legislation not void on its face, a presumption of constitutionality attaches and remains until it is proven \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 485]\n\u00a0\n invalid or so in operation. In such cases there is no unfairness, nor any invasion of the court's paramount obligation, in requiring one who would avoid the regulations' impact to show they are not what they appear to be or that they are made to operate otherwise than as they purport or were intended. But it is one thing to say that burden must be borne within the enforcement proceeding itself and another to say it must be carried entirely outside it. To require the defendant to prove invalidity in such a situation in the criminal trial itself, upon a showing of violation of the statute, is wholly permissible. But for the court to be unable to receive tendered evidence which might disclose the statute's invalid character and effect, is quite different. Certainly, under the circumstances of this case, it would seem to be as much a violation of individual right and as much an invasion of the judicial function for Congress to command the court not to receive the evidence, regardless of its character or effect, as for it to direct the court to enforce a law or an order void on its face.\n\n\n VII.\n\n\n To sanction conviction of crime in a proceeding which does not accord the accused full protection for his rights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, and which entails a substantial legislative incursion on the constitutionally derived judicial power, if indeed this ever could be sustained, would require a showing of the greatest emergency coupled with an inability to accomplish the substantive ends sought in any other way. No one questions the seriousness of the emergency the Price Control Act was adopted to meet. And it has been urged with great earnestness that the nation's security in the present situation requires that the statute's procedure, followed in this case, be sustained to its full extent.\n That argument would be more powerful if enforcement of the statute, and thus maintenance of price control, were \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 486]\n\u00a0\n dependent upon accepting every feature. No doubt to impose the criminal sanction as has been done in this case implements the enforcement process with the deterrent effects which usually accompany that sanction. But neither its use nor enforcement of the statute's substantive prohibitions requires that the criminal court shall not consider the validity of the regulations.\n With the arsenal of other valid legal weapons available, there can be no lack of speedy and effective measures to secure compliance. The regulations are effective until invalidated. They cannot be suspended by any court, pending final decision here, if the last source of relief is sought. All the armory of equity, and with it the sanctions of contempt, are available to keep the regulations in force and to prevent violations, at least until decision here is sought and had that the regulations are invalid. The same weapons are available to enforce them permanently if they are found valid. Apart from defense when charged with crime, the individual's only avenue of escape, and that not until final decision of invalidity has been made, is by protest and appeal through the single route prescribed. Finally, in addition to all this, the dealer may be punished for crime if he violates the regulation wilfully and cannot show it is invalid either in his defense or by securing a judgment to this effect through the protest procedure. In either case, in view of the statute's curtailment of his substantive rights and the consequent increase in the burden of proving facts sufficient to nullify the regulation,40 his chance for escape \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 487]\n\u00a0\n becomes remote, to say the least. In view of all these resources and advantages, the assertion hardly is sustained that enforcement requires also depriving the accused of his opportunity for full and adequate defense in his criminal trial.\n War requires much of the citizen. He surrenders rights for the time being to secure their more permanent establishment. Most men do so freely. According to our plan others must do so also, as far as the nation's safety requires. But the surrender is neither permanent nor total. The great liberties of speech and the press are curtailed but not denied. Religious freedom remains a \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 488]\n\u00a0\n living thing. With these, in our system, rank the elemental protections thrown about the citizen charged with crime, more especially those forged on history's anvil in great crises. They secure fair play to the guilty and vindication for the innocent. By one means only may they be suspended, even when chaos threatens. Whatever else seeks to dispense with them or materially impair their integrity should fail. Not yet has the war brought extremity that demands or permits them to be put aside. Nor does maintaining price control require this. The effect, though not intended, of the provision which forbids a criminal court to 'consider the validity' of the law on which the charge of crime is founded, in my opinion, would be greatly to impair these securities. Hence I cannot assent to that provision as valid.\n Different considerations, in part at any rate, apply in civil proceedings. 41 But for the trial of crimes no proce- \n\n[321 \nU.S. 414, 489]\n\u00a0\n dure should be approved which dispenses with trial of any material issue or splits the trial into disjointed segments, one of which is summary and civil, the other but a remnant of the ancient criminal proceeding.\n The judgment should be reversed.\n I am authorized to say that Mr. Justice MURPHY joins in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The parties have not discussed in briefs or on argument, and we do not find it necessary to consider, the precise effect of this direction to stabilize prices 'so far as practicable' at the levels obtaining on September 15, 1942, upon the standards laid down by Section 2(a) of the Act and the discretion which they confer on the Administrator. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The use of the March 16-28, 1942, base period is explained by the fact that wholesale meat prices had already been stabilized at approximately that level by Maximum Price Regulation No. 169 as originally issued on June 19, 1942, 7 Fed.Reg. 4653, and by the General Maximum Price Regulation issued April 28, 1942, 7 Fed.Reg. 3153, which forbade the sale of most commodities at prices in excess of the highest price charged by the seller during March, 1942. The Statement of Considerations accompanying the latter, 2 C.C.H. War Law Service-Price Control, 42,081, explains in some detail the considerations impelling the Administrator to the conclusion that stabilization at the levels obtaining in March, 1942 would be fair and equitable and would effectuate the purposes of the Act; it considers the price levels prevailing during October 1-15, 1941, and gives reasons why price stabilization at those levels would not be practicable. The Statement of Considerations accompanying Maximum Price Regulation No. 169 as originally issued, 2 C.C.H War Law Service-Price Control, 43,369A, refers to this discussion in explanation of the continuance of the use of March, 1942, levels as a base. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] For numerous instances in which comparable or shorter periods for resort to administrative relief as a prerequisite to proceeding in the courts have been held to be sufficient, see, e.g., Bellingham Bay, etc., Co. v. City of New Whatcom, \n172 \nU.S. 314\n, 19 S.Ct. 205, (10 days); Campbell v. City of Olney, \n262 \nU.S. 352\n, 43 S.Ct. 559 (20 days); Wick v. Chelan Electric Co., \n280 \nU.S. 108\n, 50 S.Ct. 41 (18 days); Phillips v. Commissioner, \n283 \nU.S. 589\n, 51 S.Ct. 608 (60 days); Opp Cotton Mills v.

The protest procedure is designed to be conducted primarily upon documentary evidence. Sec. 203(a); Revised Procedural Regulation No. 1,  1300.29-1300.31, 1300. 39. There would thus be no purpose in the personal presence of the protestant unless the protest were set for hearing by the Administrator, and in such a case the hearing may be held at any place designated by the Administrator and before a person designated by him. Id.,  1300.39, 1300. 42. The Emergency Court of Appeals is likewise authorized to 'hold sessions at such places as it may specify' and does in fact hold sessions throughout the country as needed.  204(c); Rule 4(a) of its Rules of Procedure, 50 U.S.C.App. Supp. II following  924, 50 U.S.C.A. Appendix following section 924. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Revised Procedural Regulation No. 1 authorizes the filing at any time of a petition to amend a regulation, ( 1300.20) and authorizes the Administrator to treat a protest as a petition for amendment as well ( 1300.49). \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Congress has sought to minimize the burden so far as would be consistent with the public interest by providing expeditious procedure for the review, on protest and complaint, of a regulation's validity. Thus a protest must be filed within 60 days ( 203(a); the Administrator must take initial action on it within a reasonable time but not more than 30 days after its filing or 90 days after the issuance of the regulation ( 203(a); the complaint to the Emergency Court must be filed within 30 days ( 204(a); that Court is directed to 'prescribe rules governing its procedure in such manner as to expedite the determination of cases of which it has jurisdiction' ( 204(c); in order to promote that end as many judges as are needed may be designated to serve on it, it may sit in divisions, and may hold sessions at such places as it may specify ( 204(c ), and in fact it does sit in various parts of the country as the convenience of the parties may require; under its rules it is 'always ... open for the transaction of business' (Rule 4(a), 50 U.S.C.App., Supp. II following  924, 50 U.S.C.A. Appendix following section 924); petitions for certiorari to review its decisions must be filed within 30 days ( 204( d); and this Court is directed to advance on the docket and expedite the decision of all cases from the Emergency Court ( 204(d). We cannot assume that the Administrator, who has a vital interest in the prompt and effective enforcement of the Act, would unreasonably delay action upon a protest; if he should, judicial remedies are not lacking, see Safeway Stores v. Brown, Em.App., 138 F.2d 278, 280. \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] For other instances in which Congress has regulated and restricted the power of the federal courts to grant injunctions, see: 1.

In several cases such statutes were held to be merely declaratory of a previously obtaining rule for the guidance of judicial discretion. See e.g. In re State Railroad Tax Cases, \n92 \nU.S. 575\n, 613 (Act of March 2, 1867); Matthews v.

His principal function is single, to determine and make effective by regulation the maximum price at which a commodity may be sold. The task is vast and complex, in comparison with previously sustained price-fixing delegations, by virtue of the number of industries and items affected and the nation- wide scope of the authority. But the focus of the price-fixing function is narrow, although powerful, in its incidence upon a particular industry or operator. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] Cf.

By Section 204(d) the Emergency Court and this Court are given exclusive jurisdiction to determine the validity of the regulation and all other courts are denied 'jurisdiction or power to consider' this question and to stay, restrain, enjoin or set aside any provision of the regulation or its enforcement. The net effect is to deprive all courts of power to suspend operation of the regulation pending final decision on its validity and to keep it in force until a final judgment of the Emergency Court, or of this Court on review of its decision, becomes effective. \n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] Cf. text infra, Part III, at notes 16, 17. \n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] There hardly can be question that whenever an administrative agency, acting within the discretion validly conferred upon it by Congress, promulgates a regulation or issues an order of general applicability it is 'making the law,' as effectively as is Congress when it enacts a specific prescription, by whatever name this may be called.

And the rule against allowing collateral attack, where a judgment is involved, is relevant to the broad problem of foreclosure. \n[\nFootnote 23\n] Commonly it is said that 'jurisdictional' questions, particularly concerning the court's power to deal with the subject matter, may be raised at any stage or in a collateral attack.

White, \n259 \nU.S. 276\n, 42 S.Ct. 492. \n\n[\nFootnote 26\n] Thus, in some cases review and enforcement are concentrated exclusively in the same court. Cf. National Labor Relations Act, 49 Stat. 449, 29 U.S.C.  151 et seq., 29 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq., giving the circuit courts of appeal exclusive jurisdiction to review and enforce the board's orders, to which no penalty attaches until the board has sought and obtained an order from the court for enforcement. With this done, there is no danger the individual will be sentenced for crime for failure to comply with an invalid order. And there is none that the court will be called upon to lend its hand in enforcing an unconstitutional edict or, for that matter, one merely in excess of statutory authority. Likewise, when there is provision for stay or suspension of the order pending determination of its validity, e.g., the Securities Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 81, 15 U.S.C.  77i, 15 U.S.C.A.  77i; the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 902, 15 U.S.C.  78y, 15 U.S.C.A.  78y; the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, 49 Stat. 835, 15 U.S.C.  79x, 15 U.S.C.A.  79x. And this is true where the enforcing court is not forbidden to consider the validity of the order, a prohibition entirely novel to the Emergency Price Control Act. \n[\nFootnote 27\n] Cf. Wadley Southern Ry. v. Georgia, \n235 \nU.S. 651\n, 35 S.Ct. 214, and authorities cited. In notable instances, also, where no specific provision has been made for either judicial review or avoiding the irrevocable impact of possibly invalid administrative action, and review has not been expressly denied, the courts have been ready to find means for review and for averting the impact of the penalty until it has been had. E.g., Ex parte Young, \n209 \nU.S. 123\n, 28 S.Ct. 441, 13 L.R.A., N.S., 932, 14 Ann.Cas. 764; cf. Southern Ry. Co. v. Virginia, \n290 \nU.S. 190\n, 54 S.Ct. 148. \n[\nFootnote 28\n] Cf. McAllister, op. cit. supra, note 20; and note 26 supra. \n\n[\nFootnote 29\n] Apparently it is contemplated that the 'affidavits or other written evidence' submitted in support of the objections be filed with the protest, though later submissions may be made at times and under regulations prescribed by the administrator, or when ordered by the Emergency Court, or to that court when the administrator requests. Sections 203(a), 204(a). The administrator is authorized to permit filing of protest after the sixty days have expired solely on grounds arising after that time. Section 203(a). He is required to grant or deny the protest, in whole or in part, notice the protest for a hearing, or provide an opportunity to present further evidence, within thirty days after the protest is filed or ninety days after issuance of the regulation or order, or in the case of a price schedule ninety days from the effective date, whichever occurs later. Ibid. \n[\nFootnote 30\n] Cf. note 29 supra. In the Emergency Court of Appeals, 'no objection to (the) regulation ... and no evidence in support of any objection thereto, shall be considered ... unless such objection' has been set forth in the protest or such evidence is in the transcript. Additional evidence can be admitted only if it was 'either offered to the Administrator and not admitted (by him) or ... could not reasonably have been offered to ... or included by the Administrator in such proceedings.' In that case it is to be presented to the administrator, received by him and certified to the court together with any modification he may make in the regulation. Where the administrator so requests, however, such additional evidence 'shall be presented directly to the court.' Section 204(a). \n[\nFootnote 31\n] Cf. note 14 supra. \n[\nFootnote 32\n] That is true whether the infraction occurs before or after the time for protest or appeal has passed and, it would seem, notwithstanding the protestant may proceed with all diligence. The statute makes no provision for relieving from its penal sanctions one who follows the protest procedure to the end in case the protest eventually is sustained, if meanwhile he disobeys the order. Punishment is not made dependent on or required to await the outcome of that proceeding. Rather, the enforcing court is commanded not to consider validity. The command is unqualified, unvarying and universal. It is cast in the compelling terms of 'jurisdiction.' Under the statute's provisions, it applies as much when trial and conviction occur before the Emergency Court's decision is final as afterwards. \n\n[\nFootnote 33\n] Cf. Bradley v. Richmond, \n227 \nU.S. 477\n, 33 S.Ct. 318, which involved a state prosecution for violating a state law. In affirming the conviction this Court rejected the contention that the administrative determination on which prosecution rested was unconstitutional. But it would not follow from the fact a state might thus condition its criminal proceedings consistently with the Fourteenth Amendment's requirement of due process that Congress can do likewise for federal criminal trials. Cf. infra Part V. Wadley Southern Ry. Co. v. Georgia, supra, also involved a state suit for civil penalty for violation of a state administrative order, to which the limitations of the Sixth Amendment would not apply. The dicta which the Court regards as pointing to the validity of the procedure here do not sustain it, not only for this reason, but because the special procedure was different, did not purport to foreclose defense to enforcement if not followed, and expressly asserted that, if followed, penalty could be imposed only for violations taking place after the order was adjudicated valid, not beforehand. This case involves the very risk the Court there said could not be imposed.\n Other instances relied on by the Court involve only civil, not criminal consequences, or distinguishable instances of criminal prosecution, and therefore have no conclusive bearing here. As the Court seems to recognize, the question now presented was not presented or considered in Armour Packing Co. v. United States, \n209 \nU.S. 56\n, 28 S.Ct. 428, or in United States v. Adams Express Co., \n229 \nU.S. 381\n, 33 S.Ct. 878. And it was not involved or determined in the cited decisions, either here or in the inferior federal courts, dealing with carriers who violate tariffs framed and filed by themselves and thereby become subject to penalty. The same is true of the cases holding that threatened criminal prosecution for violation of administrative orders cannot be enjoined.\n In these decisions, none of the statutes forbade the enforcing court 'to consider the validity' of the orders, none afforded a special proceeding so summary as that provided here, and only United States v. Vacuum Oil Co., D.C., 158 F. 536, raised a constitutional question relevant here. Falbo v. United States, \n320 \nU.S. 549\n, 64 S.Ct. 346, involved a different procedure and a different and more urgent problem. Compare Part VII infra. It may be doubted the decision's effect is to preclude the enforcing court from examining constitutional questions affecting the order's validity. \n\n[\nFootnote 34\n] Nor, according to accepted notions of the criminal process, has it ever been contemplated that some of the issues of fact should be provable by confrontation of witnesses and others by written evidence only, when other evidence is or may be available. If, for instance, Congress should define an act as a crime, but should require that in the trial issues relating to the validity of the law furnishing the basis for the charge should be proven only by affidavit, though others by the normal processes of proof, the proceeding hardly could be held to comport with the kind of trial the Constitution, and more particularly the Sixth Amendment requires. And if Congress should go further and provide for determination of the issues triable only by affidavit in a court or other body sitting elsewhere than in the state and district of the crime, with other issues triable before a court with a jury empanelled there, but with that court compelled to give finality to the other's findings against the accused, the departure from constitutional requirements would seem to be only the more obvious. This is not far in effect, if it is at all, from what has been done here. \n\n[\nFootnote 35\n] His only remedy is to begin a new protest proceeding ( 203(a)), which is not only as limited in character as the original one, but under the administrator's procedural regulations must be 'filed within ... sixty days after the protestant has had, or could reasonably have had, notice' of the changed facts.

McLaren, Can a Trial Court of the United States Be Completely Deprived of the Power to Determine Constitutional Questions? (1944) 30 A.B. A.J. 17. \n\n[\nFootnote 40\n] That burden is heavy, as this case illustrates. Petitioners attacked the regulation's constitutionality on the ground that, by compelling them to sell at prices less than cost, it deprived them of their property without due process of law. And, on the same ground, they urged the regulation violates the statute's requirement that the price fixed allow margins which are 'generally fair and equitable.' But the Fifth Amendment does not insure a profit to any given individual or group not under legal compulsion to render service, where doing so would contravene an enacted policy of Congress sustainable on a balance of public necessity and private hardship. Cf. the Court's opinion herein and authorities cited; also Bowles v. Willingham, \n321 \nU.S. 503\n, 64 S.Ct. 641. And in this case both the statute's basic purpose and its terms, as well as the legislative history, cf. Sen.Rep. No. 931, 77th Cong., 2d Sess. 15, show that Congress intended to forbid only a price so low that the trade in general, not merely some individual dealers or groups, could not have the margin prescribed. Bowles v. Willingham, supra. Petitioners' offers of proof, in this respect, which the trial court rejected, went only to show that they, or at most the meat wholesalers of Boston, could sell beef only at a loss. Harsh as this may seem in individual instances, it was Congress' judgment that the interests of dealers who could not operate profitably at a level of prices permitting a fair margin generally to the trade, would have to give way, in the acute prevailing circumstances, to the paramount national necessity of keeping prices stabilized and that judgment, by virtue of those circumstances, was for Congress to make. Accordingly the tendered proof hardly was sufficient to raise an issue of confiscation giving ground for setting aside the regulation. \n It is likely that by far the greater number of challenges would arise on grounds of supposed confiscation, in which this burden would have to be met. Once it is made clear just what that burden is, the fear hardly seems justified that enforcement would swamp the agency with litigation. In any event the remedy for that would be by providing a more adequate enforcing staff, not by cutting off defense to criminal prosecutions based on invalid orders. \n\n[\nFootnote 41\n] Cf. concurring opinion in Bowles v. Willingham, 321 U.S. --, 64 S. Ct. 641. Limitations applicable solely to criminal proceedings fall to one side. Giving the decision in the special proceeding, or failure to seek it after reasonable opportunity, the effect of res judicata in later civil proceedings does not therefore deprive the party affected of opportunity for full and adequate defense in his criminal trial, where not only his rights of property, but his liberty or his life may be at stake.\n However widely the character of the special remedy may be varied to meet different urgencies, with consequences of foreclosure for civil effects, the foreclosure of criminal defense should be allowed, if at all, only by a procedure affording its substantial equivalent, in relation to special constitutional issues and in such a manner that the failure to follow it reasonably could be taken as an actual, not a forced waiver. Thus, possibly foreclosure of criminal defense could be sustained, when validity turns on complex economic questions, usually of confiscatory effects of legislation, and proof of complicated facts bearing on them. But, if so, this should be only when the special proceeding is clearly adequate, affording the usual rights to present evidence, cross-examine, and make argument, characteristic of judicial proceedings, so that, if followed, the party would have a substantial equivalent to defense in a criminal trial. And the opportunity should be long enough so that the failure to take it reasonably could be taken to mean that the party intends, by not taking it, to waive the question actually and not by forced surrender. So safeguarded, the foreclosure of such questions in this way would not work a substantial deprivation of defense.\n In respect to other questions, such as the drawing of racial or religious lines in orders or by their application, of a character determinable as well by the criminal as by the special tribunal, in my opinion the special constitutional limitations applicable to federal criminal trials, and due enforcement of some substantive requirements as well, require keeping open and available the chance for full and complete defense in the criminal trial itself. \n\n\n\n\n"}}
