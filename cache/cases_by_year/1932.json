States Supreme Court\nADAMS v. MILLS(1932)\nNo. 581\nArgued: Decided: May 23, 1932\n\n\n\n\n\n[286 U.S. 397, 399]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Franklin J. Stransky, of Chicago, Ill., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Frank H. Towner and Clair R. Hillyer, both of Chicago, Ill., for appellee Union Stock Yard & Transit Co.\n\n\n[286 U.S. 397, 403]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Sidney F. Andrews, of Washington, D. C., and A. A. McLaughlin, of Des Moines, Iowa, for respondent Mills.\n\n\n[286 U.S. 397, 405]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Daniel W. Knowlton and J. Stanley Payne, both of Washington, D. C., amicus curiae.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This action was brought, on December 10, 1928, in the federal court for Northern Illinois to enforce an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission for reparations in the sum of $140,001.25, and interest. The plaintiffs, 103 in number,1 members of the Chicago Live Stock Exchange, are commission merchants engaged in the business of buying and selling live stock at the Union Stock Yards, Chicago. The defendants are the Union Stock Yard & Transit Company, owner of the yards, and the Director General of Railroads, as agent of the President, being the officer against whom suit may be brought, under section 206 of the Transportation Act 1920 (49 USCA  74), 41 Stat. 461, on causes of action arising out of federal control. The award was made on account of an extra charge of 25 cents a car for unloading live stock received at the yards from about 174,000 different shippers, during the period of federal control, December 28, 1917 to February 29, 1920. The Commission held that the charge had been exacted under an unlawful practice; and awarded reparation to the plaintiffs, who as consignees had paid the charge found unlawful. See Chicago Live Stock Exchange v. Atchison, \n\n[286 U.S. 397, 406]\n\u00a0\n Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co., 52 I. C. C. 269; Id., 58 I. C. C. 164; Id., 100 I. C. C. 266; Id., 144 I. C. C. 175.\n The case was tried in the District Court before a jury upon the evidence introduced before the Commission and additional evidence introduced by the parties at the trial. At the close of the evidence, each defendant moved, on many grounds, for a directed verdict. The District Judge granted the motions on the ground that the plaintiffs had no such interest in the claims for reparations as would entitle them to maintain an action under section 8 and section 16(2) of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 USCA,  8, 16(2). 39 F.(2d) 80. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment; but, not being entirely satisfied that the reason assigned by the District Court was correct, rested its decision on the ground that the exaction of the extra 25-cent charge was a lawful practice. 51 F.(2d) 620. This Court granted a writ of certiorari. \n284 \nU.S. 614\n, 52 S. Ct. 208, 76 L. Ed. -.\n First. The defendants contend that, even if the exaction of the extra 25-cent charge was unlawful, the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover. The argument is that under section 8 of the Interstate Commerce Act the liability of the common carrier is 'to the person or persons injured thereby for the full amount of damages sustained in consequence of any such violation'; that before any party can recover under the act he must show, not merely the wrong of the carrier, but that the wrong has in fact operated to the plaintiff's injury; that here the award is to the plaintiffs individually, not as agents for the shippers; and that individually they suffered no pecuniary loss, since they paid the charges as commission merchants and reimbursed themselves for these, as for other, charges from the proceeds of the sale of live stock, remitting to their principals only the balance remaining. We think the argument unsound, for the reasons, among others, stated in Southern Pacific Co. v. Darnell- Taenzer Lumber Co., \n245 \nU.S. 531\n, 38 S. Ct. 186, and Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. \n\n[286 U.S. 397, 407]\n\u00a0\n Sloss-Sheffield Steel & Iron Co., \n269 U.S. 217\n, 234-238, 46 S. Ct. 73. See, also, Missouri Portland Cement Co. v. Director General, 88 I. C. C. 492, 495, 496; Doughty-McDonald Grocery Co. v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co., 155 I. C. C. 47, 49; California Fruit Exchange v. American Railway Express Co., 155 I. C. C. 105, 107.\n The plaintiffs were the consignees of the shipments, and entitled to possession of them upon payment of the lawful charges. If the defendants exacted from them an unlawful charge, the exaction was a tort, for which the plaintiffs were entitled, as for other torts, to compensation from the wrongdoer. Acceptance of the shipments would have rendered them personally liable to the carriers if the merchandise had been delivered without payment of the full amount lawfully due. New York Central & H. R. R. Co. v. York & Whitney Co., \n256 \nU.S. 406, 407\n, 408 S., 41 S. Ct. 509. Compare Union Pac. R. Co. v. American Smelting & Refining Co. (C. C. A.) 202 F. 720, 723. As they would have been liable for an undercharge, they may recover for an overcharge. In contemplation of law the claim for damages arose at the time the extra charge was paid. See Southern Pacific Co. v. Darnell-Taenzer Lumber Co., \n245 \nU.S. 531, 534\n, 38 S. Ct. 186. Neither the fact of subsequent reimbursement by the plaintiffs from funds of the shippers nor the disposition which may hereafter be made of the damages recovered is of any concern to the wrongdoers. This proceeding does not involve a controversy between the consignors and the consignees; and the carriers cannot be allowed to import one into it. Compare Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Sloss-Sheffield Steel & Iron Co., \n269 \nU.S. 217, 238\n, 46 S. Ct. 73. The rights of the shippers in the proceeds of the action will not be affected by our decision. Compare Jennison Bros. & Co. v. Dixon, 133 Minn. 268, 158 N. W. 398. Those rights might have been asserted by intervention in the proceedings before the Commission. They may still be asserted \n\n[286 U.S. 397, 408]\n\u00a0\n independently in appro priate proceedings later. The plaintiffs have suffered injury within the meaning of section 8 of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA  8); and the purpose of that section would be defeated if the tort-feasors were permitted to escape reparation by a plea that the ultimate incidence of the injury was not upon those who were compelled in the first instance to pay the unlawful charge.\n An additional reason for permitting this action is that the relation between the parties to the shipments in question was that of principal and factor, not simply that of consignor and consignee. The Commission found that, as commission merchants, the plaintiffs were empowered, by well- established usage, to pay the freight and related charges; to file claims for overcharges; and to settle with the carriers therefor. Being factors for the shippers, it was not only their right, but their duty, to resist illegal exactions. This duty did not, as the District Court suggested, terminate upon remission of the proceeds of the sale of the live stock, less the charges in fact paid. It persists, with the assent of the principals, until the claim for reparation shall have been prosecuted to a successful conclusion. It is urged, on behalf of the defendants, that the order of the Commission ran in favor of the plaintiffs, not as factors, but as individuals. The contention is contrary to the fact. 2 But the form of the order is without importance. \n\n[286 U.S. 397, 409]\n\u00a0\n The Commission has recognized the right of a factor to maintain in his own name an action in the interest of his principal. See Memphis Freight Bureau v. St. Louis & San Francisco R. Co., 57 I. C. C. 212; Texas Livestock Shippers Protective League v. Director General, 139 I. C. C. 448. No useful and would be served by requiring the joining of 174,000 shippers in this proceeding; and section 8 of the Interstate Commerce Act is not to be so construed. Compare Spiller v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co., \n253 \nU.S. 117, 134\n, 135 S., 40 S. Ct. 466.\n Second. The defendants challenge the Commission's holding that the extra charge of 25 cents made to the shippers was an unlawful practice. The conclusion rests upon the findings that the Stock Yards are, in effect, terminals of the line-haul carriers; and that the service of unloading the live stock there is a part of transportation. That the yards are, in effect, terminals of the railroads is clear. They are in fact used as terminals; and necessarily so. Whether the unloading in the yards was a part of transportation was not a pure question of law to be determined by merely reading the tariffs. Compare Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Merchants' Elevator Co., \n259 \nU.S. 285, 294\n, 42 S. Ct. 477. The decision of the question was dependent upon the determination of certain facts, including the history of the stock yards and their relation to \n\n[286 U.S. 397, 410]\n\u00a0\n the line-haul carriers; the history of the unloading charge at these yards; and the action of the parties in relation thereto. If there was evidence to sustain the Commission's findings on these matters, its conclusion that the collection of the extra charge from the shippers was an unreasonable and unlawful practice must be sustained. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe R. Co. v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 199, 221\n, 34 S. Ct. 291; Los Angeles Switching Case, \n234 \nU.S. 294, 310\n, 311 S., 34 S. Ct. 814\n\n\n Third. There was ample evidence to sustain the findings of the Commission that the unloading of live stock at the stockyards was a part of the transportation provided for in the tariffs of the line-haul carriers.\n\n 1. \nThroughout the United States, the duty of unloading carload freight rests ordinarily upon the consignee. See National Wholesale Lumber Dealers' Association v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 14 I. C. C. 154, 160. But continuously for fifty years prior to 1917 live stock had been unloaded at Chicago by the Stock Yards Company, without charge therefor to the shipper or consignee. \n3\n Compare Covington Stock-Yards Co. v. Keith, \n139 \nU.S. 128, 136\n, 11 S. Ct. 461. For this service the company received 25 cents a car; but not from the shipper. Its charge was paid by the line haul carriers, whose tariffs read: 'Carriers as shown will pay the Union Stock Yards and Transit Company's charges as follows: Unloading ( in cents per car) 25.'\n The history of the practice is this. The Union Stock Yard & Transit Company was organized in 1865 by the \n\n[286 U.S. 397, 411]\n\u00a0\n railroads then entering Chicago; and until 1894 its shares were largely held by them. The company constructed stockyards and tracks connecting with those of the line-haul carriers. After 1897 the company's railroad property was operated under lease by the Chicago Junction Railway Company, which received from the line-haul carriers compensation for the use of its tracks. The line-haul carriers, using their own locomotives and crews, brought all inbound carload shipments of live stock to the unloading chutes of the Stock Yards Company; and collected from the shippers a terminal or switching charge of $2 per car, in addition to the line-haul rate. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n From the time when the cars were placed at the chutes, the course of business was substantially as follows: Employees of the Stock Yards Company unloaded the live stock into pens located upon the company's property and leased by it to the commission merchants who handled the stock for the shippers and who were invariably the consignees of the shipments. The yards company notified the commissionmen of the arrival of the shipment, prepared the official record of the receipt of the live stock, the contents of the car, and the condition of the animals-the record used by the line-haul carriers. After securing from the Western Weighing Association Bureau (a bureau of the line-haul carriers) data concerning the actual weight of the live stock, the company made a corrected record of the freight charges due from the commissionmen. These charges it collected for the line-haul carriers; and, in consideration of the prompt release of the live stock without surrender of the bill of lading and without payment of the charges, it guaranteed them. The \n\n[286 U.S. 397, 412]\n\u00a0\n practice was for the company to make collection from the consignees of all charges twice a week; and once a week to pay the whole amount thus collected to the railroads. Once a month the railroads paid the yards company its charges for unloading.\n\n 2. \nPrior to the decision in United States v. Union Stock Yard & Transit Co., \n226 \nU.S. 286\n, 33 S. Ct. 83 (December 9, 1912), the unloading charges of the yards company had not been contained in any tariff filed by it with the Commission. After that decision, the company filed with the Commission its tariff No. 1, effective May 30, 1913, stating its charge to be 25 cents a car. That tariff remained in effect, without any attempt to change it, or the practice under it, until the yards company filed a so-called tariff No. 2, to become effective May 21, 1917, which recited: 'The charge made by this company for the service (as a carrier's agent) of ... unloading livestock at the Union Stock Yards at Chicago, Illinois, is as follows: For unloading 50 cents (per car of any capacity).'5\n The line-haul railroads did not join in the yards company's tariff No. 2, or authorize it. They did not file new tariffs embodying the extra 25- cent charge. And they refused to absorb the extra charge. Upon such refusal, the yards company, in order to compel payment by the carriers, adopted the practice of withholding the sum demanded from the freight charges collected for them. In retaliation, the carriers threatened to collect those charges for themselves. The result of this controversy was an arrangement arrived at between the railroads and the yards company, whereby the former added the disputed charge to their freight bills, and the latter collected it from the shippers, despite their protest. These bills did not indicate that the extra charge imposed was one of the \n\n[286 U.S. 397, 413]\n\u00a0\n yards company to the shipper. \n6\n As theretofore, the whole amount collected was turned over by the company to the railroads.\n Meanwhile, the yards company, contending that, because of certain changes made in its relation with the Chicago Junction Railway, it was no longer a common carrier of interstate commerce, filed with the Commission a supplement to its tariffs, to be effective September 1, 1917, in which it undertook to cancel all its tariffs. The proposed supplement was suspended by the Commission under section 15(7) of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 USCA  15(7); and, before any decision had been reached in the suspension proceedings, the Chicago Live Stock Exchange filed its complaint against the yards company and the line-haul railroads challenging the extra 25-cent charge. The proceedings were consolidated. Soon thereafter, the railroads passed under federal control; and the Director General, who continued the arrangement instituted by the carriers with the yards company, became a party to the proceedings before the Commission. That arrangement continued to the end of the period of federal control, as the order of the Commission declaring the practice unlawful was not entered until July 15, 1920, Chicago Live Stock Exchange v. Atchison, T. & S. F. Ry. Co., 58 I. C. C. 164.\n\n 3. \nThus, by the unbroken usage of fifty years, the payment by shippers of live stock of the line-haul rate to Chicago, plus the terminal charge of $2, had covered all services performed in connection with the shipment up to \n\n[286 U.S. 397, 414]\n\u00a0\n and including the placing of the stock in the pens of the commissionmen. The Commission so found; and this court has heretofore so recognized. See Interstate Commerce Commission v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. Co., \n186 \nU.S. 320, 327\n, 329 S., 336, 22 S. Ct. 824; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Stickney, \n215 \nU.S. 98, 108\n, 30 S. Ct. 66. Beyond dispute, the yards company, in the services which it performed, regarded itself as the carriers' agent. This appears not only from the previous course of business, but from the terms of its second tariff, from its initial conduct with respect to collection of the additional charge and from its attempt to cancel all its tariffs. The carriers for years had paid the yards company all its charges; and there was testimony that both the $2 terminal charge and the line-haul rates were predicated upon such payment. The company's charges, moreover, which constituted its sole compensation, covered services other than the mere unloading of cars- services which were obviously performed for the benefit of the carriers rather than the shippers.\n Whether, upon the company's demand for increased compensation, the carriers, under their tariffs, could lawfully join with it in shifting the burden of such increase to the shippers, depended upon the question of fact whether the unloading of cars was the proper duty of the railroads or of the consignees. The basis of the usual practice requiring the consignee to unload carload freight is that the consignee can do it more effectively than the carrier. See National Wholesale Lumber Dealers' Association v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 14 I. C. C. 154, 160. The Commission found that, in view of the congested conditions in the Chicago stockyards and the great volume of traffic, it would have been physically impracticable, if not impossible, for the consignees themselves to unload their own shipments. Certainly the Commission could reasonably determine upon this evidence that the conditions with respect to live stock in Chicago justified a different rule there from that \n\n[286 U.S. 397, 415]\n\u00a0\n obtaining in other places; that, in fact, a different practice had prevailed; and that no reason existed for permitting a departure from that practice.\n Fourth. It is urged by the defendants that the Stock Yards Company had been found by this Court to be a common carrier, United States v. Union Stock Yard & Transit Co., \n226 \nU.S. 286\n, 33 S. Ct. 83; that this finding was adhered to by the Commission in the present proceeding despite the claim of a change in conditions; that as a common carrier the company was compelled to publish its tariffs; that the tariff, as published, has not been found by the Commission to be unreasonable; and that its collection, therefore, was mandatory, and hence could not be unlawful. But the tariff, as published, authorized only the collection of the charge, as a carrier's agent. The question at issue is not the reasonableness of the charge, but the lawfulness of the practice, jointly pursued by the railroads and the company, of collecting the extra charge from the shipper. The reasonableness of the charge itself, and the complementary question whether the railroads should be required to absorb it, were in no way involved before the Commission; and that tribunal properly made no finding with respect thereto. Nor was the issue affected in any manner by the status of the yards company as a common carrier. It did not follow from such status that it could not act as an agent of the line-haul carriers, nor that it was entitled to collect a part of its charges from the shippers. Compare Missouri Pacific R. Co. v. Reynolds- Davis Grocery Co., \n268 \nU.S. 366\n, 45 S. Ct. 516; Union Stockyards Co. v. United States (C. C. A.) 169 F. 404, 406.\n Fifth. Certain additional grounds of defense, not considered by either of the courts below, are pressed here. The Director General urges that the terms of congressional consent do not permit him to be proceeded against before the Commission for a tort, compare Missouri Pa- \n\n[286 U.S. 397, 416]\n\u00a0\n cific R. Co. v. Ault, \n256 \nU.S. 554, 559\n, 41 S. Ct. 593, but only for damage resulting from the 'collection or enforcement by or through the President during the period of Federal control of rates, fares, charges, classifications, regulations, or practices ... which were unjust, unreasonable, unjustly discriminatory, or unduly or unreasonably prejudicial.' Transportation Act, 1920, 41 Stat. 462, c. 91,  206(c), 49 USCA  74(c). The contention that the acts of the Director General, found by the Commission did not in any view constitute an 'unjust or unreasonable practice' within the meaning of this provision, is manifestly untenable. The contention is really directed against the Commission's finding that the Director General participated in the practice. Ample support for this finding is furnished by the conceded fact that the extra charge was added by the railroads to their freight bills, and by the testimony that these bills were first collected by the yards company, that the entire proceeds were paid over to the railroads, and that the railroads subsequently compensated the company.\n Sixth. The Stock Yards Company urges several independent grounds of defense, not joined in by the Director General. It is argued that the order sued on includes awards of reparation against the company on purely intrastate shipments moving during the period of Federal control; that the jurisdiction conferred on the Commission by Transportation Act 1920, 41 Stat. 462, c. 91,  206(c), to grant reparation on claims arising out of intrastate traffic during federal control, does not permit the inclusion of such elements in an award against the yards company, which was never taken over by the government; and that, the petitioners not having established by proper proof to what extent the award made was valid, the order must be declared invalid as a whole. The record, however, does not show that this objection was \n\n[286 U.S. 397, 417]\n\u00a0\n urged either before the Commission or in the District Court; and it accordingly will not be entertained here.\n The remaining contentions of the yards company relate to the sufficiency of the complaint in docket No. 9977, to the competency of the evidence upon which the amount of the reparation awarded to each complainant was determined; and to a claim that the Commission acted upon evidence not in the record. We have considered these objections; and find them to be without merit.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed; and the cases is remanded to the District Court, with direction to enter judgment for the amount of reparation awarded, with interest, and for reasonable attorney's fees to be fixed by it.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice BUTLER is of opinion that plaintiffs are not 'persons injured' within the intention of section 8, and that the assailed 'practice,' if it is such within the meaning of the act, was not unreasonable, and that therefore the judgment should be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This is the figure stated in the opinions of both courts below, and in the briefs of counsel. The names of only 101 plaintiffs appear in the petition in the District Court and in the motion to amend the petition, as set out in the Transcript of Record. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The finding of the Commission in its report of June 2, 1925, was that the parties of record who 'paid the charges' on the shipments involved 'have been damaged in the amount of such charges and are severally entitled to reparation, as factors and agents for the shippers.' Chicago Live Stock Exchange v. Atchison, T. & S. F. Ry. Co., 100 I. C. C. 266, 270. The fact that 'the charge which was paid by the commission merchant was subsequently charged back and collected from the consignors,' the report said, 'would not affect the right of the complainant consignees to awards of reparation. There is a direct and well-established relation between the complaining members of the exchange and their shippers by which the former are fully authorized to present these claims and seek awards of reparation in their own names as factors and agents for such shippers. ... The right of factors in their representative capacity to recover reparation in their own names for unlawful and unreasonable charges is settled.' Id., 100 I. C. C. at pages 269, 270.\n That the subsequent order of the Commission, of December 12, 1927, fixing the amounts due the several complainants, made no reference to their position as factors is without significance. The order expressly incorporated the report; and in the report the Commission had already determined that the complainants, as factors, were entitled to recover in their own names. Nor is the form of the petition in the District Court material. The plaintiffs' right of recovery in this proceeding was defined by the finding and order of the Commission in their favor. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Transportation Act, 1920,  418, 41 Stat. 486 (49 USCA  15(5), enacted after the period here in question, provided that thereafter, with certain exceptions: 'Transportation wholly by railroad of ordinary livestock in carload lots destined to or received at public stockyards shall include all necessary service of unloading and reloading en route, delivery at public stockyards of inbound shipments into suitable pens, and receipt and loading at such yards of outbound shipments, without extra charge therefor to the shipper, consignee or owner. ...' \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The imposition of the $2 charge was the subject of much litigation before the Commission and the courts. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. Co., \n186 \nU.S. 320\n, 22 S. Ct. 824; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Stickney, \n215 \nU.S. 98\n, 30 S. Ct. 66. Compare Chicago Live Stock Exchange v. Chicago Great Western Ry. Co., 10 I. C. C. 428. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The tariff originally filed by the Stock Yards Company, May 30, 1913, did not contain the words in parenthesis, 'as a carrier's agent.' \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The freight bills were made out upon forms, headed 'United States Railroad Administration-Director General of Railroads,' together with the name of the carrier; and, so far as appears, showed only the total charges, entered in a column marked 'Freight Charges.' The waybills, however, contained itemized charges, as follows: 'Total charges on Original Waybill'; 'Feed Charges at ...'; 'Yardage at ...'; and 'Inspection at . ...' In the last column was entered the terminal charge of $2; in the column for 'yardage' was the entry, 'Unabsorbed Unloading-25c.' \n\n\n\n\n","1":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nADVANCE-RUMELY THRESHER CO. v. JACKSON(1932)\nNo. 33\nArgued: Decided: December 5, 1932\n\n\n\n Appeal from the Supreme Court of the State of North Dakota.\n Messrs. Howard G. Fuller and M. W. Murphy, both of Fargo, N.D., for appellant.\n\n\n[287 U.S. 283, 286]\n\u00a0\n Mr. William Lemke, of Fargo, N.D., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By this appeal we are called on to decide whether as construed below a statute of North Dakota, chapter 238, Laws \n\n[287 U.S. 283, 287]\n\u00a0\n 1919, is repugnant to the due process or equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. It declares:\n'Sec. 1. Reasonable Time to Discover Defects. Any person, firm or corporation purchasing any gas or oil burning tractor, gas or steam engine, harvesting or threshing machinery for their own use shall have a reasonable time after delivery for the inspection and testing of the same, and if it does not prove to be reasonably fit for the purpose for which it was purchased the purchaser may rescind the sale by giving notice within a reasonable time after delivery to the parties from whom any such machinery was purchased, or the agent who negotiated the sale or made delivery of such personal property or his successor, and placing same at the disposal of the seller.\n\n'Sec. 2. Provisions Contrary to Preceding Section Void. Any provision in any written order or contract of sale, or other contract which is contrary to any of the provisions of this Act is hereby declared to be against public policy and void.'\n\n The complaint of appellee, plaintiff below, shows the following facts: August 13, 1928, defendant, in consideration of $1,360 to be paid by plaintiff according to his three promissory notes given therefor, sold and delivered to the latter a harvester-combine to be used for the cutting and threshing in a single operation of grain raised by him. Plaintiff undertook by means of the machine so to cut and thresh his crop, but upon a fair trial and test he found that it was defective and could not be used or made fit to operate for the purpose. September 5 he rescinded the sale in the manner prescribed by the statute. His notes remained wholly unpaid. He prayed judgment that defendant return them to him for cancellation. The answer, asserting that the statute is repugnant to the due process and equal protection clauses, does not deny the complaint, but avers that plaintiff gave defendant a written order by which he waived all warranties, express, \n\n[287 U.S. 283, 288]\n\u00a0\n implied or statutory, and unconditionally promised to pay the price represented by the notes. Plaintiff demurred. The trial court sustained the demurrer, and, defendant having elected to stand on its answer, gave plaintiff judgment in accordance with the prayer of the complaint. The Supreme Court affirmed. 241 N.W. 722.\n On the facts alleged in the complaint, section 15(1) of the Uniform Sales Act, Laws 1917, c. 202, implied a warranty by defendant that the machine was reasonably fit in a single operation to cut and thresh plaintiff's grain. Allis-Chalmers Mfg. Co. v. Frank, 57 N.D. 295, 299, 221 N.W. 75. But it left plaintiff free to waive such warranty and to purchase on the terms referred to in the answer. Section 71. Minneapolis Threshing Mach. Co. v. Hocking, 54 N.D. 559, 569, 209 N.W. 996.\n The question is whether the challenged enactment of 1919 may prohibit such waivers as contrary to public policy and void, and so limit the right of seller and purchaser to contract. While that right is a part of the liberty protected by the due process clause, it is subject to such restraints as the state in the exertion of its police power reasonably may put upon it. But freedom of contract is the general rule and restraint the exception. The exercise of legislative authority to abridge it can be justified only by the existence of exceptional circumstances. Adkins v. Children's Hospital, \n261 \nU.S. 525, 545\n, 546 S., 43 S.Ct. 394, 24 A.L.R. 1238, and cases cited. In determining the validity of a legislative declaration that a contract is contrary to public policy, regard is to be had to the general rule that competent persons shall have the utmost liberty of contracting, and that it is only where enforcement conflicts with dominant public interests that one who has had the benefit of performance by the other party to a contract will be permitted to avoid his own promise. Cf. Steele v. Drummond, \n275 \nU.S. 199, 205\n, 48 S.Ct. 53; Twin City Pipe Line Co. v. Harding Glass Co., \n283 \nU.S. 353, 356\n, 51 S.Ct. 476. \n\n[287 U.S. 283, 289]\n\u00a0\n The object sought to be attained by the statute under consideration is to protect farmers in an agricultural state against losses from investments in important machines that are not fit for the purposes for which they are purchased and to guard against crop losses likely to result from reliance upon such machines. It applies only to sales made to purchasers requiring for their own use the relatively complicated and costly implements referred to in section 1. These are used on farms producing grain, and the raising of such crops is North Dakota's principal industry. Enormous quantities of farm machinery are required in that state, and expenditures therefor constitute a large part of the total investment in farm land and equipment. Most, if not all, of the tractors, engines, harvesters, and threshers referred to are made outside North Dakota by a few manufacturers who, through their agents or dealers, sell them directly to farmers. Forms of sales contracts generally used are prepared by sellers, and, as pointed out in the opinion of the state Supreme Court, the tendency has been to restrict the rights of purchasers and to lessen the liability of sellers. Such machines can properly be tested only during seasons in which they are used, and, especially in the case of harvester and thresher combines, these periods are short. The machine sold to plaintiff is a gas and oil-burning harvester and thresher combine. Machines designed for such purposes are necessarily complex, and even under favorable conditions their effective use requires skill, experience, and resourcefulness on the part of operators. In determining whether they are reasonably suitable and fit for the purposes intended, there is involved a consideration of the kind and condition of the crops to be harvested, the periods during which they remain recoverable after becoming sufficiently ripe and dry to be contemporaneously cut and threshed, the amount and kind of weeds and other foreign vegetation growing with the grain, the topography of the fields, and the rainfall, \n\n[287 U.S. 283, 290]\n\u00a0\n dew, and humidity. Such combines have not been long known or much used in the grain-raising Northwest, and undoubtedly there are ample grounds for a legislative finding that the farmers of North Dakota as a class are not sufficiently familiar with them to be able, without actual test, to form an intelligent opinion as to their fitness to cut and thresh in a single operation or whether they safely may be regarded as dependable for use on their farms. If they were relied on generally in that state and should fail in the fields, the resulting losses would be of such magnitude and public concern as to warrant the adoption of measures calculated to guard against them.\n The regulation imposed seems well calculated to effect the purposes sought to be attained. The evils aimed at do not necessarily result from misrepresentation or any fraud on the part of sellers, and at least one of the purposes of the legislation is to lessen losses resulting from purchasers' lack of capacity, without opportunity for inspection and trial, to decide whether the machines are suitable. The statute prevents waiver of the warranty of fitness implied by the state law. Such warranties tend to restrain manufacturers from selling unfit or defective machines and also from selling any-even those of appropriate design and construction for operation in some regions-for use in places or under conditions not permitting effective service. And the right of inspection, test, and rescission that the statute assures to purchasers enables them, free from peril of serious mistakes, deliberately to consider whether such machines are reasonably suitable or fit for the purposes for which they want to use them. There is nothing in this case to suggest that, under the guise of permissible regulation, the state unreasonably deprives sellers of such machines of their right freely to contract or that in its practical operation the statute arbitrarily burdens their business. Burns Baking Co. v. Bryan, \n264 \nU.S. 504\n, 44 S.Ct. 412, 32 A.L.R. 661; Weaver v. Palmer Bros. Co., 270 \n\n[287 U.S. 283, 291]\n\u00a0\n U.S. 402, 46 S.Ct. 320. The state, in order to ameliorate the evils found incident to waivers of implied warranties of fitness, merely declares that such agreements in respect of the sale of the designated machines are contrary to public policy, and holds the parties to the just and reasonable rule prescribed by section 15(1) of the Sales Act. Upon the question of due process more need not be said.\n The character of the machines, the need of tests to determine their fitness, the serious losses that ensue if in actual use they prove unfit and the other considerations alluded to plainly warrant the classification and special regulation of sales prescribed by the statute.\n We find no substantial support for the contention that the statute complained of violates the due process or equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

PHOENIX NAT BANK & TRUST CO. OF(1932)\nNo. 413\nArgued: January 25, 1932Decided: March 14, 1932\n\n\n\n\n[285 U.S. 209, 210]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Samuel M. Wilson, of Lexington, Ky., and Charles Kerr, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Mr. James Park, of Lexington, Ky., for respondent.\n\n\n[285 U.S. 209, 211]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought by respondent, a national bank, in the circuit court of Fayette county, Ky., to re \n\n[285 U.S. 209, 212]\n\u00a0\n cover on a bond of indemnity issued by the petitioner. The cause was removed to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky, which, after a trial by the court upon an agreed statement of facts, gave judgment for petitioner. Judgment of reversal by the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, 44 F.(2d) 511, is here for review on certiorari. \n284 \nU.S. 608\n, 52 S. Ct. 41, 76 L. Ed. -.\n The indemnity bond, issued upon payment of a stipulated premium, undertook to indemnify the respondent for 'any loss through the payment ... of forged or raised checks or (genuine) checks bearing forged endorsements. ...' On different dates between May 12, 1924, and June 23, 1925, while the bond was in force, a corporation depositor of respondent drew thirty-nine checks upon its deposit account in favor of third persons. The indorsements of the payee on thirty-five of the checks were forged, and the amounts payable on the other four and on eighteen others were raised by one Fulton, who was the vice president and treasurer of the depositor, having charge of its checkbooks and books of account. Authority to sign the checks was vested in the president and one other, who was not an officer of the depositor. All the checks bore genuine indorsements made subsequent to the forgeries, two of them by Fulton alone. All were paid by respondent on presentation, and the amounts paid were charged to the depositor's account. Monthly statements were rendered to the depositor, accompanied by the canceled checks. No agents or representatives of the depositor other than Fulton, the forger, examined the depositor's accounts, canceled checks, or books of account. The checks were prepared for signature by Fulton. The representatives of the depositor who signed them relied wholly on him for their accuracy and for the names of the payees. All of the raised checks 'were completed in writing by Fulton, except that the line for the application of the protectograph was left blank, and \n\n[285 U.S. 209, 213]\n\u00a0\n were signed, before the application of the protectograph to them. And Fulton was trusted to fill in the line stating the amount of the cheque, with the protectograph, and was charged with the duty of delivering the cheques, whether by mail or in person.'\n About August 7th, a month after the payment of the last check, the depositor gave notice of the forgeries to the respondent and demanded that the sum of $5,512.72, representing so much of the payments as were induced by the forgeries, be recredited to its account. The respondent in turn asked payment of that amount of petitioner in satisfaction of its liability on the indemnity bond. Petitioner, while admitting liability if respondent was not authorized to charge the depositor with the loss, insisted that the depositor was so chargeable because of its negligence and delay in notifying respondent of the forgeries and its negligence in drawing the checks. It offered to defend any suit brought against the respondent by the depositor with respect to the loss, and asked respondent to give notice of the forgeries to prior indorsers and to demand reimbursement from them. Respondent failed to comply with any of these requests and later credited its depositor with the disputed amount.\n The petitioner, by way of defense, set up specifically the bank's assumption of the loss by crediting the depositor in the face of the latter's alleged negligence and omissions. The court below thought that the question presented was merely one of the time of the loss indemnified against, and as that had occurred when the checks were paid by respondent, later events determining the ultimate incidence of the loss as between the bank and its depositor or indorsers, were immaterial. Hence it concluded that the subsequent credit to the depositor of the amount of the loss and the consequent relinquishment of any claim against the depositor or others, had no bearing on the liability of the indemnitor. The court said: \n\n[285 U.S. 209, 214]\n\u00a0\n '... in the present case, the loss was suffered and the liability arose from time to time as the checks were paid; and, when finally the bank canceled the charges and recredited the total, it was not then suffering a loss; it was abandoning a claim for recoupment of its earlier loss-a claim which at first it did not have. We think, therefore, that the policy should be read as indemnity against the original loss, and not as holding the liability in the air until it can finally be determined whether the bank had a right to make the charge back.' (C. C. A.) 44 F.(2d) 511, 512.\n We think that the respondent could not relinquish any claims it might have had against the depositor and preserve unimpaired its right to the indemnity. Petitioner's undertaking 'to indemnify ... and hold harmless' the respondent from any loss sustained by reason of the specified payments, contained no words indicating an intention to destroy the indemnitor's usual privilege of subrogation to the indemnitee's right to recover from any who are liable to it for the loss. That privilege was a necessary incident to petitioner's contract, for only by resort to it could the character of the contract as indemnity be preserved. It is both the object and the justification of subrogation that it makes exact indemnity the measure of the liability. See Standard Marine Insurance Co., Ltd. v. Scottish Metropolitan Assurance Co., Ltd., \n283 \nU.S. 284\n, 51 S. Ct. 371; United States v. American Tobacco Co., \n166 \nU.S. 468\n, 17 S. Ct. 619; St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern Ry. Co. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., \n139 \nU.S. 223, 235\n, 11 S. Ct. 554; Hall & Long v. Nashville & C. R. Co., 13 Wall. 367; Jones v. Bacon, 145 N. Y. 446, 450, 40 N. E. 216.\n Even though we assume, as the court below held, that petitioner's liability attached on payment of the checks, and that respondent had none the less suffered a loss even though it might be able to recoup it from others, see \n\n[285 U.S. 209, 215]\n\u00a0\n Champion Ice Mfg. & Cold Storage Co. v. American Bonding & Trust Co., 115 Ky. 863, 75 S. W. 197, 103 Am. St. Rep. 356, respondent was still under a duty not to impair the rights which petitioner, upon payment of its obligation, might enforce against third persons. The failure to observe that duty, by stating an account which relinquished all claims against its depositor, see Greenhalgh Co. v. Farmers' National Bank, 226 Pa. 184, 188, 75 A. 260, 134 Am. St. Rep. 1016, 18 Ann. Cas. 330, released the petitioner from the liability which had already accrued. See Sims v. Mutual Fire Ins. Co., 101 Wis. 586, 77 N. W. 908; Illinois Automobile Ins. Exchange v. Braun, 280 Pa. 550, 124 A. 691, 36 A. L. R. 1262; American Surety Co. v. Ballman (C. C.) 104 F. 634; Jones v. Bacon, supra. To hold that respondent could, without affecting its indemnity, release its rights against those who might be liable for its loss, would be to hold, by a parity of reasoning, that respondent could enforce them with a similar lack of effect upon its right to recover from petitioner. In either case petitioner's contract would be converted from one of indemnity, as stipulated, into an unqualified obligation to repay to the bank the amounts which it was induced to pay by the forgeries.\n It is unnecessary to decide with finality what might have been the rights of the bank against other parties. It is enough to say that neither the decisions in the federal courts nor the statutes and decisions of Kentucky, which are controlling, preclude a successful defense to assertion of a claim by the depositor. \n1\n If the indemnitee assumes \n\n[285 U.S. 209, 216]\n\u00a0\n to relinquish its rights without the consent of its indemnitor, the burden rests on it to establish that they are nonexistent or unsubstantial. See Wilson v. Hite's Executor, 154 Ky. 61, 69, 157 S. W. 41; Wheeler v. Sweet, 137 N. Y. 435, 443, 33 N. E. 483.\n The court below thought that it was not reasonable to suppose that the bank had intended to buy a kind of indemnity which would involve it in litigation with its depositors, since the purpose of the bank was to keep its depositors and not to alienate them. As the liability had already attached on payment of the checks, the bank might have sued its indemnitor at once, and was not called on to defend itself against claims of its depositor or to prosecute its own claims against the endorsers. Royal Insurance Co. v. Stinson, \n103 U.S. 25\n. But it could not, as it has sought to do, retain its indemnity and withhold from its indemnitor the privilege of contesting or making such claims. See American Surety Co. v. Greek Catholic Union, \n284 \nU.S. 563\n, 52 S. Ct. 235, 76 L. Ed . -, decided February 15, 1932. If such was respondent's object, it should have taken from petitioner not a contract of indemnity, as it did here, but one to pay to it all amounts disbursed on forged checks.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Carroll's Ky.

UNITED STATES(1932)\nNo. 81\nArgued: Decided: December 5, 1932\n\n\n\n On\nappeal from the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of Illinois. \n\n[287 U.S. 229, 230]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Frank H. Towner and Silas H. Strawn, both of Chicago, Ill., for appellant.\n The Attorney General and Mr. J. Stanley Payne, of Washington, D.C., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit, under the Urgent Deficiencies Act of October 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 220 (see 28 USCA  44 et seq.), was brought by the Alton Railroad Company in the federal court for Northern Illinois to set aside part of an order entered by the Interstate Commerce Commission under section 15(6) of the Interstate Commerce Act, see Transportation Act, February 28, 1920, c. 91,  418, 41 Stat. 456, 475, 484, 486 (49 USCA  15( 6). The \n\n[287 U.S. 229, 231]\n\u00a0\n defendants are the United States and, by intervention, the Commission and carriers adversely interested. The proceeding before the Commission was commenced by the receivers of the Chicago & Alton 'to establish, just, reasonable, and equitable divisions' of existing joint rates for grain and grain products from Peoria, Ill., to points east of Buffalo.1 The Commission found that the divisions of the so-called 'local' rates were too low, and ordered them increased. It found that the divisions of the so- called 'reshipping' rates were 'not unjust, unreasonable or otherwise unlawful' and refused relief as to them. Wheelock et al., Receivers, v. Akron, Canton & Youngs-town Ry. Co., 169 I.C.C. 594; Id., 179 I.C.C. 517.2 The Alton Railroad (the \n\n[287 U.S. 229, 232]\n\u00a0\n corporation which acquired the line under the reorganization, Alton R.R. Co. Acquisition and Stock Issue, 175 I.C.C. 301) insists that by so denying relief the Commission has, in view of the facts specifically found, subjected its property to confiscation; and on this ground seeks to have that part of the order set aside.\n Lines of the Alton extend from Peoria to Chicago, Joliet, and Dwight, Ill., and at each of those cities connect with railroads whose lines extend to the East. Peoria is an important market for grain received from the West and Northwest. At Peoria the grain goes into elevators. There it may be sold and resold or it may be manufactured into grain products and by-products. Much of the grain is later shipped from Peoria to the East in the form of grain products and by-products. The transportation of grain consigned to Peoria is completed, however, by the unloading of the cars there and the payment of charges. The carriers serving Peoria have not established joint rates from such points of origin of the grain \n\n[287 U.S. 229, 233]\n\u00a0\n to the East, with a transit privilege at Peoria. Compare Central R.R. Co. v. United States, \n257 \nU.S. 247\n, 42 S.Ct. 80. But the tariffs of outbound joint rates from Peoria to points east of Buffalo, voluntarily established by the Alton and connecting railroads, provide for a lower scale of rates applicable, under certain conditions, to grain and the products of grain which had a rail movement inbound from the territory referred to. This lower scale is called 'reshipping' rates; and the merchandise shipped thereunder is called transit grain or grain products. \n3\n The higher scale applicable to other grain or grain products is called 'local' rates. Compare Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. United States, \n279 \nU.S. 768\n, 49 S.Ct. 494.\n Until July 1, 1929, the divisions of both classes of rates were fixed by agreement of the Alton and the connecting lines. Then the connecting lines, without the sanction of the Commission and over the protest of the Alton, reduced, for both classes of rates, the amounts paid to it as divisions. The connecting lines were and are physically in a position to deprive the Alton of a larger share by \n\n[287 U.S. 229, 234]\n\u00a0\n reason of the fact that the freight is collected at the destinations and distributed by the collecting carrier. The haul on the Alton outbound from Peoria is from 82 to 155 miles, dependent upon the route selected. The divisions constitute the only revenue received by the Alton for the service performed by it under the 'reshipping' rates. Under the reduced allowances, the Alton does not receive on any shipment more than 2 cents per 100 pounds and on many shipments it receives nothing. \n4\n The Com- \n\n[287 U.S. 229, 235]\n\u00a0\n mission did not suggest that the divisions so received could be deemed compensatory for the outbound haul. It justified its conclusion that the divisions were not 'unjust, unreasonable, or otherwise unlawful' on the ground that the transportation service for the performance of which the Alton sought increased divisions was not of importance to the public, and that, if the Alton desired to participate in the transportation and was dissatisfied with the share allotted, it should secure in some way allowances from the carriers which bring the grain into Peoria.\n The District Court, three judges sitting, did not consider the merits of the controversy. It dismissed the bill on the ground that the part of the order complained of was negative in character, and that hence the court was without jurisdiction. The case is here on direct appeal. Whether the order is a negative one within the meaning of the rule (compare Procter & Gamble Co. v. United States, \n225 \nU.S. 282\n, 32 S.Ct. 761, United States v. Los Angeles & Salt Lake R.R. Co., \n273 \nU.S. 299\n, 47 S.Ct. 413) is the main question requiring decision. The Alton concedes that courts have ordinarily no power to review a finding of the Commission that a particular division is not unreasonable or inequitable. The Alton's contention is that, while the joint rates are in force, it is obliged to accept traffic under them; that until the Commission decides otherwise it is entitled to the divisions agreed upon when the joint rates were established; that the order of the Commission in approving the reduced allowance to the Alton made by the connecting carriers in effect established new divisions; and that, since these are obviously confiscatory, the order is void.\n First. The order while negative in form was, in effect, an affirmative one. The joint 'reshipping' rates and the divisions thereof were established by agreement of the carriers participating in the transportation. The divisions were a term of that agreement. So long as the \n\n[287 U.S. 229, 236]\n\u00a0\n joint rates voluntarily established remain in force, each carrier is entitled as of right to the division originally agreed upon, unless a readjustment of the divisions has been made either by the parties or by the Commission pursuant to the power conferred by paragraph 6 of section 15. The connecting carriers were legally without power to reduce the divisions of the Alton over its objection. If they deemed its divisions unreasonably large, they could have invoked the power of the Commission to make a reduction. Instead of applying to the Commission to adjust the existing divisions, they resorted to force. Availing themselves of their strategic position as collectors of the freight, they withheld from the Alton a part of what was due it.\n The Alton might have sued at law for the part of the divisions wrongfully withheld. St. Louis S.W. Ry. Co. v. S. H. Bolinger & Co. (C.C.A .) 17 F.(2d) 924. Compare Malvern & F.V.R.R. Co. v. Chicago, R.I. & P. Ry. Co. (C.C.) 182 F. 685. But that was not its only remedy. Under section 15( 6), it was entitled to invoke the jurisdiction of the commission. \n5\n It could obviously have applied to the Commission to have the agreed divisions increased; and likewise it was entitled to apply to secure a determination that the agreed division shall be maintained. The Commission was not at liberty to decline to exercise its jurisdiction. Paragraph 6 imposed upon it the obligation to act upon the complaint. Compare New England Divisions Case, 261 U.S. \n\n[287 U.S. 229, 237]\n\u00a0\n 184, 43 S.Ct. 270; United States v. Abilene & Southern Ry. Co., \n265 \nU.S. 274\n, 44 S.Ct. 565. The Commission's finding that the Alton's divisions were 'not unjust, unreasonable or otherwise unlawful,' and the refusal of relief, had the effect of reducing the divisions which had been fixed by agreement of the parties and to which, but for the Commission's action, the Alton would have continued to be legally entitled.\n Second. The jurisdiction of courts to review orders of the Commission is not dependent upon the form in which the order is couched. If the Eastern carriers had applied to the Commission for a change in the divisions fixed by agreement, and the Commission had authorized divisions precisely like those which they are now imposing upon the Alton by their unauthorized action, the order would have been affirmative in form and would obviously have been subject to attack by the Alton in a suit in the federal court. By their unauthorized action the connecting carriers forced the Alton to become the moving party before the Commission, with the result that the Commission's approval of the divisions effected by them was expressed in the form of a refusal to interfere. This result of the alignment of parties does not endow the Commission's order with immunity from judicial review.\n An order of the Commission which denies relief in part, or which dismisses the complaint, may be reviewed by a court. Inter-Mountain Rate Cases, \n234 \nU.S. 476, 490\n, 34 S.Ct. 986; United States v. New River Co., \n265 U.S. 533\n, 539-541, 44 S.Ct. 610. \n\n[287 U.S. 229, 238]\n\u00a0\n To annul the order would not, as in Lehigh Valley R.R. Co. v. United States, \n243 \nU.S. 412\n, 37 S.Ct. 397, merely leave unchanged the very situation which the Commission's order refused to alter. Here the Alton, by virtue of the pre-existing agreement for divisions, would secure a measure of protection simply from the annulment of the order. To take jurisdiction would not be tantamount to usurpation by the court of the functions of the Commission. The court is not called upon here, as it was in Manufacturers' Ry. Co. v. United States, \n246 \nU.S. 457, 483\n, 38 S.Ct. 383, and Standard Oil Co. v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 235, 241\n, 51 S.Ct. 429, to afford relief which the Commission, in the exercise of its powers, had found that the complainant was not entitled to receive. \n6\n The court is not asked to prescribe reasonable divisions, or to \n\n[287 U.S. 229, 239]\n\u00a0\n direct that they be prescribed by the Commission. 7 The court is asked to find that the Commission denied the Alton a constitutional right as a result of acting upon erroneous principles of law, and therefore to enjoin that part of the order.\n The determination of the questions presented is properly within the scope of judicial review of the Commission's orders. The questions are not the correctness of its conclusion as to the reasonableness of the divisions, or the correctness of its findings as to any of the factors which the act directs it to consider in determining reasonableness. The question is the correctness of the legal principles adopted by the Commission as a basis for reaching a conclusion from its findings. The Commission reasoned that, since the particular transportation services of the Alton here in question were not of importance to the public, and since the Alton was in substance an intermediate, not an originating, carrier, it might be denied a compensatory share of the existing joint rates with the defendant carriers. Whether the 'importance to the public of the transportation services of such carriers,' as specified in the act, means the importance of the particular services in question, and whether a carrier not participating in joint rates with inbound roads is an 'intermediate line' within the meaning of the section dealing with divisions, are questions upon which a court may properly pass. So, too, is the more fundamental question whether, assuming the Commission was correct in its construction of the act, it follows that a noncompensatory share of existing joint rates may be imposed. Upon these questions the Alton was entitled to invoke the judg- \n\n[287 U.S. 229, 240]\n\u00a0\n ment of the court. Compare Southern Ry. Co. v. St. Louis Hay Co., \n214 \nU.S. 297, 301\n, 29 S.Ct. 678; Southern Pacific Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n219 \nU.S. 433, 449\n, 31 S.Ct. 288.\n Third. The defendants contend that what is sought to be enjoined is not an 'order' within the meaning of the Urgent Deficiencies Act. That contention is unsound. The action of the Commission presents none of the characteristics which have led this court in other cases to hold that there was want of jurisdiction. It is part of an order (compare United States v. Atlanta, B. & C.R.R. Co., \n282 \nU.S. 522, 527\n, 51 S.Ct. 237); and the order is final, not tentative (compare Delaware & Hudson Co. v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 438, 448\n, 45 S.Ct. 153). It was entered as the result of a formal controversy, not a project of the Commission (compare United States v. Los Angeles & Salt Lake R.R. Co., \n273 \nU.S. 299\n, 47 S.Ct. 413); and it marked the disposition of the controversy, not a preliminary stage (compare United States v. Illinois Central R.R. Co., \n244 \nU.S. 82\n, 37 S.Ct. 584).8 The suit to enjoin the order is not premature. Compare Piedmont & Northern Ry. v. United States, \n280 \nU.S. 469\n, 50 S.Ct. 192. It subjects the Alton to damage which is substantial, immediate, and irreparable. If the order is allowed to stand, and the Eastern carriers continue to retain their present share of the joint rates, the Alton's only redress will be a subsequent complaint before the Commission. Even if the Commission should then decide that the existing divisions are unreasonable, it might be powerless to award reparation for the period from the entry of the present order. Brimstone R. & Canal Co. v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 104, 121\n, 48 S. Ct. 282.\n The decree of the District Court dismissing the bill for want of jurisdiction is reversed, and the cause remanded to it for further proceedings.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The proceedings before the Commission involved also the rates from Pekin, which lies about ten miles from Peoria. But as the inbound and outbound rates to and from these two points and the transit regulations and practices in effect are the same as to both, only Peoria will be referred to. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Division 5 of the Commission, after a hearing, found that the share accorded the Alton was unreasonable and otherwise unlawful, and fixed new divisions. On petition by the defendants, the order of Division 5 was indefinitely postponed and a rehearing before the full Commission granted. The order entered by the full Commission reads as follows:\n'This case having been reheard and submitted by the parties, and full investigation of the matters and things involved having been had, and the commission having, on the date hereof, made and filed a report on rehearing containing its findings of fact and conclusions thereon, which said report, together with the original report and order herein, 169 I.C.C. 594, is hereby referred to and made a part hereof; and the commission having found in said report on rehearing, (1) that just, reasonable, and equitable divisions to be received, respectively, by complainants herein and the defendant carriers east of Chicago, Joliet, or Dwight, Ill., out of the joint nontransit rates on grain, grain products, and grain by- products, in carloads, from Peoria and Pekin, Ill., via Chicago, Joliet, or Dwight, to destinations in eastern trunk-line and New England territories, east of Buffalo, N.Y., over the lines of complainants to Chicago, Joliet, or Dwight, will be the specific or arbitrary over the Chicago reshipping rate to complainants and the reshipping rate from Chicago to destination to the carriers defendant east of Chicago; and (2) that the present divisions of joint reshipping or proportional rates on grain, grain products, and grain by-products, in carloads, from Peoria and Pekin over the lines of complainants to Chicago, Joliet or Dwight destined to points in eastern trunk-line and New England territories east of Buffalo are not unjust, unreasonable or otherwise unlawful as alleged by complainants:\n\n'It is ordered that the aforementioned original order of November 28, 1930, be, and it is hereby, vacated and set aside.\n\n'It is further ordered that the above-named defendants, according as they participate in the transportation, be, and they are hereby notified and required to cease and desist, on or before January 16, 1932, and thereafter to abstain from demanding, collecting, or receiving divisions of the joint nontransit rates specified in the preceding paragraph which do not allow said complainants the divisions found in said reports to be just, reasonable, and equitable.\n\n'And it is further ordered that this order shall continue in force until the further order of the commission.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Reshipping rates from Peoria vary somewhat with the point of origin of the grain. A subsequent outbound shipment of grain or its products may be from a shipment which did not move inbound from the territory above referred to. But the shipper, in order to avail himself of the reshipping rates on outbound grain, grain products, or by-products, must establish the fact that he sent an equivalent amount of like grain from the point of origin to Peoria within the twelve-month period allowed for transit privileges. This proof is made by the presentation of paid freight bills as memoranda of the inbound shipments. Compare Restriction on Number of Tonnage Slips Surrendered at Transit Points, 77 I.C.C. 239. The inbound and outbound shipments are carried under separate bills of lading; the final destination of the grain is usually undetermined at the time of the inbound shipment. In this respect the practice differs from that of through shipment with transit privileges. On the prevalence, legality, and possible abuses of both reshipping rates and through rates with transit privileges, see Atchison, T. & S.F. Ry. v. United States, \n279 U.S. 768\n, 777-780, 49 S.Ct. 494, and cases there cited. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] As stated in note 3, supra, the reshipping rates from Peoria to the East vary with the points of origin of the grain or grain product. Thus the reshipping rate from Peoria to New York on grain originating in the Northwest is 30.5 cents per 100 pounds, while that on grain originating in the Illinois-Iowa territory is 32.5 cents. On grain originating at other points the rates fall somewhere between these two figures. The outbound reshipping rate from Chicago to New York, with exceptions not material here, is 30.5 cents irrespective of the point of origin. The inbound rates to Chicago and to Peoria are the same on shipments from the Illinois-Iowa territory, but on shipments from the Northwest the inbound rate to Peoria is 2 cents less than to Chicago; and on shipments from other points the difference is less than 2 cents. It is evident that the outbound reshipping rates from Peoria, varying as they do with the point of origin of the grain, are designed to equalize the total rate from point of origin to final destination, whether Peoria or Chicago is taken as the place for utilizing transit privileges. Stated in general terms, where the rate to Peoria is less than that to Chicago, the rate from Peoria is correspondingly greater than that from Chicago. In no case is this excess of outbound rate from Peoria over that from Chicago more than 2 cents per 100 pounds; and in some cases there is no excess. It is this excess, if any exists, of the rate from Peoria over the 30.5 cent rate from Chicago that constitutes the share being paid to the Alton by the connecting lines out of the joint rate from Peoria to New York. The connecting carriers invariably retain 30.5 cents as their own share, leaving the Alton a maximum of 2 cents per 100 pounds as its allotment. In some instances- specifically, on shipments of grain whose origin was in the Northwest-the Alton receives nothing, although it may have hauled the grain over its line from Peoria 155 miles. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] In its complaint to the Commission, the Alton charged that the divisions allotted to it were unjust and unreasonable and in violation of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended. The Commission has held that it has no authority to enforce agreements for divisions, apart from a showing of such violation of the act. Laona & Northern R.R. Co. v. Minneapolis, St. P & S. Ste. M. Ry. Co., 52 I.C.C. 7; compare Morgantown & Wheeling Ry. Co. v. Pennsylvania R.R. Co., 63 I.C.C. 197. Section 208(b) of Transportation Act 1920 (49 USCA  76(a), provides: 'All divisions of joint rates, fares, or charges, which on February 29, 1920, were in effect between the lines of carriers subject to chapter 1 of this title (the Interstate Commerce Act), shall continue in force and effect until thereafter charged by mutual agreement between the interested carriers or by State or Federal authorities, respectively.' The purpose of this provision, as stated by Chairman Esch of the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, was to prevent rates and divisions from reverting, ipso facto, upon termination of federal control, to their precontrol status. See H.R. No. 456, 66th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 12; 58 Cong. Rec. p. 8314. The Commission has held that this provision did not confer authority upon it to enforce agreements for divisions. Hampton & Branchville R.R. Co. v. Atlantic Coast Line R.R. Co., 88 I.C.C. 77, 84. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Compare, also, Procter & Gamble Co. v. United States, \n225 \nU.S. 282\n, 32 S.Ct. 761, in which the petition in the Commerce Court included a prayer that the defendant railroads be enjoined from collecting demurrage charges on the complainant's tank cars while on its own tracks- the relief which the Commission had refused to grant.\n After the decision in the Procter & Gamble Case, eleven cases pending in the Commerce Court were dismissed by it for want of jurisdiction. In five of these the Commission had refused to award reparation; in three it had refused to order the establishment of through routes and joint rates; in one it had refused both an award of reparation and the establishment of through routes and joint rates; in one it had dismissed a complaint challenging the lawfulness of rates; and in one it had dismissed a complaint attacking an advanced rate as unreasonable. See Twenty-Sixty Ann. Rep. I.C.C. pp. 34, 202-205.\n The Commission thus understood the import of the Procter & Gamble decision: 'Its (this Court's) conclusion was that upon the plain reading of that statute the jurisdiction of the court was confined to restraining the operation of the orders of the Commission and that it possessed no affirmative authority to enforce the administrative provisions of that act . ... The central thought to be gathered from this exposition of the law seems to be that the administrative judgment of the Commission, as expressed by its orders, cannot be reviewed by the courts, in so far as they are within its delegated authority, not confiscatory, and not palpably arbitrary and unreasonable.'

Claim for refund was filed September 15, 1925, and the questions presented are whether the court below correctly held that the admitted overpayment was of the tax due and payable for petitioner's fiscal year ending June 30, 1918, so that the bar of the statute had fallen at the time of the claim for refund, or was of taxes on income for the fiscal period ending June 30, 1920, and, if the latter, whether recovery was barred by the statute of limitations.\n Petitioner filed income tax returns for the calendar years 1918, 1919, and 1920, although in each of those years it had kept its books on the basis of a fiscal year ending June 30th. By section 212(b) of the Revenue Act of 1918, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1064, returns were required to be made on the basis of the fiscal year, as shown by he taxpayer's books of account, and under the applicable section and regulation petitioner was required to file a return for the six months ending June 30, 1918, and for the years ending on June 30, 1919 and 1920. Section 226, 40 Stat. 1057, 1075; Treasury Regulations 45, art. 431. Pursuant to its returns for the calendar years in question, petitioner paid taxes as follows:\n For the calendar year 1918 $1,246,271 24 1919 1,113,509 41 1920 None $2,359,780 65\n Refunds of the taxes paid were made in the following amounts, to which interest was added:\n May 17, 1928 $217,194 58 Aug. 17, 1928 94,835 16 312,029 74\n Net payments of taxes for the calendar years 1918, 1919, 1920 $2,047,750.91 \n\n[284 U.S. 343, 346]\n\u00a0\n The correct tax for the period in question as computed by the Commissioner on the basis of amended returns for petitioner's fiscal years:\n For the 6 months ending June 30, 1918 $708,068 47 For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1919 896,314 83 For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1920 None 1,604,383 30\n Total overpayment for the period in question $443,367.61\n The government contends that as the only return petitioner was authorized by the statute to make for the year 1918 was for the six months, January 1st to June 30th, petitioner's return for the calendar year can be given effect only as a return for that six months and payments of the tax as returned must be deemed, as the Court of Claims held, to be on account of the tax due for the six months, with a consequent overpayment for that period in the sum of $538,202.77. Of this overpayment, $94,835.16 has been refunded, and, as petitioner concedes, recovery of the $443.367.61 balance is barred by the statute of limitations if it be treated as an overpayment attributable to that period.\n The petitioner insists that the amount paid as tax for each of the calendar years 1918 and 1919 should be divided and one-half applied to payment of the tax due for the fiscal period ending June 30th and one-half to payment of the tax due for the following fiscal year, the first six months of which were the last six months of the calendar year for which the tax was paid. This would result in an underpayment for the six months ending June 30, 1918, of $84,932.85, collection of which is barred by the statute; in an overpayment for the year ending June 30, 1919, of $66,380. 91, reclaim of which is also barred by the statute; and in an overpayment for the year ending June 30, 1920, of $556,754.70, for which claim for refund was filed September 15, 1925, and for recovery of which the present suit was brought. \n\n[284 U.S. 343, 347]\n\u00a0\n We think that neither the government nor the petitioner has chosen the correct method of restating the account. At the outset it is to be observed that throughout the taxable periods in question the total payments made by the taxpayer always exceeded the total taxes due, computed, as the statute required, on the basis of the taxpayer's fiscal years, and the right to recover the excess payment turns on whether it was paid for a period bringing it within or without the applicable period of limitation. The periods for which the several payments by petitioner were made are not necessarily the same as petitioner's fiscal years, for which the statute required returns. The object of the payment is in each instance defined by the intention of the taxpayer, to be ascertained from all the relevant facts and circumstances. To determine petitioner's intention, we may look at the returns which it filed, even though they mistakenly embraced a period which did not coincide with the fiscal period for which a return was prescribed.\n The return made for the calendar year 1918, and the payments of tax made in accordance with it, disclose unmistakably petitioner's intention to pay the tax on all income received during the calendar year 1918. Of the total income thus received, only that of the first six months was, under the statute, taxable in that year. Hence, the payment of taxes on the income for the entire year resulted in an overpayment of the tax accrued in the first six months in the sum of $538,202.77. But this is not, as the government contends, to be regarded as an overpayment only of tax due for the first six months of 1918. True, the taxpayer was required to make a return and pay taxes for that six months, and was not authorized to make any other return; but it did in fact make a return of its income and pay taxes for the entire calendar year and thus evidenced its intention to include in the return and pay taxes upon income accruing in the last, as well as \n\n[284 U.S. 343, 348]\n\u00a0\n the first six months of the calendar year. Thus, when the taxpayer had completed its payments of taxes for the entire year, they were enough to pay in full the tax due and payable for the six months ending June 30, 1918, and in addition to pay the sum of $538.202.77 on account of the tax on income accrued in the remaining six months of the year for which the payment was made. But as those six months were embraced in the fiscal period ending June 30, 1919, which for purposes of assessing and paying the tax the statute treats as a unit, the overpayment must necessarily be treated as a payment on account of the tax accruing for that period.\n For the calendar year 1919 the same considerations govern. The overpayment last referred to, applicable on account of taxes due for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1919, was not sufficient to pay the entire tax, aggregating $896,314.83, which the Commissioner assessed for that period. But the payments for the calendar year 1919, when added to this overpayment, exceeded the tax assessed for the fiscal year ending in June by a sum amounting, after deduction of refunds since made, to $443,367.61. As in the case of the tax paid for 1918, that paid by petitioner for 1919 was not for the fiscal, but for the calendar year. Consequently, the payment in excess of the tax due and payable for the period ending June 30, 1919, was in fact and in law a payment in advance on account of the tax upon income for the ensuing taxable period, the fiscal year ending June 30, 1920. As upon recomputation of the tax none was found due for that fiscal year, this payment in advance became an overpayment, when the tax for that period was assessable, which the petitioner is entitled to recover unless barred by the statute of limitations.\n Section 284(b)(1) of the Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, 66, 26 USCA  1065(b)(1), provides that no refund shall be made after four years from the time the tax is paid unless within that period a claim for refund is filed by the taxpayer. \n\n[284 U.S. 343, 349]\n\u00a0\n But by section 284(h), 26 USCA  1065(h), it is provided that that section shall not 'bar from allowance a claim in respect of a tax for the taxable year 1919 or 1920 if such claim is filed before the expiration of five years after the date the return was due.' As the petitioner's tax payments for the entire period under consideration were completed in December, 1920, its claim for refund, filed September 15, 1925, was not within the four year period, and its right to recover is barred unless September 15, 1925, the date the claim was filed, was before the expiration of 'five years after the date the return was due,' as provided by paragraph (h). The claim was in time only if, as petitioner contends, the return was due September 15, 1920, which is the date fixed by section 227 of the 1918 act ( 40 Stat. 1075) for filing petitioner's return for the fiscal year ending June 30th. See Burnet v. Willingham Loan & Trust Co., \n282 \nU.S. 437\n, 51 S. Ct. 185.\n On its face, section 284(h), which specifically refers to a claim for a refund 'of a tax for the taxable year ... 1920,' and bars it if not filed within five years after the return was due, would seem to refer to the time fixed by the statute for return of income for the taxable year for which the tax was paid, which, in this case, was September 15, 1920. But the government, notwithstanding its argument that the return for petitioner's fiscal year is the only one referred to or authorized by section 212 of the 1918 act, insists that the words 'date the return was due' in section 284(h) of the 1926 act refer to the return which the taxpayer in fact filed for the calendar year 1919, which, under the applicable section, section 227 of the 1918 act, was due on March 15, 1920. In support of this contention it points to the language of section 252 of the 1918 act (40 Stat. 1085), in which the quoted words first occurred. In that section they were preceded by a provision requiring credit or refund 'if, upon examination of any return,' an overpayment appeared. From this it is argued that the proviso in the same section that refund should not be allowed unless claim was made within five years from the 'date the \n\n[284 U.S. 343, 350]\n\u00a0\n return was due' refers to the due date of the return actually filed and not the due date of the return required by the statute.\n But it is to be noted that the reference, in section 252 of the 1918 act, to an examination of the return, which was continued in section 252 of the 1921 Act, c. 136, 42 Stat. 227, 268, was dropped from the corresponding section 281 of the Revenue Act of 1924 (26 USCA  1065 note), and the applicable section 284 of the Act of 1926. Both of these sections provide for refund or credit of any overpayment of the tax, and specific reference to the taxable year 1920 was inserted in the proviso that the section should not bar claims for overpayment of 'a tax for the taxable year 1919 or 1920' if 'filed before expiration of five years after the date the return was due.' Whatever the meaning of 'return' as used in the earlier sections, we think it reasonably clear that the omission by the later ones of all reference to the return actually filed and the insertion of a reference to the taxable year, in juxtaposition to the phrase 'five years after the date the return was due,' evidenced an intention that the date from which the statute is to run should be the due date of the return required by the statute for the taxable year.\n There is no basis for the contention of petitioner that the taxes paid for each calendar year should be divided and one-half applied to tax due for the first six months and one-half for tax accruing in the last six months of the year. \n1\n We think neither the circumstances nor the applicable statute permits such an allocation. Section 226 of the 1918 act authorizes the calculation of the tax for that \n\n[284 U.S. 343, 351]\n\u00a0\n part of a fiscal year falling between the beginning of the calendar year and the end of the fiscal year by the apportionment of gross income and deductions for the fiscal year, pro rata to the taxable fiscal period, in order to arrive at net income for the latter. See Appeal of Weed, 2 B. T. A. 84. But the section does not authorize a like apportionment of the tax paid for the calendar year, and none was made by the returns which petitioner filed. The tax paid was for the income of the entire year and was obviously intended to be applied to the payment of any tax due or payable in that year, which would include all the tax accruing for the fiscal period ending June 30th. Under section 252 of the Revenue Act of 1918, petitioner could not at any time have claimed a refund of any overpayment of tax except such amount as was 'in excess of that properly due' for the first six months, and since the excess, as already indicated, was, in each year, paid on account of the calendar year, a part of which fell within the fiscal period following June 30th, a correct statement of the account requires the overpayment to be credited to that rather than the preceding fiscal period.\n It follows that recovery should be allowed of the amount of the overpayment not already refunded, which, as stated, is $443,367.61, with interest computed in accordance with the applicable statutes, and that the judgment should be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\n The amounts of the tax computed by the commissioner and the amount of the overpayment as stated in this opinion are those shown by the findings of the Court of Claims, but the mandate of this Court will be without prejudice to any restatement of the amount of overpayment based on a recomputation of the tax.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] For conforming opinion of Court of Claims, see 58 F.(2d) 1080. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Such a prorating of tax payments in order to allocate taxes, erroneously paid for a calendar year, to the portions of the two fiscal years which make up the calendar year, was allowed by the Board of Tax Appeals in Paso Robles Mercantile Co. v.

GREEK CATHOLIC UNION(1932)\nNo. 401\nArgued: January 22, 1932Decided: February 15, 1932\n\n\n\n\n[284 U.S. 563, 564]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Edmund W. Arthur and James M. Magee, both of Pittsburgh, Pa., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Ralph C. Davis and Thomas Stephen Brown, both of Pittsburgh, Pa., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner executed in favor of the respondent a bond in the sum of $100,000 conditioned upon the payment of pecuniary loss the corporation should sustain through the failure of one Kondor, its treasurer, faithfully to perform his duties as prescribed by the constitution and by- laws, or through his failure to keep intact and absolutely to account for all funds of the corporation. Kondor violated his duty by depositing with the People's State Bank of Johnstown, Pa., of which he was president, a sum greatly in excess of that permitted by the by-laws to be lodged in any one depositary. The bank became embarrassed and the state banking department instituted an investigation of its affairs. The amount on deposit to the credit of respondent was found to be over $241,000; and checks for $89,000 had been prepared for signature by Kondor as treasurer and were about to be issued. The representatives of the state determined that if these checks were issued and presented for payment they could not be met out of the bank's available resources, and the institution would have to be closed and placed in the hands of an official liquidator.\n News of the situation reached certain executive officers of the Union who lived in Pittsburgh, and they came to \n\n[284 U.S. 563, 565]\n\u00a0\n Johnstown with their attorneys. They were informed that unless $100,000 additional cash was deposited with the bank the state would not permit the institution to honor the checks for $89,000. In this exigency, counsel for the respondent called up an official of the petitioner at Pittsburgh and was advised by him that he had no authority to act in the premises. The only one to whom he could refer counsel was the general claim agent of the petitioner, who lived in New York. When reached by telephone, he stated that he had no authority to pay or deposit $100,000; that such a matter would have to be referred to the executive committee. He was told that negotiations were under way to have another bank or trust company in Johnstown take over the assets and liabilities of the People's Bank, that a definite arrangement would have to be reached in less than twenty-four hours, and that the petitioner should have some one representing it come at once to Johnstown to join in the conferences on this subject. It does not appear that a promise was made that any such person could or would arrive in time to take part in the matter. This conversation took place on a Sunday morning. Late the same night a contract was entered into between the People's State Bank and the United States Trust Company of Johnstown whereby the latter assumed all the liabilities of the bank, except for its capital stock, in consideration of the conveyance of all its assets. The trust company was unwilling to make this agreement unless respondent would stipulate to leave with it $200,000 of the existing deposit with the bank for four years without interest. To assure the consummation of the transfer, the respondent executed such an undertaking. The trust company proceeded with the liquidation of the affairs of the former bank, paid checks for some $41,000 of the deposit standing to the credit of the respondent, and, at the expiration of the stipulated \n\n[284 U.S. 563, 566]\n\u00a0\n four-year period, paid the respondent the remaining $200,000.\n Respondent brought this action, alleging Kondor's breach of duty under the by-laws and his failure to keep intact the moneys intrusted to him as treasurer, and the consequent liability of petitioner on its bond. The declaration detailed the facts we have summarized, asserted due notice of breach to the surety, and its failure to meet the accruing liability; recounted the arrangement made in order to save loss, and claimed some $41, 000 of interest lost to the corporation by reason of Kondor's default and the resulting agreement with the United States Trust Company made necessary thereby. The amount demanded was made up by showing that for four years $200,000 of the respondent's moneys had yielded no income, and that in conformity with the by-laws all of these funds would have been promptly invested except for Kondor's default; that the corporation normally earned five per cent. on investments, and had lost the opportunity to earn at that or any rate by reason of having to leave the $ 200,000 on deposit with the United States Trust Company without interest. The petitioner filed a statutory demurrer which was sustained by the District Court, whose decision was overruled by the Circuit Court of Appeals (25 F.(2d) 31) and the case remanded for further proceedings. A trial on the merits resulted in a verdict and judgment for the amount claimed. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed (51 F. (2d) 1050). This court granted certiorari.\n At trial, the court affirmed a point for charge presented by respondent, which permitted the jury to find whether the arrangement entered into between respondent and the United States Trust Company created a material variation of the surety's risk. Petitioner presented a point to the effect that the agreement with the trust company created a material variance in the contract of suretyship, \n\n[284 U.S. 563, 567]\n\u00a0\n deprived the surety of recovery of salvage from the People's State Bank, and relieved the petitioner of the burden of showing that the variance was prejudicial. This was refused.\n The parties agree that Kondor's conduct with respect to the deposit in the People's State Bank was a breach of his obligations and entailed a liability upon the bond; that the ascertainment of Kondor's defaults and notice thereof to the surety matured the surety's obligation to pay the loss sustained up to $100,000; that if petitioner had made such payment it would have been entitled to be subrogated to the rights of the respondent against the People's State Bank and Kondor; and that the course adopted by the officers of the Union deprived the surety of any opportunity to pursue the People's State Bank. In its brief and at bar, respondent conceded that the telephone conversations with petitioner's employees on the eve of entering into the agreement with the United States Trust Company in no way affected the reciprocal rights and liabilities consequent on Kondor's defaults. These agreements and concessions narrow the issue presented to the question whether the arrangements made and approved by the officers of the obligee so varied the risk as to release the obligor from liability under its bond. The court below was of opinion the exigency which confronted the Union's officers was similar to one which an insured faces when a fire occurs, and the efforts at salvage ought not to be held a prejudicial variation of the hazard; that the burden rested upon petitioner affirmatively to prove that what was done increased its risk; and that the trial judge properly left this question as one of fact to the jury.\n We cannot agree with this view. Assuming that respondent is right in its contention that the obligation here was in the nature of an insurance contract rather than one of strict suretyship (American Surety Co. v. Pauly, \n170 \nU.S. 133, 144\n, 18 S. Ct. 552; United States F. & G. Co. v. Golden Pressed & Fire Brick \n\n[284 U.S. 563, 568]\n\u00a0\n Co., \n191 \nU.S. 416, 423\n, 24 S. Ct. 142), and that consequently a variation of the risk does not ipso facto discharge the insurer, who in order to escape liability must prove that the change was material and prejudicial, it remains, as a practical matter, that what was done made proof of actual detriment impossible. If the bank had been closed, the surety would have remained liable for the penal sum named in the bond, and, upon payment thereof, would have been subrogated to the respondent's rights against the bank and the defaulting treasurer. Whether the resulting loss would have been more than $41,000 no one can tell. The state authorities, from such examination as they had made, were of the opinion that the depositary might pay from twenty to forty per cent. of its liabilities. It appears, however, that by the administration of the United States Trust Company the debts have been paid almost in full, and some assets of doubtful value remain to be converted. The action of the Union's officials has placed the question of probable prejudice due to the adoption of one of the two alternatives presented wholly in the realm of conjecture, and respondent now seeks to cast upon petitioner the burden of proving the consequences of an event which never in fact occurred.\n The cases relied on by respondent have to do with an alteration of the terms of a principal obligation prior to any breach, and without the surety's consent. They address themselves to the question whether such a change discharges the indemnitor from liability consequent upon a breach. Young v. American Bonding Co., 228 Pa. 373, 77 A. 623; Philadelphia v. Fidelity & Dep. Co., 231 Pa. 208, 80 A. 62, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 1085; Brown v. Title Guaranty & Surety Co., 232 Pa. 337, 81 A. 410, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 698; Philadelphia v. Ray, 266 Pa. 345, 109 A. 689.\n The instant case presents an altogether different situation. A breach had occurred which entailed a loss for which the bondsman was liable; and thereafter the ob- \n\n[284 U.S. 563, 569]\n\u00a0\n ligee, without consulting the surety, entered into a wholly new arrangement relative to the recoupment of such loss. The claim is that this action was in fact in the interest of the surety and saved it money, and that, if this is not true, the surety must assume the burden of proving what would have been the result of refraining from the attempt to minimize loss. We are referred to no authority in support of this position, and we think it unsound as applied even to the case of a paid surety company, which is often treated as an insurer merely.\n Viewed in another aspect, the facts preclude a recovery. The cause and genesis of the loss was not one of the events specified in the bond on which payment was conditioned. The defaults for which the petitioner agreed to be liable were clearly defined. The bond guaranteed against fraud, dishonesty, forgery, theft, etc., of the treasurer; against his neglect faithfully to perform his duties as prescribed by the constitution and by-laws; against his omission to keep intact and absolutely to account for all the funds of the corporation; and against the failure of any bank or trust company in which he might deposit such funds. There is no evidence that the loss occurred through the fraud, dishonesty, or forgery of Kondor. It did not arise from the failure of the depositary, for the bank was not allowed to fail. The breach for which indemnity was to be afforded was Kondor's default in the performance of his duties and with respect to the protection of the funds of the corporation. There is nothing in the instrument which by the farthest stretch of construction can be said to undertake the payment of a loss due to an agreement of the corporation to substitute some other bank or trust company for the People's Bank. The voluntary action of the respondent in making an entirely new agreement, whereby in effect it loaned $200,000 to the United States Trust Company for four years without interest, caused the loss for which \n\n[284 U.S. 563, 570]\n\u00a0\n the suit is brought. In view of the situation confronting it, the Union thought well to incur the risk of losing that interest. It cannot now ask that the bond be rewritten to cover an event not therein specified or contemplated. Where an insured without the agreement of the insurer undertakes to substitute a new obligation under a new agreement with a third party in lieu of those arising from a breach of the officer whose fidelity is insured, thus substituting a new and different liability from any undertaken in the instrument of suretyship, and depriving the insurer of the right of subrogation, such conduct operates to discharge the obligation of the indemnity contract.\n Judgment reversed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS is of opinion the judgment should be affirmed. \n\n\n\n","7":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nAMERICAN SURETY CO. v. BALDWIN(1932)\nNo. 21\nArgued: Decided: November 14, 1932\n\n\n\n\n[287 U.S. 156, 157]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Wm. Marshall Bullitt, of Louisville, Ky., Allan C. Rowe, of New York City, and Oliver O. Haga and Frank Martin, both of Boise, Idaho, for American Surety Co.\n\n\n\n[287 U.S. 156, 158]\n\u00a0\n Mr. James F. Ailshie, Jr., of Boise, Idaho, for Baldwin and others.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In each of these cases, the American Surety Company of New York seeks to be relieved from a judgment in favor of the Baldwins entered against it by an Idaho \n\n[287 U.S. 156, 159]\n\u00a0\n court for.$22,357.21 and interest, on a supersedeas bond. No. 3, which is here on certiorari to the Supreme Court of Idaho, brings the record of the cause in which that judgment was entered. \n286 \nU.S. 536\n, 52 S.Ct. 499. No. 21 is here on certiorari to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which reversed the decree of the federal court for Idaho denying the surety company's application to enjoin the enforcement of the judgment and dismissing the bill. \n286 \nU.S. 537\n, 52 S.Ct. 500. In each case it is claimed that the judgment is void under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The bond was given upon the appeal of the Singer Sewing Machine Company and Anderson, its employee, to the Supreme Court of Idaho from a judgment for $19,500 recovered against them by the Baldwins in an Idaho district court for an automobile collision. The defendants had given a joint notice of appeal 'from that certain judgment ... against the defendants and each of them, and from the whole thereof.' Pursuant to the statutes (Idaho Compiled Statutes,  7154 and 7155), two bonds were given by the surety company; both being executed only by it. One was in the sum of $300 for costs; the other was the supersedeas bond in the sum of $25, 000 here in question, copied in the margin. 1 It recited that, \n\n[287 U.S. 156, 160]\n\u00a0\n 'if the said judgment appealed from, or any part thereof, be affirmed' and 'if the said appellant does not make such payment within thirty days from the filing of the remittitur from the Supreme Court in the court from which the appeal is taken, judgment may be entered on motion of the respondents in their favor against the undersigned surety.'\n___ Now, therefore, the undersigned American Surety Company, a corporation authorized to, and doing business in the State of Idaho, in consideration of the premises and of such appeal on the part of said appellant, Singer Sewing Machine Company, a corporation, does hereby acknowledge itself firmly bound in the sum of Twenty-five Thousand ($25, 000.00) Dollars, gold coin of the United States, that if the said judgment appealed from, or any part thereof, be affirmed, or the appeal dismissed, the appellant will pay in gold coin of the United States of America, the amount directed to be paid as to which said judgment shall be affirmed, if affirmed only in part, and all damages and costs which may be awarded against the appellant upon the appeal, and that if the said appellant does not make such payment within thirty days from the filing of the remittitur from the Supreme Court in the court from which the appeal is taken, judgment may be entered on motion of the respondents in their favor and against the undersigned surety for the said sum of Nineteen Thousand Five Hundred Seventy-three and 70\/100 ($19,573.70) Dollars, together with the interest that may be due thereon and the damages and costs which may be awarded against the said appellant, Singer Sewing Machine Company, upon the appeal.\n In Witness Whereof, the said American Surety Company, has caused its name and seal to be attached hereto by its proper officers and agents at Boise, Idaho, this 28th day of August, 1928\n\n\n American Surety Company of New York, By Howard E. Stein, Attorney-in-Fact Countersigned: Howard E. Stein, Agent at Boise, Idaho. \n\n[287 U.S. 156, 161]\n\u00a0\n The Supreme Court affirmed the judgment as to Anderson and reversed it as to the Singer Company. Baldwin v. Singer Sewing Machine Co. and Anderson, 49 Idaho, 231, 287 P. 944. Upon the filing of the remittitur, the appropriate new judgment against Anderson was entered in the trial court. That judgment having remained unpaid more than thirty days, the Baldwins, without giving notice to either of the original defendants or to the surety company, moved the trial court to enter judgment against the latter. On June 23, 1930, judgment was so entered against the surety company in the sum of.$22,357.21 and interest, with a provision 'that the plaintiffs have execution therefor.'\n The surety company concedes that by executing the supersedeas bond it became, by the laws of Idaho, a party to the litigation,2 and that, if the effect of the bond was to stay the judgment as against Anderson, consent had thereby been given to the entry of judgment without notice and the judgment would be unassailable. Compare Pease v. Rathbun-Jones Engineering Co., \n243 \nU.S. 273, 279\n, 37 S.Ct. 283, Ann.Cas.1918C, 1147. Its contention is that the bond, properly construed, \n\n[287 U.S. 156, 162]\n\u00a0\n did not stay the judgment as against Anderson, but solely as against the Singer Company; that hence the surety company had not consented to the entry of a judgment against it upon Anderson's failure to pay; and that, since the judgment against it was entered without giving it notice and the opportunity of a hearing on the construction and effect of the bond, the judgment is void under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n First. The certiorari granted in No. 3 to review the judgment rendered by the Supreme Court of Idaho on May 2, 1931 (50 Idaho, 606, 299 P. 341), must be dismissed for failure to make seasonably the federal claim. The proceedings culminating in that judgment were these. On June 26, 1930, three days after the entry by the Idaho district court of judgment against the surety company on the supersedeas bond, it filed a motion in that court to vacate and set aside the judgment. The grounds there urged in support of the motion were wholly state grounds. They were that the judgment was void, because there had been no breach of condition of the bond, properly construed; that the judgment had been entered without notice to either the surety company or the Singer Company; and that the enforcement of the judgment would be contrary to good conscience and equity. After hearing arguments on the motion, the Idaho district court ordered that the judgment be vacated and set aside, and that the execution issued pursuant thereto be quashed. The Baldwins appealed to the Supreme Court of Idaho; and, upon the presentation of their appeal, no federal question was raised by either party. The Supreme Court, on May 2, 1931, reversed the order vacating the judgment. It declared that the only issue before the trial court on motion to vacate was its own jurisdiction to render the judgment against the surety company on the supersedeas undertaking; that such jurisdiction existed by virtue of the surety company's execution of the undertaking in \n\n[287 U.S. 156, 163]\n\u00a0\n the cause; that the question which had necessarily been presented was, 'Did the surety company, in its undertaking, become a party liable for every part of the judgment appealed from which might be affirmed by the Supreme Court, or did it stipulate only as to such judgment or part thereof as might be affirmed against the Singer Sewing Machine Company?' that the trial court thus had the power and duty to construe the bond; that 'whether it decided right or wrong, its decision was a judgment which could be reviewed for error, if there was error, only by' the Supreme Court on appeal; and that the alleged error could not be raised on motion to vacate. 50 Idaho, 609, 614-616, 299 P. 341, 344.\n The surety company petitioned for a rehearing. In that petition, besides reiterating several of its previous contentions, it urged, for the first time, that the rendition of the judgment on its undertaking violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n3\n The petition was denied without opinion. The federal claim there made cannot serve as the basis for review by this Court. The contention that a federal right had been violated rests on the action of the trial court in entering judg- \n\n[287 U.S. 156, 164]\n\u00a0\n ment without giving notice and an opportunity to be heard. The same ground of objection had been raised throughout the proceedings, but solely as a matter of state law. There had been ample opportunity earlier to present the objection as one arising under the Fourteenth Amendment. Compare Corkran Oil Co. v. Arnaudet, \n199 \nU.S. 182, 193\n, 26 S.Ct. 41; Godchaux Co. v. Estopinal, \n251 \nU.S. 179, 181\n, 40 S.Ct. 116; Live Oak Water Users' Ass'n v. Railroad Comm., \n269 \nU.S. 354, 357\n, 46 S.Ct. 149. This is not a case where, as in Saunders v. Shaw, \n244 \nU.S. 317, 320\n, 37 S.Ct. 638, the federal claim arose from the unanticipated disposition of the case at the close of the proceedings in the state Supreme Court. Compare Ohio ex rel. Bryant v. Akron Metropolitan Park Dist., \n281 \nU.S. 74, 79\n, 50 S.Ct. 228, 66 A.L.R. 1460. Nor is the federal claim based, as in Brinkerhoff-Faris Trust & Savings Co. v. Hill, \n281 \nU.S. 673, 678\n, 50 S.Ct. 451, upon the unanticipated act of the state Supreme Court in giving to a statute a new construction which threatened rights under the Constitution. Compare Missouri ex rel. Missouri Insurance Co. v. Gehner, \n281 \nU.S. 313, 320\n, 50 S. Ct. 326.\n Second. In No. 21, the Circuit Court of Appeals should have affirmed the decree of the federal court for Idaho which denied the surety company's application for an interlocutory injunction and dismissed the bill. For the federal remedy was barred by the proceedings taken in the state court which ripened into a final judgment constituting res judicata.\n The surety company was at liberty to resort to the federal court regardless of citizenship, because entry of the judgment without notice, unless authorized by it, violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Compare National Exchange Bank v. Wiley, \n195 \nU.S. 257\n, 25 S.Ct. 70; Cooper v. Newell, \n173 \nU.S. 555\n, 19 S.Ct. 506. And it was at liberty to invoke the federal remedy without first pursuing that provided by state procedure. Simon v. Southern Ry., \n236 \nU.S. 115\n, 35 S.Ct. 255; Atchison, Topeka & Santa \n\n[287 U.S. 156, 165]\n\u00a0\n Fe Ry. Co. v. Wells, \n265 \nU.S. 101\n, 44 S.Ct. 469; Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Marlboro Cotton Mills (C.C.A.) 282 F. 811, 814. But an adequate state remedy was available; and, having invoked that and pursued it to final judgment, the surety company cannot escape the effect of the adjudication there. Compare Mitchell v. First National Bank, \n180 U.S. 471\n, 480-481, 21 S.Ct. 418; Lion Bonding Co. v. Karatz, \n262 \nU.S. 77, 90\n, 43 S.Ct. 480.\n The Supreme Court of Idaho had jurisdiction over the parties and of the subject-matter in order to determine whether the trial court had jurisdiction. Clearly, the motion to vacate, made on a general appearance, and the appeal from the order thereon, were no less effective to confer jurisdiction for that purpose than were the special appearance and motion to quash and dismiss held sufficient in Baldwin v. Iowa State Traveling Men's Ass'n, \n283 \nU.S. 522\n, 51 S.Ct. 517; And there was an actual adjudication in the state court of the question of the jurisdiction of the trial court to enter judgment. The scope of the issues presented involved an adjudication of that issue. Compare Napa Valley Elec. Co. v. Railroad Comm., \n251 \nU.S. 366\n, 40 S.Ct. 174; Grubb v. Public Utilities Comm., \n281 U.S. 470\n, 477-478, 50 S.Ct. 374. The Supreme Court of Idaho did not refuse to adjudicate that question when it declined to 'construe the legal effect of the undertaking in question further than to examine it in aid of determining the sole question of the court's jurisdiction to hear and determine the motion for judgment thereon.' It narrowed the issue, according to the state procedure, by separating, in effect, the question of jurisdiction from that of liability. It held that the status of the surety company as a party to the litigation, by virtue of its execution of the bond in the cause, necessarily persisted, although its liability may have been limited by the terms of the bond. With the soundness of the decision we are not here concerned. It is enough that the court did not, as the surety com- \n\n[287 U.S. 156, 166]\n\u00a0\n pany asserts, reach its decision by merely assuming the point in issue, or by deeming itself concluded by the fact that the trial court took jurisdiction. That it did not so reach its decision is made clear by the opinion itself. We are thus brought to a consideration of the effect on the present suit of the judgment of the Supreme Court of Idaho.\n The full faith and credit clause, Const. art. 4,  1, together with the legislation pursuant thereto, applies to judicial proceedings of a state court drawn in question in an independent proceeding in the federal courts. Act of May 26, 1790, c. 11; Act of March 27, 1804, c. 56,  2; Rev. Stat.  905 (28 USCA  687); Mills v. Duryee, 7 Cranch, 481, 485; Mutual L. Insurance Co. v. Harris, \n97 U.S. 331\n, 336. Compare Bradford Electric Light Co. v. Clapper, \n286 \nU.S. 145, 155\n, 52 S.Ct. 571. The principles of res judicata apply to questions of jurisdiction as well as to other issues. Baldwin v. Iowa State Traveling Men's Ass'n, \n283 \nU.S. 522\n, 51 S.Ct. 517. They are given effect even where the proceeding in the federal court is to enjoin the enforcement of a state judgment, if the issue was made and open to litigation in the original action, or was determined in an independent proceeding in the state courts. See Marshall v. Holmes, \n141 \nU.S. 589, 596\n, 12 S.Ct. 62; Fidelity & Deposit Co. of Maryland v. Gaston, Williams & Wigmore (D.C.) 13 F.(2d) 267, affirmed per curiam, (C.C.A.) 13 F.(2d) 268.4 The principles of res judicata may apply, although the proceeding was begun by motion. Thus, a decision in a proceeding begun by motion to set aside a judgment for want of jurisdiction is, under Idaho law, res judicata, and precludes a suit to enjoin enforcement of the judgment. Bernhard v. Idaho Bank & Trust Co., 21 Idaho, 598, 123 P. 481, Ann. Cas. 1913E, 120.5 Since the deci- \n\n[287 U.S. 156, 167]\n\u00a0\n sion would formally constitute res judicata in the courts of the state, since it in fact satisfies the requirements of prior adjudication, and since the constitutional issue as to jurisdiction might have been presented to the state Supreme Court and reviewed here, the decision is a bar to the present suit in so far as it seeks to enjoin the enforcement of the judgment for want of jurisdiction. Compare Fidelity Natl. Bank & Trust Co. v. Swope, \n274 U.S. 123\n, 130-131, 47 S.Ct. 511. \n\n[287 U.S. 156, 168]\n\u00a0\n Third. The surety company contends in No. 21 that, even if the trial court of the state had jurisdiction, the federal District Court may enjoin the enforcement of the judgment on the ground that, having been entered without notice and an opportunity for a hearing on the construction of the bond, it lacked due process of law. It is true that entry of judgment without notice may be a denial of due process even where there is jurisdiction over the person and subject-matter. But that rule is not applicable here; for, if the bond properly construed stayed the judgment as against Anderson, the surety company consented to the entry of judgment against it without notice for his failure to pay. If the bond did not stay the judgment as against Anderson, the trial court confessedly erred in entering the judgment on the bond. In order to contest its liability, the surety company had the constitutional right to be heard at some time on the construction of the bond. The state practice provided the opportunity for such a hearing by an appeal after the entry of judgment.\n The practice prescribed was constitutional. Due process requires that there be an opportunity to present every available defense; but it need not be before the entry of judgment. York v. Texas, \n137 \nU.S. 15\n, 11 S.Ct. 9. Compare Grant Timber & Manufacturing Co. v. Gray, \n236 \nU.S. 133\n, 35 S.Ct. 279, Bianchi v. Morales, \n262 \nU.S. 170\n, 43 S.Ct. 526. See, also, Phillips v. Commissioner, \n283 U.S. 589\n, 596- 597, 51 S.Ct. 608; Coffin Brothers & Co. v. Bennett, \n277 \nU.S. 29\n, 48 S.Ct. 422. An appeal on the record which included the bond afforded an adequate opportunity. Thus the entry of judgment was consistent with due process of law. We need not inquire whether its validity may not rest also on the ground that the surety company, by giving the bond, must be taken to have consented to the state procedure. Compare United Surety Co. v. American Fruit Product Co., \n238 \nU.S. 140, 142\n, 35 S.Ct. 828, Corn Exchange Bank v. Commissioner, \n280 \nU.S. 218, 223\n, 50 S.Ct. 94. The opportunity afforded by \n\n[287 U.S. 156, 169]\n\u00a0\n state practice was lost because the surety company inadvertently pursued the wrong procedure in the state courts. Instead of moving to vacate, it should have appealed directly to the state Supreme Court. When later it pursued the proper course, the time for appealing had elapsed. The fact that its opportunity for a hearing was lost because misapprehension as to the appropriate remedy was not removed by judicial decision until it was too late to rectify the error does not furnish the basis for a claim that due process of law has been denied. Compare O'Neil v. Northern Colorado Irrigation Co., \n242 \nU.S. 20, 26\n, 37 S.Ct. 7. Having invoked the state procedure which afforded the opportunity of raising the issue of lack of notice, the surety company cannot utilize the same issue as a basis for relief in the federal court. Federal claims are not to be prosecuted piecemeal in state and federal courts, whether the attempt to do so springs from a failure seasonably to adduce relevant facts, as in Grubb v. Public Utilities Commission, \n281 \nU.S. 470, 479\n, 50 S.Ct. 374; or from a failure seasonably to pursue the appropriate state remedy. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n In No. 3, writ of certiorari dismissed.\n In No. 21, decree reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Vivian F.

The second was a direct appeal to the Supreme Court of Idaho from the original judgment; this appeal was dismissed because taken more than 90 days after the entry of the judgment appealed from. 51 Idaho, 614, 8 P.(2d) 461, decided February 21, 1932. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] In Wells Fargo & Co. v. Taylor, \n254 \nU.S. 175\n, 41 S.Ct. 93, the petitioner had not been allowed to become a party to the prior litigation in the state court. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] The opinion in that case makes it clear that the effect of the prior judgment as a bar does not rest merely on a rule of practice or, where the second proceeding is in equity, on the adequacy of the remedy at law. The court said: 'In this state the appellant had a choice between two remedies, and he chose to file his motion to vacate the judgment in the case in which the judgment was rendered upon the same facts as pleaded in the complaint in the action involved, and the court after hearing the motion decided the facts against the appellant, holding that the judgment was not void, and the order so holding was appealable. \n But appellant refused to exercise his right of appeal and brought this suit in equity to enjoin the collection of said judgment. He had his day in court in that action, and the decision of that motion upon the question of jurisdiction was res adjudicata. The appellant had the right either to attack said judgment by motion in the original case or by bringing this action to enjoin or to have it set aside. If he proceeded by motion and the court decided against him, the decision of that question, until reversed upon appeal, is final and binding on the parties.' 21 Idaho, 598, 603, 604, 123 P. 481, 482, Ann. Cas. 1913E, 120.\n Compare the effect, under Idaho law, of a decision on a motion to set aside a judgment because of the mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect of the defendant, or to allow an answer to the merits to be interposed after judgment where summons was not served personally on the defendant.

HEACOCK CO.(1932)\nNo. 506\nArgued: February 26, 1932Decided: March 21, 1932\n\n\n\n\n\n[285 U.S. 247, 248]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Harry D. Nims, of New York City, for petition.\n\n\n[285 U.S. 247, 250]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Edward S. Rogers, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n\n[285 U.S. 247, 252]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In No. 506, H. E. Heacock Company, a corporation of the Phillippine Islands and a dealer in 'flatware,' brought suit in the Court of First Instance of Manila against the American Trading Company, also a local corporation, to enjoin infringement of trade-mark and unfair competition. The trade-mark was the name 'Rogers,' which, it was alleged, had been used by plaintiff for upwards of twenty years on flatware, whether nickel, silverplated, or silver, imported by plaintiff and sold in the Islands. In the year 1918, this trade-mark was registered under the Philippine Act No. 666 of March 6, 1903, as amended, in the local Bureau of Commerce and Industry. The complaint charged that defendant, about the year 1925, began to import and sell within the Philippine Islands flatware of precisely the same designs, as that imported and sold by plaintiff, with the words 'Wm. A. Rogers' stamped on the ware in the same position as that which plaintiff utilized, and that through this imitation plaintiff was being defrauded of its legitimate trade. The answer denied the allegations of unfair dealing, and alleged that plaintiff had no legal right to appropriate the name 'Rogers' and that, as against defendant, the registration of that name was invalid. The answer further averred that the defendant was acting in the Philippine Islands as the local representative of Wm. A. Rogers, Limited (a Canadian corporation doing business in Canada and New York) which was engaged in the manufacture of flatware and had duly registered in the United States, and was \n\n[285 U.S. 247, 253]\n\u00a0\n using in its business, several trade-marks embracing the name 'Wm. A. Rogers' and 'Rogers' in various forms. No. 507 is a cross-suit instituted by Wm. A. Rogers, Limited, and the American Trading Company against H. E. Heacock Company.\n The two suits were tried together. Judgment was rendered in favor of H. E. Heacock Company, ordering an accounting of profits and directing that Wm. A. Rogers, Limited, and the American Trading Company 'perpetually abstain from importing and selling in the Philippine Islands silver-plated wares for use in the table and for other purposes similar to those imported and sold by the plaintiff, bearing the trade-mark 'Rogers.\" The cross suit was dismissed. The Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands rendered judgments of affirmance, and this Court granted writs of certiorari. \n284 \nU.S. 613\n, 52 S. Ct. 198, 76 L. Ed. -. Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229,  7, 43 Stat. 936, 940 (28 USCA  349).\n The facts as found by the insular courts, and as set forth in the opinion of the Supreme Court, may be summarized as follows: About seventy years ago, three brothers by the name of Rogers, composing a firm in Connecticut under the name of 'Rogers Bros.,' were the first to apply the art of electroplating to the manufacture of silver-plated ware in the United States. Their ware soon acquired a high reputation. In 1865, Wm. Rogers, one of the brothers, organized a corporation known as the Wm. Rogers Manufacturing Company which used on its silver-plated ware the trade-marks '1865 Wm. Rogers Mfg. Co.' and 'Wm. Rogers & Son.' Two other corporations also acquired from one or more of the brothers the right to the use of the name Rogers, and the wares of these concerns were known by the public as 'Rogers.' In 1898, the International Silver Company was organized and became the owner of the capital stock or properties of a number of corporations, including the Wm. Rogers Manufacturing Company, the Meriden Britannia Com- \n\n[285 U.S. 247, 254]\n\u00a0\n pany, and Rogers & Bro. (which were engaged in making silver-plated ware) together with their good will and trade-marks embracing the marks '1847 Rogers Bros.' and the '(Star) Rogers & Bro.'\n The plaintiff H. E. Heacock Company was established in Manila in 1909 as successor of the firm of Heacock & Frier, which since 1901 had been importing into the Philippine Islands flatware bearing the mark 'Rogers.' The Heacock Company continued this trade and its goods bearing that mark became widely known in the Islands. These wares were manufactured in the United States by the International Silver Company, and, in 1918, the Heacock Company, with the knowledge and consent of the International Silver Company, registered the word 'Rogers' as a trade-mark in the Philippine Bureau of Commerce and Industry. The only competitor of the Heacock Company in this trade is the defendant American Trading Company which began to import its wares into the Philippine Islands in 1925. These are manufactured in the United States by Wm. A. Rogers, Limited, which has its trade-marks, as alleged by it, duly registered in the United States. They were not registered in the Philippine Islands until after the trial of these suits. As to the similarity of the wares and the effect of the use of the word 'Rogers,' the Supreme Court found that 'when Heacock Company first imported such wares into the Philippine Islands it was then a virgin country, and it must be admitted that any business standing or reputation which such wares had up to 1925 were those given to it by the advertising and business methods and dealings of that company. The evidence is conclusive that the wares for which the American Trading Company has been taking and filling orders are very similar in appearance, design, and material to the wares which have been advertised and sold in this country by Heacock Company since 1905. It is true that a dealer in such wares could \n\n[285 U.S. 247, 255]\n\u00a0\n and would see the distinction between them, but even so, in the ordinary course of business, the average public to whom they are sold could not and would not distinguish one from the other.' And further, the Supreme Court said, 'stripped of all non-essentials, it must be conceded that in this line of wares it is the word 'Rogers' which gives the business its intrinsic value.' \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[285 U.S. 247, 256]\n\u00a0\n No ground appears for disturbing these findings of fact. The petitioners contend that, irrespective of the validity of respondent's local registration, the petitioner Wm. A. Rogers, Limited 'was entitled to send its goods marked with its federally registered trade-marks to the Islands and sell them there'; that the respondent's registration in the Islands was invalid upon various grounds; and that both that registration, and the trade-mark registered, in reality belong to the International Silver Company which is equitably estopped from claiming exclusive rights in the word 'Rogers.' Respondent rests upon the Philippine statute and its registration thereunder, and upon general principles of law, insisting that the registration by Wm. A. Rogers, Limited, of its trade-marks in the United States does not constitute a defense against infringement and unfair competition in the local trade in the Islands.\n First. While the Congress, by virtue of the commerce clause, has no power to legislate upon the substantive law of trade-marks,2 it does have complete authority so to legislate, or to provide for such legislation, in the government of the Philippine Islands. \n3\n Under the authority validly conferred by the Congress,4 the Philippine Commission passed the Philippine Act No. 666, of 1903, which made comprehensive provision in relation to trade-marks, trade-names and unfair competition in the Philippine Islands. That act, with amendments, has been continued. It provides for the registration of trade-marks and their protection. The Congress has had authority to amend or repeal this legislation, relating to local trade within the \n\n[285 U.S. 247, 257]\n\u00a0\n Islands, but it has not done so. The Federal Trade-Mark Act of 1905,5 cannot be regarded as intended to displace the Philippine statute so far as the latter applied to local commerce. The Act contains no provision to that effect. It was, however, manifestly intended to apply to valid trade- marks used in commerce between continental United States and the Philippine Islands. This is apparent from section 296 which provides that the word 'States,' as used in the Act 'embraces the District of Columbia, the Territories of the United States, and such other territory as shall be under the jurisdiction and control of the United States.' \n7\n The Tariff Act of 1909,8 relating to the Philippine Islands, provided for jurisdiction in the insular courts in matters arising under the Federal Trade-Mark Act of 1905. And the Philippine statute as to trade-marks, as amended in 1915 ( Act No. 2460) in prohibiting the importation of merchandise with names or marks simulating those of domestic manufacturers or traders registered under the local Act, contained a proviso that 'this section' (section 14) 'shall not be construed to affect rights that any person may have acquired by virtue of having registered a trade-mark under the laws of the United States.' \n9\n\u00a0\n\n Accordingly, we must assume that it was the intention of the Congress in the Federal Trade-Mark Act of 1905 to provide, with respect to trade- marks used in commerce between continental United States and the Philippine Islands, a protection similar to that which was accorded \n\n[285 U.S. 247, 258]\n\u00a0\n by the Act to the use of trade-marks in interstate commerce. As to the latter, the Federal statute did not attempt to create exclusive substantive rights in marks, or to afford a refuge for piracy through registration under the Act, but to provide appropriate procedure and to give the described protection and remedies where property rights existed. The acquisition of such property rights in trade-marks rested upon the laws of the several States. United Drug Company v. Rectanus Company, \n248 \nU.S. 90, 98\n, 39 S. Ct. 48; American Steel Foundries v. Robertson, \n269 \nU.S. 372, 381\n, 46 S. Ct. 160; United States Printing & Lithograph Company v. Griggs, \n279 \nU.S. 156, 158\n, 49 S. Ct. 267. And in view of the object and terms of the statute, and of the assimilation in this respect of commerce with the Philippines to interstate commerce, the same rule of construction must be deemed applicable in both cases. There is no ground for the conclusion that the Congress, in thus according the protection of the Federal statute to valid registered trade-marks used in commerce with the Philippine Islands, intended to override the Philippine statute with respect to the acquisition and protection of rights in marks and names in local trade within the Islands. The Philippine Trade-Mark Act in its proper application to local trade is undoubtedly one of the laws which was continued in force by the Organic Act for the Philippine Islands, enacted in 1916,10 which provided in section 6 'that the laws now in force in the Philippines shall continue in force and effect, except as altered, amended, or modified herein, until altered, amended, or repealed by the legislative authority herein provided or by Act of Congress of the United States.'\n The controversy with respect to the trade in the wares in question is narrowed by the concession of the respondent, in its argument here, that its bill 'did not pray for \n\n[285 U.S. 247, 259]\n\u00a0\n an injunction against importation, but against selling-meaning, of course, local selling within the Philippines.' Respondent states that 'the infringing and unfair acts of petitioners all had to do with local selling after the imported goods had 'mingled with and become a part of the general property of the' Islands.' Referring to the provision of the judgment enjoining petitioners from 'importing and selling in the Philippine Islands,' respondent concedes the 'if the words 'selling in the Philippines' should be construed as comprehensive enough to include selling by Wm. A. Rogers, Ltd. directly to a purchaser in the Philippines,' the judgment might be 'open to criticism,' and respondent submits that these words mean 'local sales.' Insisting that the judgment as thus construed 'in no way interferes with the importation of goods of petitioners or the sale of their goods in original packages,' respondent states that, if the judgment be found ambiguous in this respect, 'it would be enough to reform it to confine its operation to 'selling in local trade in the Philippine Islands.\"\n Second. With respect to the local trade within the Islands, respondent had acquired rights under the Philippine law. Respondent had long been engaged in selling its wares and had a valuable good will. These wares had been known by the name of 'Rogers' for many years. This name had identified the wares and had made the respondent's trade distinctive. In employing this designation there had been no simulation of the names of others in the Islands and there had been no occasion for confusion. For this trade, as the insular court has said, the Islands were 'virgin' territory. The facts, as found, thus demonstrate that in this long continued local trade the word 'Rogers' did not have the significance of a family name but had acquired a secondary meaning in particular relation to the wares in which the respondent \n\n[285 U.S. 247, 260]\n\u00a0\n dealt. \n11\n The insular Supreme Court held that in these circumstances the word 'Rogers' was entitled to registration under the Philippine Trade-Mark Act No. 666. We perceive no ground on which it can be said that legislation permitting such a registration and affording the remedies for which the Act provides was not within the competency of the local legislative authority. Compare, with respect to the provision of section 5 of the Federal Trade Mark Act of 1905 (15 USCA  85), Thaddeus Davids Co. v. Davids, \n233 \nU.S. 461, 468\n, 470 S., 34 S. Ct. 648; G. & C. Merriam Co. v. Syndicate Publishing Co., \n237 \nU.S. 618, 622\n, 35 S. Ct. 708. The fact that the goods thus designated were imported goods does not effect the question of the respondent's right to protection in the local trade it had built up. The fundamental purpose of the Philippine legislation was to protect the continued enjoyment of reputation acquired in such trade and the good will flowing from it. See Hanover Milling Co. v. Metcalf, \n240 \nU.S. 403, 412\n, 413 S., 36 S. Ct. 357. In this aspect it is unnecessary to consider the respective rights of the International Silver Company and Wm. A. Rogers, Limited, in relation to the use of their marks in the States of the Union. These rights have been the subject of numerous judicial decisions. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n[285 U.S. 247, 261]\n\u00a0\n It is sufficient to say that when petitioners entered the trade within the Philippine Islands in 1925, they found a field already occupied and were bound to respect the rights there established. Nor do we find any ground for holding that the respondent is estopped from seeking relief by reason of its relation to the International Silver Company. Respondent manifestly had acquired an interest in the local trade which was entitled to protection, and it has sought and obtained that protection in accordance with the law governing that trade.\n As the questions are those of the interpretation of the local law, and its application to particular facts, this Court, while free to exercise its independent judgment, is not disposed except for cogent reasons to overrule the decision of the insular court. Alzua v. Johnson, \n231 \nU.S. 106, 110\n, 34 S. Ct. 27; Gauzon v. Compania General, \n245 \nU.S. 86, 89\n, 38 S. Ct. 46; Ibanez v. Hongkong Bank Corporation, \n246 \nU.S. 627, 629\n, 38 S. Ct. 413; Philippine Sugar Company v. Government of the Philippine Islands, \n247 \nU.S. 385, 390\n, 38 S. Ct. 513; Yu Cong Eng v. Trinidad, \n271 \nU.S. 500, 523\n, 46 S. Ct. 619. We find no such reasons here.\n The judgment of the Court of First Instance of Manila is modified, in the provision for injunction, by striking out the words 'importing and selling in the Philippine Islands' and substituting therefor the words 'selling in local trade in the Philippine Islands,' and, in the provision for accounting, by striking out the words 'importation and sale in the Philippines' and substituting therefor the words 'sale in local trade in the Philippine \n\n[285 U.S. 247, 262]\n\u00a0\n Islands'; and, with this modification, the judgments of the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands are affirmed.\n It is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Supreme Court in substance confirmed the findings of the Court of First Instance which stated: 'That the silver-plated goods for use in the table and for other purposes manufactured by the International Silver Corporation and imported into the Islands by H. E. Heacock Co. were known generally and in the Islands by their trade-mark 'Rogers' and this trade- mark used in connection with said silver-plated goods have been known by the public as goods sold by H. E. Heacock Co.; that the said silver-plated goods with the trade-mark 'Rogers' were notoriously known in the Philippine Islands due to the extensive propaganda and advertisement made by H. E. Heacock Co. which cost from forty thousand to fifty thousand pesos; that the silver-plated goods for use in the table and for other purposes imported into these Islands by H. E. Heacock Co. and by Wm. A. Rogers Ltd., and the American Trading Co., have the word 'Rogers' with the addition of other words, figures or symbols indicating the different grades or qualities of the goods; that in the local market the word 'Rogers' is the one generally known and sought for by the public which desires to buy silver-plated goods for the table and for other purposes, disregarding and overlooking completely the other words, figures and symbols appearing on the goods; that some of the dealers in silver-plated goods imported by Wm. Rogers, Ltd., and the American Trading Co. only make mention and call attention to the word 'Rogers' appearing thereon, and in almost all cases the public entertained the conviction and the belief, at least, that such silver-plated goods were the same as those which bore the trade-mark 'Rogers' sold by H. E. Heacock Co.; that the American Trading Co., through it and as representative of Wm. A. Rogers Ltd., has succeeded in making a name in the market for the silver-plated goods which it imports and sells in the Philippines, thanks to the word 'Rogers' engraved thereon, and, finally, that H. E. Heacock Co. was informed of the importation of these silver-plated goods bearing the word 'Rogers' by the American Trading Co. about the end of 1927 only.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Trade Mark Cases, \n100 U.S. 82\n; United Drug Co. v.

Burton Mason, of San Francisco, Cal., for respondents.\n\n\n[284 U.S. 370, 381]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case turns upon the power of the Interestate Commerce Commission to award reparations with respect to shipments which moved under rates approved or prescribed by it.\n The respondent carriers maintained a rate of $1.045 per hundred pounds for shipment of sugar from California points to Phoenix, Ariz. On complaint of petitioner and others, the Commission, after hearing, on June 22, 1921, found that the rate attacked had been, then was, and for the future would be, unreasonable to the extent that it exceeded 96.5 cents,1 and ordered the establishment \n\n[284 U.S. 370, 382]\n\u00a0\n of a rate not exceeding that figure. September 17, 1921, the carriers promulgated a rate of 96 cents, which they later voluntarily reduced to 86. 5 cents. November 3, 1922, certain of the complainants in the earlier proceeding, other than petitioner, filed a new petition attacking the current rate. While this case was pending the carriers, on January 10, 1924, again made a voluntary reduction to 84 cents. February 25, 1925, the Commission filed a report prescribing for the future a maximum reasonable rate of 71 cents, to that extent modifying its earlier order. \n2\n Reparation was found to be due shippers under the old rate, but none was awarded. February 8, 1927, the second case was reopened for further consideration, but the 71-cent rate was not disturbed. In a later proceeding, with which petitioner's and other claims for reparation were consolidated, the Commission found that the rates to Phoenix from and after July 1, 1922, had been unreasonable to the extent they had exceeded 73 cents from Northern California and 71 cents from Southern California, prescribed rates for the future from those origins to Phoenix and other Arizona destinations, and awarded petitioner and other shippers reparation in the amounts by which the rates paid (86.5 and 84 cents) exceeded those (73 and 71 cents) found to have been the reasonable rates during the period since July 1, 1922.3\n The date of the first shipment made by petitioner on which reparation was awarded was February 21, 1923, and of the last February 5, 1925, so that all were made between the effective dates of the first and second orders above mentioned.\n The respondents objected that they should not be required to pay reparations on shipments which moved under rates approved or prescribed by the Commission as reasonable. To this that body replied: 'We reserve the right, upon a more comprehensive record, to modify our \n\n[284 U.S. 370, 383]\n\u00a0\n previous findings, upon matters directly in issue before us as to which it clearly appears that our previous findings would not accord substantial justice under the laws which we administer. We have such a case here. For the first time the record before us is comprehensive in the evidence which it contains upon the reasonableness of the rates assailed. Upon this record we reach the conclusion that the rates prescribed in the first Phoenix case, during the period embraced in these complaints, were unreasonable and that a lower rate would have been reasonable during that period. If we are within our authority in finding that a lower rate would have been reasonable, then it must follow that shippers who paid the freight charges at the higher rate paid charges which were unreasonable, and are entitled to reparation. ...'\n The carriers having failed to pay the amount awarded, the petitioner sued therefor in the District Court, and recovered judgment. The Circuit Court reversed, and entered judgment for respondents. \n4\n This Court granted certiorari. Whether, as the petitioner argues, the Commission correctly construed its authority, is to be determined by examination of the legislation defining its powers.\n The exaction of unreasonable rates by a public carrier was forbidden by the common law. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., \n145 \nU.S. 263, 275\n, 12 S. Ct. 844. The public policy which underlay this rule could, however, be vindicated only in an action brought by him who paid the excessive charge to recover damages thus sustained. Rates, fares, and charges were fixed by the carrier, which took its chances that in an action by the shipper these might be adjudged unreasonable and reparation be awarded.\n But we are here specially concerned with the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 5 and with some of the changes of \n\n[284 U.S. 370, 384]\n\u00a0\n supplements adopted since its original enactment. That act did not take from the carriers their power to initiate rates; that is, the power in the first instance to fix rates or to increase or to reduce them. Skinner & Eddy Corporation v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 557, 564\n, 39 S. Ct. 375; Cincinnati, N. O. & T. P. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n162 \nU.S. 184, 197\n, 16 S. Ct. 700. In order to render rates definite and certain, and to prevent discrimination and other abuses, the statute required the filing and publishing of tariffs specifying the rates adopted by the carrier, and made these the legal rates; that is, those which must be charged to all shippers alike. \n6\n Any deviation from the published rate was declared a criminal offense, and also a civil wrong giving rise to an action for damages by the injured shipper. 7 Although the act thus created a legal rate, it did not abrogate, but expressly affirmed, the common-law duty to charge no more than a reasonable rate, and left upon the carrier the burden of conforming its charges to that standard. \n8\n In other words, the legal rate was not made by the statute a lawful rate-it was lawful only if it was reasonable. Under section 6, the shipper was bound to pay the legal rate; but, if he could show that it was unreasonable, he might recover reparation.\n The act altered the common law by lodging in the Commission the power theretofore exercised by courts, of determining the reasonableness of a published rate. \n9\n If the finding on this question was against the carrier, reparation \n\n[284 U.S. 370, 385]\n\u00a0\n was to be awarded the shipper, and only the enforcement of the award was relegated to the courts. In passing upon the issue of fact, the function of the Commission was judicial in character;10 its action affected only the past so far as any remedy of the shipper was concerned, and adjudged for the present merely that the rate was then unreasonable; no authority was granted to prescribe rates to be charged in the future. Indeed, after a finding that an existing rate was unreasonable, the carrier might put into effect a new and slightly different rate and compel the shipper to resort to a new proceeding to have this declared unreasonable. \n11\n Since the carrier had complete liberty of action in making the rate, it necessarily followed that upon a finding of unreasonableness an award of reparation should be measured by the excess paid, subject only to statutory limitations of time.\n Under the act of 1887 the Commission was without power either to prescribe a given rate thereafter to be charged (Interstate Commerce Commission v. Cincinnati, N. O. & T. P. R. Co., \n167 \nU.S. 479\n, 17 S. Ct. 896), or to set a maximum rate for the future (Cincinnati, N. O. & T. P. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, supra, 162 U. S. page 196, 16 S. Ct. 700), for the reason that so to do would be to exercise a legislative function not delegated to that body by the statute. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n The Hepburn Act13 and the Transportation Act14 evince an enlarged and different policy on the part of \n\n[284 U.S. 370, 386]\n\u00a0\n Congress. The first granted the Commission power to fix the maximum reasonable rate; the second extended its authority to the prescription of a named rate, or the maximum or minimum reasonable rate, or the maximum and minimum limits within which the carriers' published rate must come. When under this mandate the Commission declares a specific rate to be the reasonable and lawful rate for the future, it speaks as the Legislature, and its pronouncement has the force of a statute. \n15\n This Court has repeatedly so held with respect to the fixing of specific rates by state commissions,16 and in this respect there is no difference between authority delegated by state legislation and that conferred by congressional action.\n But it is suggested that the mere setting of limits by Commission order leaves th carrier free to name any rate within those limits, and, as at common law, it must at its peril publish a reasonable rate within the bound- \n\n[284 U.S. 370, 387]\n\u00a0\n aries set by the order; that, as it has the initiative, it must take the burden, notwithstanding the Commission's order, of maintaining the rate at a reasonable level, and will be answerable in damages if it fails so to do. This argument overlooks the fact that in declaring a maximum rate the Commission is exercusing a delegated power legislative in character;17 that it may act only within the scope of the delegation; that its authority is to fix a maximum or minimum reasonable rate; for it is precluded by the statute from fixing one which is unreasonable, which by the statute is declared unlawful. If it were avowedly to attempt to set an unreasonably high maximum, its order would be a nullity.\n The report and order of 1921 involved in the present case declared in terms that 96.5 cents was, and for the future would be, a reasonable rate. There can be no question that, when the carriers, pursuant to that finding, published a rate of 96 cents, the legal rate thus established, to which they and the shipper were bound to conform, became by virtue of the Commission's order also a lawful-that is, a reasonable-rate.\n Specific rates prescribed for the future take the place of the legal tariff rates theretofore in force by the voluntary action of the carriers, and themselves become the legal rate. As to such rates, there is therefore no difference between the legal or published tariff rate and the lawful rate. The carrier cannot change a rate so prescribed and take its chances of an adjudication that the substituted rate will be found reasonable. It is bound to conform to the order of the Commission. If that body sets too low a rate, the carrier has no redress save a new hearing and the fixing of a more adequate rate for the future. It cannot have reparation from the shippers for a rate collected under the order upon the ground that it was unreasonably \n\n[284 U.S. 370, 388]\n\u00a0\n low. This is true because the Commission, in naming the rate, speaks in its quasilegislative capacity. The prescription of a maximum rate, or maximum and minimum rates, is a legislative quality as is the fixing of a specified rate.\n In Oklahoma Operating Co. v. Love, \n252 \nU.S. 331, 335\n, 40 S. Ct. 338, 339, it was said: 'The order of the Commission prohibiting the company from charging, without its permission, rates higher than those prevailing in 1913, in effect prescribed maximum rates for the service. It was, therefore, a legislative order. ...'\n If by act of Congress maximum rates were declared lawful for certain classes of service, neither carrier nor shipper could thereafter draw into question in the courts the conduct of the other if it conformed to the legislative mandate, save by an attack on the constitutionality of the statute. By the amendatory legislation, Congress has delegated to the Commission a its administrative arm its undoubted power to declare, within constitutional limits, what are lawful rates for the service to be performed by the carriers. The action of the Commission in fixing such rates for the future is subject to the same tests as to its validity as would be an act of Congress intended to accomplish the same purpose.\n As has been pointed out, the system now administered by the Commission is dual in nature. As respects a rate made by the carrier, its adjudication finds the facts, and may involve a liability to pay reparation. The Commission may, and often does, in the same proceeding, and in a single report and order, exercise its additional authority by fixing rates or rate limits for the future. But the fact that this function is combined with that of passing upon the rates theretofore and then in effect does not alter the character of the action. 18 \n\n[284 U.S. 370, 389]\n\u00a0\n As respects its future conduct, the carrier is entitled to rely upon the declaration as to what will be a lawful, that is, a reasonable, rate; and if the order merely sets limits, it is entitled to protection if it fixes a rate which falls within them. Where, as in this case, the Commission has made an order having a dual aspect, it may not in a subsequent proceeding, acting in its quasi judicial capacity, ignore its own pronouncement promulgated in its quasi legislative capacity and retroactively repeal its own enactment as to the reasonableness of the rate it has prescribed.\n The Commission in its report confuses legal concepts in stating that the doctrine of res judicata does not affect its action in a case like this one. It is unnecessary to determine whether an adjudication with respect to reasonableness of rates theretofore charged is binding in another proceeding, for that question is not here presented. The rule of estoppel by judgment obviously applies only to bodies exercising judicial functions; it is manifestly inapplicable to legislative action. The Commission's error arose from a failure to recognize that, when it prescribed a maximum reasonable rate for the future, it was performing a legislative function, and that, when it was sitting to award reparation, it was sitting for a purpose judicial in its nature. In the second capacity, while not bound by the rule of res judicata, it was bound to recognize the validity of the rule of conduct prescribed by it, and not to repeal its own enactment with retroactive effect. It could repeal the order as it affected future action, and substitute a new rule of conduct as often as occasion might require, but this was obviously the limit of its power, as of that of the Legislature itself.\n The argument is pressed that this conclusion will work serious inconvenience in the administration of the act; will require the Commission constantly to re-examine the fairness of rates prescribed, and will put an unbearable \n\n[284 U.S. 370, 390]\n\u00a0\n burden upon that body. If this is so, it results from the new policy declared by the Congress, which, in effect, vests in the Commission the power to legislate in specific cases as to the future conduct of the carrier. But it is also to be observed that, so long as the act continues in its present form, the great mass of rates will be carrier-made rates, as to which the Commission need take no action except of its own volition or upon complaint, and may in such case award reparation by reason of the charges made to shippers under the theretofore existing rate.\n Where the Commission has upon complaint, and after hearing, declared what is the maximum reasonable rate to be charged by a carrier, it may not at a later time, and upon the same or additional evidence as to the fact situation existing when its previous order was promulgated, by declaring its own finding as to reasonableness erroneous, subject a carrier which conformed thereto to the payment of reparation measured by what the Commission now holds it should have decided in the earlier proceeding to be a reasonable rate.\n The judgment is\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS think that the judgment should be reversed for the reasons stated by Judge Hutcheson in the concurring opinion in Eagle Cotton Oil Co. v. Southern Ry. Co., 51 F.(2d) 443, 445. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 62 I. C. C. 412. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 95 I. C. C. 244. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] 140 I. C.

Culwell, of El Paso, Tex., and E. E. McInnis, of Chicago, Ill., for petitioner.\n Mr. Winbourn Pearce, of Temple, Tex., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n While employed as head brakeman by petitioner railway company and engaged in interstate commerce, J. W. Moore sustained fatal injuries at a New Mexico station. His personal representative obtained a judgment for damages, under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (45 USCA  51-59), in a Texas court.\n The Court of Civil Appeals at El Paso reversed this, holding that the evidence failed to show the accident resulted from the carrier's negligence. The Supreme Court granted a writ of error, reversed the Court of Civil \n\n[284 U.S. 458, 459]\n\u00a0\n Appeals and affirmed the original judgment. It concluded that, viewing all the evidence, there was enough to show negligence and causal connection between this and the death.\n The matter is here by certiorari. The railway sets up a claim under the federal statute which it has not heretofore had opportunity to submit for adjudication to any federal tribunal. The cause is one of a peculiar class where we have frequently been obliged to give special consideration to the facts in order to protect interstate carriers against unwarranted judgments and enforce observance of the Liability Act as here interpreted.\n Examination of the record convinces us that the Court of Civil Appeals reached the proper conclusion. We can find no evidence from which it may be properly concluded that Moore's tragic death was the result of negligence by the railway company. As often pointed out, one who claims under the Federal Act must in some adequate way establish negligence and causal connection between this and the injury. New York Central Railroad Co. v. Ambrose, \n280 \nU.S. 486\n, 50 S. Ct. 198; Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. v. Toops, \n281 \nU.S. 354\n, 50 S. Ct. 281.\n In the language of the Supreme Court, the respondent 'recovered in the trial court on the theory that the deceased, while in the discharge of his duties as a brakeman, was running along by the side of the track of the Railway Company and while doing so with the purpose and intent of boarding one of the cars in the train, he stepped on or upon some soft area or hole in his pathway, and was thereby caused to fall and be run over and killed.'\n Nobody saw the accident; no one can say with fair certainty how it occurred. Consistently with the facts disclosed, it might have happened in one of several ways and without causal negligence by the petitioner. When last seen, the deceased was running westwardly by the side of the train then moving in that direction. Across \n\n[284 U.S. 458, 460]\n\u00a0\n the pathway commonly used by trainmen, there was a slight depression- estimated to be four or five, or possibly six or eight, feet long and three feet wide-filed with small rock screenings. It was softer than other portions of the way-yielded to the foot. Eight or ten feet west of this witnesses found blood upon the rail.\n Two hours after the accident a fourteen year old boy discovered the mark of a shoe in the screenings. He said it 'was deeper then the footprint that I made, it looked as though somebody that was heavy or running had stepped in it. The front part of the foot was deepest.' There is no evidence-nothing but conjecture-to show that the deceased made this impression; and, even if he did, we cannot assume that by stepping there he was made to stumble and fall under the moving train.\n What occasioned this distressing accident can only be surmised. It was necessary to show causal negligence in order to establish the respondent's right to recover. The evidence fails to meet this requirement.\n The judgment below must be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] For conforming opinion in State Court, see 50 S.W.(2d) 1095. \n\n\n\n\n","11":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nATCHISON, T. & S.

The order prescribed maximum rates for the transportation of grain and grain products on domestic shipments within the Western District1 and for export, as described, and directed the carriers to desist from certain practices. 164 I. C. C. 619; 173 I. C. C. 511. Other carriers were permitted to intervene as parties petitioners, and state commissions and certain state organizations were admitted as intervening defendants. This appeal is from the order of the District Court, as specially constituted,2 denying the applications of the petitioners for an interlocutory injunction. 51 F.(2d) 510.\n Following the passage of the Joint Resolution of the Congress of January 30, 1925,3 known as the Hoch-Smith Resolution, the Interstate Commerce Commission insti- \n\n[284 U.S. 248, 255]\n\u00a0\n tuted a general investigation4 of the rate structures of common carriers to determine whether their rates, charges, regulations, and practices were unjust, unreasonable, unjustly discriminatory, or unduly preferential, or otherwise in violation of law. The investigation was divided into separate parts, and the proceeding in one of them (part VII) terminated in the order under review. In connection with this proceeding, there were a large number of formal complaints and suspension proceedings which, considered together, brought into issue all phases of the grain rate structure involved in the Commission's general investigation. Many state commissions, chambers of commerce, and trade and traffic associations participated in the proceeding. Hearings were held in many cities and extended over a year. The record was closed on September 22, 1928, and after protracted argument the matter was submitted, on July 1, 1929, to the Commission for its decision. The first report of the Commission, made on July 1, 1930, emphasized the magnitude of its task, in dealing with 'three score and more of major issues, affecting every part of a vast territorial domain,' and the thorough examination that had been made of the exceptionally voluminous record. The order of July 1, 1930, was to go into effect on October 1, 1930, but because of mechanical difficulties in the preparation and printing of the tariffs, containing the great number of the revised rates, the effective date was postponed from time to time.\n In September, 1930, the carriers asked for a rehearing, which was denied in November, 1930. Prior to its denial, a statement was submitted to the Commission on behalf of the Western Association of Railway Executives, directing attention to the serious financial condition of the carriers. A further petition for rehearing was pre- \n\n[284 U.S. 248, 256]\n\u00a0\n sented to the Commission on February 18, 1931. This petition described in great detail the situation then existing. The carriers alleged that, since the closing of the record before the Commission in September, 1928, there had been material and important changes in the operating, traffic, and transportation conditions in the Western District which affected adversely the revenues of the carriers, and that, regardless of the question of the validity and propriety of the order when made, it would no longer be valid and proper in the light of the existing circumstances. The carriers alleged and offered to prove that, if the order became effective, it would reduce the gross and net operating revenues of the carriers in the Western District not less than $20,000,000 annually; that their aggregate revenues in the first eleven months of 1930 were 14.92 per cent. lower than in the corresponding period of 1929; that the complete figures in respect of the revenues for December, 1930, were not yet available, but that the volume of traffic then carried was substantially less than that of December, 1929; that the revenue freight car loadings in January, 1931, showed a substantial decline (14.06 per cent.) from those of 1930 and an even greater decline (20.98 per cent.) as compared with those of 1929; that the net operating income of these carriers for 1930 was over $100,000,000 less than their average annual net operating income for the five preceding years; that the changes in conditions since the record before the Commission was closed had been such as seriously to impair the credit of the carriers; that not only had the market price of their common and preferred stock declined to such a level that it would be impossible for them to secure additional capital through the sale of stock, but that their bond issues also in many instances securities of these carriers by both savings which they formerly enjoyed; that the decrease of railroad earnings had been such as to jeopardize the eligibility of these bonds for saving bank investments, and that there had been a large decline in the holdings of the secu \n\n[284 U.S. 248, 257]\n\u00a0\n rities of these carriers by both savings banks and life insurance companies; and that, if the order of the Commission should become effective, it would, under the conditions then present, threaten the maintenance of an adequate system of transportation. In support of their allegations as to changed conditions, the petitioners submitted many other facts and statistical tables of traffic and revenues.\n The Commission denied the application for rehearing on March 3, 1931. On April 10, 1931, the Commission made its supplemental report and order, modifying and supplementing in certain particulars its original report and order, and provided that the order as thus modified should become effective on June 1, 1931. Thereupon, these suits were brought.\n The petition in the carriers' suit challenged the order as having been made in disregard of the provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act ( 49 USCA  1 et seq.). The original and supplemental reports of the Commission, and the above-mentioned petitions for rehearing, were annexed to the petition and made a part of it. Reference was made to the statement of the Commission, in its special report of January 21, 1931, to the Senate Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, that the railroads had 'never been able, since 1920, to obtain the aggregate earnings contemplated by section 15a' (of the Interstate Commerce Act), 'and they are faced with continually increasing competition from other forms of transportation.' Reciting earlier orders of the Commission bearing upon rates for the transportation of grain and grain products,5 the carriers averred that the order of \n\n[284 U.S. 248, 258]\n\u00a0\n the Commission was a complete reversal of its previous action; that the Commission had found that the revenue of the carriers for the Western District from the carriage of grain and grain products amounted to 12.1 per cent. of their total revenues in 1924, that year being used in the report as representative, and that the effect of the order in question would be to reduce the general level of rates on this traffic approximately 13 per cent, causing a serious diminution (to the amount of $ 20,000,000 annually) in the gross and net operating income of these carriers. The petition set forth the passage of the Hoch-Smith Resolution and the order of the Commission in relation to the rates on deciduous fruits from California, which had been held by this Court to be invalid because based upon an erroneous construction of the Resolution,6 and the carriers charged that, in making the reports and order here in question, the Commission had proceeded upon a like misconception of its powers. Stating the substance of their petition (February, 1931) for rehearing, the carriers further charged that the denial of that petition, in view of changed conditions, was itself an abuse of administrative discretion, and, by depriving the carriers of the hearing to which they were entitled, constituted a denial of due process in violation of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.\n In their answers, the United States and the Commission denied that the action of the Commission was in any respect unauthorized or unlawful, and, on the contrary alleged that the Commission had carefully considered the evidence before it in the light of its experience, and that the evidence fully supported its order. \n\n[284 U.S. 248, 259]\n\u00a0\n On the application for an interlocutory injunction, the evidence taken before the Commission was not presented to the District Court. Affidavits were submitted by the carriers which were addressed to the effect of the order upon their revenues. The District Court made findings of fact, reciting the findings set forth in the report of the Commission and, in the view that these were conclusive in the absence of the evidence, and that no errors of law had been committed, the application was denied.\n The appellants contest this conclusion, contending that the report of the Commission and concurring opinions of Commissioners disclosed that the Commission had misapprehended its authority under the Hoch-Smith Resolution, and that the Commission had failed to make the findings which were essential to support its decision under the applicable law; that this was shown by the special and extended consideration given by the Commission to the depression of agriculture and the lack of other and proper foundation for the order; that the Commission had not performed its duty to consider and apply the provisions of section 15a of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA  15a), and had exceeded its power by resorting to different standards from those established by sections 1 and 15 of the act ( 49 USCA  1, 15); and that the ultimate finding of the Commission, expressed in the words of the statute, that the existing rates were unreasonable to the extent that they exceeded the rates prescribed, was not in itself sufficient to support the order, as it otherwise appeared to have been erroneously based.\n We do not find it to be necessary to consider these contentions, and the counter arguments advanced on behalf of the Commission, or to review the Commission's reports, as it is sufficient for the present purpose to deal with the fundamental question presented by the action of the Commission in denying the appellants' second application for a rehearing. Ordinarily, a petition for rehearing is for \n\n[284 U.S. 248, 260]\n\u00a0\n the purpose of directing attention to matters said to have been overlooked or mistakenly conceived in the original decision, and thus invites a reconsideration upon the record upon which that decision rested. The second petition for rehearing, in this proceeding, was not of that character. It was of the nature of a supplemental bill. It presented a new situation, a radically different one, which had supervened since the record before the Commission had been closed in September, 1928. It asserted that, whatever might be the view of the order when made, and upon that record, a changed economic condition demanded reopening and reconsideration. The carriers insisted upon this reopening as a right guaranteed to them not only by the Act of Congress buy by the Constitution itself.\n There can be no question as to the change in conditions upon which the new hearing was asked. Of that change we may take judicial notice. It is the outstanding contemporary fact, dominating thought and action throughout the country. As the Interstate Commerce Commission said in its recent report to the Congress,7 'a depression such as the country is now passing through is a new experience to the present generation.' The Commission also recognized in that report 'the very large reductions in railroad earnings which have accompanied the economic depression,' and stated that 'the chief cause of these reductions has been loss of traffic.' For 'in such depressions the railroads suffer severely. Their traffic is a barometer of general business conditions.' \n 8\n\u00a0\n\n It is plain that a record which was closed in September, 1928- relating to rates on a major description of the traffic of the carriers in a vast territory-cannot be regarded as representative of the conditions existing in \n\n[284 U.S. 248, 261]\n\u00a0\n 1931. That record pertains to a different economic era, and furnishes no adequate criterion of present requirements. While the effects of the widespread economic disturbance have had a progressive manifestation, they had been sufficiently revealed in February, 1931, when the second petition for rehearing was made, to compel the conclusion that the record of 1928 afforded no sufficient basis for the order of the Commission. The facts were set forth in the carriers' petition. They pointed out the grave reductions, in traffic and earnings, from which they were suffering, that their net operating income for 1930 was over $100,000,000 less than their average annual net operating income for the five years preceding, and that their credit was seriously impaired. At the time of this petition, the order revising the rates on grain and grain products in the Western District had not yet become effective, but the Commission stood upon the record of 1928, and, without reopening the proceeding or taking further evidence, provided that its order should become effective on June 1, 1931. In justification of this course, it is urged on behalf of the Commission that its determination had been reached after regularly conducted and protracted hearings in which carriers and shippers had co-operated, and that the adjustments related, not only to the level of rates, but to the relation of rates and to discriminatory and wasteful practices, and that a reopening would have meant further lengthy proceedings. It is said that 'in performing its legislative function of prescribing reasonable rates, the Commission necessarily projects into the future the results of a decision based on the conditions disclosed in the record,' and that its determination 'cannot reflect accurately fluctuating conditions.' These suggestions would be appropriate in relation to ordinary applications for rehearing, but are without force when overruling economic forces have made \n\n[284 U.S. 248, 262]\n\u00a0\n the record before the Commission irresponsive to present conditions. This is not the usual case of possible fluctuating conditions but of a changed economic level. And the prospect that a hearing may be long does not justify its denial if it is required by the essential demands of justice.\n We are thus brought to the fundamental considerations governing the authority of the Commission. It has broad powers and a wide extent of administrative discretion, with the exercise of which, upon evidence, and within its statutory limits, the courts do not interfere. The important and salutary functions of the Commission to enforce public rights are not to be denied or impaired. But the Commission, exercising a delegated regulatory authority which does not have the freedom of ownership, operates in a field limited by constitutional rights and legislative requirements. Its duty under sections 1(5), 3(1), and 15(1) of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 USCA  1(5), 3(1), 15(1), with respect to the prescribing of reasonable rates and the preventing of unreasonable or unjustly discriminatory or unduly preferential practices, has not been changed by the Hoch-Smith Resolution. Ann Arbor Railroad Co. v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 658, 669\n, 50 S. Ct. 444. The legal standards governing the action of the Commission in determining the reasonableness of rates are unaltered. In the discharge of its duty, a fair hearing is a fundamental requirement. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Louisville & Nashville Railroad Co., \n227 \nU.S. 88, 91\n, 33 S. Ct. 185. In the instant proceeding, the hearing accorded related to conditions which had been radically changed, and a hearing, suitably requested, which would have permitted the presentation of evidence relating to existing conditions, was denied. We think that this action was not within the permitted range of the Commission's discretion, but was a denial of right. The order of the Commission which was thus made effective, and the ensuing supplemental order, cannot be sustained. \n\n[284 U.S. 248, 263]\n\u00a0\n The order of the District Court refusing an interlocutory injunction is reversed, and the cause is remanded, with direction to grant the injunction as prayed.\n It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Western District was defined in the order of July 1, 1930, as that part of continental United States 'on and west of the Mississippi River, west of Lakes Superior and Michigan, and west of and including Illinois.' \n[\nFootnote 2\n] U.

UNITED STATES(1932)\nNo. 667\nArgued: April 28, 1932Decided: May 23, 1932\n\n\n\n\n[286 U.S. 427, 428]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Dale D. Drain and Alvin L. Newmyer, both of Washington, D. C., for appellants.\n\n\n\n[286 U.S. 427, 430]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John LordO'Brian, Asst. to Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n\n[286 U.S. 427, 431]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit brought by the United States against appellants to enjoin them from continuing, in the District of Columbia, an alleged combination and conspiracy in restraint of trade and commerce in cleaning, dyeing, and otherwise renovating clothes, contrary to section 3 of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, c. 647, 26 Stat. 209, U. S. C. title 15,  3 (15 USCA  3). Appellants answered, setting up affirmatively that they were engaged solely in the performance of labor and rendering service in cleaning, dyeing, and renovating wearing apparel and other articles which had passed into the hands of the ultimate consumers thereof, and that this did not constitute trade or commerce within the meaning of the Anti-Trust Act. Upon motion the answer was stricken from the files, on the ground that the matter pleaded was not a valid defense. Appellants elected to stand upon their answers; and a decree was entered as prayed. The case comes here by appeal under the provisions of the Act of February 11, 1903, c. 544, 32 Stat. 823, U. S. C. title 15,  29 (15 USCA  29); Swift & Co. v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 311, 322\n, 48 S. Ct. 311; United States v. California Co-op. Canneries, \n279 \nU.S. 553, 558\n, 49 S. Ct. 423.\n Upon the facts which stand admitted and those affirmatively pleaded by the answers, the sole question to be determined is whether, within the meaning of section 3 of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, appellants are engaged in trade or commerce in the District of Columbia.\n The facts, established as above, are that they are carrying on the business of cleaning, dyeing, and renovating wearing apparel at plants located in the District, in part, and in some cases principally, at wholesale pursuant to contracts or engagements with numerous so-called retail \n\n[286 U.S. 427, 432]\n\u00a0\n dyers and cleaners who maintain shops in the District for receiving from the public clothing to be cleaned, dyed, or otherwise renovated. Appellants, in Angust, 1928, met together in the District and agreed to raise the then current prices charged for cleaning, dyeing, and renovating clothes, and formulated and agreed upon certain minimum and uniform prices, which they, and each of them, should thereafter charge and receive for the performance of such service. They further agreed to assign and allot to one another the retail dyers and cleaners, who, thereupon, were to be held, respectively, as exclusive customers. The agreement to maintain prices and assign and allot customers has been and is being carried into effect.\n Section 1 and 3 of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act (15 USCA  1, 3) provide as follows:\n'Section 1. Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal . ...'\n\n's 3. Every contract, combination in form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce in any Territory of the United States or of the District of Columbia, or in restraint of trade or commerce between any such Territory and another, or between any such Territory or Territories and any State or States or the District of Columbia, or with foreign nations, or between the District of Columbia and any State or States or foreign nations, is declared illegal. ...'\n\n The words describing the activity declared to be illegal are the same in both sections, namely, 'restraint of trade or commerce.' The contention on behalf of appellants is that the words, being identical, should receive the same construction in section 3 as in the preceding section 1; that section 1 rests solely on the commerce clause of the Constitution; that the words 'trade or commerce' in section 1 cannot be broader than the single word 'commerce' as used in that clause; and that commerce does not include a business such as that carried on by appellants. \n\n[286 U.S. 427, 433]\n\u00a0\n Assuming, but not deciding, that, if the acts here charged had involved interstate transactions, appellants would not come within the provisions of section 1, because the scope of the words 'trade or commerce' must there be limited by the constitutional power to regulate commerce, it does not follow that the same words contained in section 3 should be given a like limited construction. Most words have different shades of meaning, and consequently may be variously construed, not only when they occur in different statutes, but when used more than once in the same statute or even in the same section. Undoubtedly, there is a natural presumption that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning. Courtauld v. Legh, L. R., 4 Exch. 126, 130. But the presumption is not rigid and readily yields whenever there is such variation in the connection in which the words are used as reasonably to warrant the conclusion that they were employed in different parts of the act with different intent. Where the subject-matter to which the words refer is not the same in the several places where they are used, or the conditions are different, or the scope of the legislative power exercised in one case is broader than that exercised in another, the meaning well may vary to meet the purposes of the law, to be arrived at by a consideration of the language in which those purposes are expressed, and of the circumstances under which the language was employed. See State v. Knowles, 90 Md. 646, 654, 45 A. 877, 49 L. R. A. 695; Henry v. Trustees, 48 Ohio St. 671, 676, 30 N. E. 1122; Feder v. Goetz (C. C. A.) 264 F. 619, 624; James et al. v. City of Newberg et al., 101 Or. 616, 619, 201 P. 212; In re County Seat of Linn County, 15 Kan. 500, 527.\n It is not unusual for the same word to be used with different meanings in the same act, and there is no rule of statutory construction which precludes the courts from giving to the word the meaning which the Legislature intended it should have in each instance. Louisville & N. \n\n[286 U.S. 427, 434]\n\u00a0\n R. Co. v. Gaines (C. C.) 3 F. 266, 277, 278. Thus, for example, the meaning of the word 'Legislature,' used several times in the Federal Constitution, differs according to the connection in which it is employed, depending upon the character of the function which that body in each instance is called upon to exercise. Smiley v. Holm, \n285 \nU.S. 355\n, 52 S. Ct. 397, 76 L. Ed. -, decided April 11, 1932. And, again in the Constitution, the power to regulate commerce is conferred by the same words of the commerce clause with respect both to foreign commerce and interstate commerce. Yet the power when exercised in respect of foreign commerce may be broader than when exercised as to interstate commerce. In the regulation of foreign commerce an embargo is admissible; but it reasonably cannot be thought that, in respect of legitimate and unobjectionable articles, an embargo would be admissible as a regulation of interstate commerce, since the primary purpose of the clause in respect of the latter was to secure freedom of commercial intercourse among the states. See Groves et al. v. Slaughter, 15 Pet. 449, 505; Southern Steamship Company v. Portwardens, 6 Wall. 31, 32, 33; Buttfield v. Stranahan, \n192 \nU.S. 470, 492\n, 24 S. Ct. 349. Compare Russell Motor Car Co. v. United States, \n261 \nU.S. 514, 520\n, 521 S., 43 S. Ct. 428.\n Section 1 having been passed under the specific power to regulate commerce, its meaning necessarily must be limited by the scope of that power; and it may be that the words 'trade' and 'commerce' are there to be regarded as synonymous. On the other hand, section 3, so far as it relates exclusively to the District of Columbia, could not have been passed under the power to regulate interstate or foreign commerce, since that provision of the section deals not with such commerce but with restraint of trade purely local in character. The power exercised, and which gives vitality to the provision, is the plenary power to legislate for the District of Columbia, conferred by article 1,  8, cl. 17, of the Constitution. Under that clause, \n\n[286 U.S. 427, 435]\n\u00a0\n Congress possesses, not only every appropriate national power, but, in addition, all the powers of legislation which may be exercised by a state in dealing with its affairs, so long as other provisions of the Constitution are not infringed. Capital Traction Company v. Hof, \n174 \nU.S. 1, 5\n, 19 S. Ct. 580. Undoubtedly, under that extensive power, it was within the competency of Congress to prohibit and penalize the acts with which appellants are here charged; and the only question is whether by section 3 it has done so.\n A consideration of the history of the period immediately preceding and accompanying the passage of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act and of the mischief to be remedied, as well as the general trend of debate in both Houses, sanctions the conclusion that Congress meant to deal comprehensively and effectively with the evils resulting from contracts, combinations, and conspiracies in restraint of trade, and to that end to exercise all the power it possessed. In passing section 1, Congress could exercise only the power conferred by the commerce clause; but, in passing section 3, it had unlimited power, except as restricted by other provisions of the Constitution. We are, therefore, free to interpret section 3 dissociated from section 1 as though it were a separate and independent act, and, thus viewed, there is no rule of statutory construction which prevents our giving to the word 'trade' its full meaning, or the more extended of two meanings, whichever will best manifest the legislative purpose. See United States v. Hartwell, 6 Wall. 385, 396; Sacramento Nav. Co. v. Salz, \n273 \nU.S. 326, 329\n, 330 S., 47 S. Ct. 368.\n We perceive no reason for holding that Congress used the phrase 'restraint of trade' in section 3 in a narrow sense. It is true that the word 'trade' is often employed as importing only traffic in the buying, selling, or exchanging of commodities; but it is also true that frequently, if not generally, the word is used in a broader sense. This is pointed out in The Schooner Nymph, 1 Sumn. 516, 517, 518, 18 Fed. Cas. 506, No. 10,388. Construing section 32 \n\n[286 U.S. 427, 436]\n\u00a0\n of the Coasting and Fishery Act of 1793, c. 8, 1 Stat. 305, 316 (46 USCA  325) which declares that any licensed ship, etc., which shall be employed in any other 'trade' than that for which she is licensed, shall be forfeited, Mr. Justice Story in that case said:\n'The argument for the claimant insists, that 'trade' is here used in its most restrictive sense, and as equivalent to traffic in goods, or buying and selling in commerce or exchange. But I am clearly of opinion, that such is not the true sense of the word, as used in the 32d section. In the first place, the word 'trade' is often, and indeed generally, used in a broader sense, as equivalent to occupation, employment, or business, whether manual or mercantile. Wherever any occupation, employment, or business is carried on for the purpose of profit, or gain, or a livelihood, not in the liberal arts or in the learned professions, it is constantly called a trade. Thus, we constantly speak of the art, mystery, or trade of a housewright, a shipwright, a tailor, a blacksmith, and a shoe-maker, though some of these may be, and sometimes are, carried on without buying or selling goods.'\n\n A like view was taken by Pollock, B., in Bank of India v. Wilson, L. R., 3 Exch. Div. 108, 119-120.1 See, also, \n\n[286 U.S. 427, 437]\n\u00a0\n Buckelew v. Martens (N. J. Err. & App.) 156 A. 436; American Laundry Co. v. E. & W. Dry-Cleaning Co., 199 Ala. 154, 74 So. 58; Campbell v. Motion Picture M. Op. Union, 151 Minn. 220, 231, 232, 186 N. W. 781.\n We think the word 'trade' was used in section 3 of the Sherman Anti- Trust Act in the general sense attributed to it by Justice Story, and, at least, is broad enough to include the acts of which the government complains.\n Decree affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] One of the earliest decisions under the common law is Diers Case, 2 Henry V, 5, pl. 26, which arose in the time of Henry V (1414). There a weaver had bound himself for a moderate consideration not to follow his craft within the town for a limited time. Before the expiration of the time, however, his necessities sent him back to the loom, and an action against him for damages was brought. The learned judge, in deciding the case, not only held the obligation to be void, but quite evidently considered it criminal as well. With some display of feeling he said: 'The obligation is void as being contrary to the common law and by G_____ if the plaintiff were here he should go to prison until he paid a fine to the King.' And even a century or two later, when the rule in respect of contracts in restrain of trade had become less strict, in Mitchell v. Reynolds, 1 Peere Williams 181, 193, Parker, C. J., referring to Diers Case, approved the indignation of the judge, 'tho' not his manner of expressing it.' \n\n\n\n\n","13":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nATLANTIC COAST LINE R. CO. v.

This court granted a writ of certiorari. \n284 \nU.S. 611\n, 52 S. Ct. 129, 76 L. Ed. -. The question is whether there was sufficient \n\n[285 U.S. 143, 144]\n\u00a0\n evidence of negligence on the part of defendant to justify the submission of the case of the jury.\n Plaintiff's intestate was employed by defendant as locomotive engineer of a train running between Augusta, Ga., and Sumter, S. C., in the early morning of May 20, 1921. At a point near Augusta, and about one and three-tenths miles morth of a station called Beech Island, the train was derailed, the engine overturned, and the engineer killed. The accident took place on the line of the Charleston & Western Carolina Railway Company over which defendant, the Atlantic Coast Line, had trackage rights, and the negligence charged was that the employees of the former company working on the roadbed had failed properly to spike and bolt one of the rails, causing it to spread. There were two witnesses for plaintiff. One of these, who lived near Beech Island station, testified that, while driving across the railroad at that station on the afternoon before the accident, he had seen section hands working on the railroad, apparently fixing a rail, at a point between that station and a gravel pit which was not far from the place of the accident. He 'did not pay much attention'; he 'just saw them working.' It was conclusively shown by the evidence that there was a curve on the track a little less than a mile above Beech Island station and that by reason of the contour of the land, with an intervening bluff, it was impossible for one at the crossing at the station to see the place where the wreck occurred or within at least a quarter of a mile of it. The witness knew nothing of the wreck and there was no evidence that the men whom he described had been working at the place of the accident or had any connection with the cause of the derailment. The other witness for the plaintiff had visited the scene shortly after the wreck occurred. He testified that the rail was 'torn up,' that spikes and bolts were 'laying on the cross ties,' that three or four ties were 'taken loose,' \n\n[285 U.S. 143, 145]\n\u00a0\n that there was no doubt the spikes had been 'pulled,' that 'it was not a matter of fixing the track and leaving them out,' that the bolts and angle bars 'had been removed certain,' that there was a dent about the middle of the rail indicating that the rail 'had been pushed in,' and that one end of the rail had been 'pulled in' and 'spiked in from the outside' making the track 'too narrow' so that a train coming from Augusta would be derailed. Thinking that 'it looked like it had been wrecked and there might be some tools,' the witness made a search, and following tracks leading to a gravel pit about fifty of sixty feet away, he found behind some bushes a crowbar used for pulling spikes and a wrench for loosening bolts; that these tools had identification marks showing that they belonged to the Southern Railway Company whose line was five or six miles distant.\n The testimony for defendant gave a more extended description of the conditions at the place of the wreck, confirming the testimony as to the pulling out of the spikes, the removal of the bolts and angle bar, and the displacement of the rail. One of the witnesses, a planter living at Beech Island, testified that, on examining the place of the wreck on the same morning, he found that several spikes had been drawn, that the rail had been 'set in' and 'spiked down on the outside'; that 'the rail was pushed in and then driven down in new place.' Another witness, a passenger on the wrecked train and also an inspector and special investigator for the Interstate Commerce Commission, who had made an immediate examination of the track, testified that, at the point of derailment, one rail was out of place and that the angle bars had been removed from each end of the rail; that 'the bolts and nuts indicated that they had been removed by some one on purpose' and the condition of the bolts showed that they had not been stripped in any way; that there was no indication that the condition of the \n\n[285 U.S. 143, 146]\n\u00a0\n track had caused the rail to spread; that an inspection of the locomotive and cars showed no defect that would contribute in any way to the derailment; that the road apart from the wreck was in 'good condition'; that the ties, rails, and angle bars were those of 'the regular and proper strength'; that the inspection in that territory compared favorably with the inspection of railroads in general; that it appeared that 'the spikes had been pulled directly upward' and that 'had they been crushed out upon the flooring of the rail, it would naturally have made a slanting pull or splintered the tie, but they were pulled out straight.' The testimony of the roadmaster was that he had made a careful inspection of the track in question as late as 5:30 in the afternoon before the accident. The section foreman testified that the track was in good condition, that the section men had not worked at the place of the wreck for several weeks, that during the week of the accident they had not been at work within a mile and a half of that place, and that on the previous day they were working about two miles to the south; that they had no tools branded with the name of the Southern Railway Company. The section foreman of the Southern Railway Company testified that on the morning of the accident he had missed a 'claw bar and a wrench' which he had put in the toolhouse the evening before and that he found that the toolhouse had been broken into. There was evidence that these were the tools found near the wreck. Several trains passed over the track in question between the afternoon before and the time of the wreck and the engineers testified that they observed nothing unusual. Two trains passed on the way to Augusta only about one hour and a half before the accident; the point is made that there was testimony that the position and condition of the rail were such that this might be possible despite the displacement of the rail, although a train running in the \n\n[285 U.S. 143, 147]\n\u00a0\n opposite direction (like the one in question), after the rail had worked out of alignment, would be derailed. But the argument with respect to the time when the displacement might have been effected, which in any event could not have been very long before the accident, and the contention based on the position of the nuts and bolts, are unavailing in view of the lack of evidence tending to show that the defendant was in any way responsible for the condition which caused the derailment.\n There are many details which it is unnecessary to review as they do not affect the essential question. It is sufficient to say that upon a careful examination of the entire record we are unable to discover any basis for a finding of negligence on the part of defendant. The motion for the direction of a verdict in its favor should have been granted. Atlantic Coast Line R. R. Co. v. Davis, \n279 \nU.S. 34\n, 49 S. Ct. 210; Gunning v. Cooley, \n281 \nU.S. 90\n, 50 S.

C., for appellee Piedmont and Northern Ry. Co.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit, under the Act of October 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 220 (28 USCA  47) was brought in the federal court for Western South Carolina, to set aside an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission dated June 9, 1930. Restriction \n\n[284 U.S. 288, 290]\n\u00a0\n in Routing in Connection with the Georgia & Florida Railroad, 165 I. C. C. 3. The plaintiffs are the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, the Louisville & Nashville Railroad, and the Charleston & Western Railroad. The defendants are the United States, and, by intervention, the Commission, the Piedmont & Northern Railway, and the Georgia & Florida Railroad. The order assailed was entered under section 15(7) of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 USCA  15(7). It requires the cancellation of provisions in tariff schedules by which the plaintiffs seek to exclude the Georgia & Florida from participating as connecting carrier in through routes established over the Carolina, Clinchfield & Ohio Railway. The Commission held that the restrictive schedules violated the conditions under which that railroad had been leased to the Atlantic Coast Line and the Louisville & Nashville. Clinchfield Railway Lease, 90 I. C. C. 113. The District Court, three judges sitting, sustained the validity of the order and dismissed the bill. 48 F.(2d) 239. The case is here on direct appeal. We are of opinion that the decree should be affirmed.\n The Clinchfield Railway extends in a southerly direction from Elkhorn City, Ky., to Spartanburg, S. C., a distance of 276.85 miles. The Atlantic Coast Line system lies to the east and south. To the west and south lies the Louisville & Nashville, of whose stock 51 per cent, is owned by the Coast Line. The Clinchfield is a link in many possible routes between points in the Southeastern States and the North, in addition to those routes which are over the Atlantic Coast Line or the Louisville & Nashville. At Elkhorn City, the Clinchfield connects with the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway, whose system extends east, north, and west. At Spartanburg, the Clinchfield connects with the Piedmont & Northern, which extends in a southerly direction to Greenwood, S. C. And, at Greenwood, the Piedmont & Northern connects with a recently built extension of the Georgia & \n\n[284 U.S. 288, 291]\n\u00a0\n Florida, which now has 464 miles of line in the three Southeastern States. The restrictive schedules excluded from the joint rates traffic over the Clinchfield if routed via the Georgia & Florida. Such traffic was thereby subjected to the applicable combination of higher local rates. The effect of this was to prevent not only the Georgia & Florida, but also the Piedmont & Northern, the intermediate carrier, from participating in such business, with the result that the traffic would be secured for the Charleston & Western, which the Atlantic Coast Line controls through stock ownership.\n In 1923 the Atlantic Coast Line and the Louisville & Nashville applied to the Commission for leave jointly to lease the Clinchfield. The extension of the Georgia & Florida to Greenwood was then in contemplation. The Piedmont & Northern and the Georgia & Florida opposed authorization of an unconditional lease, on the ground that, if joint rates on traffic moving over the Clinchfield should be closed to them, they would be deprived of much traffic which might otherwise move over their lines or future extensions thereof. In order to preserve, among other things, the existing and possible though routes via the Clinchfield on railroads other than the Atlantic Coast Line and the Louisville & Nashville, the Commission, in authorizing the lease, made it subject to five conditions which the lessees accepted. \n1\n Condition 1 requires the maintenance of a separate organization for the Clinchfield so that the road 'shall con- \n\n[284 U.S. 288, 292]\n\u00a0\n stitute a separate operating unit.' Condition 3 requires the continuance of existing routes and channels of trade, existing gateways for the interchange of traffic, and 'the present neutrality of handling the traffic inbound and outbound' so as to permit equal service, routing, and movement of competitive traffic to and from all connecting lines reached by the Clinchfield. \n2\n Condition 4 requires the lessees to permit carriers then connecting with the line of the Clinchfield, or which may thereafter connect with it, to participate, without discrimination, in through routes and joint rates on traffic moving over the Clinchfield as an intermediate road between points at and beyond the Ohio river, on the one hand, and points in Southeastern and Carolina territory, on the other; and that to this end the Clinchfield shall be maintained as an open route for traffic available to all carriers connecting with it. \n3\n The order of June 9, 1930, here \n\n[284 U.S. 288, 293]\n\u00a0\n assailed, canceled the restrictive schedules on the ground that they violated conditions 3 and 4. The plaintiffs deny that the restrictive schedules are inconsistent with conditions 3 and 4, and claim that, if the schedules are inconsistent with the conditions, it is the conditions which are void.\n First. The plaintiffs contend that the restrictive schedules are consistent with the conditions because the Georgia & Florida is not a carrier 'connecting with the Clinchfield.' The argument is that the Georgia & Florida does not connect, since its own rails do not physically abut on the Clinchfield's rails; the connection being made over the Piedmont & Northern, an intermediate carrier. There is no warrant for limiting the meaning of 'connecting lines' to those having a direct physical connection with the Clinchfield. The term is commonly used as referring to all the lines making up a through route. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n Second. The plaintiffs contend that the restrictive schedules are consistent with the conditions, because these assure equality of treatment only to connections existing at the time the order was entered authorizing the \n\n[284 U.S. 288, 294]\n\u00a0\n lease, and the Greenwood extension by means of which the Georgia & Florida connects with the Piedmont & Northern, was not built until several years thereafter. But the open route guaranteed by the conditions is not so limited. Condition 4 prescribes that the lessees 'shall permit the line of the Clinchfield and its subsidiaries to be used as a link for through traffic, ... equally available to such other carriers, now connecting, or which may hereafter connect, with the line of the Clinchfield and its subsidiaries, as may desire to participate in through routes and joint rates between points in territory north and west of the line of the Clinchfield and points at and beyond the Ohio River, on the one hand, and points in the Southeastern and Carolina territory, on the other.'\n Third. The plaintiffs contend that, as construed, conditions 3 and 4 conflict with the provisions of section 15(4) of the act which prohibits the Commission from requiring a carrier to establish 'without its consent' any through route which does not embrace substantially the entire length of its line (including lines of controlled carriers) between the termini of the proposed route. \n5\n The argument is that the order short-hauls traffic which would otherwise pass over the Charleston & Western, and that this road is a part of the Atlantic Coast Line System. The Commission's order of June 3, 1924, which prescribed \n\n[284 U.S. 288, 295]\n\u00a0\n the conditions, did not require the lessees to abandon any protection given by section 15(4) in respect to their then existing lines. It was not an order establishing a through route within the meaning of section 15(3). In respect to the Clinchfield, which the carriers sought to acquire, the Commission gave them the option of either consenting to certain through routing over that road or abandoning their plan to lease the road. In effect, the Commission found that without such a condition the proposed lease was not in the public interest. With that condition it was. Compare Chicago Junction Case, \n264 \nU.S. 258, 265\n, 44 S. Ct. 317. It was within the powers of the Commission to make such a condition. \n6\n Obviously the condition was not arbitrary. The provision was requested by the carriers interested; and it was required in order that competition, which the Commission deemed to be in the public interest, be preserved. Compare Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co. v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 35, 42\n, 51 S. Ct. 337. The limitation imposed by section 15(4) of the act upon the Commission's power under section 15(3) to establish through routes is designed to protect the existing long-haul routes of carriers. Compare United States v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., \n278 \nU.S. 269, 277\n, 49 S. Ct. 133. It applies only when the Commission is exercising the power conferred by that paragraph. It is not a limitation upon the power of the Commission to approve new combinations of carriers.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The order of the Commission, entered June 3, 1924, provided: 'That the making of said lease and exercise of any of the rights conferred by this order shall in all future proceedings, judicial as well as administrative, to which the carriers above named or any of them may be parties, be deemed and taken as conclusive evidence of their acceptance of, and agreement to abide by, the conditions enumerated in said report. ...'

So far as lies within the power of the applicants, existing routes and channels of trade and commerce heretofore established by other carriers in connection with the Clinchfield shall be preserved, existing gateways for the interchange of traffic with such other carriers shall be maintained, and the present neutrality of handling traffic inbound and outbound by the Carolina, Clinchfield & Ohio Railway and its subsidiary, the Carolina, Clinchfield & Ohio Railway of South Carolina, shall be continued so as to permit equal opportunity for service and routing or movement of traffic which is competitive with traffic of the applicants, or either of them, to and from all connecting lines reached by the line of the Clinchfield companies, without discrimination in service against such competitive traffic.' \n[\nFootnote 3\n] '4.

McDermott, of Philadelphia, Pa., pro hac vice, by special leave of court (Messrs. Thomas D. McBride and William Charles Brown, both of Philadelphia, Pa., on the brief), for petitioner.\n Mr. Howard H. Yocum, of Philadelphia, Pa., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner brought this action in the court of common pleas of Philadelphia county, Pa., to recover damages for an injury sustained by her as a member of the crew of a steamship operated by respondent. The action was brought under the Jones Act, section 33 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, U.C.C., title 46,  688 (46 USCA  688), which provides: 'Jurisdiction1 in such actions shall be under the court of the district in which the defendant employer resides or in which his principal office is located.' Respondent, contending that the court in which the action was brought was not of the proper district, since respondent's principal office was in Baltimore, Md., moved to dismiss the action for want of jurisdiction. The motion \n\n[287 U.S. 278, 280]\n\u00a0\n was sustained, and the action accordingly dismissed. The judgment of dismissal was affirmed by the state Supreme Court. 306 Pa. 204, 159 A. 19.\n The question presented for our determination is whether the quoted provision in respect of jurisdiction applies to the state courts, or is limited to the federal courts. The decisions are conflicting, but we think the correct construction of the provision limits it to the courts of the United States. The word 'district' is peculiarly apposite in that relation; but, in order to apply it to a state court, whose territory for venue purposes may or may not be designated as a 'district,' an elasticity of interpretation would be required which it does not seem probable Congress had in mind. Thus in one instance, where an action had been brought in a state court, it was found necessary, in order to hold the provision applicable, to interpret the word 'district' as meaning 'county' in which the defendant resides or has his principal office. Wienbroer v. United States Shipping Board E.F. Corp. (D.C.) 299 F. 972. The contrary view limiting the provision to the federal courts, which we approve, is expressed in Lynott v. Great Lakes Transit Corporation, 202 App.Div. 613, 619, 195 N.Y.S. 13, affirmed without opinion, 234 N.Y. 626, 138 N.E. 473; Patrone v. M. P. Howlett, 237 N.Y. 394, 397, 143 N.E. 232; Rodrigues v. Transmarine Corporation, 216 App.Div. 337, 339, 215 N.Y.S. 123, and State ex rel. Sullivan v. Tazwell, 123 Or. 326, 330, 262 P. 220. Compare Panama R. Co. v.

If the question were more doubtful than we think it is, we should be slow to impute to Congress an intention, if it has the power,2 to interfere with the statutory provisions of the \n\n[287 U.S. 278, 281]\n\u00a0\n various states fixing the venue of their own courts. It follows that the venue should have been determined by the trial court in accordance with the law of the state.\n Another question has been raised which, however, affects only the proceedings in this court. The clerk was requested by counsel for petitioner to docket the case here under chapter 113, 40 Stat. 683, U.S.C., title 28,  837 (28 USCA  837) which provides:\n'Courts of the United States, including appellate courts, hereafter shall be open to seamen, without furnishing bonds or prepayment of or making deposit to secure fees or costs, for the purpose of entering and prosecuting suit or suits in their own name and for their own benefit for wages or salvage and to enforce laws made for their health and safety.'\n\n The clerk, being in doubt, required a deposit to secure his fees and costs, and accordingly this was made by counsel for petitioner.\n In Re Abdu, \n247 \nU.S. 27\n, 38 S.Ct. 447, it was held that the corresponding provision then in force (chapter 27, 40 Stat. 157) did not apply to appellate proceedings; but the words which now appear, 'including appellate courts,' were not in the provision as it then read. That case, therefore, is not in point. With these words added, the provision now applies to appellate proceedings.\n A more serious question is whether suits under the Jones Act (41 Stat. 988) may be regarded as suits by seamen 'for wages or salvage' or 'to enforce laws made for their health and safety.' Such a suit is not for wages or salvage. Is it to enforce a law made for the health or safety of seamen? In The Bennington (D.C.) 10 F.(2d) 799, the question was an- \n\n[287 U.S. 278, 282]\n\u00a0\n swered in the negative. In Grant v. United States Shipping Board Emergency F. Corp. (C.C.A.) 24 F.(2d) 812, it was answered in the affirmative. The court in the latter case rejected the construction put upon the provision by the decision in The Bennington as too narrow and not in accord with the liberality Congress intended toward seamen, holding that the Jones Act, being an addition to the Seamen's Act, was intended to be consistent with the spirit of that legislation, which was directed to promote the welfare of American seamen. We agree with that view. The Jones Act is an amendment to section 20 of the Seamen's Act (46 USCA  688). The Jones Act has the effect of bringing into the maritime law, for the benefit of seamen, all appropriate statutes relating to employers' liability for the personal injury or death of railway employees. Both acts are to be treated as part of the maritime law. Panama R. Co. v. Johnson, \n264 \nU.S. 375, 389\n, 44 S.Ct. 391. Seamen have always been regarded as wards of the admiralty, and their rights, wrongs, and injuries a special subject of the admiralty jurisdiction. Benedict's Admiralty (4th Ed.)  182, 603. The policy of Congress, as evidenced by its legislation, has been to deal with them as a favored class. Robertson v. Baldwin, \n165 \nU.S. 275, 287\n, 17 S.Ct. 326. In the light of and to effectuate that policy, statutes enacted for their benefit should be liberally construed. The Seamen's Act, which includes the Jones Act by amendment, is entitled in part 'An Act To promote the welfare of American seamen ... and to promote safety at sea.' Chapter 153, 38 Stat. 1164. It requires little if any aid from the doctrine of liberal construction to enable us to say that the present suit is one to enforce a law made for the safety of seamen. Petitioner will not be required to prepay or make deposit to secure fees or costs, and the clerk will be directed to refund the deposit already made.\n The judgment below is reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Judgment reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Meaning venue.

Ed. -, to review a judgment of the Supreme Court of Missouri, 43 S.W.( 2d) 782, sustaining a recovery by respondent in the circuit court of the city of St. Louis, under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (45 USCA  51-59). Respondent, who was employed by petitioner in interstate commerce as a flagman or rear brakeman on a freight train proceeding over its line from Illinois to Indiana, was injured by a fall when attempting to alight in the nighttime from a caboose, which was standing on a bridge or trestle, so narrow as to afford no foothold to one getting off the train at that point. The State Supreme Court held that the trial court rightly overruled petitioner's demurrer to the evidence and correctly submitted to the jury the question of the petitioner's negligence, by its agents and servants, in ordering or permitting the plaintiff to alight from the caboose where it was dangerous to do so.\n Respondent, an experienced railway brakeman, had been in the employ of the petitioner in that capacity for about nine years. For a number of years his regular run had been over petitioner's line where he was injured. The testimony was sharply conflicting, but the jury, if it believed the testimony most favorable to the respondent, could have found the following facts. The respondent was one of a crew of five men on a train consisting of engine, tender, forty-two cars and caboose, proceeding easterly in the direction of Xenia, Ill. He was serving as rear brakeman and rode in the caboose with the conductor. The train was under orders, known to the crew, including the respondent, to enter a passing track at Xenia and wait there until it was passed by another train \n\n[286 U.S. 272, 274]\n\u00a0\n going west. About three miles west of Xenia, respondent and the conductor observed a blazing hot box on one of the cars; the train was stopped on the main line, and both went forward to examine the hot box. The conductor then sent respondent to the engine to get a bucket of water to put out the fire, instructing him to say to the engineer that at the next stop, at Xenia, they would finish any necessary work on the box. Respondent communicated this message to the engineer; the fire was extinguished and the train proceeded on its way until it halted at Xenia. The stop there was made for the purpose of opening the switch, so that the train could enter the passing track, with the engine from one and one-half to three car lengths from the switch, and the caboose, at the rear end of the train, standing on the trestle. The respondent testified that he and the conductor were in the cupola of the caboose when it stopped and that the conductor then said: 'Get out and go ahead and fix the hot box'; that he knew at the time that the train was not on the passing track; that he immediately took his lantern, walked down the caboose steps, from which he stepped into space and fell into the ravine which was spanned by the trestle.\n The state Supreme Court held that, under the instructions given by the trial court, the jury, in order to return a verdict for respondent, was required to find that the petitioner was negligent both in stopping the caboose on the trestle and in directing or permitting the respondent to alight there. It held, rightly, that there was no evidence that the petitioner was negligent in stopping the train where it did, but, as it concluded that petitioner negligently directed or permitted respondent to alight at that point, it upheld the verdict as necessarily involving a finding of such negligence on the part of the conductor.\n There was no evidence that either the conductor or respondent knew that the caboose had stopped on the trestle, and, as they were together in the cupola of the caboose \n\n[286 U.S. 272, 275]\n\u00a0\n when the train stopped, their opportunity for knowledge, as each knew, was the same. Hence, there is no room for inference that the conductor was under a duty to warn of danger known to him and not to the respondent, or that respondent relied or had reason to rely on the conductor to give such warning. Nor was the request to alight a command to do so regardless of any danger reasonably discoverable by respondent. The conductor did not ask respondent to alight from the caboose rather than from one of the forward cars standing clear of the trestle, where it was safe, or to omit the precautions which a reasonable man would take to ascertain, by inspection, whether he could safely alight at the point chosen. There was no evidence that the respondent could not have discovered the danger by use of his lantern or by other reasonable precautions, or that he in fact made any effort to ascertain whether the place was one where he could safely alight.\n The state Supreme Court thought that it was the duty of the conductor to ascertain, by inspection, whether respondent could alight with safety, and to give warning of the danger if he could not. But there was no evidence of any rule or practice, nor do we know of any from which such a duty could be inferred. The conductor could have no knowledge of such danger, nor was he in a position to gain knowledge, superior to that of other trainmen, whose duty it was to use reasonable care to ascertain, each for himself, whether, in doing his work, he was exposing himself to peril. A duty which would require the conductor, whenever the train was stopped and trainmen were required to alight, to inspect the place and warn of danger where each might get off the train, would be impossible of performance.\n There was no breach of duty on the part of the conductor in asking the respondent, in the performance of his duty, to alight or in failing to inspect the place where \n\n[286 U.S. 272, 276]\n\u00a0\n he alighted or to warn him of the danger. If negligence caused the injury, it was exclusively that of the respondent. Proof of negligence by the railroad was prerequisite to recovery under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (45 USCA  51-59).\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","17":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBALTIMORE & PHILADELPHIA STEAMBOAT CO. v. NORTON(1932)\nNo. 185\nArgued: December 11, 1931Decided: January 11, 1932\n\n\n\n\n[284 U.S. 408, 409]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Edwin A. Swingle, of Washington, D. C., and Ira A. Campbell and Vernon S. Jones, both of New York City, for petitioners.\n The Attorney General, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit in equity brought by petitioners in the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to set aside as not in accordance with law an order of the deputy commissioner awarding compensation to Gube under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Act of March 4, 1927, 44 Stat. 1424, 1427, 33 U. S. C.  901 et seq. (33 USCA  901 et seq.). The District Court dismissed the cause, 40 F.(2d) 530, and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, 48 F.(2d) 57.\n February 17, 1928, Gube, while engaged in work for the steamboat company as a longshoreman upon a vessel in the navigable waters of the United States, suffered an injury to his left arm. He filed with the deputy commissioner a claim against the employer and insurer for compensation in accordance with the act. The deputy commissioner found that claimant's average weekly wage amounted to $36.06; that as a result of the injury he suffered total disability for 34 weeks following and permanent partial impairment, amounting to 40 per cent. of the use of his arm and awarded compensation at the weekly rate of $24.04 for 146 weeks, amounting in all to $3,509.84. \n\n[284 U.S. 408, 410]\n\u00a0\n Petitioners maintain that the award should be the full rate for 40 per cent. of 314, being 125.6 weeks, and that the amount allowed below is excessive by 20.4 weeks or $490.42. We are called on to determine, on the basis of the facts found, what amount the act requires the employer to pay claimant. No other question is presented.\n The pertinent provisions follow:\n'Sec. 8. Compensation for disability shall be paid to the employee as follows:\n\n'(a) In case of total disability adjudged to be permanent 66 2\/3 per centum of the average weekly wages shall be paid to the employee during the continuance of such total disability. ...\n\n'(b) In case of disability total in character but temporary in quality 66 2\/3 per centum of the average weekly wages shall be paid to the employee during the continuance thereof.\n\n'(c) In case of disability partial in character but permanent in quality the compensation shall be 66 2\/3 per centum of the average weekly wages, and shall be paid to the employee as follows:\n\n'(1) Arm lost, three hundred and twelve weeks' compensation. ...\n\n'(18) Compensation for permanent total loss of use of a member shall be the same as for loss of the member.\n\n'(19) Compensation for permanent partial loss or loss of use of a member may be for proportionate loss or loss of use of the member . ...\n\n'(22) In case of temporary total disability and permanent partial disability, both resulting from the same injury, if the temporary total disability continues for a longer period than the number of weeks set forth in the following schedule, the period of temporary total disability in excess of such number of weeks shall be added to the compensation period provided in subdivision (c) of this section: Arm, thirty-two weeks; ...\n\n\n\n[284 U.S. 408, 411]\n\u00a0\n 'In any case resulting in loss or partial loss of use of arm ... where the temporary total disability does not extend beyond the periods above mentioned for such injury, compensation shall be limited to the schedule contained in subdivision (c). ...' (33 USCA  908.)\n The award is based on a construction of the section in substance as follows: Subdivision (b) allows compensation for temporary total disability during its continuance at the rate of two-thirds of the average weekly wage. Subdivision (c) allows for permanent partial loss of use of an arm compensation for 314 weeks at a rate that is the same proportion of two-thirds of the weekly wage as such partial disability is of the total use. (1), (18), (19), (22). Temporary total disability and permanent partial disability resulted from the same injury. The former continued 34 weeks, being two weeks in excess of the healing period allowed by c (22). The computation was: $36.06X2\/3=$24.04X34=$817.36 for temporary total disability of claimant. 312+2=314-34=280X$24.04X. \n40\n =$2,692.48 for permanent partial disability of his arm.\n The allowance for temporary total disability was for its duration, 34 weeks. That is not authorized. The period of allowance is definitely limited to 32 weeks, and the statute expressly authorizes enlargement of the specified compensation period, 312 weeks, by the excess of actual temporary total disability over the time limited for healing, and so here the added two weeks take the proportionate rate. (c)(1)(22).\n The deputy commissioner did not apply the proportionate rate, $9.616, to the 280 weeks remaining, but added to the 34 weeks 40 per cent. of 280 ( being 112) and applied the full rate for 146 weeks. The total of the payments is the same in either case. The computation employed shortens the statutory period and correspondingly increases the weekly payments. Petitioners raise no question as to that feature of the award, and therefore \n\n[284 U.S. 408, 412]\n\u00a0\n we need not consider whether it is consonant with the act.\n In support of their computation, petitioners call attention to the second paragraph of (c)(22), that in any case resulting in the loss or partial loss of the use of an arm, or other specified member, where the temporary total disability does not extend beyond the periods for which payments are required, compensation shall be limited to the schedule, (1) to (13), contained in subdivision (c). And they contend that if claimant had not been totally disabled for more than 32 weeks he would not have been entitled to any allowance at the full rate on account of the temporary total disability but only to the proportionate rate for the entire period, or, according to the method of computation adopted, the full rate for the proportionate number of weeks. And they argue that it is inconsistent to hold that, merely because total disability continued two weeks in excess of the prescribed healing period, claimant was entitled to an allowance at the full rate for the period of total disability.\n Petitioners' construction would produce inconguous results in many cases. Indeed, a decision cited by them, Texas Employers' Ins. Ass'n v. Sheppeard (D. C.) 32 F.(2d) 300, concretely illustrates such a result. On that basis, whenever the temporary total disability of an arm continued during the full time allowed for healing and the subsequent permanent partial loss of its use was not more than 10 per cent., the injured employee would receive less than if he had suffered only the temporary total disability. Thus petitioners' construction would deny any allowance for the permanent injury. If in this case claimant's permanent partial loss of use of his arm had not been more than 10 per cent., petitioners' calculation would give him compensation for only 31.4 weeks, whereas without any permanent disability he would be paid for 32 weeks. Similar inconsistencies would arise where an injury of any \n\n[284 U.S. 408, 413]\n\u00a0\n member listed in the schedule contained in subdivision (c) resulted in temporary total disability followed by relatively small permanent partial loss of its use. It may not reasonably be assumed that Congress intended to require payment of more compensation for a lesser disability than for a greater one including the lesser. Nothing less than compelling language would justify such a construction of the act.\n Petitioners also cite Marhoffer v. Marhoffer, 220 N. Y. 543, 116 N. E. 379, reversing 175 App. Div. 52, 161 N. Y. S. 527. That case arose under the state workmen's compensation law. Claimant suffered an injury to his hand including lacerations of his thumb and index and loss of the middle finger. The statute limited the temporary total to 12 and the permanent partial disability allowance to 30 weeks. It required the payment of the full rate of two-thirds of the weekly wage on account of the total disability and the same rate during the compensation period established for the loss of a finger. The commission found total disability continued 10 weeks and, as the statute provided, excluded the first two and allowed the full rate for 8 weeks; it also allowed the full rate for the permanent partial disability for 30 weeks, to commence at the expiration of the 8 weeks' period, and so the full rate was allowed for 38 weeks. The appellate division sustained the award but that judgment was reversed. The Court of Appeals held it error to make consecutive allowances, first for the temporary total disability and second on account of the loss of the finger for the full period, and directed that the claim for the first be dismissed. Obviously the loss of the finger together with the other lacerations caused temporary total disability. That period was attributable to the injury as a whole and not exclusively to the lacerations. And while the total disability continued it necessarily included the impairment of use that was permanently to remain. That case is not \n\n[284 U.S. 408, 414]\n\u00a0\n in point. There the controversy concerned the period for which payments were required to be made. Here the question is not whether the healing period shall be added to that allowed on account of partial permanent disability, but it is whether the full rate shall be allowed for the period of total disability up to the specified limit of 32 weeks.\n The measure before us, like recent similar legislation in many states, requires employers to make payments for the relief of employees and their dependents who sustain loss as a result of personal injuries and deaths occurring in the course of their work whether with or without fault attributable to employers. Such laws operate to relieve persons suffering such misfortunes of a part of the burden and to distribute it to the industries and mediately to those served by them. They are deemed to be in the public interest and should be construed liberally in furtherance of the purpose for which they were enacted and, if possible, so as to avoid incongruous or harsh results. Jamison v. Encarnacion, \n281 \nU.S. 635, 640\n, 50 S. Ct. 440\n\n\n Section 8 establishes the rule that the full rate shall apply during continuance of total disability whether permanent or temporary, (a) and (b ), and during the specified compensation period for partial permanent disability due to loss of a listed member, (c)(1) to (13), inclusive, and it specifically provides: 'Compensation for permanent partial loss or loss of use of a member may be for proportionate loss or loss of use of the member.' The provisions of (c)(22) have no bearing on the question whether the full rate or a proportionate one shall be allowed. They relate to the periods during which payments are to be made when temporary total disability and permanent partial disability result from the same injury and establish the rule that, if temporary total disability continues for more than the prescribed healing period, the excess shall be added to the total compensation period \n\n[284 U.S. 408, 415]\n\u00a0\n specified in the schedule in subdivision (c), and that if actual duration of the temporary total disability does not exceed such healing time then the applicable period specified in such schedule shall not be increased.\n It is clear, when the related parts of section 8 are considered together, that Congress intended to distinguish between temporary total disability (b), permanent partial disability due to the total loss of the use of a member (c) (1), and permanent partial disability due to the partial loss of such use (c) (18)(19), and that its purpose was to require payments on account of the loss of earning capacity resulting from each. The language of (22) on which petitioners rely, when taken in context and construed in harmony with the purpose of the act, means that the full rate shall be allowed for the duration of the healing time and that the proportionate rate shall apply to the balance of the established compensation period.\n The decree will be modified so as to allow the full rate of $24.04 for only 32 weeks and proportionate compensation of 40 per cent. for 282 weeks.\n Modified, and affirmed as modified. \n\n\n\n","18":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBANKERS' POCAHONTAS COAL CO. v. BURNET(1932)\nNo. 104\nArgued: November 18, 1932Decided: December 5, 1932\n\n\n\n\n[287 U.S. 308, 309]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Camden R. McAtee, of Washington, D.C., and Wells Goodykoontz, of Williamson, W. Va., for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. G. A. Youngquist, Asst. Atty. Gen., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner, in 1912, acquired West Virginia coal lands in fee, and, by assignment from the prior owners, certain leases or contracts entered into by them with various coal \n\n[287 U.S. 308, 310]\n\u00a0\n operators, by which the latter acquired the right to enter upon and use the lands for the production of coal and coke for a specified period, in consideration of stipulated royalties for the coal and coke produced, including minimum royalty payments in each year. In determining petitioner's income and profits taxes for the years 1920 to 1926, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue treated the royalty payments, after deducting a depletion allowance of 3.6 cents per ton of coal mined, as taxable income of petitioner, and assessed a corresponding increase in the tax. On appeal, this ruling of the Commissioner was sustained, both by the Board of Tax Appeals, 18 B.T.A. 901, and the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, 55 F.(2d) 626. We granted certiorari, \n287 \nU.S. 584\n, 53 S. Ct. 11, 77 L.Ed. --, on a petition which assails the judgment below on three grounds, which will be separately considered.\n First. It is insisted that no part of the royalties is taxable income of petitioner. Petitioner rests this contention on what is stated to be a rule of law of West Virginia, that under coal leases, like those presently involved, the title to the coal, in place, passes to the lessee or operator immediately on execution of the lease. From this it is argued that the royalties received, were but payments for capital assets acquired and sold before the adoption of the Sixteenth Amendment, and that their taxation as income is not authorized either by the statute or by the Sixteenth Amendment, because not apportioned.\n The question whether payments of bonus and royalties from the lessee to the lessor of an oil lease are income within the meaning of the revenue laws taxing income, or a return of capital as upon a sale of the oil, was recently before this Court in Burnet v. Harmel, \n287 \nU.S. 103\n, 53 S.Ct. 74, decided November 7, 1932. Although it was contended there, as it is here, that by state law the title to the mineral content of the leased land passed to the lessee upon execution of the lease, it was \n\n[287 U.S. 308, 311]\n\u00a0\n held that this characterization of the transaction in the local law did not affect the conclusion that the payments were gross income subject to tax, after the deductions allowed by the taxing act. The considerations which led to the conclusion that bonus and royalties paid to the lessor of Texas oil lands are taxable income and not a conversion of capital, as upon a sale of capital assets, are equally applicable to West Virginia coal leases, whether the title to the coal in place passes to the lessee at the date of the lease, or only upon severance by the lessee.\n The applicable statutes thus construed and applied to not tax any part of petitioner's capital investment before March 1, 1913. Section 234( a)(9) of the Revenue Act of 1918, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1077, and regulations under it, require depletion allowances upon bonus and royalty payments received by the lessor of mineral lands, sufficient to provide for a return in full of his invested capital. The provisions of that section, and the related Treasury Regulations have been continued with the later revenue acts, see Murphy Oil Co. v. Burnet, \n287 \nU.S. 299\n, 53 S.Ct. 161, decided this day. The fact that the depletion allowance under the Revenue Act of 1913 (38 Stat. 114) was more limited is not pertinent here. Burnet v. Thompson Oil & Gas Co., \n283 \nU.S. 301\n, 51 S.Ct. 418\n\n\n Second. In a suit brought by the petitioner in the District Court for Northern West Virginia, Bankers' Pocahontas Coal Co. v. White, Collector of Internal Revenue, with respect to taxes for the years 1914 to 1919, it was held that petitioner was entitled to a depletion allowance on royalties received from the leases involved in the present suit, of 5 cents per ton of coal mined. It is insisted that the decision in that case was res adjudicata of that issue, and that, in flxing the depletion allowance of the present case at 3.6 cents per ton, the court below and the Board of Tax Appeals erroneously refused to follow the decision of the District Court in the earlier case. With respect to \n\n[287 U.S. 308, 312]\n\u00a0\n this contention it is sufficient to say that the suit in the District Court was not against the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, the respondent here, but against the collector, judgment against whom is not res adjudicata against the Commissioner or the United States. Graham & Foster v. Goodcell, \n282 \nU.S. 409, 430\n, 51 S.Ct. 186; Sage v. United States, \n250 \nU.S. 33\n, 39 S.Ct. 415; see Smietanka v. Indiana Steel Co., \n257 \nU.S. 1\n, 42 S.Ct. 1; compare Union Trust Co. v. Wardell, \n258 \nU.S. 537\n, 42 S.Ct. 393.\n Third. After the Board of Tax Appeals had filed its findings of fact and opinion, both respondent and petitioner submitted recomputations of the amount of the deficiency under the Board's report, as provided by rule 50 of the Board's Rules of Practice. In petitioner's recomputation, the claim was made for the first time that the minimum royalty payments stipulated by the leases had in some instances exceeded the amount of the per ton royalty which would have been payable on actual production, and it was asked that the depletion allowance be computed upon the basis of the actual payments made, instead of upon the number of tons extracted. Petitioner, at a hearing on the recomputation, tendered evidence in support of this claim. The Board rejected the evidence, and denied petitioner's motion for a rehearing in order to present this contention. The court below upheld this action.\n The Board is authorized to prescribe rules of practice and procedure for the conduct of proceedings before it. Section 601, Revenue Act of 1928, c. 852, 45 Stat. 791, 871, 872 (26 USCA  1219), amending section 907(a), Revenue Act of 1924, as amended; see Goldsmith v. United States Board of Tax Appeals, \n270 \nU.S. 117\n, 46 S.Ct. 215. Rule 50 prescribes the procedure for computing the amount of the deficiency after the Board has heard and decided the issues raised and presented on the merits. In terms, it directs that the hearing on the computation \n\n[287 U.S. 308, 313]\n\u00a0\n which it authorizes is to be 'confined strictly to the consideration of the correct computation of the deficiency or overpayment resulting from the determination already made, and no argument will be heard upon or consideration given to ... any new issues.' The Board has held that under the rule new issues may not be raised and urged on a hearing upon the computation. Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Commissioner, 10 B.T.A. 1347, affirmed on other issues (C.C.A.) 40 F.(2d) 372. The rule was a proper exercise of the power of the Board to prescribe the practice in proceedings before it. See O'Meara v. Commissioner (C.C.A.) 34 F.(2d) 390, 395; Boggs & Buhl v. Commissioner (C.C.A.) 34 F.(2d) 859, 861; Metropolitan Business College v. Blair (C.C.A.) 24 F.(2d) 176, 178; compare Sooy v. Commissioner (C.C.A.) 40 F. (2d) 634.\n The purpose of the tendered evidence was to bring the case within the ruling of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed in Murphy Oil Co. v. Burnet, supra, that bonus payments to the lessor of a mineral lease are to be treated as advanced payments of royalties and depletion allowed. This was a new issue. We need not consider the contention of the government that it does not clearly appear either that the stipulated minimum payments exceeded the total per ton royalties upon the leases, or that, even if they did, the excess of the minimum royalties over the royalties computed on actual production can, upon a proper construction of the leases, be treated as advance payment of the per ton royalties to accrue in future years. It is not shown that the evidence tendered was not available to the petitioner in ample time to present it before the Board had made and filed its findings of fact and opinion. Under the circumstances, we cannot say that the Board abused its discretion in denying a rehearing.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","19":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBECKLEY WATER CO. v.

Kilpatrick, of Lubbock, Tex., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action brought to recover the sum of $5,000 life insurance and specified disability benefits upon a policy issued by the respondent to Carl Oscar Bergholm on March 13, 1926. Judgment upon a verdict for peti- \n\n[284 U.S. 489, 490]\n\u00a0\n tioners in the trial court was reversed by the court of appeals. 50 F.(2d) 67. We granted certiorari, \n284 \nU.S. 605\n, 52 S. Ct. 30, 76 L. Ed. -, because of a supposed conflict with Minnesota Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Marshall (C. C. A.) 29 F.(2d) 977.\n Beginning with February 27, 1927, premiums were to be paid quarterly, with a grace period of one month from any due date, during which period the policy was to continue in full force. In case of total and permanent disablement there was a provision for payment of a monthly income for life of one per cent. of the amount of the principal sum. The policy expressly provided that 'if any premium is not paid on the date when due, this policy shall cease and determine, except as hereinafter provided.' The income disability clause, which follows this language, provides:\n'Upon receipt by the Company of satisfactory proof that the Insured is totally and permanently disabled as hereinafter defined the Company will\n\n'1. Pay for the Insured all premiums becoming due hereon after the receipt of such proof and during the continuance of the total and permanent disability of the Insured and will also\n\n'2. Pay to the Insured a Monthly Income for life of 1% of this Policy; The first payment of such income to be paid immediately upon receipt of such proof. ...\n\n'3. ... To entitle the Insured to the above Total and Permanent Disability Benefits this policy at the time of making claim for such benefits must be in full force and all premiums becoming due prior to the time of making claim must have been duly paid. ...'\n\n The insured died on April 18, 1929. Judgment was sought for disability benefits from December 1, 1927, to April 1, 1929, at the rate of $50 per month, with interest. The last premium paid was due on May 27, 1927. The next, allowing a month's period of grace, should have been paid not later than September 27, 1927. Neither that nor \n\n[284 U.S. 489, 491]\n\u00a0\n any subsequent premium was ever paid. Long prior to the death of the insured, the policy therefore had lapsed, unless saved by the terms of the disability clause above quoted. There is evidence in the record from which it reasonably may be found that the insured was totally and permanently disabled from a time before the premiums first became in arrears, and that this condition continued until his death; but no proof thereof was furnished to the company.\n The petitioners, nevertheless, contend that this is enough to bring into effect the promise of the company to pay the premiums which became due after the disability began. In support of this contention, Minnesota Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Marshall, supra, is cited. The pertinent provisions of the policy there, however, differ from those found in the policy here under consideration. There the policy provided that if the insured, while the policy is in force and before default in payment of premiums, 'shall become totally and permanently disabled ... and shall furnish satisfactory proof thereof, the Company will waive the payment of premiums thereafter becoming due,' and that 'upon the receipt of due proof of total and permanent disabilities ... the Company will waive the payment of all premiums thereafter becoming due.' The court held that the waiver took effect at the time of the disability, and did not depend upon the time when proof thereof was furnished.\n We do not need to controvert this construction of the words quoted, or question the soundness of the view of the court that the existence of the disability before the premium became in arrears, standing alone, was enough to create the waiver. In that view, the obligation to furnish proof was no part of the condition precedent to the waiver; but such proof might be furnished within a reasonable time thereafter. Here the obligation of the company does not rest upon the existence of the disability; \n\n[284 U.S. 489, 492]\n\u00a0\n but it is the receipt by the company of proof of the disability which is definitely made a condition precedent to an assumption by it of payment of the premiums becoming due after the receipt of such proof. The provision to that effect is wholly free from the ambiguity which the court thought existed in the Marshall policy. Compare Brams v. New York Life Ins. Co., 299 Pa. 11, 14, 148 A. 855. It is true that where the terms of a policy are of doubtful meaning, that construction most favorable to the insured will be adopted. Mutual Ins. Co. v. Hurni Co., \n263 \nU.S. 167, 174\n, 44 S.

This canon of construction is both reasonable and just, since the words of the policy are chosen by the insurance company; but it furnishes no warrant for avoiding hard consequences by importing into a contract an ambiguity which otherwise would not exist, or, under the guise of construction, by forcing from plain words unusual and unnatural meanings.\n Contracts of insurance, like other contracts, must be construed according to the terms which the parties have used, to be taken and understood, in the absence of ambiguity, in their plain, ordinary, and popular sense. Imperial Fire Ins. Co. v. Coos County, \n151 \nU.S. 452, 462\n, 463 S., 14 S. Ct. 379. As long ago pointed out by this court, the condition in a policy of life insurance that the policy shall cease if the stipulated premium shall not be paid on or before the day fixed is of the very essence and substance of the contract, against which even a court of equity cannot grant relief. Klein v. Insurance Co., \n104 U.S. 88\n, 91; New York Life Ins. Co. v. Statham et al., \n93 \nU.S. 24, 30\n, 31 S.; Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Owen (C. C. A.) 31 F.(2d) 862, 866. And to discharge the insured from the legal consequences of a failure to comply with an explicitly stipulated requirement of the policy, constituting a condition precedent to the granting of such relief by the insurer, would be to vary the plain terms of a contract in utter disregard of long-settled principles.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","21":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBLACKMER v. UNITED STATES(1932)\nNo. 200\nArgued: January 5, 1932Decided: February 15, 1932\n\n\n\n\n\n[284 U.S. 421, 424]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Karl C. Schulyer, of Denver, Colo., George Gordon Battle, of New York City, Frederick De C. Faust and Charles F. Wilson, both of Washington, D. C., and Eugene D. Millikin, of Denver, Colo., for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Atlee Pomerene, Sp. Counsel (Leo A. Rover, U. S. Atty., of Washington, D. C., and Frank Harrison, of Cleveland, Ohio, on the brief), of Cleveland, Ohio, for the United States.\n\n\n[284 U.S. 421, 433]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner, Harry M. Blackmer, a citizen of the United States resident in Paris, France, was adjudged guilty of contempt of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia for failure to respond to subpoenas served upon him in France and requiring him to appear as a witness on behalf of the United States at a criminal trial in that court. Two subpoenas were issued, for appearances at different times, and there was a separate proceeding with respect to each. The two cases were heard together, and a fine of $30,000 with costs was imposed in each case, to be satisfied out of the property of the petitioner which had been seizer by order of the court. The decrees were affirmed by the Court of Appeals of the District (49 F.(2d) 523), and this Court granted writs of certiorari \n284 \nU.S. 602\n, 52 S. Ct. 19, 76 L. Ed.-.\n The subpoenas were issued and served, and the proceedings to punish for contempt were taken, under the provisions of the Act of July 3, 1926, c. 762, 44 Stat. 835, U. S. C., tit. 28,  711-718 (28 USCA  711-718).1 The statute provided that \n\n[284 U.S. 421, 434]\n\u00a0\n whenever the attendance at the trial of a criminal action of a witness abroad, who is 'a citizen of the United States or domiciled therein,' is desired by the Attorney General, or any assistant or district attorney acting under him, the judge of the court in which the action is pending may order a subpoena to issue, to be addressed to a consul of the United States and to be served by him personally \n\n[284 U.S. 421, 435]\n\u00a0\n upon the witness with a tender of traveling expenses. Sections 2, 3 of the act (28 USCA  712, 713). Upon proof of such service and of the failure of the witness to appear, the court may make an order requiring the witness to show cause why he should not be punished for contempt, and, upon the issue of such an order, the court may direct that property belonging to the witness and within the United States may be seized and held to satisfy any judgment which may be rendered \n\n[284 U.S. 421, 436]\n\u00a0\n against him in the proceeding. Sections 4, 5 (28 USCA  714, 715). Provision is made for personal service of the order upon the witness and also for its publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the district where the court is sitting. Section 6 (28 USCA  716). If, upon the hearing, the charge is sustained, the court may adjudge the witness guilty of contempt and impose upon him a fine not exceeding $100,000, to be satisfied by a sale of the property seized. Section 7 (28 USCA  717). This statute and the proceedings against the petitioner are assailed as being repugnant to the Constitution of the United States.\n First. The principal objections to the statute are that it violates the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. These contentions are: (1) That the 'Congress has no power to authorize United States consuls to serve process except as permitted by treaty'; (2) that the act does not provide 'a valid method of acquiring judicial jurisdiction to render personal judgment against defendant and judgment against his property'; (3) that the act 'does not require actual or any other notice to defendant of the offense or of the Government's claim against his property'; (4) that the provisions 'for hearing and judgment in the entire absence of the accused and without his consent' are invalid; and (5) that the act is 'arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable.'\n While it appears that the petitioner removed his residence to France in the year 1924, it is undisputed that he was, and continued to be, a citizen of the United States. He continued to owe allegiance to the United States. By virtue of the obligations of citizenship, the United States retained its authority over him, and he was bound by its laws made applicable to him in a foreign country. Thus, although resident abroad, the petitioner remained subject to the taxing power of the United States. Cook v. Tait, \n265 \nU.S. 47, 54\n, 56 S., 44 S. Ct. 444. For disobedience to its laws through conduct abroad, he was subject to punishment in the courts of the United States. United States v. Bow- \n\n[284 U.S. 421, 437]\n\u00a0\n man, \n260 \nU.S. 94, 102\n, 43 S. Ct. 39. With respect to such an exercise of authority, there is no question of international law,2 but solely of the purport of the municipal law which establishes the duties of the citizen in relation to his own government. \n3\n While the legislation of the Congress, unless the contrary intent appears, is construed to apply only within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States, the question of its application, so far as citizens of the United States in foreign countries are concerned, is one of construction, not of legislative power. American Banana Co. v. United Fruit Co., \n213 \nU.S. 347, 357\n, 29 S. Ct. 511, 16 Ann. Cas. 1047; United States v. Bowman, supra; Robertson v. Labor Board, \n268 \nU.S. 619, 622\n, 45 S. Ct. 621. Nor can it be doubted that the United States possesses the power inherent in sovereignty to require the return to this country of a citizen, resident elsewhere, whenever the public interest requires it, and to penalize him in case of refusal. Compare Bartue and the Duchess of Suffolk's Case, 2 Dyer's Rep. 176b, 73 Eng. Rep. 388; Knowles v. Luce, Moore 109, 72 Eng. Rep. 473.4 What in England was the prerogative of the sov- \n\n[284 U.S. 421, 438]\n\u00a0\n ereign in this respect pertains under our constitutional system to the national authority which may be exercised by the Congress by virtue of the legislative power to prescribe the duties of the citizens of the United States. It is also beyond controversy that one of the duties which the citizen owes to his government is to support the administration of justice by attending its courts and giving his testimony whenever he is properly summoned. Blair v. United States, \n250 \nU.S. 273, 281\n, 39 S. St. Ct. 468. And the Congress may provide for the performance of this duty and prescribe penalties for disobedience.\n In the present instance, the question concerns only the method of enforcing the obligation. \n5\n The jurisdiction of the United States over its absent citizen, so far as the binding effect of its legislation is concerned, is a jurisdiction in personam, as he is personally bound to take notice of the laws that are applicable to him and to obey them. United States v. Bowman, supra. But for the exercise of judicial jurisdiction in personam, there must be due process, which requires appropriate notice of the judicial action and an opportunity to be heard. For this notice and opportunity the statute provides. The authority to require the absent citizen to return and testify necessarily implies the authority to give him notice of the requirement. As his attendance is needed in court, it is appropriate that the Congress should authorize the court to direct the notice to be given, and that it should be in the customary form of a subpoena. Obviously, the requirement would be nugatory, if provision could not be made for its communication to the witness in the foreign coun- \n\n[284 U.S. 421, 439]\n\u00a0\n try. The efficacy of an attempt to provide constructive service in this country would rest upon the presumption that the notice would be given in a manner calculated to reach the witness abroad. McDonald v. Mabee, \n243 \nU.S. 90, 92\n, 37 S. Ct. 343, L. R. A. 1917F, 458. The question of the validity of the provision for actual service of the subpoena in a foreign country is one that arises solely between the government of the United States and the citizen. The mere giving of such a notice to the citizen in the foreign country of the requirement of his government that he shall return is in no sence an invasion of any right of the foreign government and the citizen has no standing to invoke any such supposed right. While consular privileges in foreign countries are the appropriate subjects of treatries,6 it does not follow that every act of a consul, as, e. g., in communicating with citizens of his own country, must be predicated upon a specific provision of a treaty. The intercourse of friendly nations, permitting travel and residence of the citizens of each in the territory of the other, presupposes and facilitates such communications. In selecting the consul for the service of the subpoena, the Congress merely prescribed a method deemed to assure the desired result but in no sense essential. The consul was not directed to perform any function involving consular privileges or depending upon any treaty relating to them, but simply to act as any designated person might act for the government in conveying to the citizen the actual notice of the requirement of his attendance. The point raised by the petitioner with respect to the provision for the service of the subpoena abroad is without merit.\n As the Congress could define the obligation, it could prescribe a penalty to enforce it. And, as the default lay in disobedience to an authorized direction of the court, it \n\n[284 U.S. 421, 440]\n\u00a0\n constituted a contempt of court, and the Congress could provide for procedure appropriate in contempt cases. The provision of the statute for punishment for contempt is applicable only 'upon proof being made of the service and default.' Section 4 (28 USCA  714). That proof affords a proper basis for the proceeding, and provision is made for personal service upon the witness of the order to show cause why he should not be adjudged guilty. For the same reasons as those which sustain the service of the subpoena abroad, it was competent to provide for the service of the order in like manner. It is only after a hearing pursuant to the order to show cause, and upon proof sustaining the charge, that the court can impose the penalty. The petitioner urges that the statute does not require notice of the offense, but the order to show cause is to be issued after the witness has failed to obey the subpoena demanding his attendance and the order is to be made by the court before which he was required to appear. This is sufficient to apprise the witness of the nature of the proceeding and he has full opportunity to be heard. The further contention is made that, as the offense is a criminal one, it is a violation of due process to hold the hearing, and to proceed to judgment, in the absence of the defendant. The argument misconstrues the nature of the proceeding. 'While contempt may be an offense against the law and subject to appropriate punishment, certain it is that since the foundation of our government proceedings to punish such offenses have been regarded as sui generis and not 'criminal prosecutions' within the Sixth Amendment or common understanding.' Myers v. United States, \n264 \nU.S. 95, 104\n, 105 S., 44 S. Ct. 272, 273. See, also, Bessette v. Conkey, \n194 \nU.S. 327, 336\n, 337 S., 24 S. Ct. 665; Michaelson v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 42, 65\n, 66 S., 45 S. Ct. 18, 35 A. L. R. 451; Ex parte Grossman, \n267 \nU.S. 87, 117\n, 118 S., 45 S. Ct. 332, 38 A. L. R. 131. The requirement of due process in such a case is satisfied by suitable notice and adequate opportunity to appear and to be heard. Cf. Cooke v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 517, 537\n, 45 S. Ct. 390. \n\n[284 U.S. 421, 441]\n\u00a0\n The authorization of the seizure of the property belonging to the defaulting witness and within the United States, upon the issue of the order to show cause why he should not be punished for contempt (section 5 of the Act (28 USCA  715)), affords a provisional remedy, the propriety of which rests upon the validity of the contempt proceeding. As the witness is liable to punishment by fine if, upon the hearing, he is found guilty of contempt, no reason appears why his property may not be seized to provide security for the payment of the penalty. The proceeding conforms to familiar practice where absence or other circumstance makes a provisional remedy appropriate. See Cooper v. Reynolds, 10 Wall. 308, 318. The order that is to be served upon the witness contains the direction for the seizure. The property is to be held pending the hearing, and is to be applied to the satisfaction of the fine if imposed and unless it is paid. Given the obligation of the witness to respond to the subpoena, the showing of his default after service, and the validity of the provision for a fine in case default is not excused, there is no basis for objection to the seizure upon constitutional grounds. The argument that the statute creates an unreasonable classification is untenable. The disobedience of the defaulting witness to a lawful requirement of the court, and not the fact that he owns property, is the ground of his liability. He is not the subject of unconstitutional discrimination simply because he has property which may be appropriated to the satisfaction of a lawful claim.\n Second. What has already been said also disposes of the contention that the statute provides for an unreasonable search and seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment. It authorizes a levy upon property of the witness at any place within the United States in the manner provided by law or rule of court for levy or seizure under execution. A levy in such a manner, either provisionally \n\n[284 U.S. 421, 442]\n\u00a0\n or finally, to satisfy the liability of the owner, is not within the constitutional prohibition.\n The petitioner raises the further and distinct point that the statute limits the availability of the subpoena to the government, and that 'by excluding defendants in criminal prosecutions' from the right to such a subpoena violates the provision of the Sixth Amendment that the accused shall have 'compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor.' We need not consider whether the statute requires the construction for which the petitioner contends, as in any event the petitioner, a recalcitrant witness, is not entitled to raise the question. Nelson v. United States, \n201 \nU.S. 92, 115\n, 26 S. Ct. 358; Southern Railway Co. v. King, \n217 \nU.S. 524, 534\n, 30 S. Ct. 594; Jeffrey Manufacturing Co. v. Blagg, \n235 \nU.S. 571, 576\n, 35 S. Ct. 167; Blair v. United States, supra, 250 U. S. at page 282, 39 S. Ct. 468.\n Third. The statute being valid, the question remains as to the procedure in its application against the petitioner. He insists that the showing for the issue of the subpoenas requiring him to attend was inadequate. But the 'proper showing' required was for the purpose of satisfying the court that the subpoenas should issue. The petitions, in the instant cases, were presented to the judge of the court by the official representatives of the government, and their statement as to the materiality and importance of the testimony expected from the witness was unquestionably sufficient to give the court jurisdiction to issue the subpoenas, and, unless they were vacated upon proper application, the petitioner was bound to obey. Nor was it necessary that the subpoenas should 'identify' themselves with the statute under which they were issued. The petitioner as a citizen of the United States was chargeable with knowledge of the law under which his attendance as a witness could be required. It was sufficient that the subpoenas required his attendance to testify on behalf of the United States at the time and place stated. \n\n[284 U.S. 421, 443]\n\u00a0\n Equally unavailing is the objection that, after the petitioner had refused to appear in response to the subpoenas, the orders to show cause why he should not be punished for contempt did not specify the offense. As the statute prescribed, he had been served with the subpoenas and had defaulted, and he had also been served with the order which directed him to show cause why he should not be adjudged guilty of contempt and provided for the seizure of his property to be held to satisfy any judgment that might be rendered against him in the proceeding. The notice which he thus received was sufficient to inform him of the character of the charge against him and of the hearing at which he would have opportunity to present his defense. The petitioner also insists that the seizure which was made in case No. 200 was abandoned by virtue of the seizure of the same property under the order issued in No. 201. But the second levy was not antagonistic to the first. The proceedings were consistent.\n In No. 201, the contention is made that the petitioner was subpoenaed to attend on April 2, 1928, and that the case in which his testimony was desired was not tried until April 9, 1928. There is no suggestion that the petitioner appeared on April 2, 1928, in compliance with the subpoena, and the record shows that the case in which he was subpoenaed was continued by the court until the later date. The subpoena contained the usual provision that the witness was 'not to depart the court without leave of the court or district attorney.' Cf. Rev. Stat.  877, U. S. C., tit. 28,  655 (28 USCA  655). It was the duty of the petitioner to respond to the subpoena and to remain in attendance until excused by the court or by the government's representatives.\n Decrees affirmed.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Act is as follows: 'Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That whenever letters rogatory shall issue out of any court of the United States, either with or without interrogatories addressed to any court of any foreign country, to take the testimony of any witness, being a citizen of the United States or domiciled therein, and such witness, having been personally notified by it according to the practice of such court, to appear and testify pursuant to such letters rogatory and such witness shall neglect to appear, or having appeared shall decline, refuse or neglect to answer to any question which may be propounded to him by or under the authority of such court, to which he would be required to make answer were he being examined before \n the court issuing such letters, the court out of which said letters issued may upon proper showing order that a subpoena issue addressed to any consul of the United States within any country in which such witness may be, commanding such witness to appear before the said court at a time and place therein designated.\n'Sec. 2. Whenever the attendance at the trial of any criminal action of a witness, being a citizen of the United States or domiciled therein, who is beyond the jurisdiction of the United States, is desired by the Attorney General or any assistant or district attorney acting under him, its judge of the court before which such action is pending, or who is to sit in the trial of the same, may, upon proper showing, order that a subpoena issue, addressed to any consul of the United States within any country in which such witness may be, commanding such witness to appear before the said court at a time and place therein designated.\n\n'Sec. 3. It shall be the duty of any consul of the United States within any country is which such witness may be at the request of the clerk of the court issuing any subpoena under this Act or at the request of the officer causing such subpoena to be issued, to serve the same personally upon such witness and also to serve any orders to show cause, rules, judgments, or decrees when requested by the court or United States marshal, and to make a return thereof to the court out of which the same issued, first tendering to the witness the amount of his necessary expenses in traveling to and from the place at which the court sits and his attendance thereon, which amount shall be determined by the judge on issuing the order for the subpoena and supplied to the consul making the service.\n\n'Sec. 4. If the witness so served shall neglect or refuse to appear as in such subpoena directed, the court out of which it was issued shall, upon proof being made of the service and default, issue an order directing the witness to appear before the court at a time in such order designated to show cause why he should not be adjudged guilty of contempt and be punished accordingly. \n\n'Sec. 5. Upon issuing such order the court may, upon the giving of security for any damages which the recusing witness may have suffered, should the charge be dismissed (except that no security shall be required of the United States), direct as a part of such order that the property of the recusing witness, at any place within the United States, or so much thereof in value as the court may direct shall be levied upon and seized by the marshal of said court in the manner provided by law or the rule of the court for a levy or seizure under execution, to be held to satisfy any judgment that may be rendered against such witness in the proceeding so instituted.\n\n'Sec. 6. The marshal, having made such levy, shall thereupon forward to the consul of any country where the recusing witness may be a copy of the order to show cause why such witness should not be adjudged guilty of contempt with the request that said consul make service of the same personally upon the recusing witness, and shall cause to be published such order to show cause and for the sequestration of the property of such witness, in some newspaper of general circulation in the district within which the court issuing such order sits, once each week for six consecutive weeks.\n\n'Sec. 7. On the return day of such order or any later day to which the hearing may by the court be continued, proof shall be taken; and if the charge of recusancy against the witness shall be sustained, the court shall adjudge him guilty of contempt and, notwithstanding any limitation upon the power of the court generally to punish for contempt, impose upon him a fine not exceeding $100,000 and direct that the amount thereof, with the costs of the proceeding, be satisfied, unless paid, by a sale of the property of the witness so seized or levied upon, such sale to be conducted upon the notice required and in the manner provided for sales upon execution.\n\n'Sec. 8. Any judgment rendered pursuant to this Act upon service by publication only may be opened for answer within the time and in the manner provided in section 57 of the Judicial Code.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 'The law of Nations does not prevent a State from exercising jurisdiction over its subjects travelling or residing abroad, since they remain under its personal supremacy.'

C., an insolvent national bank, to recover money alleged to have been paid to the bank upon trust for the purchase, for respondent, of United States bonds. Judgment of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina for respondent was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. 52 F.(2d) 821. This Court granted certiorari. Blakey v. Brinson, \n285 \nU.S. 531\n, 52 S. Ct. 312, 76 L. Ed. -.\n The case was tried to the court without a jury, and the facts are not in dispute. Respondent maintained an in \n\n[286 U.S. 254, 259]\n\u00a0\n terest-bearing savings account with the bank, in which his credit balance on October 14, 1929, was $1,961.31. Shortly before that date, respondent had had conversations with an officer of the bank, in the course of which the latter signified the willingness of the bank to purchase $4,000 of United States bonds for respondent. On October 10, he stated to respondent that the bank would send to Richmond for the bonds, and asked him to bring to the bank on the 14th such amount, in addition to his credit balance, as would be required to pay for the bonds. On the latter date respondent drew a check for $2,100 upon another bank, which he deposited in his savings account, thus increasing his deposit balance to $4,061.31. On the 15th, the same officer of the bank informed respondent that the bonds had been ordered, and on the 19th said to him, 'I have your bonds,' and handed to him a charge slip which stated: 'This is to advise you that we have this day charged your account as follows:\n 4,000 Fourth L. L. 4 1\/4% Bonds $3,960.00 Acc. Int. .60 Commission 4.00 $3,964.60\"\n On October 21 the bank charged respondent's savings account on its books with $3,964.60, and credited a like amount as a 'deposit' in a 'bond account' appearing on its books. The bond account contained only a daily record of credits in the account of checks and deposits and their total, without any reference to respondent or any other customer of the bank. The nature and purpose of the account does not otherwise appear. When the bank closed its doors on October 26, it was discovered that in fact no bonds had been purchased, ordered, or received for the respondent. The only transactions had with respect to respondent or his account were the con- \n\n[286 U.S. 254, 260]\n\u00a0\n versations with the officer of the bank and the entry of the debit and credit items mentioned.\n On these facts, the District Court concluded that the bank had received the $3,964.60 in trust for the purpose of purchasing the bonds, and that, as the funds in the hands of the receiver had been augmented by the wrongful commingling of the trust fund with the other funds of the bank, respondent was entitled to payment in preference to the general creditors of the bank. The Court of Appeals thought that the trust arose only on the 19th, when the bank stated that respondent's account had been charged with the purchase price of the bonds, but reached the same conclusion as respects the increase of the funds in the hands of the receiver and the right of respondent to preferential payment.\n The petitioner insists, as matter of law, that no trust ever came into existence as the result of these transactions. He also relies on the facts that the $2,100 check credited to respondent's account had been included in a clearing house settlement of the bank with a correspondent, and its proceeds in the form of a draft for the balance due upon the settlement had been indorsed and turned over by the New Bern bank to a third bank in settlement of its account with the latter. From this it is argued that the check did not augment the bank's funds, and that the proceeds could not be traced into the hands of the receiver; hence as to them the respondent could not be preferred over general creditors.\n As we conclude that petitioner's first position is well taken, it is unnecessary to consider the second. It would have been equally competent for respondent to have provided for the purchase of the bonds either by the creation of a trust of funds in the hands of the bank, to be used for that purpose, or by establishing with it a credit to be debited with the cost of the bonds when purchased. But only if the former was the method adopted could respond- \n\n[286 U.S. 254, 261]\n\u00a0\n ent, upon the bank's insolvency and failure to purchase the bonds, recover the fund or its proceeds, if traceable, in preference to general creditors. See Minard v. Watts (C. C.) 186 F. 245; Fallgatter v. Citizens' National Bank (D. C.) 11 F.(2d) 383; Northern Sugar Corp. v. Thompson (C. C. A.) 13 F.(2d) 829.\n The relationship established between the bank and respondent by his savings account was, from its inception, that of debtor and creditor, and the credit balance of $1,961.31 in respondent's account on October 14 represented the amount of the bank's indebtedness to him. Planter's Bank v. Union Bank, 16 Wall. 483, 501; Phoenix Bank v. Risley, \n111 \nU.S. 125\n, 4 S. Ct. 322; Manhattan Co. v. Blake, \n148 \nU.S. 412, 425\n, 426 S., 13 S. Ct. 640.\n Although there had been anticipatory talk of the purchase of bonds, and the bank's officer had stated that they would be purchased, nothing said or done before the 14th purported to carry out the proposal or to alter the relationship established by the savings account. On that date respondent's credit balance was augmented by the deposit of the $2,100 check, made in conformity to the usual course of business with respect to deposit accounts. Respondent obviously did not alter the debit and credit relationship with respect to the $1,961.31 balance by asking the bank to purchase bonds, or by handing to the bank the deposited check of $2,100. All that happened on that date was inconsistent with any purpose to create a trust of the check or its proceeds, and showed unmistakably that the amount of the check, as in the case of any other deposit in the savings account, was to be added to the existing balance and treated like it. In making the deposit, respondent used the customary form of deposit slip, and, in accordance with its instructions, the deposit was credited by the bank in the usual manner, both in his passbook and in his savings account on its own books. \n\n[286 U.S. 254, 262]\n\u00a0\n After the deposit of the check, as before, the bank remained a debtor and the respondent a creditor for the amount of the credit balance.\n The situation thus created continued without change until the 19th, when the bank's officer advised respondent that the bonds had been purchased. If the advice was true, as respondent believed it to be, he was then called upon to pay to the bank the amount of the purchase price, and the bank proceeded, with the assent of the respondent, to liquidate the supposed obligation by charging his savings account with the exact amount of the stated purchase price, with interest and commissions added. We can find in this method of discharging a supposed obligation no hint of an intended alteration of the debtor and creditor relationship, with which respondent had been content from the beginning, to that of trustee and cestui que trust.\n The court below thought that the legal consequence to be attributed to the debiting of the account with the supposed purchase price of the bonds was the same as if the respondent had cashed a check for the amount and had then proceeded to hand the money back to the bank under a specific agreement between him and the bank that the money was to be held as a special fund, for the sole purpose of completing the purchase. This view is not without support. See Davis v. McNair (C. C. A.) 48 F.(2d) 494; State v. Grills, 35 R. I. 70, 75, 85 A. 281; Northwest Lumber Co. v. Scandinavian American Bank, 130 Wash. 33, 225 P. 825, 39 A. L. R. 922; State v. American Exchange Bank, 112 Neb. 834, 201 N. W. 895. See, contra, Beard v. Independent District of Pella City (C. C.

Cosmopolitan Trust Co., 242 Mass. 181, 136 N. E. 333, 24 A. L. R. 1148. \n\n[286 U.S. 254, 263]\n\u00a0\n Such a procedure, if actually carried out, might afford a basis, which is lacking here, for the inference that respondent, no longer content with the role of creditor, had sought to establish a trust fund. But the mere debiting of his account, without more, for the reimbursement of the bank for the obligation which it was supposed to have incurred or paid, lends no support to such an inference. The cancellation of the credit balance by the debit neither suggests any intention to establish a trust nor points to any identifiable thing which could be the subject of it.\n The debit entry may be disregarded, because respondent's assent to it was procured by a false statement; but the only consequence is that his status as a creditor is unaffected, and he is entitled only to share in the funds of the bank on an equal footing with other creditors who similarly are the victims of its insolvency.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","23":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBLOCKBURGER v. UNITED STATES(1932)\nNo. 374\nArgued: Decided: January 4, 1932\n\n\n\n On Writ of Certiorari to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.\n Harry Blockburger was convicted of violating certain provisions of the Harrison Anti-Narcotic Act. To review a judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals [50 F.(2d) 795], affirming the judgment of conviction, the defendant brings certiorari.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n[284 U.S. 299, 300]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Harold J. Bandy, of Granite City, Ill., for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Claude R. Branch, of Providence, R. I., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner was charged with violating provisions of the Harrison Narcotic Act, c. 1,  1, 38 Stat. 785, as amended by c. 18,  1006, 40 Stat. 1057, 1131 (U. S. C. Title 26,  692 [26 USCA  692]);1 and c. 1,  2, 38 Stat. 785, 786 (U. S. C., Title 26,  696 [26 USCA  696]).2 The indictment \n\n[284 U.S. 299, 301]\n\u00a0\n contained five counts. The jury returned a verdict against petitioner upon the second, third, and fifth counts only. Each of these counts charged a sale of morphine hydrochloride to the same purchaser. The second count charged a sale on a specified day of ten grains of the drug not in or from the original stamped package; the third count charged a sale on the following day of eight grains of the drug not in or from the original stamped package; the fifth count charged the latter sale also as having been made not in pursuance of a written order of the purchaser as required by the statute. The court sentenced petitioner to five years' imprisonment and a fine of $2,000 upon each count, the terms of imprisonment to run consecutively; and this judgment was affirmed on appeal. (C. C. A.) 50 F.( 2d) 795.\n The principal contentions here made by petitioner are as follows: (1) That, upon the facts, the two sales charged in the second and third counts as having been made to the same person constitute a single offense; and (2) that the sale charged in the third count as having been made not from the original stamped package, and the same sale charged in the fifth count as having been made not in pursuance of a written order of the purchaser, constitute but one offense, for which only a single penalty lawfully may be imposed.\n One. The sales charged in the second and third counts, although made to the same person, were distinct and separate sales made at different times. It appears from the evidence that, shortly after delivery of the drug which was the subject of the first sale, the purchaser paid for an additional quantity, which was delivered the next day. But the first sale had been consummated, and the payment for the additional drug, however closely following, was the initiation of a separate and distinct sale completed by its delivery.\n The contention on behalf of petitioner is that these two sales, having been made to the same purchaser and \n\n[284 U.S. 299, 302]\n\u00a0\n following each other, with no substantial interval of time between the delivery of the drug in the first transaction and the payment for the second quantity sold, constitute a single continuing offense. The contention is unsound. The distinction between the transactions here involved and an offense continuous in its character is well settled, as was pointed out by this court in the case of In re Snow, \n120 \nU.S. 274\n, 7 S. Ct. 556. There it was held that the offense of cohabiting with more than one woman, created by the Act of March 22, 1882, c. 47, 22 Stat. 31 (now 18 USCA  514) was a continuous offense, and was committed, in the sense of the statute, where there was a living or dwelling together as husband and wife. The court said (pages 281, 286 of 120 U. S., 7 S. Ct. 556, 559):\n'It is, inherently, a continuous offense, having duration; and not an offense consisting of an isolated act. ...\n\n'A distinction is laid down in adjudged cases and in text-writers between an offense continuous in its character, like the one at bar, and a case where the statute is aimed at an offense that can be committed uno ictu.'\n\n The Narcotic Act does not create the offense of engaging in the business of selling the forbidden drugs, but penalizes any sale made in the absence of either of the qualifying requirements set forth. Each of several successive sales constitutes a distinct offense, however closely they may follow each other. The distinction stated by Mr. Wharton is that, 'when the impulse is single, but one indictment lies, no matter how long the action may continue. If successive impulses are separately given, even though all unite in swelling a common stream of action, separate indictments lie.' Wharton's Criminal Law (11th Ed.)  34. Or, as stated in note 3 to that section, 'The test is whether the individual acts are prohibited, or the course of action which they constitute. If the former, then each act is punishable separately. ... If the latter, there can be but one penalty.' \n\n[284 U.S. 299, 303]\n\u00a0\n In the present case, the first transaction, resulting in a sale, had come to an end. The next sale was not the result of the original impulse, but of a fresh one-that is to say, of a new bargain. The question is controlled, not by the Snow Case, but by such cases as that of Ebeling v. Morgan, \n237 \nU.S. 625\n, 35 S. Ct. 710. There the accused was convicted under several counts of a willful tearing, etc., of mail bags with intent to rob. The court (page 628 of 237 U. S., 35 S. Ct. 710, 711) stated the question to be 'whether one who, in the same transaction, tears or cuts successively mail bags of the United States used in conveyance of the mails, with intent to rob or steal any such mail, is guilty of a single offense, or of additional offenses because of each successive cutting with the criminal intent charged.' Answerint this question, the court, after quoting the statute, section 189, Criminal Code , (U. S. C. title 18,  312 [18 USCA  312]) said (page 629 of 237 U. S., 35 S. Ct. 710, 711):\n'These words plainly indicate that it was the intention of the lawmakers to protect each and every mail bag from felonious injury and mutilation. Whenever any one mail bag is thus torn, cut, or injured, the offense is complete. Although the transaction of cutting the mail bags was in a sense continuous, the complete statutory offense was committed every time a mail bag was cut in the manner described, with the intent charged. The offense as to each separate bag was complete when that bag was cut, irrespective of any attack upon, or mutilation of, any other bag.'\n\n See, also, Ex parte Henry, \n123 \nU.S. 372, 374\n, 8 S. Ct. 142; Ex parte De Bara, \n179 \nU.S. 316, 320\n, 21 S. Ct. 110; Badders v. United States, \n240 \nU.S. 391, 394\n, 36 S. Ct. 367; Wilkes v. Dinsman, 7 How. 89, 127; United States v. Daugherty, \n269 \nU.S. 360\n, 46 S. Ct. 156; Queen v. Scott, 4 Best & S. (Q. B.) 368, 373.\n Two. Section 1 of the Narcotic Act creates the offense of selling any of the forbidden drugs except in or from the original stamped package; and section 2 creates the offense of selling any of such drugs not in pursuance of a written \n\n[284 U.S. 299, 304]\n\u00a0\n order of the person to whom the drug is sold. Thus, upon the face of the statute, two distinct offenses are created. Here there was but one sale, and the question is whether, both sections being violated by the same act, the accused committed two offenses or only one.\n The statute is not aimed at sales of the forbidden drugs qua sales, a matter entirely beyond the authority of Congress, but at sales of such drugs in violation of the requirements set forth in sections 1 and 2, enacted as aids to the enforcement of the stamp tax imposed by the act. See Alston v. United States, \n274 \nU.S. 289, 294\n, 47 S. Ct. 634; Nigro v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 332, 341\n, 345 S., 351, 48 S. Ct. 388.\n Each of the offenses created requires proof of a different element. The applicable rule is that, where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one is whether each provision requires proof of an additional fact which the other does not. Gavieres v. United States, \n220 \nU.S. 338, 342\n, 31 S. Ct. 421, and authorities cited. In that case this court quoted from and adopted the language of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts in Morey v. Commonwealth, 108 Mass. 433: 'A single act may be an offense against two statutes; and if each statute requires proof of an additional fact which the other does not, an acquittal or conviction under either statute does not exempt the defendant from prosecution and punishment under the other.' Compare Albrecht v. United States, \n273 \nU.S. 1, 11\n, 12 S., 47 S. Ct. 250, and cases there cited. Applying the test, we must conclude that here, although both sections were violated by the one sale, two offenses were committed.\n The case of Ballerini v. Aderholt (C. C. A.) 44 F.(2d) 352, is not in harmony with these views, and is disapproved.\n Three. It is not necessary to discuss the additional assignments of error in respect of cross-examination, admission of testimony, statements made by the district \n\n[284 U.S. 299, 305]\n\u00a0\n attorney to the jury claimed to be prejudicial, and instructions of the court. These matters were properly disposed of by the court below. Nor is there merit in the contention that the language of the penal section of the Narcotic Act (section 9, 26 USCA  705), 'any person who violates or fails to comply with any of the requirements of this act,' shall be punished, etc., is to be construed as imposing a single punishment for a violation of the distinct requirements of sections 1 and 2 when accomplished by one and the same sale. The plain meaning of the provision is that each offense is subject to the penalty prescribed; and, if that be too harsh, the remedy must be afforded by act of Congress, not by judicial legislation under the guise of construction. Under the circumstances, so far as disclosed, it is true that the imposition of the full penalty of fine and imprisonment upon each count seems unduly severe; but there may have been other facts and circumstances before the trial court properly influencing the extent of the punishment. In any event, the matter was one for that court, with whose judgment there is no warrant for interference on our part.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'It shall be unlawful for any person to purchase, sell, dispense, or distribute any of the aforesaid drugs [opium and other narcotics] except in the original stamped package or from the original stamped package; and the absence of appropriate tax-paid stamps from any of the aforesaid drugs shall be prima facie evidence of a violation of this section by the person in whose possession same may be found. ...' \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 'It shall be unlawful for any person to sell, barter, exchange, or give away any of the drugs specified in section 691 of this title, except in pursuance of a written order of the person to whom such article is sold, bartered, exchanged, or given on a form to be issued in blank for that purpose by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.' \n\n\n\n\n","24":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBORUM v.

Ct. 44, 76 L. Ed. -, to review a judgment of the municipal court of Boston, entered on rescript of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, holding that the Massachusetts Workmen's Compensation Act does not impose an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce. 177 N. E. 665.\n The suit was brought by respondent to recover for personal injuries while in the employ of petitioner, an interstate rail carrier, engaged both in intrastate and interstate commerce. At the time of his injury, he was engaged exclusively in intrastate commerce. The railroad company interposed as defenses that the injury was due solely to the negligence of a fellow servant, and that respondent had assumed the risks of such negligence. Upon the trial by the court without a jury, respondent invoked the provisions of the Massachusetts Workmen's Compensation Act,  66, c. 152, Mass. General Laws, providing that an employer not electing to comply with that act by effecting the prescribed insurance for the benefit of his employees, as petitioner had failed to do, may not interpose these defenses in an action brought by an employee to recover for injuries sustained in the course of his employment. Rulings requested by the petitioner that the act did not apply to petitioner, and, if it did, that the provisions invoked constituted an unconstitutional burden on commerce, were denied. The correctness of these rulings was reviewed and upheld by the Supreme Judicial Court, after which, following the Massachusetts practice, judgment was entered accordingly by the municipal court. \n\n[285 U.S. 234, 237]\n\u00a0\n It is the contention of the petitioner that the insurance provisions of the Massachusetts act, if applied to an interstate carrier, impose an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce, and as section 66, denying to employers certain common-law defenses, in effect penalizes failure to comply with the insurance provisions, and is inseparable from them, the constitutionality of the section is conditioned upon that of the insurance requirements, and it must be deemed unconstitutional as applied to petitioner.

Railroad Commission, \n271 \nU.S. 583\n, 46 S. Ct. 605, 47 A. L. R. 457.\n The act, in terms section 1(4), is made broadly applicable to employees 'except masters of and seamen on vessels engaged in interstate or foreign commerce,' and the state court held in this case that it is applicable to the employees of interstate carriers engaged in intrastate commerce. But, construing the act, it ruled that, as by implication all statutes of the state are intended to operate only upon a subject within the jurisdiction of the Legislature enacting them, this statute is not to be deemed to be applicable to employees whose rights of recovery for injuries in the course of their employment in interstate commerce are governed by the Federal Employers' Liability Act (45 USCA  51-59). The Court said (page 669 of 177 N. E.):\n'... The act does not require ... that an employer must insure branches or departments or kinds of business which for any reason are not within the jurisdiction of the general court and thus necessarily outside the scope of the act. An employer, conducting some business within the jurisdiction of the general court and other business outside that jurisdiction, may insure under the act with respect to his employees in the part of his business within that jurisdiction and secure \n\n[285 U.S. 234, 238]\n\u00a0\n with respect to them all the benefits of the act unaffected by the circumstance that he continues to conduct the part of his business outside that jurisdiction without such insurance; and he may continue to conduct this latter part of his business under the principles of legal obligation governing it, free from any effect flowing from insurance under the act as to the other part of his business conducted within the jurisdiction of the general court.'\n\n Thus construed, the act does not on its face impose any burden on interstate commerce.\n The enactment of workmen's compensation acts is within the legislative power of the state, Mountain Timber Co. v.

Ct. 289.\n Although by the Federal Employers' Liability Act (45 USCA  51-59) the regulatory power of the national government over interstate commerce has been extended to the employees of interstate rail carriers, it has not excluded the exertion of state power over their employees while engaged in a service not involving interstate commerce. See Shanks v. Delaware, Lackawanna & Western R. Co., \n239 \nU.S. 556, 558\n, 36 S. Ct. 188, L. R. A. 1916C, 797. The liability of the carrier to its employees \n\n[285 U.S. 234, 239]\n\u00a0\n when so engaged is controlled by state law, see Illinois Central R. Co. v. Behrens, \n233 \nU.S. 473\n, 34 S.

Industrial Commission of Illinois, \n284 \nU.S. 296\n, 52 S. Ct. 151.\n But the petitioner insists that the Massachusetts statute does invade the field already occupied by the federal legislation. It is said that the stated, as construed by the state court, applies to all employees in intrastate commerce, while the federal act does extend to and include some employees engaged in intrastate commerce if, at the same moment and in the same service, they are also engaged in interstate commerce. See Pedersen v. Delaware, Lackawanna & Western R. Co., \n229 \nU.S. 146\n, 33 S. Ct. 648, Ann. Cas. 1914C, 153; Erie R. Co. v. Winfield, \n244 \nU.S. 170\n, 37 S. Ct. 556, Ann. Cas. 1918B, 662; Southern Pacific Co. v. Industrial Accident Commission, \n251 \nU.S. 259\n, 40 S. Ct. 130, 10 A. L. R. 1181\n\n\n But there are two answers to this suggestion: First, as was conceded at the trial, the respondent was not engaged in interstate commerce at the time of the accident, and the petitioner cannot object, on the ground advanced, to the application of the act to his employment. Second, we do not read the opinion of the state court as placing any such construction on the act. By the language which we have quoted and elsewhere in the opinion, the court states with emphasis that the act is not to be construed as reaching into any part of the field occupied by federal legislation. Thus construed, it does not purport to extend to employees who, because they are engaged in interstate commerce, are within the federal act, even though at the same time their service is also in intrastate commerce.\n Petitioner also urges that, as the insurance provisions of the act, as interpreted by the state court, require the premiums to be based on so much of its payroll as may be allocated to the hours of employment in intrastate \n\n[285 U.S. 234, 240]\n\u00a0\n commerce, a burden is imposed on interstate commerce by the difficulty, if not impossibility, of making the allocation. So far as this argument is based on an interpretation of the statute which the state court has rejected, it may be disregarded. The allocation required is only to employment exclusively in intrastate service not embraced in the Federal Employers' Liability Act (45 USCA  51-59). The state court thought that possible difficulties in making it could be dealt with administratively by rules framed by the state insurance commissioner, acting under authority of the act. In any case, it is not self-evident that the act is unworkable, and there is nothing on the record which would enable us to say that such allocation is either impossible or so difficult as necessarily to impose any burden on interstate commerce. See Interstate Busses Corporation v. Holyoke St. Ry. Co., supra, 273 U. S. page 52, 47 S. Ct. 298.\n There are no findings, and the petitioner asked no ruling with respect to the point. There is no evidence from which it could be inferred that the allocation could not be made or that insurance could not be effected at a cost bearing a fair relation to the intrastate service to which the act applies. The burden was on petitioner, who assailed the statute, to establish its unconstitutionality. O'Gorman & Young, Inc. v. Hartford Fire Insurance Co., \n282 \nU.S. 251\n, 51 S.

LAWYERS' MORTG. CO.(1932)\nNo. 355\nArgued: Decided: March 14, 1932\n\n\n\n\n\n[285 U.S. 182, 183]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Claude R. Branch, of Providence, R. I., for petitioner.\n Mr. Harry W. Forbes, of New York City, for respondent. \n\n[285 U.S. 182, 184]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent voluntarily paid the capital stock tax imposed on domestic corporations by section 1000, Revenue Act of 1921, 42 Stat. 294, for the fiscal years ending June 30 in 1922 and 1923. Thereafter it applied for refund on the ground that it was an insurance company taxable only under section 246, 42 Stat. 262. The claim was denied. It brought this action in the federal court for the Southern district of New York to recover the amount so paid. The parties by written stipulation waived a jury and submitted the case on an agreed statement of facts. The District Court gave judgment for respondent. 34 F.(2d) 504. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 50 F.(2d) 104.\n The question is whether on the admitted facts respondent was an insurance company subject to the tax imposed by section 246 and therefore not taxable under sections 230 and 1000\n\n\n Respondent was incorporated in 1893 under  170(1) of Article 5 of the Insurance Law of New York1 as the 'Lawyers Mortgage Insurance Company' to examine titles, procure and furnish information in relation thereto, and guarantee or insure bonds and mortgages and the owners of real estate against loss by reason of defective titles. In 1903, 'insurance' was dropped from its name. In 1905, its certificate of incorporation was amended to include the making, and guaranty of the correctness, of searches for instruments, liens, and charges affecting real estate and the guaranty of payment of bonds and mortgages. \n2\n In 1913,3 the certificate of incorporation was further amended to include authority to insure payment of notes of individuals and partnerships and bonds and other evidences of indebtedness of corporations, when se- \n\n[285 U.S. 182, 185]\n\u00a0\n cured by real estate mortgages, and to 'invest in, purchase and sell, with such guarantee (of payment) or with guarantee only against loss by reason of defective title or incumbrances, bonds and mortgages, and notes of individuals or partnerships secured by mortgages ... and bonds, notes, debentures and other evidences of indebtedness of solvent corporations secured by deed of trust or mortgages ....' It was subject to supervision by the state superintendent of insurance and to the laws applicable to title and credit guaranty corporations and was required to file with such superintendent statements of its condition at the end of each year.\n Respondent never has insured titles. In the tax years, it carried on business as follows: Upon receiving an application for a loan it caused an appraisal of the proposed real estate security to be made and procured a title insurance company to survey the property, make a report as to title and insure the same. The borrower, having executed and delivered a bond and mortgage to respondent, received from it the amount specified therein less charges for title insurance, survey, disbursements, and recording tax, and less a lending fee which included the charge for appraisal. Respondent sold the mortgage loans. On the sale of a bond and mortgage as a whole, it delivered an assignable contract called 'policy of mortgage guarantee' to the purchaser. On the sale of part of a loan, it issued a participation certificate assignable by indorsement and registration on respondent's books and containing substantially the same provisions as the policy. By every such policy or certificate the purchaser appointed respondent his agent to collect the principal and interest, and the latter agreed to keep the title guaranteed and the premises insured against fire and to require the owner to pay taxes, assessments, water rates, and fire insurance premiums. Respondent guaranteed payment of principal, as and when collected but in any event within 18 months following written demand made after maturity, \n\n[285 U.S. 182, 186]\n\u00a0\n and payment of interest regularly at an agreed rate usually one-half of one per cent. less than that specified in the bond. Respondent kept the difference and called it 'premium.' Respondent also retained the interest accruing between the making of the loans and the sale of the securities. For renewals of loans it charged extension fees.\n It issued some policies of guaranty as to mortgage loans which were not made or sold by it. While substantial in amount, that part of its business constituted but a small percentage of the total. It made no assignment or apportionment of assets to the different parts of its business but used them indiscriminately in its different activities. It kept on hand sufficient bonds and mortgages to maintain the guaranty fund required by the Insurance Law. Corporations organized under the New York banking laws and subject to its banking department are authorized to make loans and sell bonds, mortgages and participations therein with their guaranties under the same general method of doing business as that of respondent. And at least two companies so organized and supervised are carrying on that business.\n Pertinent provisions of the act are printed in the margin. \n4\n The general rule declared by section 1000(a) is broad \n\n[285 U.S. 182, 187]\n\u00a0\n enough to include respondent. But, if it was an insurance company taxable under section 246, it was excepted from the general rule by subsection (b). As such corporations constitute a special class, respondent must be held liable for the capital stock tax unless clearly shown to have been an insurance company within the meaning of the act. Bank of Commerce v. Tennessee, \n161 \nU.S. 134, 146\n, 16 S. Ct. 456; Heiner v. Colonial Trust Co., \n275 \nU.S. 232, 235\n, 48 S. Ct. 65; Choteau v. Burnet, \n283 \nU.S. 691, 696\n, 51 S. Ct. 598. The act does not define 'insurance company' or definitely indicate criteria by which corporations meant to be so specially dealt with may with certainty by identified. General definition is not necessary in order to determine whether, having regard to the purpose of the classification and the considerations on which it probably was made, respondent's business brought it within the special class.\n Under section 230, Revenue Act of 1918, 40 Stat. 1075, insurance companies were taxed as were other business corporations. The applicable Definition of gross income was comprehensive and included gains, profits and income derived from any source whatever. Section 213, p. 1065. It was substantially the same in the 1921 Act. Section 213, 42 Stat. 237. But section 246 of the latter act dealt with certain classes of insurance companies separately and defined \n\n[285 U.S. 182, 188]\n\u00a0\n gross income to be 'investment income,' i. e., interest, dividends and rents, and 'underwriting income,' i. e., premiums earned less losses and expenses. Capital gains and income from other sources were omitted.\n A statement showing respondent's lending fees, extension fees, interest and premiums follows:\n Lending Extension Year Fees Fees Interest Premiums5 1922 $655,283.70 $214,303.56 $372,795.12 $619,986. 38 1923 990,855.37 73,745.71 426,842.31 750,803.21\n While name, charter powers, and subjection to state insurance laws have significance as to the business which a corporation is authorized and intends to carry on, the character of the business actually done in the tax years determines whether it was taxable as an insurance company. United States v. Phellis, \n257 \nU.S. 156, 168\n, 42 S. C.t. 63; Weiss v. Stearn, \n265 \nU.S. 242, 254\n, 44 S. Ct. 490, 33 A.L. R. 520. Evidently that was the basis of the classification. Congress did not intend to exempt from the capital stock tax under section 1000(a) and the income tax under section 230 corporations not doing insurance business even though organized under and subject to state insurance laws.\n The dropping of 'insurance' from respondent's name and the extension of charter powers to the purchase and sale of mortgage loans suggest purpose to carry on an investment rather than an insurance business. Respondent did not consider itself an insurance company taxable under section 246 until after it had twice made and paid capital stock taxes under section 100(a) and income taxes under section 230. The lending of money on real estate security, the sale of bonds and mortgages given by borrowers and use of the money received from purchasers to make addi- \n\n[285 U.S. 182, 189]\n\u00a0\n tional loans similarly secured constituted its principal business. Undoubtedly the guaranties contained in the policies and participation certificates were in legal effect contracts of insurance. Tebbets v. Mercantile Credit Guarantee Co. (C. C. A.) 73 F. 95, 97; Guarantee Co. v. Mechanics' Sav. Bank & Trust Co. (C. C. A.) 80 F. 766, 772; State ex rel. Peach Co. v. Bonding & Surety Co., 279 Mo. 535, 553, 556, 215 S. W. 20; People v.

United States Credit System Co., 92 Wis. 366, 374, 66 N. W. 528, 32 L. R. A. 383, 53 Am. St. Rep. 920; Young v. American Bonding Co., 228 Pa. 373, 380, 77 A. 623. These guaranties furnished purchasers additional security and were calculated to make the loans desirable as investments and readily saleable at a profit.\n The lending fees, extension fees, and accrued interest appertain to the business of lending money rather than to insurance and may not reasonably be attributed to the subordinate element of guaranty in respondent's mortgage loan business. The so-called premiums amount to about one-third of total income, but they cover agency and other services which generally are not performed under contracts of insurance. There is no showing that these amounts do not include profits arising from such sales or that they are justly chargeable or were intended to apply only to the risks covered. Respondent has not established any basis upon which the interest so retained may reasonably be charged or apportioned to the element of insurance involved in such transactions. And the stipulation in respect of policies issued on loans not made by respondent is too vague to be given weight.\n'Premiums' are characteristic of the business of insurance, and the creation of 'investment income' is generally, if not necessarily, essential to it. Section 246 does not cover any other class of income. It is not shown that \n\n[285 U.S. 182, 190]\n\u00a0\n respondent had any investment income within that section. Evidently its guaranties produced less than one-third of its income.\n\n Respondent's business is one which may be and is in fact carried on by corporations organized under the New York banking laws. The element of insurance may not properly be regarded as more than an incident thereof; it certainly is not sufficient to make respondent an 'insurance company' within the meaning of that phrase as it is commonly used and understood. There is no warrant for holding that Congress intended to use the expression in any other sense. Miller v. Robertson, \n266 \nU.S. 243, 250\n, 45 S. Ct. 73; Sacramento Navigation Co. v. Salz, \n273 \nU.S. 326, 329\n, 330 S., 47 S. Ct. 368.\n This case is not, as respondent contends, ruled against the government by United States v. Loan & Bldg. Co., \n278 \nU.S. 55\n, 49 S. Ct. 39. The opinion in that case shows that loan and building associations exempt from taxes under Revenue Acts of 1918 and 1921 are not strictly confined to the raising of funds by subscription of members for the making of advances to members to enable them to build or buy houses of their own, that the outside operations of the association there considered were not so related to mere money making as to constitute a gross abuse of the name and that the receiving of deposits on interest and making of loans to nonmembers did not disqualify it for the exemption.\n In the case before us respondent's charter authority extended not only to the business of insurance but also to other lines including that of investment with or without guaranties as it might choose. As above shown, the element of guaranty involved in its transactions in the tax years was not sufficient to make it an insurance company.\n Judgment reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Laws 1892, c. 690. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Laws 1904, c. 543. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Laws 1913, c. 215.

C., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[286 U.S. 145, 150]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This action for damages was brought in a court of New Hampshire under the employers' liability provisions of the Employers' Liability and Workmen's Compensation Act of that state, N. H. Public Laws 1926, c. 178, to recover for the death of Leon J. Clapper, which the plaintiff claimed was due to his employer's negligence. The case \n\n[286 U.S. 145, 151]\n\u00a0\n was removed to the federal court on the ground of diversity of citizenship; the defendant, Bradford Electric Light Co., Inc., being a citizen and resident of Vermont and the plaintiff, Jennie M. Clapper, administratrix, being a citizen and resident of New Hampshire. It appeared that the company had its principal place of business in Vermont and lines extending into New Hampshire; that Leon Clapper, a resident of Vermont, was employed by it there as a lineman for emergency service in either state; and that, in the course of his duties, he was sent to restore some burned-out fuses at a substation in New Hampshire, and while doing so was killed. The company, invoking the full faith and credit clause of the Federal Constitution (article 4,  1), set up as a special defense that the action was barried by provisions of the Vermont Compensation Act; that the contract of employment had been entered into in Vermont, where both parties to it then, and at all times thereafter resided; and that the Vermont act had been accepted by both employer and employee as a term of the contract.\n The District Court ruled that the action was properly brought under the laws of the state of New Hampshire; that the action was based on a tort occurring in that state; and that the Vermont Workmen's Compensation Act had no extraterritorial effect. Accordingly, that court rejected the special defense and denied a motion to dismiss. The case was tried three times before a jury; the third trial resulting in a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $4,000. The judgment entered thereon was first reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. But upon a rehearing, the judgment of the trial court was affirmed, one judge dissenting. 51 F.(2d) 992, 999. The company filed in this Court both an appeal and a petition for writ of certiorari. The appeal was denied, and certiorari granted. \n284 \nU.S. 221\n, 52 S. Ct. 118. \n\n[286 U.S. 145, 152]\n\u00a0\n The Vermont Workmen's Compensation Act provides that a workman hired within the state shall be entitled to compensation even though the injury was received outside the state, Vermont General Laws, c. 241,  5770; that 'employers who hire workmen within this state to work outside of the state, may agree with such workmen that the remedies under the provisions of this chapter shall be exclusive as regards injuries received outside this state by accident arising out of and in the course of such employment, and all contracts of hiring in this state shall be presumed to include such an agreement,' section 5774; that every contract of employment made within the state shall be presumed to have been made subject to its provisions, unless prior to the accident an express statement to the contrary shall have been made, in writing, by one of the parties, section 5765; and that acceptance of the act is 'a surrender by the parties ... of their rights to any other method, form or amount of compensation or determination thereof,' section 5763. Neither the company nor Leon Clapper filed a statement declining to accept any provision of the Vermont act.\n The New Hampshire Employers' Liability and Workmen's Compensation Act provides that the employer shall become subject to the workmen's compensation provisions of the act only by filing a declaration to that effect, N. H. Public Laws, c. 178,  4; and that, even if the declaration is filed, the employee may, subsequent to the injury, still elect either to claim compensation, section 11, or to sue for damages at common law as modified by the employers' liability provisions of the act. Failure to file such a declaration exposes the employer to a common-law action of negligence in which the defenses of assumption of risk and injury by a fellow servant may not be interposed. Sections 2, 3. The company filed in New Hampshire the declaration provided for by its statute. \n\n[286 U.S. 145, 153]\n\u00a0\n Thus, each state has a workmen's compensation law of the elective type; but their provisions differ sharply. The New Hampshire statute, unlike that of vermont, permits the employee or his representative to elect, after the injury, to sue for damages as at common law; and it was as a result of such an election made by the administratrix that the case at bar arose. The main question for decision is whether the existence of a right of action for Leon Clapper's death should be determined by the laws of Vermont, where both parties to the contract of employment resided and where the contract was made, or by the laws of New Hampshire, where the employee was killed.\n First. It clearly was the purpose of the Vermont act to preclude any recovery by proceedings brought in another state for injuries received in the course of a Vermont employment. The provisions of the act leave no room for construction. \n1\n The statute declares in terms that when a workman is hired within the state, he shall be entitled to compensation thereunder for injuries received outside, as well as inside, the state, unless one of the parties elects to reject the provisions of the act. And it declares further that for injuries wherever received the remedy under the statute shall exclude all other rights and remedies of the employee or his personal representative. If the acci- \n\n[286 U.S. 145, 154]\n\u00a0\n dent had happened in Vermont, the statute plainly would have precluded the bringing of an action for damages in New Hampshire under its Employers' Liability Act. \n2\n For such action is predicated on a tort; and in Vermont an injury resulting from the employer's negligence is not a tort, if the provisions of the Compensation Act have been accepted. The question is whether the fact that the injury occurred in New Hampshire leaves its courts free to subject the employer to liability as for a tort; that is, may the New Hampshire courts disregard the relative rights of the parties as determined by the laws of Vermont where they resided and made the contract of employment; or must they give effect to the Vermont act, and to the agreement implied therefrom, that the only right of the employee against the employer, in case of injury, shall be the claim for compensation provided by the statute?\n Second. If the conflict presented were between the laws of a foreign country and those of New Hampshire, its courts would be free, so far as the restrictions of federal law are concerned, to attach legal consequences to acts done within the state, without reference to the undertaking of the parties, entered into at their common residence abroad, that such consequences should not be enforced between them. But the conflict here is between the laws of two states; and the company, in setting up as a defense a right arising under the Vermont statute, invokes article 4,  1, of the Federal Constitution, which declares that 'full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts ... of every other State.' That a statute \n\n[286 U.S. 145, 155]\n\u00a0\n is a 'public act' within the meaning of that clause is settled. Modern Woodmen of America v. Mixer, \n267 \nU.S. 544, 550\n, 551 S., 45 S. Ct. 389, 41 A. L. R. 1384; AEtna Life Insurance Co. v. Dunken, \n266 \nU.S. 389, 393\n, 45 S. Ct. 129. See Tennessee Coal, Iron & R. Co. v. George, \n233 \nU.S. 354, 360\n, 34 S. Ct. 587, L. R. A. 1916D, 685; Chicago & Alton R. Co. v. Wiggins Ferry Co., \n119 \nU.S. 615, 622\n, 7 S. Ct. 398.3 A federal court sitting in New Hampshire is bound equally with courts of the state to observe the command of the full faith and credit clause, where applicable. \n4\n The precise question for decision is whether that clause is applicable to the situation here presented.\n Third. The administratrix contends that the full faith and credit clause is not applicable. The argument is that to recognize the Vermont act as a defense to the New Hampshire action would be to give to that statute an \n\n[286 U.S. 145, 156]\n\u00a0\n extraterritorial effect, whereas a state's power to legislate is limited to its own territory. It is true that full faith and credit is enjoined by the Constitution only in respect to those public acts which are within the legislative jurisdiction of the enacting state. See National Mutual Building & Loan Association v. Brahan, \n193 \nU.S. 635, 647\n, 24 S. Ct. 532; Olmsted v. Olmsted, \n216 \nU.S. 386, 395\n, 30 S. Ct. 292, 25 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1292.5 But, obviously, the power of Vermont to effect legal consequences by legislation is not limited strictly to occurrences within its boundaries. It has power through its own tribunals to grant compensation to local employees, locally employed, for injuries received outside its borders, compare Quong Ham Wah Co. v. Industrial Accident Commission, \n255 \nU.S. 445\n, 41 S. Ct. 373, dismissing writ of error 184 Cal. 26, 192 P. 1021, 12 A. L. R. 1190; and likewise has power to exclude from its own courts proceedings for any other form of relief for such injuries. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n[286 U.S. 145, 157]\n\u00a0\n The existence of this power is not denied. It is contended only that the rights thus created need not be recognized in an action brought in another state; that a provision which Vermont may validly enforce in its own courts need not be given effect when the same facts are presented for adjudication in New Hampshire.\n The answer is that such recognition in New Hampshire of the rights created by the Vermont act, cannot, in any proper sense, be termed an extraterritorial application of that act. \n7\n Workmen's compensation acts are \n\n[286 U.S. 145, 158]\n\u00a0\n treated, almost universally, as creating a statutory relation between the parties-not, like employer's liability acts, as substituting a statutory tort for a common-law tort. See Cudahy Packing Co. v. Parramore, \n263 \nU.S. 418, 423\n, 44 S. Ct. 153, 30 A. L. R. 532; Mulhall v. Nashua Manufacturing Co., 80 N. H. 194, 197, 115 A. 449; Cameron v Ellis Construction Co., 252 N. Y. 394, 396, 169 N. E. 622; Chandler v. Industrial Commission, 55 Utah 213, 217, 184 P. 1020, 8 A. L. R. 930; Anderson v. Miller Scrap Iron Co., 169 Wis. 106, 113, 117, 118, 170 N. W. 275, 171 N. W. 935. The relation between Leon Clapper and the company was created by the law of Vermont; and as long as that relation persisted its incidents were properly subject to regulation there, for both Clapper and the company were at all times residents of Vermont; the company's principal place of business was located there; the contract of employment was made there; and the employee's duties required him to go into New Hampshire only for temporary and specific purposes, in response to orders given him at the Vermont office. The mere recognition by the courts of one state that parties by their conduct have subjected themselves to certain obligations arising under the law of another state is not to be deemed an extraterritorial application of the law of the state creating the obligation. 8 Com- \n\n[286 U.S. 145, 159]\n\u00a0\n pare Canada Southern Ry. Co. v. Gebhard, \n109 \nU.S. 527, 536\n, 537 S., 3 S. Ct. 363\n\n\n By requiring that, under the circumstances here presented, full faith and credit be given to the public act of Vermont, the Federal Constitution prevents the employee or his representative from asserting in New Hampshire rights which would be denied him in the state of his residence and employment. A vermont court could have enjoined Leon Clapper from suing the company in New Hampshire, to recover damages for an injury suffered there, just as it would have denied him the right to recover such damages in Vermont. Compare Cole v. Cunningham, \n133 \nU.S. 107\n, 10 S. Ct. 269; Reynolds v. Adden, \n136 \nU.S. 348, 353\n, 10 S. Ct. 843. The rights created by the Vermont act are entitled to like protection when set up in New Hampshire by way of defense to the action brought there. If this were not so, and the employee or his representative were free to disregard the law of Vermont and his contract, the effectiveness of the Vermont act would be gravely impaired. For the purpose of that Act, as of the workmen's compensation laws of most other states, is to provide, in respect to persons residing and businesses located in the state, not only for employees a remedy which is both expeditious and independent of proof of fault, but also for employers a liability which is limited and determinate. Compare New York Central R. Co. v. White, \n243 \nU.S. 188\n, 37 S. Ct. 247, L. R. A. 1917D, 1, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 629; Hawkins v. Bleakly, \n243 \nU.S. 210\n, 37 S. Ct. 255, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 637; Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, \n243 \nU.S. 219\n, 37 S. Ct. 260, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 642.\n Fourth. It is urged that the provision of the Vermont statute which forbids resort to common-law remedies for injuries incurred in the course of employment is contrary to the public policy of New Hampshire; that the full faith and credit clause does not require New Hampshire to enforce an act of another state which is obnoxious to its public policy; and that a federal courts sitting in that state may therefore decline to do so. Compare Union \n\n[286 U.S. 145, 160]\n\u00a0\n Trust Co. v. Grosman, \n245 \nU.S. 412\n, 38 S. Ct. 147. It is true that the full faith and credit clause does not require the enforcement of every right conferred by a statute of another state. There is room for some play of conflicting policies. Thus, a plaintiff suing in New Hampshire on a statutory cause of action arising in Vermont might be denied relief because the forum fails to provide a court with jurisdiction of the controversy, see Chambers v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., \n207 \nU.S. 142, 148\n, 149 S., 28 S. Ct. 34; compare Douglas v. New York, New Haven & Hartford R. Co., \n279 \nU.S. 377\n, 49 S. Ct. 355; or because it fails to provide procedure appropriate to its determination, see Tennessee Coal, Iron & R. Co. v. George, \n233 \nU.S. 354, 359\n, 34 S. Ct. 587, L. R. A. 1916D, 685; compare Slater v. Mexican National R. Co., \n194 \nU.S. 120, 128\n, 129 S., 24 S. Ct. 581; or because the enforcement of the right conferred would be bonoxious to the public policy of the forum, compare Bothwell v. Buckbee, Mears Co., \n275 U.S. 274\n, 277-279, 48 S. Ct. 124; Union Trust Co. v. Grosman, \n245 \nU.S. 412\n, 38 S. Ct 147; Bond v. Hume, \n243 \nU.S. 15, 25\n, 37 S. Ct. 366; Converse v. Hamilton, \n224 \nU.S. 243, 260\n, 261 S., 32 S. Ct. 415, Ann. Cas. 1913D, 1292; or because the liability imposed is deemed a penal one, see Galveston, Harrisburg & San Antonio Ry. Co. v. Wallace, \n223 \nU.S. 481, 490\n, 32 S. Ct. 205; compare Stewart v. Baltimore & Ohio R. R., \n168 \nU.S. 445, 448\n, 18 S. Ct. 105. But the company is in a position different from that of a plaintiff who seeks to enforce a cause of action conferred by the laws of another state. The right which it claims should be given effect is set up by way of defense to an asserted liability; and to a defense different considerations apply. Compare Home Insurance Co. v. Dick, \n281 \nU.S. 397, 407\n, 408 S., 50 S. Ct. 338, 74 A. L. R. 701. A state may, on occasion, decline to enforce a foreign cause of action. In so doing, it merely denies a remedy, leaving unimpaired the plaintiff's substantive right, so that he is free to enforce it elsewhere. But to refuse to give effect to a substantive defense under the applicable law of another state, as under the circumstances here presented, subjects the defendant to irremediable liability. This may not be done. Compare Modern Woodmen \n\n[286 U.S. 145, 161]\n\u00a0\n of America v. Mixer, \n267 \nU.S. 544, 550\n, 551 S., 45 S. Ct. 389, 41 A. L. R. 1384; AEtna Life Insurance Co. v. Dunken, \n266 \nU.S. 389\n, 45 S. Ct. 129; Supreme Council of Royal Arcanum v. Green, \n237 \nU.S. 531\n, 35 S. Ct. 724, L. R. A. 1916A, 771; see, also, Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Brown, \n234 \nU.S. 542\n, 34 S. Ct. 955; Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Sowers, \n213 \nU.S. 55, 69\n, 29 S. Ct. 397.\n Moreover, there is no adequate basis for the lower court's conclusion that to deny recovery would be obnoxious to the public policy of New Hampshire. No decision of the state court has been cited indicating that recognition of the Vermont statute would be regarded in New Hampshire as prejudicial to the interests of its citizens. \n9\n In support of the contention that the provision of the Vermont act is contrary to the New Hampshire policy, it is urged that New Hampshire's Compensation Law is unique among workmen's compensation acts, in that it permits the injured employee to elect, subsequent to injury, whether to bring a suit based upon negligence or to avail himself of the remedy provided by the act; and that the Legislature of New Hampshire has steadily refused to withdraw this privilege. \n10\n But the mere fact that the Vermont legislation does not conform to that of New \n\n[286 U.S. 145, 162]\n\u00a0\n Hampshire does not establish that it would be obnoxious to the latter's public policy to give effect to the Vermont statute in cases involving only the rights of residents of that state incident to the relation of employer and employee created there. Northern Pacific R. Co. v. Babcock, \n154 \nU.S. 190, 198\n, 14 S. Ct. 978. Nor does sufficient reason appear why it should be so regarded. The interest of New Hampshire was only casual. Leon Clapper was not a resident there. He was not continuously employed there. So far as appears, he had no dependent there. It is difficult to see how the state's interest would be subserved, under such circumstances, by burdening its courts with this litigation.\n Sixth. The administratrix urges that the company had in fact accepted the provision of the New Hampshire Compensation Act, which reserves to the employee the right to elect to sue for damages as at common law. It was upon this ground, primarily, that the Circuit Court of Appeals based, upon the rehearing, the affirmance of the judgment of the District Court. The circumstances under which the acceptance of the New Hampshire act was filed show that the company did not intend thereby to abandon its rights under the Vermont law in respect to Leon Clapper or other employees similarly situated. It had had occasion to hire in New Hampshire residents of that state for employment there in connection with the operation of its lines in that state. In case of injury of such employees, failure to accept the New Hampshire act would have made the petitioner liable to an action for negligence in which it would have been denied the defenses of assumption of risk and injury by a fellow servant. Jutras v. Amoskeag Manufacturing Co., 84 N. H. 171, 173, 147 A. 753; Levesque v. American Box & Lumber Co., 84 N. H. 543, 153, A. 10. Its acceptance is to be construed as referable only to such New Hampshire em- \n\n[286 U.S. 145, 163]\n\u00a0\n ployees, and not as bringing under the New Hampshire act employees not otherwise subject to it.\n We are of opinion that the rights as between the company and Leon Clapper or his representative are to be determined according to the Vermont act. The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals must accordingly be reversed. We have no occasion to consider whether, if the injured employee had been a resident of New Hampshire, or had been continuously employed there, or had left dependents there, recovery might validly have been permitted under New Hampshire law.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE (concurring).\n I agree that, in the circumstances of the present case, the courts of New Hampshire, in giving effect to the public policy of that state, would be at liberty to apply the Vermont statute and thus, by comity, make it the applicable law of New Hampshire. In the absence of any controlling decision of the New Hampshire courts, I assume, as does the opinion of the court, that they would do so, and that what they would do we should do. Hence it seems unnecessary to decide whether that result could be compelled, against the will of New Hampshire, by the superior force of the full faith and credit clause.\n If decision of that question could not be avoided, I should hesitate to say that the Constitution projects the authority of the Vermont statute across state lines into New Hampshire, so that the New Hampshire courts, in fixing the liability of the employer for a tortious act committed within the state, are compelled to apply Vermont law instead of their own. The full faith and credit clause \n\n[286 U.S. 145, 164]\n\u00a0\n has not hitherto been though to do more than compel recognition, outside the state, of the operation and effect of its laws upon persons and events within it. Bonaparte v. Appeal Tax Court, \n104 U.S. 592\n; Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad Co. v. Sowers, \n213 U.S. 55\n, 29, S. Ct. 397; Olmsted v. Olmsted, \n216 \nU.S. 386\n, 30 S. Ct. 292, 25 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1292; Tennessee Coal, Iron & R. R. Co. v. George, \n233 \nU.S. 354\n, 34 S. Ct. 587, L. R. A. 1916D, 685; Hood v. McGehee, \n237 \nU.S. 611\n, 35 S. Ct. 718; see Union Trust Co. v. Grosman, \n245 \nU.S. 412, 415\n, 416 S., 38 S. Ct. 147; Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Brown, \n234 \nU.S. 542, 547\n, 34 S. Ct. 955.\n It is true that in this case the status of employer and employee, terminable at will, was created by Vermont laws operating upon them while they were within that state. I assume that the fact of its creation there must be recognized elsewhere, whenever material. But I am not prepared to say that that status, voluntarily continued by employer and employee, and given a locus in New Hampshire by their presence within the state, may not be regulated there according to New Hamshire law, or that the legal consequences of acts of the employer or employee there, which grow out of or affect the status in New Hampshire, must, be mandate of the Constitution, be either defined or controlled, in the New Hampshire courts, by the laws of Vermont rather than of New Hampshire.\n The interest which New Hampshire has, in exercising that control, derived from the presence of employer and employee within its borders, and the commission of the tortious act there, is at least as valid as that of Vermont, derived from the fact that the status is that of its citizens, and originated when they were in Vermont, before going to New Hampshire. I can find nothing in the history of the full faith and credit clause, or the decisions under it, which lends support to the view that it compels any state to subordinate its domestic policy, with respect to persons and their acts within its borders, to the laws of any other. On the contrary, I think it should be interpreted as leaving the courts of New Hampshire free, in \n\n[286 U.S. 145, 165]\n\u00a0\n the circumstances now presented, either to apply or refuse to apply the law of Vermont, in accordance with their own interpretation of New Hampshire policy and law. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Right to Compensation Exclusive.

The trial court held both vessels at fault, and determined that the damages to each should be equally apportioned between the owners. A Special Commissioner was appointed to ascertain the damages and report. \n\n[287 U.S. 170, 173]\n\u00a0\n The controversy hinges upon an item of demurrage. As to the repair bills ($26,114.57 for the Integrity and $2,230 for the Raritan), as well as some other items, the parties are now at one. The conflict between them, once waged along a wider front, has narrowed to a single point. The District Court, confirming the Commissioner's report, allowed demurrage to the petitioner at the rate of $150 a day, the market hire of another tug, during the seventy-eight days when the Integrity was withdrawn for repairs. This item ($11,700) the Circuit Court of Appeals excluded. 54 F.(2d) 978. A writ of certiorari has brought the case here.\n The petitioner was in the business of towing car floats for railroads between points in New York harbor. It did not use its boats for hire generally. Its business was sufficient to occupy three tugs during regular working hours in the transfer of railroad cars from one point to another. When the Integrity was laid up, the petitioner did not hire an extra tug as a substitute for the one disabled. Instead, it used its two other tugs overtime, and thus kept down the cost while doing business as before. The same crews were employed; but if extra wages were paid, the amount has not been proved. Extra wear and tear there may have been; but there is nothing in the record to indicate how much. Indeed, the witness for the petitioner frankly stated that the loss, if any, from that cause was too uncertain to be measured. The award for demurrage allowed by the District Court and disallowed by the Court of Appeals was not made upon the basis of depreciation of the boats in use. It is measured by expenses that in fact never were incurred, but that might have been incurred and charged to the respondent if the necessities of the business had been something other than they were.\n Our decision may not overleap the limitations of the record. To dispose of the case before us we do not need to hold that through the use of the other vessels the pos- \n\n[287 U.S. 170, 174]\n\u00a0\n sibility of all demurrage has been excluded by an inexorable rule of law. Other courts have held in situations not dissimilar that demurrage may be measured by the interest on the capital value tied up in the disabled boat during the term of disability and thus unfruitfully employed. The Susquehanna, (1926) A.C. 655, 363, 664. Cf. The Greta Holme, (1897) A.C. 596. To approve or disapprove that measure is unnecessary here, for the record does not contain the figures that would enable us to apply it. Even now the petitioner is not seeking for a judgment upon that basis, nor indeed upon any other basis than the one adopted at the trial. The question narrows itself to this, whether the full-time hire of an extra boat must be charged to the respondent as damage flowing from the collision when there was no need of such a boat to keep the business going, and none in fact was used or paid for. Is an award upon that basis either erroneous in law or extravagant in fact?\n Erroneous and extravagant we think it must be held to be. The Conqueror, \n166 \nU.S. 110, 125\n, 134 S., 17 S.Ct. 510; The Susquehanna, supra; cf. The North Star (C.C.A.) 151 F. 168; The Wolsum (C. C.A.) 14 F.(2d) 371); Cuyamel Fruit Co. v. Nedland (C.C.A.) 19 F.(2d) 489; Newtown Creek Towing Co. v. City of New York (C.C.A.) 23 F.(2d) 486; The Glendola (C.C.A.) 47 F.(2d) 206. The disability of a vessel will not sustain demurrage at the rate of the value of her hire unless an award at such a rate can be seen to be reasonable when the disability is viewed in the setting of the circumstances. The Conqueror, supra. Only when thus enlightened can we choose the yardstick most nicely adjusted to be a measure of reparation, in some instances, no doubt, the hire of another vessel, in other instances, it may be, a return upon the idle capital (The Susquehanna, supra), in others something else. Only then indeed can we know whether the interference with profit or enjoyment is to be ranked \n\n[287 U.S. 170, 175]\n\u00a0\n as substance or as shadow. The vessel may have been employed in a business of such a nature that for the avoidance of loss there is need of the employment of a substitute. In such circumstances the fair value of the hire may be an element of damage, and this whether the substitute is actually procured or not. Cf. The Lagonda (D.C.) 44 F. 367; The Mediana, ( 1900) A.C. 113; Perkins v. Brown, 132 Tenn. 294, 177 S.W. 1158, L.R.A. 1915F, 723, Ann. Cas. 1917A, 124; Cook v. Packard Motor Car Co., 88 Conn. 590, 92 A. 413, L.R.A. 1915C, 319. The vessel may be a yacht, employed for pleasure and not for business. Even then, in the judgment of many courts, the value of the use may be considered by the triers of the facts in fixing the recovery if there has been a substantial impairment of that enjoyment for which such vessels are maintained. The Lagonda, supra; Cook v. Packard Motor Car Co., supra; Banta v. Stamford Motor Co., 89 Conn. 51, 56, 92 A. 665; Perkins v. Brown, supra; Hunt Co. v. Boston Elevated R. Co., 199 Mass. 220, 235, 236, 85 N.E. 446; The Astrakhan, (1910) P. 172, 181. There are statements in The Conqueror (page 133 of 166 U.S., 17 S.Ct. 519) that may be in conflict with that view, but they were not essential to the judgment (page 134 of 166 U.S., 17 S.Ct. 519), and in the light of later decisions as to the loss of pleasure vehicles are unquestionably in opposition to a strong current of authority. See cases, supra. The owner of the Conqueror would not have let his yacht to any one if there had been no occasion to repair her, nor during the season that she was out of service would he have used her for himself. The Conqueror, 166 U.S. at page 134, 17 S.Ct. 510. There was neither interference with profit nor substantial disturbance of enjoyment. The court did not hold that even then there could be no recovery whatever. Cf. Cook v. Packard Motor Car Co., supra, at page 596 of 88 Conn., 92 A. 413. It held that recovery was excessive when based on the returns of an imaginary letting. We are to have regard in every case to the reasonable probabilities of time \n\n[287 U.S. 170, 176]\n\u00a0\n and place and circumstance. Demurrage on the basis of the cost of a substitute, actual or supposititious, may be no more than fair indemnity when gains have been lost or enjoyment seriously disturbed. Demurrage on a like basis may be so extravagant as to outrun the bounds of reason when loss of profit has been avoided without the hire of a substitute and the disturbance of enjoyment has been slight or perhaps fanciful. The Conqueror, supra. Cf. Cook v. Packard Motor Car Co., supra, page 595 of 88 Conn., 92 A. 413; The Susquehanna, (1925) P. 196, 207, affirmed (1926) A.C. 655. A wide range of judgment is conceded to the triers of the facts in the choice of the standard to be applied and in the method of applying it. Cook v. Packard Motor Car Co., supra. The choice, however, may not be arbitrary, nor is the range of judgment without limit. We think that on the face of this award there is declared a principle of assessment that in the setting of the circumstances exceeds the bounds of any discretion allowed to the assessors. In admiralty an appeal to the Court of Appeals is deemed to be a trial de novo. Munson Steamship Line v. Miramar Steamship Co. (C.C.A.) 167 F. 960; Gilchrist v. Chicago Ins. Co. (C.C.A.) 104 F. 566, 571; cf. The Abbotsford, \n98 U.S. 440\n; Watts, W. & Co. v. Unione Austriaca di Navigazione, \n248 \nU.S. 9, 21\n, 39 S.Ct. 1, 3 A.L.R. 323; Standard Oil Co. v. So. Pacific Co., \n268 \nU.S. 146, 155\n, 45 S.Ct. 465. An assessment of damages may be corrected if erroneous in point of law, but also it may be corrected if extravagant in fact.\n The doctrine of the 'spare boat' cases is invoked by the petitioner as decisive in its favor, but we think without avail. Shipowners at times maintain an extra or spare boat which is kept in reserve for the purpose of being utilized as a substitute in the contingency of damage to other vessels of the fleet. There are decisions to the effect that in such conditions the value of the use of a boat thus specially reserved may be part of the demur- \n\n[287 U.S. 170, 177]\n\u00a0\n rage. The Cayuga, 7 Blatch, 385, Fed. Cas. No. 2,537, affirmed 14 Wall. 270, 278; The Favorita, 8 Blatch. 539, Fed. Cas. No. 4,695, affirmed 18 Wall. 598, 603; New Haven Steam-Boat Co. v. The Mayor (D.C.) 36 F. 716, 718; The Emma Kate Ross (C.C.A.) 50 F. 845; The Providence (C.C.A.) 98 F. 133. If no such boat had been maintained, another might have been hired, and the hire charged as an expense. The result is all one whether the substitute is acquired before the event or after. The same doctrine has been recognized in the English courts, where a boat thus held in reserve is known as a standby. The Mediana, (1900) A.C. 113. In those courts, however, as in our own, there has been a refusal to extend the doctrine to boats acquired and maintained for the general uses of the business. Just such a state of facts was considered by the House of Lords in The Susquehanna, supra, a case hardly to be distinguished from the one at hand. In the speech by Lord Summer we are told that 'the Admiralty by prompt effort and economy in consumption, acting in accordance with their obligation to minimize the damages, managed to get through their work' without the disabled vessel. 'They cannot,' he continued (page 663 of (1926) A.C.), 'get damages based on the use of a standby when in fact they did very well without one.'\n So here. The petitioner was engaged in an established business using tugs for a single purpose. It had no thought to turn that business into one of a different kind while this tug was out of service. Mindful of the need to minimize the damages, it used to the full its available resources, and was able by special effort to make them do the work. We are unable to accept the argument that the expenses which it saved are to be charged to the respondent as if they had not been saved at all.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals which modified the judgment of the District Court is accordingly.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","29":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBURNET v. CHICAGO PORTRAIT CO.(1932)\nNo. 378\nArgued: Decided: February 23, 1932\n\n\n\n\n[285 U.S. 1, 2]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. G. A. Youngquist, Asst. Atty. Gen., for petitioner.\n\n\n[285 U.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Arnold R. Baar, of Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\n\n\n[285 U.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This proceeding was brought for the redetermination of a deficiency in income tax for the year 1923. The respondent, Chicago Portrait Company, is an Illinois corporation with its principal place of business at Chicago. It owned 51 per cent. of the capital stock of the International Art Company of Sydney, Australia, a foreign corporation. Respondent received dividends from the International Art Company and sought credit for a proportionate part of the income taxes paid by that corporation to the Commonwealth of Australia, to the State of New South Wales, and to the Dominion of New Zealand. Section 238(e) of the Revenue Act of 1921 (42 Stat. 227, 258, 259) permitted credit in the case of such taxes paid 'to any foreign country.' Credit was allowed on account of the income taxes paid to the Commonwealth of Australia and to the Dominion of New Zealand but was refused as to those paid to the State of New South Wales. The Board of Tax Appeals held that the respondent was entitled to the credit with respect to the last mentioned taxes also, and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that decision. 16 B. T. A. 1129; 50 F.(2d) 683. This Court granted a writ of certiorari, \n284 \nU.S. 607\n, 52 S. Ct. 36, 76 L. Ed . -.\n The sole question is whether New South Wales is a 'foreign country' within the meaning of the applicable statute. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[285 U.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n The word 'country,' in the expression 'foreign country,' is ambiguous. It may be taken to mean foreign territory or a foreign government. In the sense of territory, it may embrace all the territory subject to a foreign sovereign power. When referring more particularly to a foreign government, it may describe a foreign state in the international sense, that is, one that has the status of an international person with the rights and responsibilities under international law of a member of the family of nations2; or it may mean a foreign government which has authority over a particular area or subject-matter, although not an international person but only a component part, or a political subdivision, of the larger \n\n[285 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n international unit. \n3\n The term 'foreign country' is not a technical or artificial one, and the sense in which it is used in a statute must be determined by reference to the purpose of the particular legislation. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n In the case of tariff acts, this Court said in Stairs v. Peaslee, 18 How. 521, 526, that the word 'country' has always been construed 'to embrace all the possessions of a foreign State however widely separated, which are subject to the same supreme executive and legislative control.' See, also, United States v. The Recorder, Fed. Cas. No. 16,129, 1 Blatchf. 218, 225-227; Campbell v. Barney, Fed. Cas. No. 2, 354, 5 Blatchf. 221. Accordingly, in construing the Act of March 3, 1851 ( 9 Stat. 629, 630), providing that imported merchandise should be appraised at its market value at 'the principal markets of the country' from which it had been imported, the Court held that a commodity shipped from Halifax, Nova Scotia, should be appraised according to the value in the principal markets under the British rule, and these were found, in fact, to be London and Liverpool. After the ratification of the Treaty of Peace between the United States and Spain (30 Stat. 1754), Porto Rico and the Philippines ceased to be 'foreign country' under the tariff laws. De Lima V. Bidwell, \n182 \nU.S. 1\n, 21 S. Ct. 743; In re Fourteen Diamond Rings, \n183 \nU.S. 176, 179\n, 22 S. Ct. 59. It followed that the term 'other countries' in the Commercial Convention with Cuba of 1903 (33 Stat. 2136, 2140) did not include the Philippine Islands. Faber v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 649, 658\n, 31 S. Ct. 659. Under the provisions of the Platt Amendment (31 Stat. 897), and the Constitution of Cuba, the Isle of Pines was de facto under the jurisdiction of Cuba and hence remained 'foreign country' within the meaning of the Tariff Act of 1897 (30 Stat. 151). Pearcy v. Stranahan, \n205 \nU.S. 257, 265\n, 27 S. Ct. 545. \n\n[285 U.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n In construing legislation providing for the deportation of aliens 'to the country whence they came,' the place of emigration affords the dominant consideration. Thus, under the Immigration Act of 1917 (39 Stat. 874, 890 (8 USCA  156)) the court held that an alien emigrating from Grodno, then a part of Russia, was properly deported to Poland, because at that time Grodno was a part of Poland. 'The term 'country,\" said the court, was used in the statute 'to designate, in general terms, the state which, at the time of deportation, includes the place from which the alien came.' Mesevich v. Tod, \n264 \nU.S. 134, 136\n, 137 S., 44 S. Ct. 282, 283. The evident purpose of the statute determined the significance to be attached to the expression.\n In the instant case, the question is one of credit for income taxes 'paid to any foreign country.' The word 'country' is manifestly used in the sense of government. And to decide what government fits the description, whether only that of a foreign power which may be considered an international person, or that of a political entity which, although not an international person, levies and collects income taxes which may be the subject of the intended credit, it is necessary to consider the object of the enactment and to construe the expression 'foreign country' so as to achieve, and not defeat, its aim. We think that the purpose of the statute is clear. The fact that the provision is for a credit to the domestic corporation, against income taxes payable here, of income taxes 'paid during the same taxable year to any foreign country,' itself demonstrates that the primary design of the provision was to mitigate the evil of double taxation. Cognate provisions in the case of individuals disclose a similar intent. Section 222(a)5 of the same Revenue \n\n[285 U.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n Act (1921) provides that the income tax, in the case of a citizen of the United States, should be credited with the amount of any income taxes 'paid during the taxable year to any foreign country or to any possession of the United States.' In the case of an alien resident of the United States, the credit is conditioned upon reciprocal treatment. The resident alien is to be credited with 'the amount of any such taxes paid during the taxable year to any foreign country, if the foreign country of which such alien resident is a citizen or subject, in imposing such taxes, allows a similar credit to citizens of the United States residing in such country.' 42 Stat. 249.6 \n\n[285 U.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n In the case of domestic corporations, the purpose is also disclosed to facilitate their foreign enterprises. The provision of section 238(e) of the Revenue Act of 1921 indicates appreciation of the practical exigencies which lead to the foreign incorporation of subsidiaries for the extension by domestic corporations of their business abroad. This clearly appears to be the reason for the allowance by that act of a credit to a domestic corporation, against its income tax here upon dividends received from its foreign subsidiary, of a proportionate part, as defined, of the income taxes paid by that subsidiary to 'any foreign country.' \n7\n The same provision applies to subsidiaries with \n\n[285 U.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n respect to income taxes paid 'to any possession of the United States.'\n In effectuating these purposes, it is manifest that the controlling consideration was the fact that the income tax was paid to a foreign government competent to lay the tax, and not the international status of that government. The burden upon the domestic corporation was the same whether the foreign government had international standing or was a lesser political entity which nevertheless had authority to impose the exaction upon the corporation or its subsidiary. And if credit was to be allowed here by reason of the payment of the income tax abroad, it made no difference to the Government of the United States whether the payment abroad was made to the one sort of foreign government or the other. The reasons underlying the allowance of the credit were applicable in either case.\n An examination of the provisions of earlier income tax acts in which the expression 'foreign country' is found, does not support, but rather negatives, the conclusion that the term was used in the restricted sense for which the petitioner contends. In the Corporation Tax Act of \n\n[285 U.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n 1909 (36 Stat. 113) deduction from gross income was allowed to the corporation for all sums paid by it within the year for taxes 'imposed by the government of any foreign country as a condition to carrying on business therein.' That corporation tax was an excise on the privilege of doing business in a corporate capacity. The provision with respect to taxes laid by a foreign government manifestly referred to that government which, as the statute said, imposed a privilege tax. There was no suggestion that the foreign government laying the tax must have an international status; it was enough that it had authority to require the payment 'as a condition to carrying on business.' In the Income Tax Act of 1913, paragraph G(b) (38 Stat. 173) deduction was allowed, in computing net income of a corporation, of 'all sums paid by it within the year for taxes imposed under the authority of the United States or of any State or Territory thereof, or imposed by the Government of any foreign country.' The Income Tax Act of 1916,  5(a), 6(a) and 12(a) (39 Stat. 759, 760, 767, 769), provided for deduction from gross income of 'Taxes paid within the year imposed by the authority of the United States, or its Territories, or possessions, or any foreign country, or under the authority of any State, county, school district, or municipality, or other taxing subdivision of any State, not including those assessed against local benefits.' The Income Tax Amendments of 1917,  1201(1), 1207(1) (40 Stat. 330, 334, 335) continued the provisions for deductions as to taxes imposed 'by the authority' of 'any foreign country' in obviously the same sense. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n[285 U.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n There appears to be no room for the conclusion that, under these acts, the deductions for taxes paid abroad were available only if paid to a foreign government that had an international standing, and not if paid to a foreign government which although not having that standing was still authorized to exact the taxes. The criterion was the fact that the tax was imposed by the authority of a foreign country and not the international status of the particular government to which it was paid. We have not been referred to any opposing administrative construction of these acts. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n The Revenue Act of 1918, with its provisions for credits, against income taxes laid here, of taxes paid 'to any foreign country, upon income derived from sources therein' (sections 222(a), 238(a); 40 Stat. 1073, 1080)10 was \n\n[285 U.S. 1, 13]\n\u00a0\n enacted with this background and we find no basis whatever for the conclusion that the term 'foreign country' was used in that statute in any different sense. In the Act of 1918, the provisions for deductions of taxes from gross income, in computing net income, by citizens or residents, and by domestic corporations, of taxes paid to a foreign country, were continued as in the prior acts, save that there was excepted from these deductions the amount of the credits now allowed to citizens and residents under section 222 and to domestic corporations under section 238 (40 Stat. 1067).11 In these provisions for deductions, the expres- \n\n[285 U.S. 1, 14]\n\u00a0\n sion 'foreign country' undoubtedly had the same meaning that it had in the prior income tax acts. \n12\n It will be observed that taxes paid to the states of the Union, or to their political subdivisions, were deductible from gross income. \n13\n But in the provisions introduced in the act of 1918 for credits against income taxes, such taxes paid to the states of the Union, and to their political subdivisions, were not included. \n14\n This fact does not affect the present question, for credits were allowed in the case of income taxes paid to foreign countries, and the provision as to such countries was the same in the section relating to credits as in that with respect to deductions. The slight difference in phraseology in sections 222 and 238 as to credits for taxes paid 'to any foreign country,' instead of taxes imposed 'by the authority of any foreign country,' as in sections 214(a) and 234(a)15 is not important. As the context plainly shows, both phrases were intended to convey the same meaning. Thus section 234(a)(3)(d) provides for deduction, in computing the net income of \n\n[285 U.S. 1, 15]\n\u00a0\n a domestic corporation, of the taxes imposed 'by the authority of any foreign country, except the amount of income, war-profits and excess- profits taxes allowed as a credit under section 238.' The distinction made with respect to income taxes paid to the states of the Union, and to their political subdivisions, between deductions from gross income and credits against taxes, simply reflected the economic policy adopted in making allowances for taxes paid within the borders of continental United States and the organized territories. In relation to income taxes paid outside these borders, the provision as to credits was enacted to give greater and not less relief. Not only was the same expression as to foreign countries used in the section as to credits against income taxes as had been employed, and was still continued, as to deductions from gross income, but that the reference was not to a government having an international status was indicated by the provision for similar credits in cases of income taxes paid to 'any possession of the United States.' \n16\n And that the dominant thought in the mind of the Congress was to allow a credit for income taxes paid in any foreign country, whenever imposed by the authority of a foreign government, is shown in the reports, above cited, of the committees in connection with the Revenue Bill of 1918.17\n No change, or qualification, was made in the use of the term 'foreign country' in the Revenue Act of 1921,18 and we think it must be regarded as having the same significance as it unquestionably had through the series of the prior income tax acts to which we have referred. The same controlling purpose is manifest, and the credit provision, here in question, in relation to taxable dividends \n\n[285 U.S. 1, 16]\n\u00a0\n from foreign subsidiaries of domestic corporations was introduced not to narrow that purpose but to carry it out more effectively. \n19\n\u00a0\n\n The present controversy has arisen under the Treasury Regulations adopted with respect to the Revenue Acts of 1918 and 1921 as to credits. \n20\n The familiar principle is invoked that great weight is attached to the construction consistently given to a statute by the executive department charged with its administration. United States v. Jackson, \n280 \nU.S. 183, 193\n, 50 S. Ct. 143. But the qualification of that principle is as well established as the principle itself. The court is not bound by an administrative construction, and if that construction is not uniform and consistent, it will be taken into account only to the extent that it is supported by valid reasons. United States v. Missouri Pacific R. R. Co., \n278 \nU.S. 269, 280\n, 49 S. Ct. 133. See, also, United States v. Dickson, 15 Pet. 141, 161; United States v. Healey, \n160 \nU.S. 136, 145\n, 16 S. Ct. 247; Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry. Co. v. McCaull-Dinsmore Co., \n253 \nU.S. 97, 99\n, 40 S. Ct. 504. Moreover, ambiguous regulations are of little value in resolving statutory ambiguities. In the 'Preliminary Edition' of Treasury Regulations No. 45 under the act of 1918, Article 382 relating to credits stated: \"Foreign country' means any governmental authority, not that of the United States or any part or possession thereof, having power to impose such taxes, and it therefore includes a self-governing colony, such as the Dominion of Canada.' But this provision was shortly superseded in the amended Regulations No. 45, promulgated \n\n[285 U.S. 1, 17]\n\u00a0\n April 17, 1919, by a new Article 382 containing the following: \"Foreign country' includes within its meaning any foreign sovereign state or self- governing colony (for example, the Dominion of Canada), but does not include a foreign municipality (for example, Montreal) unless itself a sovereign State (for example, Hamburg). 'Any possession of the United States' includes, among others, Porto Rico, the Philippines and the Virgin Islands.' The Department thus sought to introduce a qualification as to the significance of 'foreign country' not found in the words of the statute, or in those of the preceding income tax acts, or in departmental regulations under them, and one that was inconsistent with the apparent purpose of the enactment. It was a qualification which not only did not conform to the view that the expression 'foreign country' was limited to a foreign state having the status of an international person under international law, but, on the other hand, afforded no definite criterion. Its phrase 'self-governing colony' had no certain application, as there are colonies with varying degrees of self-government, and if, in view of the aim of the statute, it was important to draw a distinction with respect to self-government, it would appear that the particular phase of autonomy that was relevant to the purpose of the statute was the competency to impose income taxes upon the domestic corporation, or its foreign subsidiary, with respect to which the relief was granted. It is true that certain foreign political divisions which formerly had not had an international status were achieving it, but even that progress, at the time of the adoption of the regulation in 1919,21 was still uncertain both as to the quality and extent of the international recognition which would be accorded, and, however im- \n\n[285 U.S. 1, 18]\n\u00a0\n portant in other relations that progress might be, it was not the concern of this statute and its operation cannot be deemed to depend upon it. The departmental regulation became the more ambiguous as it proceeded with its illustrations relating to municipalities.\n By section 216(e) of the Revenue Act of 1918 (40 Stat. 1069), a nonresident alien individual was allowed credits for personal exemptions and for dependents if the 'country' of which he was a citizen or subject allowed a similar credit to citizens of the United States not residing in 'such country.' Article 307 of Regulations No. 45 gave a list of 'countries' which satisfied the credit requirements of this provision. This list was amended in later editions of these regulations, applicable to the Revenue Act of 1918, and embraced a great variety of 'countries,' including, for example, British Honduras, Ceylon, Cyprus, Fiji Islands, Gibraltar, Gold Coast, Malay States, Mauritius, St. Kitt-Nevis, etc. \n22\n As already noted, the expression 'foreign \n\n[285 U.S. 1, 19]\n\u00a0\n country' was used in section 222(a)(3) of the Revenue Act of 1918 in relation to credits allowed to an alien resident of the United States for taxes upon income derived from sources in such 'country,' if the latter allowed a similar credit to citizens of the United States. \n23\n Article 385 of Regulations No. 45, set forth the list of 'countries' which did or did not satisfy this reciprocal credit requirement. This Article further illustrates the ambiguity of the regulations. \n24\n\u00a0\n\n[285 U.S. 1, 20]\n\u00a0\n It is urged that the Revenue Act of 1921 must be deemed to have been adopted with the meaning attributed to the term 'foreign country' by the regulations under the act of 1918. But regulations of such an ambiguous character supplying no definite criterion cannot be deemed to determine satisfactorily the interpretation \n\n[285 U.S. 1, 21]\n\u00a0\n of the statute. The Revenue Act of 1918 had continued the expression 'foreign country' precisely as it had been used in the preceding income tax acts without any such restricting gloss, and the act of 1921 continued the expression as used in the act of 1918. In these circumstances, we are of the opinion that the expression 'foreign country' in the act of 1921 should be deemed to have the same significance in that act that it had in the prior acts and was not limited by the regulations adopted under the act of 1918. The regulations under the act of 1921 were of the same equivocal sort as those to which we have referred under the act of 1918, and can be deemed to have no greater effect. \n25\n The decisions of the Treasury Department26 applying these regulations have no more force than the reasons given to sustain them and these, in our opinion, furnish no adequate ground for denying effect to the credit provisions of the statute in accordance with their manifest purpose.\n In this view, we find it unnecessary to consider the arguments that have been adduced with respect to the status of New Sourth Wales in its relation to the Commonwealth of Australia. There is no question that New South Wales levied the income taxes for which credit is sought and that its government had adequate authority to impose them.\n We conclude that the Board of Tax Appeals and the Circuit Court of Appeals were right in holding that these income taxes fell within the statutory provision as to credits, and the judgment is affirmed.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The provisions of section 238(a) and (e) of the Revenue Act of 1921 are as follows:\n'Sec. 238(a) That in the case of a domestic corporation the tax imposed by this title, plus the warprofits and excess-profits taxes, if any, shall be credited with the amount of any income, war-profits, and excess-profits taxes paid during the same taxable year to any foreign country, or to any possession of the United States: Provided, That the amount of credit taken under this subdivision shall in no case exceed the same proportion of the taxes, against which such credit is taken, which the taxpayer's net income (computed without deduction for any income, war- profits, and excess-profits taxes imposed by any foreign country or possession of the United States) from sources without the United States bears to its entire net income (computed without such deduction) for the same taxable year. ...\n\n'(e) For the purposes of this section a domestic corporation which owns a majority of the voting stock of a foreign corporation from which it receives dividends (not deductible under section 234) in any taxable year shall be deemed to have paid the same proportion of any income, war- profits, or excess-profits taxes paid by such foreign corporation to any foreign country or to any possession of the United States, upon or with respect to the accumulated profits of such foreign corporation from which such dividends were paid, which the amount of such dividends bears to the amount of such accumulated profits: Provided, That the credit allowed to any domestic corporation under this subdivision shall in no case exceed the same proportion of the taxes against which it is credited, which the amount of such dividends bears to the amount of the entire net income of the domestic corporation in which such dividends are included.

R. Rep. No. 767, 65th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 11), said: 'Under existing law a citizen of the United States can only deduct income war or excess profits taxes paid to a foreign country from gross income in computing net income. With the corresponding high rates imposed by certain foreign countries the taxes levied in such countries in addition to the taxes levied in the United States upon citizens of the United States place a very severe burden upon such citizens. The bill provides that a credit against the income tax imposed in the United States be allowed a citizen of the United States subject to income and war or excess profits taxes in a foreign country of an amount equal to the tax paid in such country upon income that is received from sources within such country. The bill further provides that, in the case of an alien resident of the United States who is a citizen or subject of a country which imposes income, war profits, or excess profits taxes, a like credit shall be allowed if such country allows a similar credit to citizens of the United States resident in such country.'\n The Conference Report on the Revenue Bill of 1918 (H. R. Rep. No. 1037, 65th Cong., 3d Sess., p. 53), contains the following statement: 'Amendment No. 118: The House bill provided that a citizen of the United States might credit against his income tax the amount of any income, war- profits, and excess-profits taxes paid to any foreign country, Porto Rico, or the Philippine Islands, upon income derived from sources therein, and allowed a similar credit to an alien resident if his country makes reciprocal provisions. The Senate amendment entirely rewrites the section and broadens it to include a credit for taxes paid to any possession of the United States, which is also to be given to an alien resident of the United States. The House recedes with an amendment providing that if any deduction is allowed for taxes accrued in any possession or foreign country, the commissioner may require the taxpayer to give a surety bond providing for the payment of any tax found to be due the Government in case too great a deduction shall be allowed for accrued taxes in our possessions or any foreign country. ...' \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] In the Report of the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives in relation to the Revenue Bill of 1921 (H. R. Rep. No. 350, 67th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 8), the following statement was made with respect to American concerns doing business in foreign countries: 'Under existing law an American citizen or domestic corporation is taxed upon his or its entire income even though all of it is derived from business transacted without the United States. This results in double taxation, places American business concerns at a serious disadvantage in the competitive struggle for foreign trade, and encourages American corporations doing business in foreign countries to surrender their American charters and incorporate under the laws of foreign countries.' While this statement was made to introduce a remedial proposal, which was not adopted, it discloses the purpose entertained. See, also, Report of Committee of Finance of the Senate (Sen. Rep. No. 275, 67th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 9).\n The Conference Report on the Revenue Bill of 1921 (H. R. Rep. 486, 67th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 38), contains the following: 'Amendment No. 436: The House bill provided for the exclusion from income of all dividends received from a corporation. Senate amendments agreed to by the conferees having provided for the inclusion in gross income of certain dividends received from a foreign corporation, Senate amendment No. 436 provides, under proper safeguards, for the credit by a domestic corporation of taxes paid by its subsidiary foreign corporation with respect to the income or profits of the foreign corporation paid as taxable dividends to the domestic corporation; and the House recedes.' \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] These provisions in the Act of 1917 read: 'Taxes paid within the year imposed by the authority of the United States (except income and excess profits taxes), or of its Territories, or possessions, or any foreign country, or by the authority of any State, county, school district, or municipality, or other taxing subdivision of any State, not including those assessed against local benefits.' \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] On the contrary, Treasury Regulations No. 33, Revised (issued in January, 1918, applicable to the Income Tax Acts of 1916 and 1917), had the following provision in Article 8 with respect to the deductions allowed to citizens and resident aliens for taxes paid abroad: 'Taxes: State or any political subdivision thereof, Federal or foreign (except income and excess profits taxes paid to the United States), and not including taxes assessed against local benefits.'\n The provision of these regulations as to the taxes deductible in cases of corporations, had the same import.\n This provision was as follows: 'Art. 191. Taxes deductible.-Taxes imposed against a corporation by authority of the United States (except income and excess-profits taxes) its territories or any foreign country, or by authority of any State, county, school district, municipality, or other taxing subdivision of a State (not including those assessed against local benefits) and paid within the year for which the return is made, are deductible from the gross income of a domestic corporation.' \n[\nFootnote 10\n] These provisions as to individuals were as follows:\n'Sec. 222. (a) That the tax computed under Part II of this title shall be credited with: '(1) In the case of a citizen of the United States, the amount of any income, war-profits and excess-profits taxes paid during the taxable year to any foreign country, upon income derived from sources therein, or to any possession of the United States; and '(2) In the case of a resident of the United States, the amount of any such taxes paid during the taxable year to any possession of the United States; and '(3) In the case of an alien resident of the United States who is a citizen or subject of a foreign country, the amount of any such taxes paid during the taxable year to such country, upon income derived from sources therein, if such country, in imposing such taxes, allows a similar credit to citizens of the United States residing in such country. ...'\n\n And with respect to domestic corporations:\n'Sec. 238. (a) That in the case of a domestic corporation the total taxes imposed for the taxable year by this title and by Title III shall be credited with the amount of any income, war-profits and excess-profits taxes paid during the taxable year to any foreign country, upon income derived from sources therein, or to any possession of the United States . ...' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] These provisions for deductions in the Revenue Act of 1918 were; 'Sec. 214. (a) ... (3) Taxes paid or accrued within the taxable year imposed (a) by the authority of the United States, except income, war- profits and excess-profits taxes; or (b) by the authority of any of its possessions, except the amount of income, war-profits and excess-profits taxes allowed as a credit under section 222; or (c) by the authority of any State or Territory, or any county, school district, municipality, or other taxing subdivision of any State or Territory, not including those assessed against local benefits of a kind tending to increase the value of the property assessed; or (d) in the case of a citizen or resident of the United States, by the authority of any foreign country, except the amount of income, warprofits and excess-profits taxes allowed as a credit under section 222. ...' 40 Stat. 1067.\n Section 234(a)(3)(d), 40 Stat. 1077, provided for a similar deduction of taxes paid by a domestic corporation excepting from such deductions the credits allowed under section 238. \n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] Treasury Regulations No. 45, under the Revenue Act of 1918, thus described these deductions: 'Art. 131. Taxes.-Federal taxes (except income, war profits and excess profits taxes), State and local taxes (except taxes assessed against local benefits of a kind tending to increase the value of the property assessed), and taxes imposed by possessions of the United States or by foreign countries (except the amount of income, war profits and excess profits taxes allowed as a credit against the tax), are deductible from gross income. ...'

(continued on p. 19) \n The former names of certain of these territories are here used for convenience, in spite of an actual or possible change in name or sovereignty. A nonresident alien individual who is a citizen or subject of any country in the first list is entitled for the purpose of the normal tax to such credit for personal exemption and for dependents as his family status may warrant. If he is a citizen or subject of any country in the second list he is entitled to a credit for personal exemption, but to none for dependents. If he is a citizen or subject of any country in the third list he is not entitled to credit for either personal exemption or for dependents. If he is a citizen or subject of a country which is in none of the lists, then to secure credit for either a personal exemption or for dependents he must prove to the satisfaction of the commissioner that his country does not impose an income tax or that in imposing an income tax it grants the similar credit required by the statute.' \n[\nFootnote 23\n] Supra, note 10. \n[\nFootnote 24\n] Article 385 of Regulations No. 45 is as follows (Treas.

(b) The following is an incomplete list of the countries which do not satisfy the similar credit requirement of section 222(a)(3) of the Revenue Act of 1918, either by allowing no credit to citizens of the United States residing in such countries, for the amount of income, war profits, or excess profits taxes paid to the United States upon incomes derived from sources therein, or because such countries do not impose any income, war profits, or excess profits taxes: Argentina, Bahama, Belgium, Bermuda, Bolivia, Bosnia, Brazil, Chile, China, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Egypt, Finland, France, Great Britain and Ireland, Guatemala, Herzegovina, India, Jamaica, Japan, Montenegro, Morocco, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Persia, Peru, Portugal, Roumania, Santo Domingo, Serbia, Siam, Sweden, Switzerland, Venezuela. \n The former names of certain of these territories are here used for convenience in spite of the actual or possible change in the name or sovereignty.

Gen., for petitioner.\n Mr. William S. Hammers, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent Clark's income tax return for 1921 showed net loss exceeding $17,000; for 1922 net loss of about $5,000. He claimed these should be deducted from gains reported for 1923, under section 204(a) and ( b),1 Revenue \n\n[287 U.S. 410, 412]\n\u00a0\n Act of 1921, c. 136, 42 Stat. 227, 231. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue ruled otherwise, and the Board of Tax Appeals approved. The Court of Appeals, District of Columbia, 61 App.D.C. 217, 59 F.(2d) 1031, reversed the Board's action. The matter is here upon certiorari, \n287 \nU.S. 584\n, 53 S.Ct. 19, 77 L.Ed. --.\n From 1899 until 1922 respondent was closely connected with the Bowers Southern Dredging Company, which did river and harbor improvement work, dredging, and jetty building. He was majority stockholder, active head, after 1905 president, and devoted himself largely to its affairs. During 1921 and 1922 he was a member of three partnerships similarly engaged and often associated with the Bowers Company. Also he owned and held as investments shares of a number of corporations. He was not in the investment business.\n After 1917 the Bowers Company encountered continuous financial difficulties. To protect his interest therein, at sundry undisclosed times respondent indorsed the company's obligations to the banks. In 1921 a creditors' committee took charge, and thereafter respondent conducted the corporate affairs as managing director. A new concern took over the entire assets and business in 1922\n\n\n Because of his indorsements, respondent paid $68,000 for the company during 1921. He claimed and was al- \n\n[287 U.S. 410, 413]\n\u00a0\n lowed to deduct the sum thus lost upon his return for that year. During the same year he also lost $9,500 through sale of the corporation's stock, and in 1922 he sustained a similar loss amounting to $92,500. For both these sums appropriate deductions were permitted.\n After considering all the circumstances, the collector held respondent's losses did not result 'from the operation of any trade or business regularly carried on by the taxpayer,' and could not be deducted from gains of succeeding years. The Board of Tax Appeals approved. Among other things, it said:\n'In order for the losses here involved to be deductible in determining taxable income for 1923, they must be net losses resulting from the operation of a trade or business regularly carried on by the petitioner and not from isolated and occasional transactions.\n\n'With respect to the loss of $68,000 resulting from the petitioner's endorsement of the Bowers Company notes, he testified that in endorsing the notes he was seeking to protect his investment in its stock. Aside from endorsing an undisclosed number of notes of this company there is nothing in the record to indicate that acting as endorser or guarantor constituted a business or trade with the petitioner. So far as the record shows these were the only notes ever endorsed by the petitioner for the Bowers Company or for any other company or person. From the facts in the case we are of the opinion that the loss did not result from the operation of a trade or business regularly carried on by the petitioner but resulted from isolated or occasional transactions. ...\n\n'With respect to the remaining losses resulting from the sale of the Bowers Company stock in 1921 and 1922, we do not think the petitioner's ownership of stock in a number of corporations which he held as an investment during 1921 and 1922 or the sale of some of such stock in those years constituted a business or trade regularly \n\n[287 U.S. 410, 414]\n\u00a0\n carried on by him. As to his being in the investment business, the petitioner testified as follows: 'Q. Would you say you were in the investment business, Mr. Clark?' 'A. No sir.'\n\n'Since the petitioner was not in the investment business or engaged in the business of a dealer in securities, we think the losses resulting from the sale of the Bowers Company stock in 1921 and 1922 constituted losses arising from occasional or isolated transactions and not from the operation of a business regularly carried on. ...'\n\n In support of the contrary view, the District Court of Appeals said:\n'It appears that during the times in question appellant was engaged in regularly carrying on the business of dredging, operated by a corporation of which appellant was principal owner and active directing head, and to which he devoted all of his time and energies. Appellant accordingly was necessarily concerned with the financial conditions and difficulties which beset the business, and he was compelled by circumstances to indorse the company's notes in order to supply it with necessary operating funds. This action was not isolated or occasional, but became part of the operation of the business, and helped to carry it on. It is true that appellant did not regularly carry on a business of indorsing notes for profit, but his indorsement of the company's notes was part of the business regularly carried on for the company. It is also true that appellant was not regularly engaged in the business of selling corporate stocks, but the transactions of that character appearing in the record cannot be separated from the regular course of business of which they were part, and must not be considered as if wholly independent transactions.' 59 F.(2d) 1031, 1032.\n\n We agree with the Commissioner and the Board of Tax Appeals. The judgment below must be reversed. \n\n[287 U.S. 410, 415]\n\u00a0\n The respondent was employed as an officer of the corporation; the business which he conducted for it was not his own. There were other stockholders. And in no sense can the corporation be regarded as his alter ego, or agent. He treated it as a separate entity for taxation; made his own personal return; and claimed losses through dealings with it. He was not regularly engaged in indorsing notes, or buying and selling corporate securities. The unfortunate indorsements were no part of his ordinary business, but occasional transactions intended to preserve the value of his investment in capital shares.\n A corporation and its stockholders are generally to be treated as separate entitles. Only under exceptional circumstances-not present here- can the difference be disregarded.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Revenue Act, 1921: 'Sec. 204.

Widener (he died in 1915), made return concerning income and excess profits taxes for 1920 wherein it claimed deduction for loss occasioned by transfer of British-American Tobacco Company stock to the estate. The Commissioner refused to allow the deduction, and found that, rightly regarded, the transaction had yielded gain to the taxpayer. A deficiency assessment followed.\n The Board of Tax Appeals approved the Commissioner's action; but the Circuit Court of Appeals, Third Circuit (57 F.(2d) 47), held otherwise.\n Having acquired control of the Commonwealth Improvement Company, incorporated under an old Pennsylvania charter, Mr. Widener caused an increase of its capital stock and authorization of $20,000,000 script and debentures. He then-May 1, 1912-conveyed to the corporation sundry stocks valued at $25,000,000, taking in payment all its shares and $20,000,000 in debentures and script. He was old, and the double purpose was to avoid multifold death duties or transfer taxes and to insure the safety of an endowment which he wished to \n\n[287 U.S. 415, 417]\n\u00a0\n donate to a favorite charity-School for Crippled Children. $4,000,000 of the debentures so received were promptly deposited in trust for the benefit of that school.\n Among the securities transferred by Widener to respondent were 225, 000 shares British-American Tobacco Company. Their market value March 1, 1913, was $5,315,625-$23.625 per share.\n In 1919 the improvement company, under privilege extended to stockholders, subscribed for and received 75,000 new shares then issued by the British-American Company. Paying therefor $326,437.50-$4.3525 per share-much less than market value.\n In 1920 the trustees of the estate acquired the $4,000,000 of respondent's debentures theretofore deposited for benefit of the school. These were transferred to respondent, and in part payment it transferred to the estate the original block (the identical certificates) of 225,000 British-American Tobacco Company shares volued at $5,287,500-$23.50 per share. The apparent result was sale of the whole block at 12 1\/2 cents per share under the March 1, 1913, value with consequent net loss of $28,125. For this sum respondent claimed deduction upon its 1920 tax return.\n When the Commissioner audited the return, he decided that the base value per unit (for taxation purposes) of the 225,000 shares British- American Tobacco Company, transferred as shown, should be ascertained by adding to their total market value March 1, 1913-$5,315,625.00-the total paid for the 75,000 shares acquired in 1919, $326,437.50, and dividing the resulting sum by $300,000. The quotient, $18.806,875, he held was the base cost of each transferred share. Accordingly he found a gain by respondent of $1,055,953.12, and made an appropriate deficiency assessment.\n In brief and argument here respondent advances two points: First, it is said the Commissioner improperly \n\n[287 U.S. 415, 418]\n\u00a0\n reckoned the base value of the British-American Tobacco Company shares. Second, that under the peculiar facts or the cause the transaction under consideration resulted in no true loss or gain. Respondent was merely the agency or instrumentality of the trustees of the estate in administering their trust. Practically considered, the improvement company and the estate are the same entity.\n The Board of Tax Appeals expressed no opinion concerning the Commissioner's method of reckoning-it was not requested so to do. There the respondent relied entirely upon the second point. The Circuit Court of Appeals ruled only on the same point. In such circumstances, we do not undertake to determine what was not considered below.\n Upon the second point we think the Board of Tax Appeals reached the right conclusion; the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be reversed.\n Among other things, the Board well said:\n'The petitioner does not now argue before the board that the method of computing the gain was incorrect, but relies entirely upon its contention that the corporation and the estate are the same entity. If this contention were logically applied it would follow that all income received by the corporation since its organization was properly taxable as income of P. A. B. Widener and his estate and should have been added to any other income which Widener and his estate received during these years and taxed at the rates applicable to individuals rather than returned by the petitioner and taxed at the rates fixed for corporations. For the purposes of inheritance and transfer taxes imposed by the various States upon the transfer of the stocks owned by petitioner the corporate entity should have been disregarded upon the death of Widener and these stocks treated as different things and taxed accordingly payable had they been owned by the decedent. But \n\n[287 U.S. 415, 419]\n\u00a0\n petitioner does not seek to carry its contention to such a conclusion. Having enjoyed the benefits which resulted from its separate existence, it seeks to perpetuate those benefits and asks that the separate existence and tax liability of the petitioner and its single stockholder be overlooked only with respect to transactions which take place between them. That this is an afterthought is plainly evidenced by the action of petitioner in claiming a deduction upon this same transaction when it believed a deductible loss had been sustained. ...\n\n'The fact is that petitioner did have a separate legal existence with privileges and obligations entirely separate from those of its stockholders. The fact that it had only one stockholder seems of no legal significance. Cannon Mfg. Co. v. Cudahy Co., \n267 U.S. 333\n (45 S.Ct. 250).'\n\n Counsel for respondent concede that ordinarily a corporation and its stockholders are separate entities, whether the shares are divided among many or are owned by one. Consequently they make no effort to support any general rule under which a corporation and its single stockholder have such identity of interest that transactions between them must be disregarded for tax purposes. They submit, however, the peculiar facts here disclosed suffice to show there was really no income, nothing properly taxable as such. They refer to Southern Pacific Company v. Lowe, \n247 \nU.S. 330\n, 38 S.Ct. 540, 543, and Gulf Oil Corp. v. Lewellyn, \n248 \nU.S. 71\n, 39 S.Ct. 35, not as controlling, but as instances where the court looked through mere form and regarded substance.\n While unusual cases may require disregard of corporate form, we think the record here fails to disclose any circumstances sufficient to support the petitioner's claim. Certainly the improvement company and the estate were separate and distinct entities; the former was avowedly utilized to bring about a change in ownership beneficial to the latter. For years they were recognized and \n\n[287 U.S. 415, 420]\n\u00a0\n treated as differentthings and taxed accordingly upon separate returns. The situation is not materially different from the not infrequent one where a corporation is controlled by a single stockholder. See Eisner v. Macomber, \n252 \nU.S. 189, 208\n, 209 S., 40 S.Ct. 189, 9 A.L.R. 1570; Lynch v. Hornby, \n247 \nU.S. 339, 341\n, 38 S.Ct. 543; United States v. Phellis, \n257 \nU.S. 156, 172\n, 173 S., 42 S.Ct. 63.\n Southern Pacific Company v. Lowe, supra, and Gulf Oil Corp. v. Lewellyn, supra (the latter covered in principle by the first), cannot be regarded as laying down any general rule authorizing disregard of corporate entity in respect of taxation. These cases presented peculiar situations, and were determined upon consideration of them. In the former this court said: 'The case turns upon its very peculiar facts, and is distinguishable from others in which the question of the identity of a controlling stockholder with his corporation has been raised. Pullman's Car Co. v. Missouri Pacific Ry. Co., \n115 \nU.S. 587, 596\n, 6 S.Ct. 194; Peterson v. Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry.

Act of June 16, 1906, 34 Stat. 267, 270, 272, 273. The State Constitution (article 11,  1) established 7a common school system and pledged her faith to preserve the lands so conveyed by the United States as a sacred trust, and to keep the same for the uses and purposes for which they were granted. The Legislature prescribed regulations for leasing and directing payment of the proceeds into the school fund. Oklahoma Comp. Statutes of 1921, sections 9415, 9417, 9423\n\n\n In January, 1914, some of these lands were leased to the Coronado Oil & Gas Company; renewals followed in 1919. Under the first lease the state received fifty per cent., and under the second twelve and one-half per cent. of the gross production of oil and gas. During the years here important the lessee's entire income came from the sale of its portion of such output.\n The Commissioner of Internal Revenue assessed income and excess profits taxes upon the corporation's net income for 1917, 1918, and 1919. The Board of Tax Appeals approved his action; the Court of Appeals, District of Columbia, ruled otherwise. The latter held that the lease to the Coronado Company was an instrumentality of the state for the utilization of lands dedicated to the support of public schools, and that to tax the fruits of the lease would burden her in the performance of the governmental function of maintaining such schools. This conclusion, it properly thought, was necessary under Gillespie v. Oklahoma, \n257 \nU.S. 501\n, 42 S. Ct. 171.\n We are disposed to apply the doctrine of Gillespie v. Oklahoma strictly and only in circumstances closely analogous to those which it disclosed. In principle, however, the present claim of exemption cannot be distinguished from the one presented in the earlier cause, and we adhere to the rule there approved. \n\n[285 U.S. 393, 399]\n\u00a0\n True it is, as stated in Group No. 1 Oil Corp. v. Bass, \n283 \nU.S. 279, 282\n, 283 S., 51 S. Ct. 432, 433, 'This Court has consistently held that, where property or any interest in it has completely passed from the government to the purchaser, he can claim no immunity from taxation with respect to it, merely because it was once government owned, or because the sale of it effected some government purpose. ... Property which has thus passed from either the national or a state government to private ownership becomes a part of the common mass of property and subject to its common burdens.' And as there distinctly indicated, the exemption claimed by the Oil Corporation was denied because under the settled rule applied by the Texas Supreme Court the oil and gas from disposal of which the corporate income arose had been purchased, not obtained under a lease-title had passed out of the state by a present sale. Status of the title was matter for determination under laws of the state as construed and applied by her courts. In the present cause there is no basis for saying that, according to the local law, the transaction between the state and the lessee amounted to a sale. The distinction between cases involving sales and those where leases had been made seemed sufficiently apparent when Group No. 1 Oil Corp. v. Bass, was decided, and is not less obvious now.\n'Just what instrumentalities of either a state or the federal government are exempt from taxation by the other cannot be stated in terms of universal application. But this court has repeatedly held that those agencies through which either government immediately and directly exercises its sovereign powers, are immune from the taxing power of the other.' Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, \n269 \nU.S. 514, 522\n, 46 S. Ct. 172, 174.\n\n The opinion in Gillespie v.

Cas. 737, much relied upon, is not in point.\n The states are essential parts of the plan adopted by the Federal Constitution; and we accept as settled doctrine that the United States can lay no tax upon their governmental instrumentalities.

Indian Motorcycle Co. v. United States, supra. Each government is supreme in its sphere; and in order to preserve our dual system this fact must be given practical recognition.\n\n Here the lease to the respondent was an instrumentality of the state for the purpose of carrying out her duty in respect of public schools. To tax the income of the lessee \n\n[285 U.S. 393, 401]\n\u00a0\n arising therefrom would amount to an imposition upon the lease itself.\n The challenged judgment must be affirmed.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE (dissenting).\n I think the judgment below should be reversed and Gillespie v. Oklahoma, \n257 \nU.S. 501\n, 42 S. Ct. 171, should be overruled. Neither can stand as the law of this court consistently with the principles recently reaffirmed in Group No. 1 Oil Corporation v. Bass, \n283 \nU.S. 279\n, 51 S. Ct. 432.\n The state of Texas, like the state of Oklahoma, has set apart a portion of its public domain for educational purposes. It has granted oil and gas leases of these lands, not differing in any material respect from the Oklahoma lease involved in this case. The royalties received by the state from the leases are devoted to the University of Texas, as Oklahoma devotes the income derived from its leases to its public schools. In Group No. 1 Oil Corporation v. Bass, supra, decided less than a year ago, this court, notwithstanding its decision in the Gillespie Case that the income of the lessees of Indian oil lands could not be taxed by Oklahoma, upheld the right of the national government to assess and collect a tax upon the income received by the lessee of one of the Texas leases, from the sale of oil produced from the leased land. It was pointed out that under Texas law the lessee, by virtue of his lease, became the owner of the oil underground, and that the taxed income was derived from the sale of oil which was his own property. In upholding the tax, the court said (pages 282, 283 of 283 U. S., 51 S. Ct. 432, 433):\n'Property sold or otherwise disposed of by the government, either state or national, in order to raise revenue for government purposes, is in a broad sense a government instrumentality, with respect to which neither the \n\n[285 U.S. 393, 402]\n\u00a0\n property itself before sale, nor its sale by one government, may be taxed by the other. But it does not follow that the same property in the hands of the buyer, or his use or enjoyment of it, or the income he derives from it, is also tax immune. New Brunswick v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 547\n, 48 S. Ct. 371; Forbes v. Gracey, \n94 U.S. 762\n; Tucker v. Ferguson, 22 Wall. 527; see Weston v. Charleston, 2 Pet. 449, 468; Veazie Bank v. Fenno, 8 Wall. 533, 547. Theoretically, any tax imposed on the buyer with respect to the purchased property may have some effect on the price, and thus remotely and indirectly affect the selling government. We may assume that, if the property is subject to tax after sale, the governmental seller will generally receive a less favorable price than if it were known in advance that the property in the hands of later owners, or even of the buyer alone, could not be taxed.\n\n'But the remote and indirect effects upon the one government of such a nondiscriminatory tax by the other have never been considered adequate grounds for thus aiding the one at the expense of the taxing power of the other. See Willcuts v. Bunn, \n282 \nU.S. 216, 231\n, 51 S. Ct. 125; Educational Films Corp. v. Ward, \n282 \nU.S. 379\n, 51 S. Ct. 170; Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, \n269 \nU.S. 514, 523\n, 524 S., 46 S. Ct. 172. This Court has consistently held that, where property or any interest in it has completely passed from the government to the purchaser, he can claim no immunity from taxation with respect to it, merely because it was once government owned, or because the sale of it effected some government purpose. New Brunswick v. United States, supra; Forbes v. Gracey, supra; Tucker v. Ferguson, supra; see Gromer v. Standard Dredging Co., \n224 \nU.S. 362, 371\n, 32 S. Ct. 499; Choctaw, O. & G. R. Co. v. Mackey, \n256 \nU.S. 531, 537\n, 41 S. Ct. 582; Central Pacific R. Co. v. California, \n162 \nU.S. 91, 125\n, 16 S. Ct. 766; (Union P.) Railroad Co. v. Peniston, 18 Wall. 5, 35-37; Weston v. Charleston, supra, page 468 of 2 Pet. (7 L. Ed. 481).\n\n\n\n[285 U.S. 393, 403]\n\u00a0\n 'Property which has thus passed from either the national or a state government to private ownership becomes a part of the common mass of property and subject to its common burdens. Denial to either government of the power to tax it, or income derived from it, in order to insure some remote and indirect antecedent benefit to the other, would be an encroachment on the sovereign power to tax, not justified by the implied constitutional restriction. See Weston v. Charleston, supra, page 468 of 2 Pet. (7 L. Ed. 481).'\n The doctrine thus announced was not a new one. More than fifty years before, and long before the decision in the Gillespie Case, it had been definitely decided in Forbes v. Gracey, \n94 U.S. 762\n, that private mining claims granted by the government in the public lands of the United States, and the ores and minerals derived from them, are subject to state taxation.\n In deciding the Group No. 1 Oil Corporation Case, it was not necessary to determine whether the result in that case would have been different if the oil, from the sale of which the taxpayer derived his income, had become his only when severed from the soil, or whether there were other distinguishing features between that case and the Gillespie Case. It was enough, there, that, as the taxed income was derived from the lessee's sale of the oil, title to which was, by the lease, vested in him before severance, the case was definitely controlled by precedents whose avowed principles the court approved. Now, we are concerned with a lease identical with that involved in the Gillespie Case, and comparison of it with the Texas lease is unavoidable. If we can find no distinction of substance between the operation and effect of the Texas leases and the Oklahoma leases, the Gillespie Case should no longer be followed. That no such distinction can be drawn is obvious.\n The leasing by the national government of Indian oil lands in Oklahoma to private lessees, for the benefit of the \n\n[285 U.S. 393, 404]\n\u00a0\n Indians, and the leasing by Oklahoma of its school lands in like fashion, for the benefit of the schools of the state, are no more and no less governmental enterprises than the leasing by Texas of its oil lands for the benefit of the state university. Whatever the genesis of the particular public duty which each sovereignty has undertaken to perform, the method chosen and the instruments selected for its performance are the same. In each case there was the exercise of a function concededly governmental; but in each the only result, so far as the lessee was concerned, was the acquisition by him of certain property rights exclusively for his own benefit. In each the lessee was taxed on his profits, derived from his private business in the production and sale of oil and gas, which was his property. It cannot be said that the identical tax, thus levied, has any effect on Oklahoma differing from that on Texas. The fact, if it is a fact, that under the Oklahoma leases the lessees do not acquire ownership of the oil or gas until they have severed it from the soil, but before its sale, while the lessees under the Texas leases acquire it immediately on receipt of their leases, presents no distinguishing feature. All acquire private rights by governmental grant, from the exploitation of which they have derived income which, upon principles consistently applied by this court, except in the Indian oil lease cases, and reiterated in the Group No. 1 Oil Corporation Case, may be taxed as other income is taxed.\n Since comparison of the two methods of disposing of state assets reveals only formal differences, this court must now deal with an irreconcilable conflict in the theories upon which two of its decisions rest. One, the Gillespie Case, extends the doctrine of tax immunity, beyond any other case, to income from private business enterprises, merely because the property used in the business was acquired from a sovereign government which ap- \n\n[285 U.S. 393, 405]\n\u00a0\n plies the proceeds of it to a governmental purpose. The other, and more recent, case, decided by the court after full consideration of all the arguments now advanced as supporting the Gillespie Case, restricted the immunity to the property of the sovereign government itself, and to the income which the government derives from it.\n It is plain that if we place emphasis on the orderly administration of justice, rather than on a blind adherence to conflicting precedents, the Gillespie Case must be overruled. It is true that for ten years the state of Oklahoma has been deprived, by the decision in that case, of taxes upon the income derived from private business of lessees of Indian lands in that state, but that is no reason why it should continue to be so deprived or why the national government should now be denied the right to like taxes and at the same time be permitted to tax the income of the lessees under the Texas leases. No interest which could be subserved by so rigid an application of stare decisis is superior to that of a system of justice based on a considered and consistent application of the Constitution of the United States.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, Mr. Justice ROBERTS, and Mr. Justice CARDOZO join in this opinion.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS (dissenting).\n Under the rule of Gillespie v. Oklahoma, vast private incomes are being given immunity from state and federal taxation. I agree with Mr. Justice STONE that that case was wrongly decided and should now be frankly overruled. Merely to construe strictly its doctrine will not adequately protect the public revenues. Compare Jaybird Mining Co. v. Weir, \n271 \nU.S. 609\n, 46 S. Ct. 592.\n Stare decisis is not, like the rule of res judicata, universal inexorable command. 'The rule of stare decisis, though one tending to consistency and uniformity \n\n[285 U.S. 393, 406]\n\u00a0\n of decision, is not inflexible. Whether it shall be followed or departed from is a question entirely within the discretion of the court, which is again called upon to consider a question once decided.' Hertz v. Woodman, \n218 \nU.S. 205, 212\n, 30 S. Ct. 621. Stare decisis is usually the wise policy, because in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right. Compare National Bank v. Whitney, \n103 U.S. 99\n, 102. This is commonly true even where the error is a matter of serious concern, provided correction can be had by legislation. \n1\n But in cases involving the Fed \n\n[285 U.S. 393, 407]\n\u00a0\n eral Constitution, where correction through legislative action is practically impossible, this court has often overruled its earlier decisions. \n2\n The court bows to the les \n\n[285 U.S. 393, 408]\n\u00a0\n sons of experience and the force of better reasoning, 3 recognizing that the process of trial and error, so fruitful in the physical sciences, is appropriate also in the judicial function. Compare Brinkerhoff-Faris Trust & Savings \n\n[285 U.S. 393, 409]\n\u00a0\n Co. v. Hill, \n281 \nU.S. 673, 681\n, 50 S. Ct. 451. Recently, it overruled several leading cases, when it concluded that the states should not have been permitted to exercise powers of taxation which it had theretofore repeatedly sanctioned. \n4\n In cases involving the Federal Constitution5 the position \n\n[285 U.S. 393, 410]\n\u00a0\n of this court is unlike that of the highest court of England, where the policy of stare decisis was formulated and is strictly applied to all classes of cases. \n6\n Parliament is free to correct any judicial error; and the remedy may be promptly invoked.\n The reasons why this court should refuse to follow an earlier constitutional decision which it deems erroneous are particularly strong where the question presented is one of applying, as distinguished from what may accurately be called interpreting the Constitution. In the cases which now come before us there is seldom any dispute as to the interpretation of any provision. The controversy is usually over the application to existing conditions of some well-recognized constitutional limitation. \n7\n This is strikingly true of cases under the due process clause when the question is whether a statute is unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious; of cases under the equal protection clause when the question is whether there is any reasonable basis for the classification made by a statute; and of cases under the commerce clause when the question is whether an admitted burden laid by a statute upon interstate commerce is so substantial as to be deemed direct. These issues resemble, fundamentally, that of reasonable care in negligence cases, the determination of which is ordinarily left to the verdict of the jury. In every such case the decision, in the first instance, is dependent upon the determination of what in legal parlance is called a fact, as distinguished from the \n\n[285 U.S. 393, 411]\n\u00a0\n declaration of rule of law. \n8\n When the underlying fact has been found, the legal result follows inevitably. The circumstance that the decision of that fact is made by a court, instead of by a jury, should not be allowed to obscure its real character.\n The issue presented by the case at bar is of the character of those discussed above. Here, also, the applicable provision of law is beyond dispute. Confessedly, the United States may not, by a tax, interfere substantially with the functions of a state. The question at issue is whether, as a practical matter, it does not interfere by a statute which includes among the items on which its general income tax is laid, the profits derived by the taxpayer from operating some of the state's school lands under a lease. The question resembles closely that presented and decided in Willcuts v. Bunn, \n282 \nU.S. 216, 230\n, 231 S., 51 S. Ct. 125. There, this court examined the surrounding facts to determine whether 'a federal tax on the profits of sales of such securities should be deemed, as a practical matter, to lay such a burden on the exercise of the State's borrowing power as to make it necessary to deny to the Federal Government the constitutional authority to impose the tax.' The validity of the tax, it held, depends upon 'whether the prospect on the part of the ordinary investor of obtaining profit on the resale of such obligations is so important an element in inducing their acquisition that a federal tax on such profits, in common with profits derived from the sales of other property, constitutes any substantial interference with the functions of state governments.' Obviously the matter for determination in Willcuts v. Bunn, although made by the highest court of the land, was, in \n\n[285 U.S. 393, 412]\n\u00a0\n essence, a matter of fact. Similarly, here, the question whether it would interfere substantially with the functions of the state government to permit the general income tax of the United States to include profits derived from the lease involves primarily the determination of a fact, not the decision of a proposition of law.\n The doctrine of res judicata demands that a decision made by the highest court, whether it be a determination of a fact or a declaration of a rule of law, shall be accepted as a final disposition of the particular controversy, even if confessedly wrong. But the decision of the court, if, in essence, merely the determination of a fact, is not entitled, in later controversies between other parties, to that sanction which, under the policy of stare decisis, is accorded to the decision of a proposition purely of law. For not only may the decision of the fact have been rendered upon an inadequate presentation of then existing conditions, but the conditions may have changed meanwhile. Compare Abie State Bank v. Bryan, \n282 \nU.S. 765, 772\n, 51 S. Ct. 252. Moreover, the judgment of the court in the earlier decision may have been influenced by prevailing views as to economic or social policy which have since been abandoned. \n9\n In cases involving constitutional issues of the character discussed, this court must, in order to reach sound conclusions, feel free to bring its opinions into agreement with experience and with facts newly ascertained, so that its \n\n[285 U.S. 393, 413]\n\u00a0\n judicial authority may, as Mr. Chief Justice Taney said, 'depend altogether on the force of the reasoning by which it is supported.'\n Mr. Justice STONE and Mr. Justice ROBERTS join in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This Court has, in matters deemed important, occasionally overruled its earlier decisions although correction might have been secured by legislation.

HARMEL(1932)\nNo. 26\nArgued: Decided: November 7, 1932\n\n\n\n\n[287 U.S. 103, 104]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Thomas D. Thacher, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Robert Ash, of Washington, D.C., and A. H. Britain, of Wichita Falls, Tex., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent, the owner in fee of Texas oil lands, executed oil and gas leases of the lands for three years and as long thereafter as oil or gas should be produced from them by the lessee, in return for bonus payments aggregating $57,000 in cash, and stipulated royalties, measured by the production of oil and gas by the lessee. In making his income tax returns under the Revenue Act of 1924 for the years 1924 and 1925, respondent reported the cash payments as gain from a sale of capital assets, taxable under the applicable section of the statute at a lower rate than other income. The Commissioner treated the pay- \n\n[287 U.S. 103, 105]\n\u00a0\n ments as ordinary income taxed at the higher rate, and gave respondent notice of assessment for the deficiency. The order of the board of Tax Appeals upholding the assessment, 19 B.T.A. 376, was reversed by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, 56 F.(2d) 153, following its earlier decision in Ferguson v. Commissioner (C.C.A.) 45 F.(2d) 573. It was held that because Texas law, unlike that of other states, regards an oil and gas lease as a present sale of the oil and gas in place, the gain resulting from the cash payment received as consideration for the leases was taxable only as gain from the sale of capital assets. This Court granted certiorari, \n286 \nU.S. 536\n, 52 S.Ct. 498, to resolve a conflict of the decision below with that of the Court of Claims, under corresponding provisions of the Revenue Act of 1921, in Hirschi v. United States, 67 Ct.Cl. 637.\n The Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. 262, like that of Revenue Act 1921, c. 136, 42 Stat. 232, taxed certain income derived from capital gains at a lower rate than other income. By section 208(a)(1), Revenue Act 1924 (26 USCA  939 note), 'the term 'capital gain' means taxable gain from the sale or exchange of capital assets consummated after December 31, 1921.' By section 208(a)(8) of the act of 1924 (26 USCA  939 note) 'capital assets' means property held by the taxpayer for more than two years, but does not include property 'which would properly be included in the inventory of the taxpayer if on hand at the close of the taxable year, or property held by the taxpayer primarily for sale in the course of his trade or business.' Related provisions of the section define 'capital loss' and 'capital deductions' which, in some circumstances, are allowed as deductions from capital gain in order to arrive at the net gain taxed at the lower rate. The only question presented here is whether the bonus payments to the respondent, after allowed deductions, if any, are 'gain from the sale or exchange of capital assets' within the meaning of the taxing act. \n\n[287 U.S. 103, 106]\n\u00a0\n Before the act of 1921, gains realized from the sale of property were taxed at the same rates as other income, with the result that capital gains, often accruing over long periods of time, were taxed in the year of realization at the high rates resulting from their inclusion in the higher surtax brackets. The provisions of the 1921 Revenue Act for taxing capital gains at a lower rate, re-enacted in 1924 without material change, were adopted to relieve the taxpayer from these excessive tax burdens on gains resulting from a conversion of capital investments, and to remove the deterrent effect of those burdens on such conversions. House Report No. 350, Ways and Means Committee, 67th Cong., 1st Sess. on the Revenue Bill of 1921, p. 10; see Alexander v. King (C.C.A.) 46 F.(2d) 235, 74 A.L.R. 174.\n It is an incident of every oil and gas lease, where production operations are carried on by the lessee, that the ownership of the oil and gas passes from the lessor to the lessee at some time, and the lessor is compensated by the payments made by the lessee for the rights and privileges which he acquires under the lease. But, notwithstanding this incidental transfer of ownership, it is evident that the taxation of the receipts of the lessor as income does not ordinarily produce the kind of hardship aimed at by the capital gains provision of the taxing act. Oil and gas may or may not be present in the leased premises, and may or may not be found by the lessee. If found, their abstraction from the soil is a time-consuming operation, and the payments made by the lessee to the lessor do not normally become payable as the result of a single transaction within the taxable year, as in the case of a sale of property. The payment of an initial bonus alters the character of the transaction no more than an unusually large rental for the first year alters the character of any other lease, and the taxation of the one as ordinary income does not act as a deterrent upon conversion of capital assets, any more than the taxation of the other. \n\n[287 U.S. 103, 107]\n\u00a0\n Moreover, the statute speaks of a 'sale,' and these leases would not generally be described as a 'sale' of the mineral content of the soil, using the term either in its technical sense or as it is commonly understood. Nor would the payments made by lessee to lessor generally be denominated the purchase price of the oil and gas. By virtue of the lease, the lessee acquires the privilege of exploiting the land for the production of oil and gas for a prescribed period; he may explore, drill, and produce oil and gas, if found. Such operations with respect to a mine have been said to resemble a manufacturing business carried on by the use of the soil, to which the passing of title of the minerals is but an incident, rather than a sale of the land or of any interest in it or in its mineral content. Stratton's Independence v. Howbert, \n231 \nU.S. 399, 414\n, 415 S., 34 S.Ct. 136; see Von Baumbach v. Sargent Land Co., \n242 \nU.S. 503, 521\n, 37 S.Ct. 201.\n Long before the enactment of the capital gains provision in the 1921 Revenue Act, this Court had to determine whether a mining lease was to be regarded as a sale. In interpreting the Corporation Tax Law of 1909, it had occasion to consider the nature of the proceeds derived by the owner of mineral land from his own mining operations or from payments made to him by the lessee under a mining lease. That act imposed an excise tax on corporations, measured by their income. Unlike the later revenue acts, it made no provision for a depletion allowance to be deducted from the proceeds of mining in order to arrive at the statutory income. It was argued that, since the net result of the mining operation is a conversion of capital investment as upon a sale, the money received by the corporate owner or lessor, being its capital in a changed form, could not rightly be deemed to be income. But that argument was rejected, both with respect to the proceeds of mining operations carried on by the corporate owner on its land, Stratton's Independence v. \n\n[287 U.S. 103, 108]\n\u00a0\n Howbert, supra; Goldfield Consolidated Mines v. Scott, \n247 \nU.S. 126\n, 38 S. Ct. 465; see Stanton v. Baltic Mining Co., \n240 \nU.S. 103, 114\n, 36 S.Ct. 278, and with respect to payments made by the lessee to the corporate lessor under the provisions of a mining lease, Von Baumbach v. Sargent Land Co., \n242 \nU.S. 503, 521\n, 522 S., 37 S.Ct. 201; United States v. Biwabik Mining Co., \n247 \nU.S. 116\n, 38 S.Ct. 462\n\n\n Although these cases arose under the act of 1909, before the enactment of the capital gains provision in the 1921 act, they established, for purposes of defining 'income' in a tax measured by it, that payments by lessees to lessors under mining leases were not a conversion of capital, as upon a sale of capital assets, but were income to the lessor, like payments of rent. And before the 1921 act this Court had indicated (see Eisner v. Macomber, \n252 \nU.S. 189, 207\n, 40 S.Ct. 189, 9 A.L.R. 1570), what it later held, that 'income,' as used in the revenue acts taxing income, adopted since the Sixteenth Amendment, has the same meaning that it had in the act of 1909. Merchants' Loan & Trust Co. v. Smietanka, \n255 \nU.S. 509, 519\n, 41 S.Ct. 386, 15 A.L.R. 1305; see Southern Pacific Co. v. Lowe, \n247 \nU.S. 330, 335\n, 38 S.Ct. 540.\n Congress legislated in the light of this history, cf. United States v. Merriam, \n263 \nU.S. 179, 187\n, 44 S.Ct. 69, 29 A.L.R. 1547, and, in the absence of explicit language indicating a different purpose, it cannot be taken to have intended that an oil and gas lease under the capital gains provision, any more than a mineral lease under the earlier acts, should be treated like an ordinary sale of land or chattels, resulting in a conversion of capital assets. Such a construction would have disregarded legislative and judicial history of persuasive force; it would have adopted a distorted, rather than the common, meaning of the term 'sale,' see Old Colony R.R. Co. v. Commission, \n284 \nU.S. 552, 561\n, 52 S.Ct. 211, and would have tended to defeat, rather than further, the purpose of the act. \n\n[287 U.S. 103, 109]\n\u00a0\n The respondent does not challenge the correctness of the construction of the statute which we adopt,1 when applied to oil and gas leases under which the title to the oil and gas passes to the lessee only on severance from the leasehold. But it is argued that the section cannot be so applied to the bonus payments received by the lessor in the present case, because, under Texas law, an oil and gas lease operates immediately upon its execution to pass the title of the oil and gas, in place, to the lessee, and it is thus a sale of the oil and gas and a conversion of capital assets within the precise terms of section 208.\n In Group No. 1 Oil Corp. v. Bass, \n283 \nU.S. 279\n, 51 S.Ct. 432, this Court recognized that oil and gas leases have been characterized, in the decisions of the Texas courts, as present sales of the oil and gas in place, and we applied the rule of those decisions that ownership of the oil and gas passes from lessor to lessee on execution of the lease. There the question was not one of the interpretation of a federal statute, but of the power of the federal government to levy a tax upon the income of a lessee of state lands derived from the sale of oil and gas abstracted by him from the land. It was objected that the tax was not within the power of the federal government because imposed on income derived from an instrumentality of the state. If the oil and gas had ceased to be property of the state before its removal by the lessee, it had, under the decisions of this Court, ceased to be an instrumentality of the state, and the income derived from it was within the taxing power of the national government. Whether the title \n\n[287 U.S. 103, 110]\n\u00a0\n had so passed was a question of state law, and the affirmative answer of the state courts necessarily led to the conclusion that the lessee's income was not immune from federal income tax. Compare Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., \n285 \nU.S. 393, 399\n, 52 S.Ct. 443.\n Here we are concerned only with the meaning and application of a statute enacted by Congress, in the exercise of its plenary power under the Constitution, to tax income. The exertion of that power is not subject to state control. It is the will of Congress which controls, and the expression of its will in legislation, in the absence of language evidencing a different purpose, is to be interpreted so as to give a uniform application to a nation-wide scheme of taxation. See Weiss v. Wiener, \n279 \nU.S. 333, 337\n, 49 S.Ct. 337; Burk-Waggoner Oil Ass'n v. Hopkins, \n269 \nU.S. 110\n, 46 S.Ct. 48; United States v. Childs, \n266 \nU.S. 304, 309\n, 45 S.Ct. 110. State law may control only when the federal taxing act, by express language or necessary implication, makes its own operation dependent upon state law. See Crooks v. Harrelson, \n282 \nU.S. 55\n, 51 S.Ct. 49; Poe v. Seaborn, \n282 \nU.S. 101\n, 51 S.Ct. 58; United States v. Cambridge Loan & Building Co., \n278 \nU.S. 55\n, 49 S.Ct. 39; Tyler v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 497\n, 50 S.Ct. 356, 69 A.L.R. 758; see Von Baumbach v. Sargent Land Co., supra, page 519 of 242 U.S., 37 S.Ct. 201.\n But section 208 neither says nor implies that the determination of 'gain from the sale or exchange of capital assets' is to be controlled by state law. For the purpose of applying this section to the particular payments now under consideration, the act of Congress has its own criteria, irrespective of any particular characterization of the payments in the local law. See Weiss v. Wiener, supra, page 337 of 279 U.S., 49 S.Ct. 337. The state law creates legal interests, but the federal statute determines when and how they shall be taxed. We examine the Texas law only for the purpose of ascertaining whether the leases conform to the standard which the taxing statute prescribes for giving the favored treatment to capital gains. Thus tested, we find in the \n\n[287 U.S. 103, 111]\n\u00a0\n Texas leases no differences from those leases where the title to the oil and gas passes only on severance by the lessee, which are of sufficient consequence to call for any different application of section 208. The fact that title to the oil and gas is said to pass before severance, rather than after, is not such a difference. The economic consequences to the lessor of the two types of lease are the same. Under both, the payments made by the lessee are consideration for the right which he acquires to enter upon and use the land for the purpose of exploiting it, as well as for the ownership of the oil and gas; under both the bonus payments are paid and retained, regardless of whether oil or gas is found, and despite the fact that all which is not abstracted will remain the property of the lessor upon termination of the lease.\n Title to the oil and gas likewise passes from the landowner when he conducts mining operations on his own land. But, as was pointed out in Stratton's Independence v. Howbert, since that is only an incident to the use of his land for oil production, the operation, considered in its entirety, cannot be viewed as a sale or a conversion of capital assets. Like considerations govern here.\n The court below thought that the bonus payments, as distinguished from the royalties, should be treated as capital gain, apparently because it assumed that the statute authorizes a depletion allowance upon the royalties alone. See Ferguson v. Commissioner (C.C.A.) 45 F.(2d) 573, 577. But bonus payments to the lessor have been deemed to be subject to depletion allowances under section 214(a)(9), Revenue Act of 1924, 26 USCA  955(a)(9), by article 216, Treasury Regulations 65, as well as under earlier acts. Section 214(a)(10), Revenue Act of 1921 (42 Stat. 241), art. 215, Treasury Regulations 62. Cf. Murphy Oil Co. v. Burnet (C.C.A.) 55 F.( 2d) 17. The distinction, so far as we are advised, has not been taken in any other case. See Alexander v. King, supra; Ferguson v. Commissioner (C. C.A.) 59 F.(2d) 891; Appeal of Nelson Land & Oil Company, 3 B.T.A. \n\n[287 U.S. 103, 112]\n\u00a0\n 315; Burkett v. Commissioner (C.C.A.) 31 F.(2d) 667, and see the same case before the Board of Tax Appeals, 7 B.T.A. 560; Berg v. Commissioner, 59 App.D.C. 86, 33 F.(2d) 641; Hirschi v. United States, supra. We see no basis for it. Bonus and royalties are both consideration for the lease, and are income of the lessor. We cannot say that such payments by the lessee to the lessor, to be retained by him regardless of the production of any oil or gas, are any more to be taxed as capital gains than royalties which are measured by the actual production. See Work v. U.S. ex rel. Mosier, \n261 \nU.S. 352, 357\n, 358 S., 43 S.Ct. 389.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The capital gains provision of the 1921 act (section 206) was held not to embrace receipts of the lessor from an oil and gas lease in Burkett v.

LEININGER(1932)\nNo. 426\nArgued: February 16, 1932Decided: March 14, 1932\n\n\n\n\n[285 U.S. 136, 137]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Claude R. Branch, of Providence, R. I (Messrs. Thomas D. Thacher, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., G. A. Youngquist, Asst. Atty. Gen., Sewall Key, John H. McEvers, and Wilbur H. Friedman, all of Washington, D. C., on the brief), for petitioner.\n Mr. Irwin N. Loeser, of Cleveland, Ohio (Messrs. Levi Cooke and John R. Beneman, both of Washington, D. C., on the brief), for respondent.\n\n\n[285 U.S. 136, 138]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The respondent sought a redetermination of deficiencies in income taxes for the years 1920 to 1923. The question related to the income earned on respondent's share in a partnership,' known as the Eagle Laundry Company, doing business in Cleveland, Ohio. By virtue of an agreement made with his wife, respondent insisted that she was 'a full equal partner with him in his interest in the partnership,' and that each should return and pay tax upon one-half of the income attributable to that interest. The Commissioner determined that respondent was taxable upon the whole of the income earned on his share in the partnership and the Board of Tax Appeals affirmed that decision. 19 B. T. A. 621. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the order of the Board (51 F.(2d) 7), and this Court granted a writ of certiorari. \n284 \nU.S. 608\n, 52 S. Ct. 43, 76 L. Ed. -.\n The question arises under section 218(a) of the Revenue Acts of 1918 and 1921 (40 Stat. 1070; 42 Stat. 245) which provided:\n'That individuals carrying on business in partnership shall be liable for income tax only in their individual capacity. There shall be included in computing the net income of each partner his distributive share, whether distributed or not, of the net income of the partnership for the taxable year. ...'\n\n There is no challenge to the findings of fact made by the Board of Tax Appeals as being unsupported by evidence, and they must be treated as conclusive. Phillips v. \n\n[285 U.S. 136, 139]\n\u00a0\n Commissioner, \n283 \nU.S. 580, 599\n, 600 S., 51 S. Ct. 608. Upon these findings, which are set forth in the margin,1 it cannot be maintained that the agreement between the respondent and his wife made her a member of the partnership. That result could not be achieved without the consent of the \n\n[285 U.S. 136, 140]\n\u00a0\n other partner or partners,2 and there is no finding of such consent. The mere communication of the fact that the agreement had been made was not enough. It does not appear that there was any attempt to change the ownership of the partnership assets or the control of the partnership enterprise. It was the husband's interest that was the subject of the agreement. \n3\n His wife was to be an 'equal partner with him' in that interest. The business of the firm was continued as before. Complying with the statute,4 the partnership returns, verified by the husband for the years in question, stated that the names of the partners were 'C. P. Leininger and M. T. Monaghan, each owning one-half.' 19 B. T. A. at page 623. The 'Leininger interest' remained in the name of the respondent on the partnership books. His wife took no part in the management of the business and made no contribution to its capital. The profits received from the partnership went to the respondent, no checks on the firm being drawn to the wife. Upon the facts as found, the agreement with Mrs. Leininger cannot be taken to \n\n[285 U.S. 136, 141]\n\u00a0\n have amounted to more than an equitable assignment of one-half of what her husband should receive from the partnership, she in turn agreeing to make good to him one-half of the losses he might sustain by reason of his membership in the firm.\n The respondent urges that the assignment to his wife was of one-half of the 'corpus' of his interest and that this 'corpus' produced the income in question. The characterization does not aid the contention. That which produced the income was not Mr. Leininger's individual interest in the firm, but the firm enterprise itself, that is, the capital of the firm and the labor and skill of its members employed in combination through the partnership relation in the conduct of the partnership business. There was no transfer of the corpus of the partnership property to a new firm with a consequent readjustment of rights in that property and management. If it be assumed that Mrs. Leininger became the beneficial owner of one-half of the income which her husband received from the firm enterprise, it is still true that he, and not she, was the member of the firm and that she had only a derivative interest.\n The statute dealt explicitly with the liability of partners as such. Applying to this case, the statute provided that there should be included in computing the net income of Leininger his distributive share of the net income of the partnership. That distributive share, as he himself stated in his return on behalf of the partnership, was one-half. In view of the clear provision of the statute, it cannot be said that Leininger was required to pay tax upon only a part of this distributive share because of the assignment to his wife. The case of Lucas v. Earl, \n281 \nU.S. 111\n, 50 S. Ct. 241, is analogous. There the husband made a contract with his wife by which his salary and fees were to be 'received, held, taken and owned' by them as joint tenants. The Court recognized that a forcible argument \n\n[285 U.S. 136, 142]\n\u00a0\n was presented 'to the effect that the statute seeks to tax only income beneficially received, and that taking the question more technically the salary and fees became the joint property of Earl and his wife on the very first instant on which they were received.' But the case was deemed to turn on the import and reasonable construction of the taxing act. 'There is no doubt' said the Court, 'that the statute could tax salaries to those who earned them and provide that the tax could not be escaped by anticipatory arrangements and contracts however skillfully devised to prevent the salary when paid from vesting even for a second in the man who earned it. That seems to us the import of the statute before us and we think that no distinction can be taken according to the motives leading to the arrangement by which the fruits are attributed to a different tree from that on which they grew.' Id., pages 114, 115 of 281 U. S., 50 S. Ct. 241. This ruling was not disturbed by Poe v. Seaborn, \n282 \nU.S. 101\n, 51 S. Ct. 58, which pointed out the distinction. Id., page 117 of 282 U. S., 51 S. Ct. 58.\n We find no reason to doubt the validity of the tax. The Congress, having the authority to tax the net income of partnerships, could impose the liability upon the partnership directly, as it did under the Revenue Act of 1917 (40 Stat. 300, 303), or upon the 'individuals carrying on business in partnership,' as in the statutes here involved. The Congress could thus tax the distributive share of each partner as such, as in Lucas v. Earl, supra, it taxed the salary and fees of the person who earned them. A different situation was presented in Hoeper v. Tax Commission of Wisconsin, \n284 \nU.S. 206\n, 52 S. Ct. 120 (decided November 30, 1931), where the question related to the earnings of the wife and the income which she received from her separate estate. For that which thus belonged to her the Court held that her husband could not be taxed. In the instant case, the right of the wife was derived from the agreement with her husband and \n\n[285 U.S. 136, 143]\n\u00a0\n rested upon the distributive share which he had, and continued to have, as a member of the partnership.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and the order of the Board of Tax Appeals affirmed.\n It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The findings of the Board of Tax Appeals are as follows:\n'In 1898 a partnership known as Eagle Laundry Co. was organized by petitioner and one M. G. Monaghan, each owning a one-half interest. In 1904 Monaghan died and his wife, Mary T. Monaghan, succeeded to his interest in the firm and on the books of the company. In 1920 Mary T. Monaghan transferred by bill of sale her interest to her children. The entire Monaghan interest was thereafter carried on the books in the name of Marcus A. Monaghan. The partnership returns for the years 1921, 1922, and 1923 filed by the Eagle Laundry Co. disclose the partners to be petitioner and M. T. Monaghan and the income to be distributable one-half to each. Each of the three children of Mary T. Monaghan, however, returned a proportionate part of the income for taxation.\n\n'During the latter part of 1920 a written agreement confirmatory of a preexisting oral agreement, was entered into between petitioner and his wife, wherein its was acknowledged that petitioner's wife had been and was a full equal partner with him in the interest in the Eagle Laundry Co., entitled to share equally in the profits and obligated to bear equally any losses. The contract was effective from the beginning of 1920. The written agreement was not produced, probably having been lost in a fire at the plant. The fact of this transfer was communicated to Marcus A. Monaghan, who represented the owners of the other one-half interest in the Eagle Laundry Co. The Leininger interest always stood in the name of C. P. Leininger on the partnership books, but Mrs. C. P. Leininger returned one- half of the profits of the Leininger interest for taxation.\n\n'Petitioner and his wife maintained prior to and throughout the period here involved a joint bank account on which each could draw unrestrictedly. The profits received from the partnership were deposited in this account by Leininger, no checks on the partnership being drawn to the wife. After the execution of the agreement the wife also maintained a small personal account in which were deposited checks received on account of earnings on her personal investments. Mrs. Leininger took no part in the management of the business and made no contribution to its capital. There was never any formal accounting between petitioner and his wife.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Channel v. Fassitt, 16 Ohio, 166; Pagel v. Creasy, 6 Ohio App. 199, 207, 208; McNamara v.

UNITED STATES(1932)\nNo. 378\nArgued: November 15, 1932Decided: December 5, 1932\n\n\n\n\n[287 U.S. 216, 217]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Otto Christensen, of Los Angeles, Cal., for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Thomas D. Thacher, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Court granted certiorari (\n287 \nU.S. 585\n, 53 S.Ct. 92, 77 L.Ed. --) to review the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals affirming an order revoking probation. 59 F.(2d) 721. On a plea of guilty to three counts of an indictment, petitioner was sentenced, on May 4, 1931, on the first count to imprisonment for one year, on the second count to pay a fine of $ 2,000, and on the third count to imprisonment for five years. Execution of the last-mentioned sentence was suspended, and the court granted probation upon the following terms: 'During such time as the defendant reports regularly \n\n[287 U.S. 216, 218]\n\u00a0\n every three months in writing, beginning with this date, to the federal probation officer of this court; during which time he entirely refrains from any violation of any law with the possible exception of parking and traffic ordinances, and in all respects conduct himself as a law-abiding citizen. In case of the violation of the terms of probation, the defendant will be brought before the court and sentenced. Probation is granted for a period of five years.'\n On January 21, 1932, while petitioner was serving his sentence on the first count, he was brought before the court, by its direction, for the purpose of investigating a report that he had violated the terms of probation. After a brief recess to permit the attendance of counsel for petitioner, the court held a summary hearing. A special agent of the Department of Justice testified that the jail records, a copy of which was produced, showed that on fifteen days between May 10 and August 18, 1931, petitioner had been absent from the jail for long periods ranging from nearly four hours to over twelve hours; that an order had been made permitting him to visit a dentist for necessary dental work, but that on August 18th the agent had found petitioner at his home. Petitioner was examined on his own behalf, and from his cross-examination it appeared that on one occasion, when the record showed that he had been away from the jail from 10 a.m. until 9:06 p.m., he had been at his home in the evening 'listening to the radio, something like that.' He was unable to say how often he had gone to his home when he was supposed to be visiting the dentist; it was 'quite a few times. Q. Most of the time? A. Pretty near.' He further testified: 'Q. When you left the jail and didn't go to the dentist's office, were you and Lessner (a deputy marshal) riding around or were you at your house and would Lessner ride around? Is that right? A. Yes.' On ridirect examination, petitioner added that when he was out he \n\n[287 U.S. 216, 219]\n\u00a0\n asked to be taken home to get a change of clothes; that usually each time he went to the house he went for a change of linen.\n After petitioner had testified, the court, denying the request of petitioner's counsel for an opportunity to present further evidence, especially as to matters upon which the court did not base its conclusion, revoked the probation order. The court said that 'there is enough obviously before this court to show that the spirit of the probation was not in any sense complied with.' The Circuit Court of Appeals, reviewing petitioner's testimony at length, sustained the order as based not upon 'a technical escape, but upon the fact that the appellant had not acted in good faith in carrying out the order of the trial judge, but, on the contrary, had taken advantage of a general permit to carry out his own purposes quite independently of the basis and theory upon which the order was given.' (C.C.A.) 59 F.(2d) 724.\n First. Petitioner objects to the summary character of the proceeding. He urges that he was entitled to previous notice of specific charges of violation of the terms of probation and to a hearing upon such charges according to the established rules of judicial procedure. As opposed to the action sanctioned below he invokes principles announced in Hollandsworth v. United States (C.C.A.4th) 34 F.(2d) 423, 428, and in certain decisions of state courts dealing with procedure under state probation laws. See State v. Zolantakis, 70 Utah, 296, 259 P. 1044, 54 A.L. R. 1463, 1471, note. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[287 U.S. 216, 220]\n\u00a0\n The Federal Probation Act (March 4, 1925, c. 521, 43 Stat. 1259, U.S. C., tit. 18,  724-727 (18 USCA  724-727)), confers an authority commensurate with its object. It was designed to provide a period of grace in order to aid the rehabilitation of a penitent offender; to take advantage of an opportunity for reformation which actual service of the suspended sentence might make less probable. United States v. Murray, \n275 \nU.S. 347, 357\n, 358 S., 48 S.Ct. 146; H.R.Rep. No. 423, 68th Cong., 1st Sess. Probation is thus conferred as a privilege, and cannot be demanded as a right. It is a matter of favor, not of contract. There is no requirement that it must be granted on a specified showing. The defendant stands convicted; he faces punishment, and cannot insist on terms or strike a bargain. To accomplish the purpose of the statute, an exceptional degree of flexibility in administration is essential. It is necessary to individualize each case, to give that careful, humane, and comprehensive consideration to the particular situation of each offender which would be possible only in the exercise of a broad discretion. The provisions of the act are adapted to this end. It authorizes courts of original jurisdiction, when satisfied 'that the ends of justice and the best interests of the public, as well as the defendant, will be subserved,' to suspend the imposition or execution of sentence and 'to place the defendant upon probation \n\n[287 U.S. 216, 221]\n\u00a0\n for such period and upon such terms and conditions as they may deem best.'\n There is no suggestion in the statute that the scope of the discretion conferred for the purpose of making the grant is narrowed in providing for its modification or revocation. The authority for the latter purpose immediately follows that given for the former, and is in terms equally broad. 'The court may revoke or modify any condition of probation, or may change the period of probation.' There are no limiting requirements as to the formulation of charges, notice of charges, or manner of hearing or determination. No criteria for modification or revocation are suggested which are in addition to, or different from, those which pertain to the original grant. The question in both cases is whether the court is satisfied that its action will subserve the ends of justice and the best interests of both the public and the defendant. The only limitation, and this applies to both the grant and any modification of it, is that the total period of probation shall not exceed five years. Act of March 4, 1925,  1 (18 USCA  724).\n Such procedural provisions as the act contains harmonize with the view that the continuance of the probation, as well as the grant of it, rests in the court's discretion. The probation officer, when directed by the court, must report to the court with a statement of the conduct of the probationer. 'The court may thereupon discharge the probationer from further supervision and may terminate the proceedings against him, or may extend the probation, as shall seem advisable.' Id.,  2 (18 USCA  725). The broad authority of the court remains unimpaired. At any time within the probation period, the probationer may be arrested, either with or without warrant, and thereupon he 'shall forthwith be taken before the court.' Also, after the probation period has expired, but within the maximum period for which the defendant might originally have been sentenced, the court may issue a warrant and cause the \n\n[287 U.S. 216, 222]\n\u00a0\n defendant to be arrested and brought before it. 'Thereupon the court may revoke the probation or the suspension of sentence, and may impose any sentence which might originally have been imposed.' Id.\n The duty placed upon the probation officer to furnish to each probationer under his supervision 'a written statement of the conditions of probation' and to 'instruct him regarding the same' (Id.  4 (18 USCA  727)) cannot be deemed to restrict the court's discretion in modifying the terms of probation or in revoking it. The evident purpose is to give appropriate admonition to the probationer, not to change his position from the possession of a privilege to the enjoyment of a right. He is still a person convicted of an offense, and the suspension of his sentence remains within the control of the court. The continuance of that control, apparent from the terms of the statute, is essential to the accomplishment of its beneficent purpose, as otherwise probation might be more reluctantly granted, or, when granted, might be made the occasion of delays and obstruction which would bring reproach upon the administration of justice. See Campbell v. Aderhold (D.C.) 36 F.(2d) 366, 367; United States v. Mulligan (C.C.A.) 48 F.(2d) 93, 94; Jianole v. United States (C.C.A.) 58 F.( 2d) 115, 117; Commonwealth v. McGovern, 183 Mass. 238, 66 N.E. 805; People ex rel. Pasco v. Trombly, 173 App.Div. 497, 499, 160 N.Y.S. 67; Richardson v. Commonwealth, 131 Va. 802, 810, 811, 109 S.E. 460; People v. Dudley, 173 Mich. 389, 392, 395, 138 N.W. 1044; People v. Sanders, 64 Cal.App. 1, 220 P. 24.\n The question, then, in the case of the revocation of probation, is not one of formal procedure either with respect to notice or specification of charges or a trial upon charges. The question is simply whether there has been an abuse of discretion and is to be determined in accordance with familiar principles governing the exercise of judicial discretion. That exercise implies conscientious \n\n[287 U.S. 216, 223]\n\u00a0\n judgment, not arbitrary action. The Styria v. Malcomson, \n186 \nU.S. 1, 9\n, 22 S.Ct. 731. It takes account of the law and the particular circumstances of the case and is 'directed by the reason and conscience of the judge to a just result.' Langnes v. Green, \n282 \nU.S. 531, 541\n, 51 S.Ct. 243, 247. While probation is a matter of grace, the probationer is entitled to fair treatment, and is not to be made the victim of whim or caprice.\n Second. Applying these principles, it is apparent that the instant case has the peculiar feature that the probationer was actually serving a jail sentence while on probation with respect to another sentence. But, even in jail, he was subject to the conditions of the probation. By its terms, he was to refrain from violation of law and 'in all respects conduct himself as a law-abiding citizen.' As, at the same time that the sentence in question was suspended and probation was granted, he was committed to jail upon a distinct sentence, there was also a condition necessarily implied that he should not be guilty of conduct inconsistent with obedience to that sentence. Abuse of the liberty granted him to leave the jail for a particular purpose, and absenting himself in the circumstances described in his testimony-apart from the question of violation of law (see Act of May 14, 1930, c. 274,  9, 46 Stat. 325, 327, U.S.C., tit. 18,  753h (18 USCA  753h))-was clearly a breach of that condition, and the court was entitled to take note of it.\n There is, properly speaking, no question here of notice. Defendant was brought before the court and questioned. Defendant was not only heard but gave his testimony. The inquiry related to his own conduct in connection with his leaving the jail, and the court could properly restrict the examination to what was pertinent to that conduct and could refuse to extend the inquiry to embrace other matters. The hearing was summary, but it cannot be said that it was improper or inadequate, in view of the nature of the proceeding and of the particular point upon which \n\n[287 U.S. 216, 224]\n\u00a0\n the court rested its decision. The court revoked the probation upon defendant's admissions of his dereliction, and it does not appear that there was an abuse of discretion.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See, also, Riggs v.

UNITED STATES(1932)\nNo. 576\nArgued: March 14, 1932Decided: April 11, 1932\n\n\n\n\n[285 U.S. 515, 516]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Louis Halle, of New York City, for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. G. A. Youngquist, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner was indicated under section 593(b) of the Tariff Act of 1922, 1 for aiding and abetting the importation of intoxicating liquors contrary to law, the specified illegality being violation of Title 2,  3, of the National Prohibition Act. \n2\n In support of a demurrer he asserted \n\n[285 U.S. 515, 517]\n\u00a0\n the indictment set forth an offense under the Prohibition Act and failed to charge one under the cited section of the Tariff Act; and was duplicitous as including offenses under both statutes. The demurrer was overruled, trial and conviction followed, and petitioner was sentenced under section 593(b). The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment, and this court granted certiorari.\n We are asked to hold that one who violates the Prohibition Act by importing liquor, may not be indicted, tried, and sentenced under the Tariff Act, which makes the importation of 'any merchandise3 contrary to law' a criminal offense. The phrase 'contrary to law' as used in the later act is unqualified and taken in its natural meaning signifies 'contrary to any law,' and hence contrary to the earlier prohibition act, so that a violation of that act would be an offense within the other.\n The petitioner urges that the National Prohibition Act deals specifically with intoxicating liquor, prohibits its importation, and provides a penalty therefor; whereas, the Tariff Act is concerned with a wholly separate subject and the penal section 593(b) aimed at unlawful importation should not be construed as repealing the earlier special statute. Ex parte Crow Dog, \n109 \nU.S. 556, 570\n, 3 S. Ct. 396; Rodgers v. United States, \n185 U.S. 83\n, 87-89, 22 S. Ct. 582; Washington v. Miller, \n235 \nU.S. 422, 428\n, 35 S. Ct. 119. This argument overlooks the fact that the National Prohibition Act prescribes no special penalty for importation in violation of its provisions. Section 29 of Title 2, an omnibus section fixing penalties for violations for which no special penalty is \n\n[285 U.S. 515, 518]\n\u00a0\n prescribed, is the only one under which punishment could be imposed for illegal importation. \n4\n The language used is sufficiently broad to include specific penalties fixed in other sections of the statute and also such as might be imposed by separate legislation. The Tariff Act, a later statute, fixes a definite penalty for one of the violations grouped in the penal section of the earlier act. In this respect it superseded the general provisions of the prior statute embracing the same subject. Cook County National Bank v. United States, \n107 \nU.S. 445\n, 2 S. Ct. 561; Walla Walla v.

Bigham, both of New York City, for petitioners.\n\n\n[285 U.S. 413, 417]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Ray M. Stanley, of Buffalo, N. Y., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These three libels in admiralty in personam were brought in the federal court for western New York, by owners of cargo laden on the steamer Yorkton to recover for loss resulting from the sinking of that vessel in a collision with respondent's steamer Mantadoc, in Lake Superior, on the American side of the international boundary line. The respondent moved, in each case, that the District Court exercise its discretion to decline jurisdiction and dismiss the libels on the ground that all the parties were citizens of Canada, and that the controversy concerned 'matters ... properly the subjects of hearing and determination' by the Canadian courts. The motions were granted (49 F.(2d) 802, 804), and the decrees of the District Court were affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (51 F.(2d) 1007). This court granted certiorari, \n284 \nU.S. 612\n, 52 S. Ct. 131, 76 L. Ed. -.\n Shortly after the collision, the Wreck Commissioner of Canada held a formal investigation, as required by law, respecting the circumstances of the collision, and determined that the masters of both vessels were at fault. The respondent then instituted in the admiralty court of Canada a proceeding for the judicial determination of the liability as between the colliding vessels and their owners. \n\n[285 U.S. 413, 418]\n\u00a0\n The libelants' motive for invoking the jurisdiction of a court of the United States, instead of that of the Canadian court in which that proceeding was pending, appears in affidavits filed with the exceptions to the libel. Under the Canadian law, it is stated, if both colliding vessels were at fault each vessel would be liable for not more than half of the loss; and the salvaged value of the Yorkton might not suffice to pay its share. See The Milan, Lush. Adm. 401. Under our law the innocent cargo owner can recover full damages from the noncarrying vessel. The New York, \n175 \nU.S. 187, 209\n, 210 S., 20 S. Ct. 67.\n The libelants concede, as they must, that in a suit in admiralty between foreigners it is ordinarily within the discretion of the District Court to refuse to retain jurisdiction, and that the exercise of its discretion will not be disturbed unless abused. Charter Shipping Co. v. Bowring, Jones & Tidy, Ltd., \n281 \nU.S. 515, 517\n, 50 S. Ct. 400. Compare Watts, Watts & Co. v. Unione Austriaca di Navigazione, \n248 \nU.S. 9\n, 39 S. Ct. 1, 3 A. L. R. 323; Langnes v. Green, \n282 \nU.S. 531, 544\n, 51 S. Ct. 243. They claim, however, that the rule is not applicable here, since the cause of action arose within the territorial limits of the United States; and, moreover, that if the District Court had discretion, the decrees should be reversed because, on the undisputed facts, it was an abuse of discretion to decline jurisdiction. We are of opinion that neither claim is well founded.\n First. The contention that the jurisdiction was obligatory rests upon the fact that the collision occurred within the territorial waters of the United States. The argument is that a cause of action arising from a collision occurring on territorial waters of the United States arises out of its laws, since within its territory there can be no other law, Smith v. Condry, 1 How. 28, 33; Slater v. Mexican National R. Co., \n194 \nU.S. 120, 126\n, 24 S. Ct. 581; New York Central R. Co. v. Chisholm, \n268 \nU.S. 29, 32\n, 45 S. Ct. 402, 38 A. L. R. 1048; that the Constitution, art. 3,  2, cl. 1, extends the judicial \n\n[285 U.S. 413, 419]\n\u00a0\n power to 'all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction'; that section 24 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  41) confers upon the District Court jurisdiction 'of all civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction'; and that by vesting jurisdiction in that court, Congress imposed a duty upon it to exercise the jurisdiction. Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 404; McClellan v. Carland, \n217 \nU.S. 268, 281\n, 30 S. Ct. 501; Second Employers' Liability Case, \n223 \nU.S. 1, 58\n, 59 S., 32 S. Ct. 169, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 44. In support of the argument that there is no power to decline jurisdiction in cases where the cause of action arose within the United States, the libelants urge the statement in The Belgenland, \n114 \nU.S. 355, 365\n, 5 S. Ct. 860, 865, that 'the courts will use a discretion about assuming jurisdiction of controversies between foreigners in cases arising beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the country to which the courts belong.'\n The respondent insists that the doctrine of lex loci delicti has no application to cases of collision on the Great Lakes; that the Great Lakes and their connecting channels constitute public navigable waters, irrespective of the location of the international boundary, and possess all the characteristics of the high seas, The Eagle, 8 Wall. 15, 22; United States v. Rodgers, \n150 \nU.S. 249, 256\n, 14 S. Ct. 109; Panama R. Co. v. Napier Shipping Co., \n166 \nU.S. 280, 285\n, 17 S. Ct. 572; The New York, \n175 \nU.S. 187\n, 20 S. Ct. 67; The Robert W. Parsons, \n191 \nU.S. 17, 27\n, 24 S. Ct. 8; that in a case of collision on the high seas between two vessels of the same nationality, liability is governed by the law of the flag, The Scotland, \n105 \nU.S. 24, 29\n, 30 S.; The Eagle Point (C. C. A.) 142 F. 453, 454; that the Canadian law would apply in the cases at bar; and that hence, the asserted ground for the District Court's retaining jurisdiction fails.\n We have no occasion to inquire by what law the rights of the parties are governed, as we are of the opinion that, under any view of that question, it lay within the discretion of the District Court to decline to assume jurisdiction \n\n[285 U.S. 413, 420]\n\u00a0\n over the controversy. The suggestion drawn from the language in The Belgenland, supra, that such discretion exists only 'in cases arising beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the country to which the courts belong,' is without support in either the earlier or the later decisions of this court. Nor is it justified by the language relied on, when that language is read in its context. The case of The Belgenland arose out of a collision on the high seas between foreign vessels of different nationalities; and the objection was raised that the courts of the United States were wholly without jurisdiction. Mr. Justice Bradley, speaking for the court, replied that jurisdiction in admiralty did exist over controversies between foreigners arising without the territorial waters of this country, but that the court in such a case would use its discretion in determining whether to exercise it. That the court had no intention of denying the existence of similar discretion, where the cause of action arose within the territorial waters of this country, is shown by its reference to the cases of The Maggie Hammond, 9 Wall. 435, 457, and Taylor v. Carryl, 20 How. 583, 611, in which no such limitation was expressed, and which the court described as 'accurately stating' the law. The doctrine of these earlier cases was recently reiterated by this court, in similar terms, in Langnes v. Green, \n282 \nU.S. 531, 544\n, 51 S. Ct. 243, 248, where it was said: 'Admiralty courts ... have complete jurisdiction over suits of a maritime nature between foreigners. Nevertheless, 'the question is one of discretion in every case, and the court will not take cognizance of the case if justice would be as well done by remitting the parties to their home forum.\" See, also, Charter Shipping Co. v. Bowring, Jones & Tidy, Ltd ., \n281 \nU.S. 515, 517\n, 50 S. Ct. 400.1 \n\n[285 U.S. 413, 421]\n\u00a0\n The rule recognizing an unqualified discretion to decline jurisdiction in suits in admiralty between foreigners appears to be supported by an unbroken line of decisions in the lower federal courts. \n2\n The question has most frequently been presented in suits by foreign seamen against masters or owners of foreign vessels, relating to claims for wages and like differences,3 or to claims of personal injury. \n4\n Although such cases are ordinarily decided ac- \n\n[285 U.S. 413, 422]\n\u00a0\n cording to the foreign law, they often concern causes of action arising within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States. Compare Patterson v. Bark Eudora, \n190 \nU.S. 169\n, 23 S. Ct. 821; The Kestor (D. C.) 110 F. 432, 450. Neither in these, nor in other cases, has the bare circumstance of where the cause of action arose been treated as determinative of the power of the court to exercise discretion whether to take jurisdiction. \n 5\n\u00a0\n\n Obviously, the proposition that a court having jurisdiction must exercise it, is not universally true; else the admiralty court could never decline jurisdiction on the ground that the litigation is between foreigners. Nor is it true of courts administering other systems of our law. \n\n[285 U.S. 413, 423]\n\u00a0\n Courts of equity and of law also occasionally decline, in the interest of justice, to exercise jurisdiction, where the suit is between aliens or nonresidents, or where for kindred reasons the litigation can more appropriately be conducted in a foreign tribunal. \n6\n The decisions relied upon by libelants are inapposite for several reasons. They were not in admiralty causes; nor did they involve alien or nonresident parties. Compare Second Employers' Liability Case, \n223 \nU.S. 1, 58\n, 59 S., 32 S. Ct. 169, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 44, with Douglas v. New York, New Haven & Hartford R. Co., \n279 \nU.S. 377\n, 49 S. Ct. 355. The cases of Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 404, and McClellan v. Carland, \n217 \nU.S. 268, 281\n, 30 S. Ct. 501, denied the right to abdicate to state courts jurisdiction which the Constitution in positive terms intrusts to the federal judiciary.\n Second. There is no basis for the contention that the District Court abused its discretion. All the parties were not only foreigners, but were citizens of Canada. Both the colliding vessels were registered under the laws of Canada, and each was owned by a Canadian corporation. The officers and the crew of each vessel-the material witnesses-were citizens and residents of that country, and so would not be available for compulsory attendance in the District Court. The cargo, in each case, was shipped under a Canadian bill of lading from one Canadian port to another. The collision occurred at a point where the inland waters narrowed to a neck, and the District Court concluded that the colliding vessels proceeded \n\n[285 U.S. 413, 424]\n\u00a0\n in United States waters unintentionally. If the libelants are entitled to have applied the law of the United States in respect to the liability, the Canadian courts will, it must be assumed, give effect to it. The District Court embodied in the decrees an order that the respondent should appear and file security in any action which might be instituted by the petitioners in the admiralty courts of Canada, so that petitioners would not by dismissal of the libels lose the security gained by the foreign attachment. It is difficult to conceive of a state of facts more clearly justifying the refusal of a District Court to retain jurisdiction in a cause between foreigners.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Compare Mason v.

The bill alleges that the lands described constitute parts of the right of way granted by the Acts of Congress approved July 1, 1862, and July 2, 1864 (c. 120, 12 Stat. 489; c. 216, 13 Stat. 356), to the Central Pacific Railroad Company, predecessor in interest of the Central Pacific Railway Company, and leased to the Southern Pacific Company; that the county of Alameda and the other defendants, without the permission or consent, and against the will of petitioners, and without right or legal authority, had been and were then using the lands for highway or road purposes and thereby wrongfully excluding petitioners therefrom. To this bill respondents filed an answer and cross-complaint, denying some of the allegations of the bill, admitting others, and alleging affirmatively that the county of Alameda was the owner of the described lands, and was in possession and entitled to the possession thereof.\n The trial court found that three of the described parcels, held in fee by the Central Pacific Railway Company were subject to an easement in favor of the county to maintain an existing right of way for highway purposes. A decree, entered accordingly, was affirmed by the state Supreme Court. 299 P. 75.\n An abridged statement of facts found by the trial court and set forth at length in the opinion of the state Supreme Court follows:\n A public highway between Niles and Sunol, through and along the bottom of Niles Canyon, was laid out and declared by the county in 1859, and ever since has been maintained. During that time it has served as one of the main arteries of travel between the bay regions of \n\n[284 U.S. 463, 466]\n\u00a0\n southern Alameda county and the Livermore Valley. In establishing the highway, the county acted by authority of, and in compliance with, the requirements of state statutes then in force. That portion of the canyon containing the segments of the highway here in question is narrow, deep, and rugged, and through it runs the Alameda creek. Steep cliffs make it impracticable to maintain a highway through the canyon except along the bottom thereof. In pursuance of the act of Congress of 1862, supra, granting a right of way four hundred feet wide across the public lands to the Central Pacific Railroad Company, the company designated as part of its right of way the route through Niles Canyon, which right of way, on account of the narrowness of the canyon, embraced part of the land occupied by the highway A single track railroad was completed in 1868, over which trains have since been operated, but thereby the free use of the highway never has been interfered with.\n About the years 1910-11, owing to the effect of flood waters, a part of the highway was moved from one side of the creek to the other and beyond the railroad right of way; the discontinued portions being formally abandoned. When this suit was begun, the highway was within the right of way for stretches of about one-half a mile at the westerly end of the canyon, about one mile and a half at the easterly end, and for a short distance between the two. The physical conditions of the canyon are such as to render the use of the lands over these stretches for highway purposes a practical necessity. In reconstituting the highway in 1910-11, the line of the then existing road was substantially followed, except for the abandoned portions.\n The trial court found that 'the said highway did not exist throughout in its present location hereinabove particularly described prior to March 27, 1911, but that these parts of the old road No. 247 (the road of 1859) not ex- \n\n[284 U.S. 463, 467]\n\u00a0\n pressly abandoned by the Board of Supervisors on said date and now included within the limits of county road No. 4974 (the road of 1910-11), are a part of the present traveled road.' The testimony of witnesses in respect of the identity of these parts of the new and the old roads is meager and leaves much to be desired in the way of certainty, as, owing to the great lapse of time, well might be expected. But that a road through the canyon was laid out and established in 1859, under and in accordance with the state law, and was thereafter used by the public, is not open to serious controversy, although the point is urged that the present road departs from the line of that first established. The original road was formed by the passage of wagons, etc., over the natural soil, and we know, as a matter of ordinary observation, that in such cases the line of travel is subject to occasional deviations owing to changes brought about by storms, temporary obstructions, and other causes. But, so far as the specific parcels of land here in dispute are concerned, we find nothing in the record to compel the conclusion that any departure from the line of the original highway was of such extent as to destroy the identity of the road as originally laid out and used. Even in the case of highways sought to be established by prescription, where the user must be confined to a definite line, slight deviations are not regarded as material. Nelson v. Jenkins, 42 Neb. 133, 137, 60 N. W. 311; Burleigh County v. Rhud, 23 N. D. 362, 364, 136 N. W. 1082; Moon v. Lollar, 203 Ala. 672, 85 So. 6; Gentleman v. Soule, 32 Ill. 271, 278, 83 Am. Dec. 264; Bannister v. O'Connor, 113 Iowa, 541, 543, 85 N. W. 767.\n Here the question is not whether there had been such deviations from the original line of travel as to negative the claim that a road had been brought into existence by prescription, but whether there had been such substantial departures from portions of the line of the road established in 1859 as to constitute an abandonment of those \n\n[284 U.S. 463, 468]\n\u00a0\n portions of that road, and the substitution, pro tanto, of a new one so removed in location as to cause it to depend for its legality, not upon the original establishment, but upon independent facts and considerations. The burden of sustaining the affirmative of this proposition plainly rests upon the party who asserts it, since proof of the establishment of a road raises a presumption of its continuance; that is to say, the respondents having shown the establishment by the county of a road through Niles Canyon in 1859, the continuing identity of that road must be presumed until overcome by proof to the contrary, the burden of which rests upon the petitioners. Barnes v. Robertson, 156 Iowa, 730, 733, 137 N. W. 1018; Beckwith et al. v. Whalen, 65 N. Y. 322, 332; Eklon v. Chelsea, 223 Mass. 213, 216, 111 N. E. 866; Taeger v. Riepe, 90 Iowa, 484, 487, 57 N. W. 1125; Town of Oyster Bay v. Stehli, 169 App. Div. 257, 262, 154 N. Y. S. 849. This is in accordance with the general principle that a condition once shown to exist is presumed to continue. In the light of this presumption, and the absence of evidence clearly contravening it, we cannot say that the findings below are wholly without support. The conclusion follows that the portions of the highway now in question, prior to the grant of the railroad right of way of 1862, formed part of a legally constituted public road, which, since its establishment in 1859, has been in continuous use. In this view, the decree below must be affirmed upon principles settled by this court in respect of cognate cases.\n By the Act of July 26, 1866, c. 262, 14 Stat. 251-253, Congress dealt with the acquisition of a variety of rights upon the public domain. By sections 1-7, mineral lands, whether surveyed or unsurveyed, are opened to exploration and occupation, subject to regulations prescribed by law, and to the local customs and rules of miners in the several districts. Section 8 (43 USCA  932), the one with which we are \n\n[284 U.S. 463, 469]\n\u00a0\n here concerned, provides that 'the right of way for the construction of highways over public lands, not reserved for public uses, is hereby granted.' By section 9 (43 USCA  661) it is provided that rights to the use of water for mining, agricultural, or other purposes, which have vested and accrued and are recognized and acknowledged by local customs, laws, etc., shall be maintained and protected; 'and the right of way for the construction of ditches and canals for the purposes herein specified is hereby acknowledged and confirmed.'\n In Broder v. Water & Mining Co., \n101 U.S. 274\n, this court had section 9 under consideration. It there appeared that the water company owned a canal for conducting and distributing water for mining, agricultural, and other uses. The canal was completed in 1853, and thereafter was in constant operation, and uniformly acknowledged and recognized by the local customs, laws, and decisions of the courts of California. Until the passage of the act of 1862, supra, the land through which the canal ran was the public property of the United States. A portion of it was included in the grant of lands made by that act to the railroad company from which Broder derived his title to a tract traversed by the canal. He brought suit against the water company to have the canal declared a nuisance and abated and to recover damages. This court held that, notwithstanding the fact that Broder's title antedated the act of 1866, that title nevertheless was subject to the right of way for the canal. Upon that matter it was said:\n'It is the established doctrine of this court that rights of ... persons who had constructed canals and ditches ... are rights which the government had, by its conduct, recognized and encouraged and was bound to protect before the passage of the Act of 1866.' We are of opinion 'that the section of the Act which we have quoted was rather a voluntary recognition of a pre-existing right of \n\n[284 U.S. 463, 470]\n\u00a0\n possession, constituting a valid claim to its continued use, than the establishment of a new one.'\n\n The court then, referring to the clause in section 4 of the Act of July 2, 1864, supra, reserving from defeat or impairment by the general terms of the grant of 1862, 'any preemption, homestead, swamp land, or other lawful claim,' said that all such reservations were to be construed in the light of the general principle that Congress, in making the donations, could not be supposed to do so 'at the expense of pre-existing rights which, though imperfect, were still meritorious and had just claims to legislative protection.'\n Leavenworth, etc., R. Co. v. United States, \n92 U.S. 733\n, involved a grant to the state of Kansas of lands to aid in the construction of specified railroads; and the question was whether the grant included lands dedicated to, and occupied by, the Osage Indians. The grant was subject to a proviso reserving to the United States all lands theretofore reserved for the purpose of aiding in any object of internal improvement or for any other purpose whatsoever. It was held that this proviso had the effect of excluding the Indian lands from the operation of the grant. The court, at page 746 of 92 U. S., said:\n'It would be strange, indeed, if, by such an act, Congress meant to give away property which a just and wise policy had devoted to other purposes. That lands dedicated to the use of the Indians should, upon every principle of natural right be carefully guarded by the government, and saved from a possible grant, is a proposition which will command universal assent.'\n\n And the court added:\n'What ought to be done, has been done. The proviso was not necessary to do it; but it serves to fix more definitely what is granted by what is excepted.' \n\n[284 U.S. 463, 471]\n\u00a0\n Likewise, this court has recognized that the appropriation of mineral lands upon the public domain in accordance with the local customs of miners, prior to congressional legislation, was assented to by the silent acquiescence of the government, and was entitled to protection. See Atchison v. Peterson, 20 Wall. 507, 512; Sparrow v. Strong, 3 Wall. 97, 104; Jennison v. Kirk, \n98 U.S. 453\n, 458; Northern Pacific Railroad Co. v. Sanders, \n166 \nU.S. 620, 634\n, 17 S. Ct. 671\n\n\n\n In Jennison v. Kirk, supra, at page 459 of 98 U. S., referring to the act of 1866, this court quoted approvingly the statement of the author of the act, that 'it merely recognized the obligation of the government to respect private rights which had grown up under its tacit consent and approval. It proposed no new system, but sanctioned, regulated, and confirmed a system already established, to which the people were attached.'\n As far back as 1855, the Supreme Court of California, in an opinion which received the approval of this court in Atchison v. Peterson, supra, said:\n'In this State the larger part of the territory consists of mineral lands, nearly the whole of which are the property of the public. No right or intent of disposition of these lands has been shown either by the United States or the State governments, and with the exception of certain State regulations, very limited, in their character, a system has been permitted to grow up by the voluntary action and assent of the population, whose free and unrestrained occupation of the mineral region has been tacitly assented to by the one government, and heartily encouraged by the expressed legislative policy of the other. If there are, as must be admitted, many things connected with this system, which are crude and undigested, and subject to fluctuation and dispute, there are still some \n\n[284 U.S. 463, 472]\n\u00a0\n which a universal sense of necessity and propriety have so firmly fixed as that they have come to be looked upon as having the force and effect of res judicata. Among these the most important are the rights of miners to be protected in the possession of their selected localities, and the rights of those who, by prior appropriation, have taken the waters from their natural beds, and by costly artificial works have conducted them for miles over mountains and ravines, to supply the necessities of gold diggers, and without which the most important interests of the mineral region would remain without development.' Irwin v. Phillips, 5 Cal. 140, 146, 63 Am. Dec. 113.\n\n Finally, in Cramer v. United States, \n261 \nU.S. 219\n, 43 S. Ct. 342, 344, it was held that public lands in the actual occupancy of individual Indians since before 1859, were excepted from the railroad grant of lands made by the act of July 25, 1866, c. 242, 14 Stat. 239. This holding was based upon the well-understood governmental policy of encouraging the Indian to forego his wandering habits and adopt those of civilized life; and it was said that to hold that by so doing he acquired no possessory rights to the lands occupied, to which the government would accord protection, would be contrary to the whole spirit of the traditional American policy toward these dependent wards of the nation. 'The fact that such right of occupancy finds no recognition in any statute or other formal governmental action is not conclusive. The right, under the circumstances here disclosed, flows from a settled governmental policy. Broder v. Water Co., \n101 U.S. 274\n, 276, furnishes an analogy.'\n The present case is controlled by the same general principles. We cannot close our eyes to the fact that long before the act of 1866, highways in large number had been laid out by local, state, and territorial authority, upon and across the public lands. The practice of doing so had been so long continued, and the number of roads thus created was so great, that it is impossible to con- \n\n[284 U.S. 463, 473]\n\u00a0\n clude otherwise than that they were established and used with the full knowledge and acquiescence of the national government. These roads, in the fullest sense of the words, were necessary aids to the development and disposition of the public lands. Compare Flint & P. M. Ry. Co. v. Gordon, 41 Mich. 420, 428, 429, 2 N. W. 648; Town of Red Bluff v. Walbridge, 15 Cal. App. 770, 778, 779, 116 P. 77. They facilitated communication between settlements already made, and encouraged the making of new ones, increased the demand for additional lands, and enhanced their value. Governmental concurrence in and assent to the establishment of these roads are so apparent, and their maintenance so clearly in furtherance of the general policies of the United States, that the moral obligation to protect them against destruction or impairment as a result of subsequent grants follows as a rational consequence. The section of the act of 1866 granting rights of way for the construction of highways, no less than that which grants the right of way for ditches and canals, was, so far as then existing roads are concerned, a voluntary recognition and confirmation of pre- existing rights, brought into being with the acquiescence and encouragement of the general government.\n It follows that the laying out by authority of the state law of the road here in question created rights of continuing user to which the government must be deemed to have assented. Within the principle of the decisions of this court heretofore cited, they were such rights as the government in good conscience was bound to protect against impairment from subsequent grants. The reasons for so holding are too cogent to be denied. When, under that grant, the railroad company designated its right of way and built its line, it must be held to have done so with knowledge of the existence of the highway and subject to its continued maintenance and use.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","40":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHAMPLIN REFINING CO. v.

The District Court consisting of three judges, 28 U. S. C.  380 ( 28 USCA  380), denied plaintiff's application for a temporary injunction, and No. 122 is plaintiff's appeal from such refusal. As final judgment has been entered, this appeal will be dismissed. The final decree sustains certain regu- \n\n[286 U.S. 210, 225]\n\u00a0\n latory provisions of the act, but declares invalid some of its penal clauses. 51 F. (2d) 823. No. 485 is plaintiff's appeal from the first- mentioned portion of the decree, and No. 486 is defendants' appeal from the other part.\n The act prohibits the production of petroleum in such a manner or under such conditions as constitute waste. \n\n[286 U.S. 210, 226]\n\u00a0\n Section 1. Section 3 defines waste to include, in addition to its ordinary meaning, economic, underground, and surface waste, and waste incident to production in excess of transportation or marketing facilities or reasonable market demands, and empowers the commission to make rules and regulations for the prevention of such wastes. Whenever full production from any common source can only be under conditions constituting waste, one having the right to produce oil from such source may take only such proportion of all that may be produced therefrom without waste as the production of his wells bears to the total. The commission is authorized to regulate the taking of oil from common sources so as to prevent unreasonable discrimination in favor of one source as against others. Section 4. Gauges are to be taken for the purpose of determining production of wells. And the commission is directed to promulgate rules and regulations and to appoint such agents as may be necessary to enforce the act. Section 5. Since the passage of the act, the commission has from time to time made 'proration orders.'\n The court made its findings which, so far as need be given here, are indicated below:\n Plaintiff is engaged in Oklahoma in the business of producing and refining crude oil and transporting and marketing it and its products in intrastate and interstate commerce. It has oil and gas leases in both the Greater Seminole and the Oklahoma City fields. In each field it has nine wells. It owns a refinery having a daily capacity of 15,000 barrels of crude, and there produces gasoline and other products. It has approximately 735 tank cars, operates about 470 miles of pipe line, including adequate facilities for the transportation of crude oil from the fields to its refinery, and has about 256 wholesale and 263 retail gasoline stations in Oklahoma and other states which are supplied from its refinery. At the refinery it has gas- \n\n[286 U.S. 210, 227]\n\u00a0\n tight steel storage tanks with a total capacity of about 645,000 barrels. It does not use earthen storage or permit its crude to run at large, or waste any oil produced at its wells. All that it can produce will be utilized for commercial purposes. It also purchases much oil.\n The Greater Seminole area covers a territory fifteen to twenty by eight to ten miles, and has eight or more distinct pools in formations which do not overlie each other. The first pool was discovered in 1925, and by June 15, 1931, there were 2,141 producing wells having potential production of 564,908 barrels per day. The wells are separately owned and operated by 80 lessees. About three-fourths of them, owning wells with 40 per cent. of the total potential capacity of the field, have no pipe lines or refineries, and are entirely dependent for an outlet for their crude upon others who purchase and transport oil. Five companies, owning wells with about 13 per cent. of the potential production, have pipe lines or refinery connections affording a partial outlet for their production. Nineteen other companies own or control pipe lines extending into this area having a daily capacity of 468,200 barrels, and most of them from time to time purchase oil from other producers in the field.\n The Oklahoma City field, about 65 miles west of the Seminole, is about six by three miles, and part of it has been divided into small lots. All of plaintiff's leases are in that portion of the field. Oil was discovered there in December, 1928, and is being produced from four different formations more than 6,000 feet below the surface. In some parts of the area two or more overlie each other, and at many points the wells penetrate all overlying formations and are capable of producing from all of them. The field is not yet fully developed. June 15, 1931, there were 746 producing wells having an estimated potential of 2,987,993 barrels per day. These wells are owned by 53 different lessees. Thirty-six of them are wholly, and \n\n[286 U.S. 210, 228]\n\u00a0\n eight are partially, nonintegrated; they operate wells having about 90 per cent. of total potential production. The ten producing companies control pipe lines extending into this area with a carrying capacity of only 316, 000 barrels per day. Most of them from time to time purchase oil from other producers there.\n Crude oil and natural gas occur together or in close proximity to each other, and the gas in a pool moves the contents toward the point of least resistance. When wells are drilled into a pool, the oil and gas move from place to place. If some of the wells are permitted to produce a greater proportion of their capacity than others, drainage occurs from the less active to the more active. There is a heavy gas pressure in the Oklahoma City field. Where proportional taking from the wells in flush pools is not enforced, operators who do not have physical or market outlets are forced to produce to capacity in order to prevent drainage to others having adequate outlets. In Oklahoma prior to the passage of the act, large quantities of oil produced in excess of transportation facilities or demand therefor were stored in surface tanks, and, by reason of seepage, rain, fire, and evaporation, enormous waste occurred. Uncontrolled flow of flush or semiflush wells for any considerable period exhausts an excessive amount of pressure, wastefully uses the gas, and greatly lessens ultimate recovery. Appropriate utilization of gas energy is especially important in the Oklahoma City field where, because of the great depth of the wells, the cost of artificially recovering the oil would be very high.\n The first of the present series of proration orders took effect August 1, 1927, and applied to the then flush and semiflush pools in the Seminole. Similar orders have been in effect almost continuously since that time. Soon after the discovery of oil in the Oklahoma City field, production exceeded market demand there. The first proration order applicable in that field took effect October 15, \n\n[286 U.S. 210, 229]\n\u00a0\n 1929. Such orders usually covered short terms because of rapidly changing potential production and market demand from each of the pools.\n All the proration orders attacked by plaintiff were made pursuant to sections 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 of the act. Each, and the findings that it contained, were made after notice to all interested persons and were based upon evidence adduced at the hearings. The allegations of the complaint that the orders were made by the commission without having heard the testimony of witnesses under oath or any legal evidence were not sustained before the court.\n The commission construes the act as intended to empower it to limit production to the amount of the reasonable daily market demand and to require ratable production by all taking from the common source. In current orders it has found that waste of oil will result in the prorated areas unless production is limited to such demand. In order No. 5189, June 30, 1930, it found that the potential production in the United States was approximately 4,730,000 barrels per day, and that imports amounted to about 300,000 barrels, creating a supply of over 5,000,000 barrels as against an estimated domestic and export demand of 2,800,000 barrels. And it found that the existing stocks of crude in storage exceeded the needs of the industry, and that purchasers were unwilling to buy in Oklahoma for storage in any amount sufficient to take the surplus of potential production in that state. Similar findings are contained in the commission's subsequent orders.\n Based on findings of the daily potential of the Oklahoma City field and the amount of the market outlet for oil there, that is, the amount that could be produced without waste as defined by the act, plaintiff at the time of the trial was limited by the proration orders to about 6 per cent. of the total production of its wells in that field. And the orders also operated to restrict plaintiff \n\n[286 U.S. 210, 230]\n\u00a0\n to much less than the potential production of its nine wells in the Seminole pools.\n The court found that at all times covered by orders involved there was a serious potential overproduction throughout the United States and particularly in the flush and semiflush pools in the Seminole and Oklahoma City fields; that, if no curtailment were applied, crude oil for lack of market demand and adequate storage tanks would inevitably go into earthen storage and be wasted; that the full potential production exceeded all transportation and marketing facilities and market demands; that accordingly it was necessary, in order to prevent waste, that production of flush and semiflush pools should be restricted as directed by the proration orders, and that to enforce such curtailment, with equity and justice to the several producers in each pool, it was necessary to enforce proportional taking from each well and lease therein, and that, upon the testimony of operators and others, a comprehensive plan of curtailment and proration conforming to the rules prescribed in the act was adopted by the commission and was set forth in its orders.\n The commission, acting under section 5 of the act and with the consent of the Governor of the state, appointed one Collins as its umpire and agent, and constituted certain producers in each pool an operating committee to assist him in administering the prescribed rules and regulations. Later, one Bradford was appointed assistant umpire and agent. He spent all his time in the Oklahoma City field, leaving Collins to serve in the other prorated areas. They supervised the taking of gauges, ascertained daily production of prorated wells, checked the same against quantities transported, and kept complete records, to the end that wells in each pool should be operated in accordance with the commission's rules, and that violations be detected and reported. No appropriation had been made for the payment of umpires or agents. The commission did not have \n\n[286 U.S. 210, 231]\n\u00a0\n sufficient regular help for the administration of the proration orders. Members of operators' committees served without pay. Collins' salary and expenses have been paid by voluntary contributions of certain producers in the Seminole field, and Bradford's by voluntary contribution of producers in the Oklahoma City field. In each field a great majority of the producers joined to raise such funds, and contributions were prorated on the basis of production. This method of paying for such help has been followed since 1927, and at all times has been known to the commission, the Governor, and the public. In that period there have been two sessions of the Legislature, and it has not forbidden the practice or provided funds to pay for the work. Neither the umpire nor the members of the committee are public officers; they are mere agents or employees of the commission. The evidence does not establish that they have been guilty of favoritism or dishonesty, or that the commission has acted arbitrarily or discriminated in favor of the groups paying such agents, or that the plaintiff has suffered any injury by reason thereof.\n The commission has not discriminated against the Oklahoma City field or any other prorated area, nor in favor of the Seminole. The relation between potential production of each pool and the amount of crude oil that without waste could be produced therefrom was not the same in all prorated pools, and therefore the applicable percentages of curtailment varied. The same pipe lines and purchasers did not serve or take oil from all the pools, and in some the reasonable market demand was greater in proportion to potential production than in others. Some were prorated longer and had purchasers whose facilities do not extend to others. When oil was discovered in the Oklahoma City field the pools in the Seminole area were quite fully developed, and some had passed flush production. The latter is a more favored location \n\n[286 U.S. 210, 232]\n\u00a0\n in respect of trunk pipe lines and has a larger market demand, although the daily production of the former is greater. The constant bringing in of new wells in the Oklahoma City field has resulted in a continuous and rapid increase in the potential production of that field, whereas market demand for oil there has increased very slowly.\n None of the commission's orders has been made for the purpose of fixing the price of crude oil, or has had that effect. When the first order was made the price was more than two dollars per barrel, but it declined until at the time of the trial it was only thirty-five cents. In each case the commission has allowed to be produced the full amount of the market demand for each pool. It has never entered any order under section 2 of the act.\n It was not shown that the commission intended to limit the amount of oil entering interstate commerce for the purpose of controlling the price of crude oil or its products, or of eliminating plaintiff or any producer or refiner from competition, or that there was any combination among plaintiff's competitors for the purpose of restricting interstate commerce in crude oil or its products or that any operators' committee made up of plaintiff's competitors formulated the proration orders.\n The evidence before the trial court undoubtedly sustains the findings above referred to, and they are adopted here.\n\n 1. \nPlaintiff here insists that the act is repugnant to the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n We need not consider its suggestion that the business of production and sale of crude oil is not a public service, and that it does not devote its property to the public use. The proration orders do not purport to have been made, and in fact were not made, in respect of services or charges \n\n[286 U.S. 210, 233]\n\u00a0\n of any calling so affected with a public interest as to be subject to regulation as to rates or prices.\n Plaintiff insists that it has a vested right to drill wells upon the lands covered by its leases and to take all the natural flow of oil and gas therefrom so long as it does so without physical waste and devotes the production to commercial uses. But if plaintiff should take all the flow of its wells, there would inevitably result great physical waste even if its entire production should be devoted to useful purposes. The improvident use of natural gas pressure inevitably attending such operations would cause great diminution in the quantity of crude oil ultimately to be recovered from the pool. Other lessees and owners of land above the pool would be compelled, for self-protection against plaintiff's taking, also to draw from the common source, and so to add to the wasteful use of lifting pressure. And because of the lack, especially on the part of the nonintegrated operators, of means of transportation or appropriate storage and of market demand, the contest would, as is made plain by the evidence and findings, result in surface waste of large quantities of crude oil.\n In Oklahoma, as generally elsewhere, landowners do not have absolute title to the gas and oil that may permeate below the surface. These minerals, differing from solids in place such as coal and iron, are fugacious and of uncertain movement within the limits of the pool. Every person has the right to drill wells on his own land and take from the pools below all the gas and oil that he may be able to reduce to possession including that coming from land belonging to others, but the right to take and thus to acquire ownership is subject to the reasonable exertion of the power of the state to prevent unnecessary loss, destruction, or waste. And that power extends to the taker's unreasonable and wasteful use of natural gas \n\n[286 U.S. 210, 234]\n\u00a0\n pressure available for lifting the oil to the surface, and the unreasonable and wasteful depletion of a common supply of gas and oil to the injury to others entitled to resort to and take from the same pool. Ohio Oil Co. v. Indiana, \n177 \nU.S. 190\n, 20 S. Ct. 576; Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., \n220 \nU.S. 61, 77\n, 31 S. Ct. 337, Ann. Cas. 1912C, 160; Bandini Co. v. Superior Court, Los Angeles County, Cal., \n284 U.S. 8\n, 19 et seq., 52 S. Ct. 103; Brown v. Spilman, \n155 \nU.S. 665, 669\n, 15 S. Ct. 245; Walls v. Midland Carbon Co., \n254 \nU.S. 300, 323\n, 41 S. Ct. 118; Rich v. Doneghey, 71 Okl. 204, 177 P. 86, 3 A. L. R. 352; People v. Associated Oil Co., 211 Cal. 93, 100 et seq., 294 P. 717.\n It is not shown that the rule for proration prescribed in section 4 or any other provision here involved amounts to or authorizes arbitrary interference with private business or plaintiff's property rights, or that such statutory rule is not reasonably calculated to prevent the wastes specified in section 3.\n We put aside plaintiff's contentions resting upon the claim that section 2 or section 3 authorizes or contemplates directly or indirectly regulation of prices of crude oil. The commission has never made an order under section 2. The court found that none of the proration orders here involved were made for the purpose of fixing prices. The fact that the commission never limited production below market demand and the great and long continued downward trend of prices contemporaneously with the enforcement of proration strongly support the finding that the orders assailed have not had that effect. And if section 2 were to be held unconstitutional, the provisions on which the orders rest would remain in force. The unconstitutionality of a part of an act does not necessarily defeat or affect the validity of its remaining provisions. Unless it is evident that the Legislature would not have enacted those provisions which are within its power, independently of that which is not, the invalid part may be dropped if what is left is fully operative as a law. Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co., \n184 \nU.S. 540, 565\n, 22 S. Ct. 431; Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & \n\n[286 U.S. 210, 235]\n\u00a0\n Trust Co., \n158 \nU.S. 601, 635\n, 15 S. Ct. 912; Reagan v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., \n154 \nU.S. 362, 395\n, 396 S., 14 S. Ct. 1047; Field v. Clark, \n143 \nU.S. 649, 695\n, 696 S., allowed to be produced the full amount of the that the invalidity of any part of the act shall not in any manner affect the remaining portions. That discloses an intention to make the act divisible, and creates a presumption that, eliminating invalid parts, the Legislature would have been satisfied with what remained, and that the scheme of regulation derivable from the other provisions would have been enacted without regard to section 2. Williams v. Standard Oil Co., \n278 \nU.S. 235, 242\n, 49 S. Ct. 115, 60 A. L. R. 596; Crowell v. Benson, \n285 \nU.S. 22\n, 52 S. Ct. 285, 76 L. Ed. -; Utah Power & Light Co. v. Pfost, \n286 \nU.S. 165\n, 52 S. Ct. 548, 76 L. Ed. -. The orders involved here were made under other sections which provide a complete scheme for carrying into effect, through action of the commission, the general rules laid down in sections 3 and 4 for the prevention of waste. See Julian Oil & Royalties Co. v. Capshaw, 145 Okl. 237, 243, 292 P. 841. The validity of section 2 need not be considered.\n\n 2. \nPlaintiff contends that the act and proration orders operate to burden interstate commerce in crude oil and its products in violation of the commerce clause. Const. U. S. art. 1,  8, clause 3. It is clear that the regulations prescribed and authorized by the act and the proration established by the commission apply only to production and not to sales or transportation of crude oil or its products. Such production is essentially a mining operation, and therefore is not a part of interstate commerce, even though the product obtained is intended to be and in fact is immediately shipped in such commerce. Oliver Iron Co. v. Lord, \n262 \nU.S. 172, 178\n, 43 S. Ct. 526; Hope Gas Co. v. Hall, \n274 \nU.S. 284, 288\n, 47 S. Ct. 639; Foster-Fountain Packing Co. v. Haydel, \n278 \nU.S. 1, 10\n, 49 S. Ct. 1; Utah Power & Light Co. v. Pfost, supra. No violation of the commerce clause is shown.\n\n 3. \nPlaintiff assails the proration orders as unauthorized, lacking basis in fact, and arbitrary. But it failed to show that the orders were not based upon just and rea- \n\n[286 U.S. 210, 236]\n\u00a0\n sonable determinations of the governing facts; namely, that proportion of all crude oil, which may be produced from a common source without waste, that the production of plaintiff's wells bears to the total production from such source. Gauges were taken to determine the potential production of each well under rules and regulations prescribed by the commission and not shown to be inappropriate or liable to produce arbitrary or discriminatory results. It does not appear that the agents, umpires and committees, employed by the commission with the consent of the Governor, to enforce the provisions of the act, did more than to make investigations necessary to secure for the commission data required to make the proration directed by section 4, or that they acted otherwise than as faithful subordinates. Plaintiff has not shown that any act or omission of these agents subjected it to any disadvantage, or that the prorations were arbitrary or discriminatory in any respect. Obviously the commission, without agents and employees, could not make or enforce proration as directed by the act. The plaintiff is not entitled to have the commission's orders set at naught and the purposes of the act thwarted merely because, in the absence of legislative appropriations therefor, the salaries and expenses of agents or employees were paid out of funds raised by operators interested in having proration established under the statutory rule.\n Proration, required to prevent waste defined in sectiion 3 and to give effect to the rule prescribed by section 4, changes according to conditions existing from time to time and percentages valid at one time may be inapplicable, unjust, and arbitrary at another. Bluefield Co. v. Public Service Comm., \n262 \nU.S. 679, 693\n, 43 S. Ct. 675; Knoxville v. Water Co., \n212 \nU.S. 1, 19\n, 29 S. Ct. 148. As plaintiff has failed to prove that any order in force at the time of the trial was not in accordance with the rule prescribed by section 4 or otherwise invalid, the part of the decree from which it appealed will be affirmed. But \n\n[286 U.S. 210, 237]\n\u00a0\n such affirmance will not prevent it in an appropriate suit, a different state of facts being shown to exist, from having an injunction to restrain the enforcement of any order proved to be not authorized by the act or unjust and arbitrary and to operate to plaintiff's prejudice. Cf. Village of Euclid, Ohio, v. Ambler Co., \n272 \nU.S. 365, 395\n, 47 S. Ct. 114, 54 A. L. R. 1016\n\n\n\n No. 486.\n\n This is defendant's appeal from that part of the final decree that declares that sections 8 and 9 are not valid, and enjoins the Attorney General and county attorney from enforcing them. In its conclusions of law the court below declares that these sections in terms impose penalties for violation of the act, and not for violation of the orders of the commission; that sections 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are too indefinite and uncertain to warrant the imposition of the prescribed penalties, and that therefore both sections are invalid. The opinion points out that the act is a penal statute and also a regulatory measure to be supplemented by rules, regulations, and orders of the commission. It suggests that an operator or producer of oil from a common pool should not be required at the peril of severe penalties to determine whether in the operation of his oil well he is committing 'economic waste' or producing in excess of the 'reasonable market demands,' because these terms are not defined in the act and are of uncertain and doubtful meaning.\n\n 1. \nDefendants insist that no question concerning the validity of section 8 was before the court.\n We do not find any direct or definite allegation in the record that defendants have threatened or are about to cause plaintiff to be prosecuted under section 8. The court found that no prosecution had been commenced against plaintiff, its officers, or employees, under that section. There is no finding, or evidence sufficient to require one, that any such prosecution was imminent or contemplated. \n\n[286 U.S. 210, 238]\n\u00a0\n And the opinion states, in substance, that section 9 was the only provision of the act as a penal statute that was before the court.\n Equity jurisdiction will be exercised to enjoin the threatened enforcement of a state law which contravenes the Federal Constitution whenever it is essential in order effectually to protect property rights and the rights of persons against injuries otherwise irremediable; and in such a case a person, who as an officer of the state is clothed with the duty of enforcing its laws and who threatens and is about to commence proceedings, either civil or criminal, to enforce such a law against parties affected, may be enjoined from such action by a federal court of equity. Terrace v. Thompson, \n263 \nU.S. 197, 214\n, 44 S. Ct. 15, and cases cited. The burden was upon plaintiff seeking to invoke that rule definitely to show that, in order to protect its property rights, it was necessary to restrain defendants from enforcing section 8. Indeed the record before us indicates that plaintiff did not show that its rights were directly affected by any danger of prosecution under section 8, and therefore had no standing to invoke equity jurisdiction against its enforcement. Oliver Iron Co. v. Lord, supra, \n262 \nU.S. 180, 181\n, 43 S. Ct. 526; Massachusetts v. Mellon, \n262 \nU.S. 447, 488\n, 43 S. Ct. 597; AEtna Insurance Co. v. Hyde, \n275 U.S. 440\n, 446 et seq., 48 S. Ct. 174. Undoubtedly section 8, if invalid, may be severed from other parts of the act without affecting the provisions under which the prorations were made. Ohio Tax Cases, \n232 \nU.S. 576, 594\n, 34 S. Ct. 372. It follows that the lower court erred in passing upon the validity of that section, and the decree will be modified to declare that no question as to section 8 was before the court.\n\n 2. \nDefendants also maintain that no question as to the validity of section 9 was before the court.\n The record shows that plaintiff having taken crude oil in excess of the quantities allowed by the orders, the At- \n\n[286 U.S. 210, 239]\n\u00a0\n torney General, May 28, 1931, brought suit under section 9 in a state court to have a receiver appointed for its wells. And he procured that court to issue a temporary injunction restraining plaintiff from producing oil or violating the act or proration orders pending the appointment of a receiver. On the next day, plaintiff filed an amended and supplemental bill applying for a stay of enforcement of the proration orders pending the determination of the appeal, No. 122, to this court.\n June 13 the lower ocurt, upon plaintiff's application and affidavits submitted by the parties, found that plaintiff would suffer irreparable loss and injury unless the stay be granted. And it entered an order restraining the commission from instituting proceedings under section 6 of the act; restraining the Attorney General and county attorney from prosecuting under section 9 receivership proceedings against plaintiff; allowing plaintiff, on conditions which need not be stated here, to produce up to 10,000 barrels daily; and requiring the Attorney General immediately to have the state court injunction dissolved.\n It is clear, if section 9 is invalid, that the enforcement of its provisions pending the trial of this case would, as plaintiff claimed and the lower court found, have inflicted irreparable loss and damage upon the plaintiff. Defendants do not show or claim that the evidence does not establish that finding. The lower court had authority to stay the enforcement of the assailed orders pending the determination of plaintiff's appeal from the denial of its motion for temporary injunction. Hovey v. McDonald, \n109 \nU.S. 150, 161\n, 3 S. Ct. 136; Cotting v. Kansas City Stock-Yards Co. (C. C.) 82 F. 839, 857; Cumberland Tel. Co. v. Pub. Serv. Comm., \n260 \nU.S. 212\n, 43 S. Ct. 75; Virginian Ry. Co. v. United States, \n272 U.S. 658\n, 669 et seq., 47 S. Ct. 222. The jurisdiction of the court was properly invoked to determine whether plaintiff was entitled to protection against the shutting down \n\n[286 U.S. 210, 240]\n\u00a0\n and seizure of its wells and the sale of its oil pending the federal court's final decision.\n The Attorney General, though not required so to do, dismissed the suit in the state court, and here insists that, as no proceeding for a receiver was pending, the court erred in construing or passing on the validity of section 9. But, when regard is had to the facts and circumstances, it is clear that such dismissal did not require that court to hold that thereby the purpose of the Attorney General and county attorney had changed or that prosecution under the section was no longer imminent. The court was therefore properly called upon to pass upon its validity.\n\n 3. \nSection 9 provides: 'That in addition to any penalty imposed under the preceding section, any person, firm or corporation, violating the provisions of this act, shall be subject to have his or its producing property placed in the hands of a receiver by a court of competent jurisdiction, at the suit of the State through the Attorney General, or any county attorney, but such receivership shall only extend to the operating of producing wells and the marketing of the production thereof, under the provisions of this act.' The language used applies to violations of the act, and does not extend to violations of orders of the commission. It is plain and leaves no room for construction. A direct and unambiguous expression would be required to warrant an inference that the state Legislature intended to authorize the seizure of producers' wells and the sale of their oil for a mere violation of an order.\n The context and language used unmistakably show that the section imposes a penalty and is not a measure in the nature of, or in aid of remedy by, injunction to prevent future violations. By section 6 the commission, which in respect of such matters is a court of record (State Constitution, art. 9,  19), is empowered to punish as for contempt violation of the commission's orders by fines up to $500 per day during continuance of such violation. \n\n[286 U.S. 210, 241]\n\u00a0\n Sections 3498, 3499, C. O. S. 1921; Planters' Cotton & Ginning Co. v. West Bros., 82 Okl. 145, 147, 198 P. 855. And section 8 declares that, 'in addition to any penalty' that may be imposed by the commission for contempt, one directly or indirectly 'violating the provisions of this act' shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and be punished by fine or imprisonment. And similarly the liability under section 9 is for 'violating the provisions of this act' and is 'in addition to any penalty' imposed by section 8. Both deal with an act already committed. Moreover, liability under section 9 is not limited to seizure and operation of the offender's wells, but extends to the marketing of his oil. Absolute liability arises from a single transgression, and prosecution therefor may be had after all occasion for restraint of production has ceased. There is nothing in the act by which the duration of the receivership may be determined. An owner whose wells are so seized may not, as of right, have production reduced or withheld to await a better demand or have any voice as to quantities to be produced, or continue to have his oil transported by means of his own pipelines or other facilities, or have it sent to his own refinery or delivered in fulfillment of his contracts. Plainly such a taking deprives the owner of property without compensation, even if the moneys received for oil sold less expenses are accounted for by the receiver. The suit is prosecuted by the state to redress a public wrong denounced as crime. The provisions of section 9 are not consistent with any purpose other than to inflict punishment for violation of the act, and they must be deemed as intended to impose additional penalties upon offenders having oil producing wells. Boyd v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 616, 634\n, 6 S. Ct. 524; United States v. Reisinger, \n128 \nU.S. 398, 402\n, 9 S. Ct. 99; Huntington v. Attrill, \n146 \nU.S. 657, 667\n, 668 S., 13 S. Ct. 224.\n As section 9 declares that one 'violating the provisions of this act, shall be subject' to the prescribed penalties, it is necessary to refer to the regulatory provisions here in \n\n[286 U.S. 210, 242]\n\u00a0\n volved. Section 1 prohibits 'production of crude oil ... in such manner and under such conditions as to constitute waste.' Section 3 declares that, 'in addition to its ordinary meaning,' 'waste' shall include 'economic waste, underground waste, surface waste, and waste incident to the production of crude oil or petroleum in excess of transportation or marketing facilities or reasonable market demands.' Section 4 provides that whenever full production from any common source can only be obtained 'under conditions constituting waste,' then one having the right to produce from such source may take therefrom only such proportion 'that may be produced therefrom, without waste, as to the production of the well or wells' of such taker 'bears to the total production of such common source of supply.'\n There is nothing to support defendants' suggestion that the regulatory provisions of the act do not become operative until the commission has defined permissible production. As shown above, section 9 does not cover violations of orders of the commission. The validity of its provisions must be tested on the basis of the terms employed. In Connally v. General Construction Co., \n269 \nU.S. 385, 391\n, 46 S. Ct. 126, 127, this court has laid down the rule that governs here: 'That the terms of a penal statute creating a new offense must be sufficiently explicit to inform those who are subject to it what conduct on their part will render them liable to its penalties is a well-recognized requirement, consonant alike with ordinary notions of fair play and the settled rules of law; and a statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application violates the first essential of due process of law.'\n The general expressions employed here are not known to the common law or shown to have any meaning in the \n\n[286 U.S. 210, 243]\n\u00a0\n oil industry sufficiently definite to enable those familiar with the operation of oil wells to apply them with any reasonable degree of certainty. The meaning of the word 'waste' necessarily depends upon many factors subject to frequent changes. No act or definite course of conduct is specified as controlling, and, upon the trial of one charged with committing waste in violation of the act, the court could not foresee or prescribe the scope of the inquiry that reasonably might have a bearing or be necessary in determining whether in fact there had been waste. It is no more definite than would be a mere command that wells shall not be operated in any way that is detrimental to the public interest in respect of the production of crude oil. And the ascertainment of the facts necessary for the application of the rule of proportionate production laid down in section 4 would require regular gauging of all producing wells in each field; a work far beyond anything that reasonably may be required of a producer in order to determine whether in the operation of his wells as is committing an offense against the act.\n In the light of our decisions, it appears upon a mere inspection that these general words and phrases are so vague and indefinite that any penalty prescribed for their violation constitutes a denial of due process of law. It is not the penalty itself that is invalid, but the exaction of obedience to a rule or standard that is so vague and indefinite as to be really no rule or standard at all. United States v. L.

That the taking of crude oil or petroleum from any oil-bearing sand or sands in the State of Oklahoma at a time when there is not a market demand therefor at the well at a price equivalent to the actual value of such crude oil or petroleum is hereby prohibited, and the actual value of such crude oil or petroleum at any time shall be the average value as near as may be ascertained in the United States at retail of the byproducts of such crude oil or petroleum when refined less the cost and a reasonable profit in the business of transporting, refining and marketing the same, and the Corporation Commission of this State is hereby invested ( sic) with the authority and power to investigate and determine from time to time the actual value of such crude oil or petroleum by the standard herein provided, and when so determined said Commission shall promulgate its findings by its orders duly made and recorded, and publish the same in some newspaper of general circulation in the State. ( 7955.)\n  3. That the term 'waste' as used herein, in addition to its ordinary meaning, shall include economic waste, underground waste, surface waste, and waste incident to the production of crude oil or petroleum in excess of transportation or marketing facilities or reasonable market demands. The Corporation Commission shall have authority to make rules and regulations for the prevention of such wastes, and for the protection of all fresh water strata, and oil and gas bearing strata, encountered in any well drilled for oil. ( 7956.)\n  4. That whenever the full production from any common source of supply of crude oil or petroleum in this State can only be obtained under conditions constituting waste as herein defined, then any per- \n son, firm or corporation, having the right to drill into and produce oil from any such common source of supply, may take therefrom only such proportion of all crude oil and petroleum that may be produced therefrom, without waste, as the production of the well or wells of any such person, firm or corporation, bears to the total production of such common source of supply. The Corporation Commission is authorized to so regulate the taking of crude oil or petroleum from any or all such common sources of supply, within the State of Oklahoma, as to prevent the inequitable or unfair taking, from a common source of supply, of such crude oil or petroleum, by any person, firm, or corporation, and to prevent unreasonable discrimination in favor of any one such common source of supply as against another. ( 7957.)\n  5. That for the purpose of determining such production, a gauge of each well shall be taken under rules and regulations to be prescribed by the Corporation Commission, and said Commission is authorized and directed to make and promulgate, by proper order, such other rules and regulations, and to employ or appoint such agents with the consent of the Governor, as may be necessary to enforce this act. ( 7958).\n  6. That any person, firm, or corporation, or the Attorney General on behalf of the State, may institute proceedings before the Corporation Commission, or apply for a hearing before said Commission, upon any question relating to the enforcement of this act, and jurisdiction is hereby conferred upon said Commission to hear and determine the same. Said Commission shall set a time and place, when and where such hearing shall be had and give reasonable notice thereof to all persons or classes interested therein, by publication in some newspaper or newspapers, having general circulation in the State, and in addition thereto, shall cause reasonable notice in writing to be served personally on any person, firm or corporation complained against. In the exercise and enforcement of such jurisdiction, said Commission is authorized to determine any question or fact, arising hereunder, and to summon witnesses, make ancillary orders, and use mesne and final \n process, including inspection and punishment as for contempt, analogous to proceedings under its control over public service corporations, as now provided by law.

Such appeal may be taken by any person, firm or corporation, shown by the record to be interested therein, in the same manner and time as appeals are allowed by law from other orders of the Corporation Commission. Said orders so appealed from shall not be superseded by the mere fact of such appeal being taken, but shall be and remain in full force and effect until legally suspended or set aside by the Supreme Court. ( 7960.)\n  8. That in addition to any penalty that may be imposed by the Corporation Commission for contempt, any person, firm, or corporation, or any officer, agent or employee thereof, directly or indirectly violating the provisions of this act, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof, in a court of competent jurisdiction, shall be punished by a fine in any sum not to exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000. 00), or by imprisonment in the county jail not to exceed thirty (30) days, or by both fine and imprisonment. ( 7961.)\n  9. That in addition to any penalty imposed under the preceding section, any person, firm or corporation, violating the provisions of producing property be subject to have his or its producing property placed in the hands of a receiver by a court of competent jurisdiction, at the suit of the State through the Attorney General, or any county attorney, but such receivership shall only extend to the operating of producing wells and the marketing of the production thereof, under the provisions of this act.

Rawlins, of Chicago, Ill., and Thomas P. Littlepage, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner. \n\n[284 U.S. 296, 297]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Samuel E. Hirsch, of Chicago, Ill., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Thomas, an employee of the railroad company, in attempting to oil an electric motor while it was running, was injured by having his hand caught in the gears. The railroad was engaged in both intrastate and interstate commerce. The motor furnished power for hoisting coal into a chute, to be taken therefrom by, and for the use of, locomotive engines principally employed in the movement of interstate freight. An action was brought before the Industrial Commission of Illinois to recover compensation for the injury under the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Act of Illinois (Smith-Hurd Rev. St. 1931, c. 48,  138-172).\n The railroad company contended, and an arbitrator, appointed by the commission, found, that the work in which Thomas was engaged was in interstate commerce, that the case therefore was not within the state act, and the commission was without jurisdiction. The commission, on review, held otherwise, and awarded compensation aggregating $2,184.64. The court below affirmed the award upon a writ of certiorari authorized by state statute. The state Supreme Court, in the exercise of its discretion, declined to review the judgment; and the case is \n\n[284 U.S. 296, 298]\n\u00a0\n properly here on certiorari to the state circuit court. Amer. Ry. Exp. Co. v. Levee, \n263 \nU.S. 19, 20\n, 44 S. Ct. 11; West. Un. Tel. Co. v. Crovo, \n220 \nU.S. 364, 366\n, 31 S. Ct. 399.\n The contention that Thomas was employed in interstate commerce at the time of the injury rests upon the decisions of this court in Erie R. R. Co. v. Collins, \n253 \nU.S. 77\n, 40 S. Ct. 450, and Erie R. R. Co. v. Szary, \n253 \nU.S. 86\n, 40 S. Ct. 454. In the Collins Case, the employee, at the time of his injury, was operating a gasoline engine to pump water into a tank for the use of locomotives engaged in both interstate and intrastate commerce. In the Szary Case, the duty of the employee was to dry sand by the application of heat for the use of locomotives operating in both kinds of commerce; and he was so employed when injured. In each case this court held that the employee was engaged in interstate commerce at the time of the injury, within the terms of the Federal Employers' Liability Act (45 USCA  51-59).\n The only difference between those cases and this one is that here the work of the employee related to coal, while in the Collins Case it related to water, and, in the Szary Case, to sand. Obviously the difference is not one of substance, and, if the Collins and Szary Cases are followed, a reversal of the judgment below would result.\n But in Chi., Burlington & Q. R. R. v. Harrington, \n241 \nU.S. 177\n, 36 S. Ct. 517, 518, the injured employee was engaged in taking coal from storage tracks to bins or chutes for the use of locomotives used in the movement of both interstate and intrastate traffic; and this court held that the service was not in interstate commerce. After quoting the test for determining whether an employee is engaged in interstate commerce, laid down in Shanks v. Del., Lack. & Western R. R., \n239 \nU.S. 556, 558\n, 36 S. Ct. 188, L. R. A. 1916C, 797, namely, 'was the employee at the time of the injury engaged in interstate transportation, or in work so closely related to it as to be practically a part of it,' this court said (page 180 of 241 U. S., 36 S. Ct. 517, 518), 'Manifestly, there \n\n[284 U.S. 296, 299]\n\u00a0\n was no such close or direct relation to interstate transportation in the taking of the coal to the coal chutes. This was nothing more than the putting of the coal supply in a convenient place from which it could be taken as required for use.'\n We are unable to reconcile this decision with the rule deducible from the Collins and Szary Cases, and it becomes our duty to determine which is authoritative. From a reading of the opinion in the Collins Case, it is apparent that the test of the Shanks Case was not followed (see page 85 of 253 U. S., 40 S. Ct. 450); the words 'interstate commerce' being inadvertently substituted for the words 'interstate transportation.' The Szary Case is subject to the same criticism, since it simply followed the Collins Case. Both cases are out of harmony with the general current of the decisions of this court since the Shanks Case, Chicago & North Western Ry. Co. v. Bolle, \n284 \nU.S. 74\n, 52 S. Ct. 59, decided November 23, 1931, and they are now definitely overruled.\n The Harrington Case furnishes the correct rule, and, applying it, the judgment below must be affirmed. \n\n\n\n","42":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCLAIBORNE-ANNAPOLIS FERRY CO. v.

Gen., for appellees the United States and the Interstate Commerce Commission.\n Mr. Jonathan C. Gibson, of Washington, D. C., for appellee Chesapeake Beach Ry. Co.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Chesapeake Beach Railway Company, incorporated under Maryland laws and carrier by railroad subject to the Interstate Commerce Act, operates a line twenty-nine miles long which commences in the District of Columbia and passes southeastward through Maryland to Chesapeake Beach, twenty miles south of Annapolis. Connec- \n\n[285 U.S. 382, 386]\n\u00a0\n tions are made and freight interchanged with the Baltimore & Ohio and Pennsylvania Railroad. The charter empowers it to build and operate a railroad, etc., to construct docks, piers, bridges, and retaining walls along the bay shore and to 'own and employ steamboats or other vessels to connect the said railroads with other points by water communication.'\n December 26, 1929, proceeding under section 1, pars. 18, 19, 20, Interstate Commerce Act, as amended by Transportation Act 1920,  402, 49 U. S. C.  1(18-20) (49 USCA  1(18-20), the railway company petitioned the Interstate Commerce Commission to grant a certificate declaring 'that the present or future public convenience and necessity require or will require the construction, or operation, or construction and operation,' of the proposed addition or extension to its line. It stated the purpose 'to establish and operate, either directly or through a wholly owned subsidiary, a ferry for the transportation of passengers and property between the terminus of its said line at Chesapeake Beach, across Chesapeake Bay (16 miles), and a point on Trippe's Bay in Dorchester County, Maryland.' And it averred that 'the present and future public convenience and necessity require the establishment of the proposed ferry so as to afford a direct route by rail and water between the City of Washington and surrounding territory and the eastern shore of Maryland and also to provide a direct route for the transportation of automobiles and other vehicies between such points.'\n Notice was given to the Governor of Maryland; publication followed; all as required by the statute.\n The Claiborne-Annapolis Ferry Company (appellant), Maryland corporation, which operates a ferry from Annapolis across Chesapeake Bay, intervened and opposed the railway's application 'for the reason that the ferry service proposed to be operated by the applicant from \n\n[285 U.S. 382, 387]\n\u00a0\n Chesapeake Beach, Calvert County, Maryland, to a point on Trippe's Bay in Dorchester County, Maryland, will interfere with and hamper the efforts of your petitioner to give adequate service on its present route'-twenty miles further north. It denied that present and future public convenience and necessity requires establishment of the proposed ferry. No other party asked to intervene of offered objection to the requested certificate.\n The commission took evidence, heard the parties, made a report, and, August 1, 1930, certified 'that the present and future public convenience and necessity require the establishment by the Chesapeake Beach Railway Company of ferry service across Chesapeake Bay, in Calvert and Dorchester Counties, Md., as set forth in the application and said report.'\n The ferry company asked modification of the report, order, and certificate 'in such manner as the Commission may deem best to remove any doubt that the permission granted the applicant is only for an extension of railroad and not for the establishment of a general ferry service.' Among other things, the petition therefor stated: 'Your petitioner does not question the authority or the wisdom of this Honorable Commission in granting to the applicant a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity if the Commission construes the application of the Chesapeake Beach Railway Company in this case to be an application for a certificate authorizing an extension of its railroad. That, although the jurisdiction of this Honorable Commission in this case is limited in law to the grant of authority to the applicant to extend its line of railroad across the Chesapeake Bay by means of vessels, the Report, Order and Certificate filed in this case on their face would seem to indicate that the Commission has attempted to grant to the applicant authority to operate a general ferry across the Chesapeake Bay between the points known as Chesa- \n\n[285 U.S. 382, 388]\n\u00a0\n peake Beach, Calvert County, Maryland, and Trippe's Bay, Dorchester County, Maryland. While your petitioner does not suggest that this Honorable Commission has granted or attempted to grant to the applicant such a certificate, which could be granted only by the State of Maryland, yet the use of the language by the Commission as follows: 'It is hereby certified, That the present and future public convenience and necessity require the establishment by the Chesapeake Beach Railway Company of ferry service across Chesapeake Bay, in Calvert and Dorchester Counties, Md., as set forth in the application and said report' is, we most respectfully submit, misleading and confusing.' The request was denied October 13, 1930\n\n\n December 24, 1930, appellant here, as sole complainant, filed an original bill in the Supreme Court, District of Columbia, against the Chesapeake Beach Railway Company and all members of the Interstate Commerce Commission, individually and as members thereof. Subsequently, the United States were made parties defendant. No others asked to come in or were added. After stating complainant's business, and that the Interstate Commerce Commission had granted the above-described certificate of public convenience and necessity, the bill alleged that the order and certificate were null and without effect because the evidence before the commission showed the carrier lacked corporate power to operate the ferry and had no actual use therefor in connection with its road; also, that no present or future public necessity and convenience required such operation. The prayer asked an injunction prohibiting the proposed construction, maintenance, and operation, pursuant to the order of August 1, 1930, and 'that it be adjudged, ordered and decreed that the said order of the Interstate Commerce Commission of August 1, 1930, be set aside and annulled and held for naught.' Also, for general relief. \n\n[285 U.S. 382, 389]\n\u00a0\n The proceedings before the Interstate Commerce Commission, the evidence presented there, and its action were presented to the court. The cause was heard at a special session held by one judge of the Court of Appeals and two judges of the Supreme Court. 38 Stat. 208, 220, U. S. C., title 28,  47 (28 USCA  47), U. S. C. title 28,  345 (28 USCA  345). A final decree dismissed the bill and the cause is here upon direct appeal.\n Section 1, par. 3, Interstate Commerce Act, as amended by Transportation Act 1920,  400, 49 USCA  1(3), provides that the term 'railroad' as used in the Act, shall include all bridges, car floats, lighters, and ferries used by or operated in connection with any railroad. Paragraph 18 prohibits carriers from extending their lines, or constructing new ones, 'unless and until there shall first have been obtained from the commission a certificate that the present or future public convenience and necessity require or will require the construction, or operation, or construction and operation of such additional or extended line of railroad.' Paragraph 19 prescribes the procedure in respect of applications for such certificates. Paragraph 20: 'From and after issuance of such certificate, and not before, the carrier by railroad may, without securing approval other than such certificate, comply with the terms and conditions contained in or attached to the issuance of such certificate and proceed with the construction, operation, or abandonment covered thereby. Any construction, operation, or abandonment contrary to the provisions of this paragraph or of paragraph (18) or (19) of this section may be enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction at the suit of the United States, the commission, any commission or regulating body of the State or States affected, or any party in interest; and any carrier which, or any director, officer, receiver, operating trustee, lessee, agent, or person, acting for or employed by such carrier, who knowingly authorizes, consents to, or permits any violation of the provisions of this paragraph or of paragraph (18) of this \n\n[285 U.S. 382, 390]\n\u00a0\n section, shall upon conviction thereof be punished by a fine of not more than $5,000 or by imprisonment for not more than three years, or both.' Chapter 91, 41 Stat. 474, 477, 478; USCA, title 49,  1.\n Paragraphs 18, 19, and 20 were added to the Act to Regulate Interstate Commerce by the Transportation Act 1920,  402. They are restricted to carriers engaged in transporting persons or property in interstate and foreign commerce and were intended to affect intrastate commerce only as that may be incidental to the effective regulation of interstate commerce. Texas v. Eastern Texas R. R. Co., \n258 \nU.S. 204, 213\n, 217 S., 42 S. Ct. 281.\n Considering Texas v. Eastern R. R. Co., supra; Colorado v. United States, \n271 \nU.S. 153\n, 46 S. Ct. 452; Western Pacific California R. R. Co., v. Southern Pacific Company, \n284 \nU.S. 47\n, 52 S. Ct. 56, decided November 23, 1931; and Transit Commission of State of New York v. United States, \n284 \nU.S. 360\n, 52 S. Ct. 157 (January 4, 1932), it must be held that appellant is a 'party in interest' within the meaning of the statute capable of instituting the present proceeding. The bill disclosed that the proposed and permitted action might directly and adversely affect its welfare by changing the transportation situation. The cause is one of the class to be tried by a specially constituted district court, under the Urgent Deficiencies Act, Oct. 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 220 (U. S. C., title 28,  47 (28 USCA  47)).\n U. S. Code, title 28,  46, 28 USCA  46 (Judicial Code,  208), provides that suits to enjoin, set aside, annul, or suspend any order of the Interstate Commerce Commission shall be brought in the District Court against the United States, etc. Section 47 directs that they shall be heard before three judges, at least one of whom must be a circuit judge.\n It has been suggested that the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia cannot be regarded as a District Court, and judges of the Court of Appeals of the District are not circuit judges within those provisions; conse- \n\n[285 U.S. 382, 391]\n\u00a0\n quently the District Supreme Court had no jurisdiction to hear the present cause. The point is without merit.\n Section 43, title 18, District of Columbia Code 1929, provides that the Supreme Court 'shall possess the same powers and exercise the same jurisdiction as the district courts of the United States, and shall be deemed a court of the United States.' Federal Trade Commission v. Klesner, \n274 \nU.S. 145, 156\n, 47 S. Ct. 557, 560, held that section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, conferring jurisdiction on the Circuit Courts of Appeals to enforce, set aside, or modify orders of the commission, should be construed as conferring like jurisdiction upon the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia. 'The parallelism between the Supreme Court of the District and the Court of Appeals of the District, on the one hand, and the District Courts of the United States and the Circuit Courts of Appeals, on the other, in the consideration and disposition of cases involving what among the states would be regarded as within federal jurisdiction, is complete.' And see Pitts v. Peak (App. D. C.) 50 F.(2d) 485.\n Whether the railway company has corporate power to operate the proposed ferry is a question which cannot be considered in this proceeding. We think Congress never intended to impose upon the Interstate Commerce Commission the duty of determining matters of this nature before granting or withholding assent to the construction of an extension. Cleveland, etc., Ry. v. United States, \n275 \nU.S. 404, 414\n, 48 S. Ct. 189.\n The right of appellant ferry company to institute and maintain this proceeding rests wholly upon the permission granted by paragraph 20,  1. 'Any party in interest' may institute a suit to enjoin proposed construction, operation, or abandonment of a carrier's line unless it has obtained a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the Interstate Commerce Commission. In \n\n[285 U.S. 382, 392]\n\u00a0\n the absence of such certificate the doing of any of these things is declared to be unlawful-a crime subject to punishment by fine and imprisonment. And the permission is to apply to the court for an order to arrest the unlawful undertaking. The inhibition applies where there is no certificate in fact, or where the commission lacked power to grant the outstanding one because of insufficient evidence to support its findings or other reason. An invalid certificate would leave the situation as though none had issued. Chicago, R. I. & P. Ry. v. United States, \n274 \nU.S. 29\n, 47 S. Ct. 486.\n Here, undoubtedly, the commission had power to entertain and act upon the railway's petition, also to grant the certificate of public convenience and necessity upon sufficient evidence. If the record discloses such evidence, the certificate is not a nullity and the ferry company has no right now to demand decision of any other question.\n We think there was enough evidence-material and conflicting we may not pass upon its weight-to support the commission's conclusion. A large district on the Eastern Shore of Chesapeake Bay lacks adequate reilroad connection with Washington and points beyond. The possibilities of the proposed ferry, operated as a part of the railway's line, were disclosed and the commission's conclusion that material advantages to the public would result from the additional facilities for interstate transportation is not without support.\n The decree below is affirmed.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","43":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCONTINENTAL BAKING CO. v. WOODRING(1932)\nNo. 677\nArgued: Decided: May 23, 1932\n\n\n\n\n\n[286 U.S. 352, 354]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles R. Wilke, of Lincoln, Neb., and John C. Grover, of Kansas City, Mo., for appellants.\n\n\n[286 U.S. 352, 356]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Walter T. Griffin, of Topeka, Kan., for appellees. \n\n[286 U.S. 352, 357]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from a final decree of the District Court, composed of three judges, as required by statute, which dismissed, on motion, the bill of complaint in a suit brought to restrain the enforcement of the Motor Vehicle Act of Kansas. Laws of 1931, c. 236; Continental Baking Company v. Woodring, Governor (D. C.) 55 F.(2d) 347.\n Plaintiffs are 'private motor carriers of property,' operating bakeries in Kansas and other states and making deliveries to their customers by their own trucks. They contend that the statute, by reason of the obligations it imposes, and of its classifications, violates the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, the provision as to the privileges and immunities of citizens (article 4,  2), and the commerce clause (article 1,  8, cl. 3), of the Federal Constitution.\n The statute relates to motor vehicles, comprehensively defined, when used upon any public highway of the state for the purpose of transporting persons or property. It applies to those who are engaged in such transportation as 'public motor carriers' of property and passengers, 'contract motor carriers' of property and passengers, and 'private motor carriers of property.' 'Public motor carrier' means one transporting 'for hire as a common carrier having a fixed termini or route.' 'Contract motor carrier' of property means one who is not a 'public motor carrier' and is engaged in transportation 'for hire as a business.' 'Private motor carrier of property' means one transporting 'property sold or to be sold by him in furtherance of any private commercial enterprise.' Section 1.1 The act does not apply \n\n[286 U.S. 352, 358]\n\u00a0\n to (1) motor carriers operating wholly within any city or village of the state, (2) private motor carriers operating within a radius of twenty-five miles beyond the corporate limits of such city or village, (3) the transportation of live stock and farm products to market 'by the owner thereof or supplies for his own use in his own motor vehicle,' and (4) the transportation of children to and from school. Section 2.2 Public motor carriers are declared to be common carriers within the meaning of the public utility laws of the state and subject to regulation accord- \n\n[286 U.S. 352, 359]\n\u00a0\n ingly, including that of rates and charges. Section 3.3 Public motor carriers, contract motor carriers, and private motor carriers of property are forbidden to operate motor vehicles for compensation on any public highway except in accordance with the provisions of the act. Section 4.4 The public service commission is vested with supervision of these carriers in all matters affecting their relationship 'with the traveling and shipping public' and, specifically, to prescribe regulations in certain particulars hereinafter mentioned. Section 5.5 All transportation charges made \n\n[286 U.S. 352, 360]\n\u00a0\n by public motor carriers must be just and reasonable. Section 6. Public motor carriers in intrastate commerce must obtain certificates of convenience and necessity. Section 7. Contract motor carriers and private motor carriers of property, 'either in intrastate commerce or in interstate commerce,' must obtain licenses. Application therefor must give information as to ownership, financial condition and equipment, and such further facts as the public service commission may request. The commission is required, upon receipt of this information and on compliance with the regulations and payment of fees, to issue a license. Section 8.6 In addition to license fees, public motor carriers, contract motor carriers, and private motor carriers of property must pay a tax of 'five-tenths mill per gross ton mile,' computed in the manner described, for the administra- \n\n[286 U.S. 352, 361]\n\u00a0\n tion of the act and for the maintenance and reconstruction of the public highways. Section 13.7 Every motor carrier covered by the act must keep daily records, upon prescribed forms, of all vehicles used, and must certify under oath summaries showing the ton miles traveled monthly and such other information as the commission may require. Section 15.8 The commission is empowered to enforce the provisions of the act and to inspect the books and documents of all carriers to which the act applies. Section 16.9 \n\n[286 U.S. 352, 362]\n\u00a0\n Of the moneys received under the provisions of the act, 20 per cent. is to be applied to administration and enforcement, and the remainder is to be placed to the credit of the state's highway fund. Section 18.10 No certificate or license is to be issued by the commission to any of the described motor carriers until a liability insurance policy approved by the commission has been filed 'in such reasonable sum as the commission may deem necessary to adequately protect the interests of the public with due regard to the number of persons and amount of property involved, which liability insurance shall bind the obligors thereunder to pay compensation for injuries to persons and loss of or damage to property resulting from the negligent operation of such carrier.' No other or additional bonds or licenses than those prescribed in the act are to be required by any city or town or other agency of the state. Section 21.11 The commission may promul- \n\n[286 U.S. 352, 363]\n\u00a0\n gate rules relating to the maintenance of vehicle units in a safe and sanitary condition, and making provision as to qualifications and hours of service of operators and for the reporting of accidents. Section 22.12 Violation of the act or of any order of the commission is made a misdemeanor. Section 23. 13 \n\n[286 U.S. 352, 364]\n\u00a0\n The general situation to which the statute is addressed is thus described by the District Court (55 F.(2d) at pages 350, 351): 'The state of Kansas has constructed at great expense a system of improved highways. These have been built in part by special benefit districts and in part by a tax on gasoline sold in the state and by license fees exacted of all resident owners of automobiles. These public highways have become the roadbeds of great transportation companies, which are actively and seriously competing with railroads which provide their own roadbeds; they are being used by concerns such as the plaintiffs for the daily delivery of their products to every hamlet and village in the state. The highways are being pounded to pieces by these great trucks which, combining weight with speed, are making the problem of maintenance well-nigh insoluble. The Legislature but voiced the sentiment of the entire state in deciding that those who daily use the highways for commercial purposes should pay an additional tax. Moreover, these powerful and speedy trucks are the menace of the highways.'\n It is apparent that Kansas, in framing its legislation to meet these conditions, did not attempt to compel private carriers to become public carriers. The Legislature did not purport to put both classes of carriers upon an identical footing and subject them to the same obligations. See Smith v. Cahoon, \n283 \nU.S. 553, 563\n, 51 S. Ct. 582; Michigan Public Utilities Commission v. Duke, \n266 U.S. 570\n, 576-578, 45 S. Ct. 191, 36 A. L. R. 1105; Frost & Frost Trucking Co. v. Railroad Commission, \n271 \nU.S. 583, 592\n, 46 S. Ct. 605, 47 A. L. R. 457. It recognized and applied distinctions. 'Public' or common carriers, and not private carriers, are required to obtain certificates of public convenience and necessity. The former, and not the latter, are put under regulations as to fares and charges. While, with respect to certain matters, both are placed under the general authority given to the public service commission to prescribe regulations, it does not appear from the bill of complaint that any regulation has \n\n[286 U.S. 352, 365]\n\u00a0\n been prescribed, or that the commission has made any order, of which private carriers may properly complain. The statute itself, however, does impose certain obligations upon private motor carriers of property, and the first question is whether these provisions violate the constitutional restrictions invoked.\n First. 'Private motor carriers of property' must obtain a license, pay a tax, and file a liability insurance policy. The public service commission has no authority to refuse a license if the described information is given with the application, the liability insurance policy is filed, and there is compliance with the regulations and payment of the license fee. Section 8.14 It is not shown that either regulations or license fees are unreasonable. The tax and the license fees, over the expenses of administration, go to the highway fund of the state for the maintenance and reconstruction of the highways the carrier is licensed to use. The insurance policy is to protect the interests of the public by securing compensation for injuries to persons and property from negligent operations of the carriers. Section 21.15 The District Court approved an earlier decision, also by a District Court of three judges, that this provision was not intended to require 'security for passengers or cargoes carried, but only to protect third persons from injuries to their persons or property.' 55 F.(2d) at page 357; Louis v. Boynton (D. C.) 53 F. (2d) 471, 473. This is an admissible construction, and no different application of the provision appears to have been made by either the state court or the commission.\n Requirements of this sort are clearly within the authority of the state which may demand compensation for the special facilities it has provided and regulate the use of its highways to promote the public safety. Reasonable regulations to that end are valid as to intrastate \n\n[286 U.S. 352, 366]\n\u00a0\n traffic, and, where there is no discrimination against the interstate commerce which may be affected, do not impose an unconstitutional burden upon that commerce. Motor vehicles may properly be treated as a special class, because their movement over the highways, as this Court has said, 'is attended by constant and serious dangers to the public, and is also abnormally destructive to the ways themselves.' Hendrick v. Maryland, \n235 \nU.S. 610, 622\n, 35 S. Ct. 140, 142; Kane v. New Jersey, \n242 \nU.S. 160, 167\n, 37 S. Ct. 30; Michigan Public Utilities Commission v. Duke, supra; Interstate Busses Corporation v. Blodgett, \n276 \nU.S. 245, 250\n, 251 S., 48 S. Ct. 230; Sprout v. South Bend, \n277 \nU.S. 163, 169\n, 170 S., 48 S. Ct. 502, 62 A. L. R. 45; Hodge Drive-It-Yourself Company v. Cincinnati, \n284 \nU.S. 335, 337\n, 52 S. Ct. 144.\n Objection to the tax is made on the score of uncertainty, in view of the exemptions of motor carriers operating wholly within a city or village, and of private motor carriers operating 'within a radius of twenty five miles beyond the corporate limits of such city, or any village.' Section 2. 16 This objection is distinct from that of unconstitutional discrimination, shortly to be considered. We perceive no uncertainty by reason of the first exemption which definitely applies to cases of operation exclusively within the limits of a city or village. As to the second exemption, the state authorities assert, and it is not denied, that, in the administration of the act, the public service commission has taken the exemption to mean that 'so long as private carriers operate within a radius of twenty-five miles of their home city or base they are not subject to the payment of the fee. Even though they have made trips outside the twenty-five mile radius, which subjects them to the law and to the payment of tax for such trips, they are still not subject to the payment of a tax for trips made entirely within the \n\n[286 U.S. 352, 367]\n\u00a0\n twenty-five mile zone.' The District Court expressed the opinion that the provision 'can and should be construed as intending to exempt from the tax those carriers who either have an established place of business or an established delivery point, with trucks domiciled in any city, and that such trucks may operate in that city and within a 25-mile radius free of any tax,' and the court said that it agreed with the construction of the commission that, 'if such a truck goes beyond the 25-mile limit,' 'only the excess is taxable.' 55 F.(2d) at page 356. On this construction, it cannot be said that there is a fatal defect in definition. The tax itself is certain, as in the process of laying the tax it is necessarily made certain before any penalty can be imposed for nonpayment. The tax is to be assessed and collected on the basis of gross ton miles, and this mileage is to be computed in a prescribed manner. When the tax is assessed, the ordinary remedies will be available for contesting it, if the assessment is not in accordance with the law. No impropriety in assessment or in collection as to these appellants, or denial of remedy, is disclosed. Nor is the amount of the tax, which the state could lay in its discretion for the lawful purposes declared, shown to be unreasonable.\n The objection to the authority given to the public service commission 'to regulate and supervise the accounts, schedules, service and method of operation,' 'to prescribe a uniform system and classification of accounts,' to require the filing of reports and data, and generally to 'supervise and regulate' all the carriers to which the act applies 'in all matters affecting the relationship' between such carriers and 'the traveling and shipping public (section 5)17 similarly raises no question which can now be \n\n[286 U.S. 352, 368]\n\u00a0\n considered, as there has been no action or threat of action, so far as appears, by the commission giving ground for the contention that the constitutional rights of the appellants have been or will be invaded. This is not a case like that of Smith v. Cahoon, supra, where the requirements of the statute itself, as distinguished from action of the state commission under it, had such an objectionable generality and vagueness as to the obligations imposed upon private carriers that they provided no standard of conduct that it was possible to know and exposed the persons concerned to criminal prosecution before any suitably definite requirement had been prescribed. In the instant case, the statute itself clearly distinguishes in fundamental matters between the obligations of public and private carriers and places upon the latter certain requirements which the state had power to impose. Whatever uncertainty may exist with respect to possible regulations of the commission will be resolved as regulations are promulgated. If any of these transcend constitutional limits, appellants will have their appropriate remedy. The provision as to keeping records and furnishing reports and information, and as to maintaining uniform methods of accounting, may, in the case of private carriers of property, be assumed, until the contrary appears, to have relation, as the state authorities assert, to the determination of the amount of the tax to which the private carriers are properly liable. The general grant of authority to the public service commission over all the carriers described, including both public and private carriers, in all matters affecting their relationship with the traveling and shipping public, we think should be taken distributively in the light of the context and of the manifest distinctions in the relation of different sorts of carriers to the public. The distinction made by the statute between public and private carriers with respect to the obtaining of certificates of public con- \n\n[286 U.S. 352, 369]\n\u00a0\n venience and necessity, and as to rates and charges, indicates the intention to keep separate the special responsibilities of public carriers from the more limited but still important duties which are owing as well by private carriers, in protecting the public highways from misuse and in insuring safe traffic conditions, and there is no reason to conclude that the authority given to the commission will not be viewed and exercised accordingly. We agree with the District Court that the last clause of section 5, providing that 'all laws relating to the powers, duties, authority and jurisdiction of the public service commission over common carriers are hereby made applicable to all such motor carriers except as herein otherwise specifically provided,' applies to public and not to private carriers.\n The duty laid upon the commission (section 22)18 to insist that motor vehicles shall be maintained 'in a safe and sanitary condition,' to prescribe qualifications of operators as to age and hours of service, and to require the reporting of accidents, has manifest reference to considerations of safety. The terms of the statute do not require action by the commission which does not have reasonable relation to that purpose. In this respect, as well as in relation to the other matters above- mentioned, appellants had no right to resort to equity merely because of an anticipation of improper or invalid action in administration. Smith v. Cahoon, supra, at page 562 of 283 U. S., 51 S. Ct. 582, 587; Dalton Adding Machine Co. v. State Corporation Commission, \n236 \nU.S. 699, 700\n, 701 S., 35 S. Ct. 480; Champlin Refining Company v. Corporation Commission, \n286 \nU.S. 210\n, 52 S. Ct. 559, 76 L. Ed. -, decided May 16, 1932\n\n\n Second. The challenged exemptions are set forth in section 2.19 The first, which excludes from the application of the act motor carriers who operate wholly within a city or village of the state, has an obviously reasonable basis, as such operations are subject to local regulations. In \n\n[286 U.S. 352, 370]\n\u00a0\n protecting its highway system, the state was at liberty to leave its local communities unembarrassed, and was not bound either to override their regulations or to impose burdensome additions.\n The second exemption extends only to certain private motor carriers. Under the construction above stated, the exemption provides immunity from the provisions of the act for carriers of that class who have an established place of business or base of operations within a city or village and operate within a radius of twenty-five miles beyond the municipal limits. The first question is whether the state, in legislation of this sort, may provide for such carriers an exempt zone contiguous to its municipalities. We find no difficulty in concluding that it may. As the District Court pointed out, there is 'a penumbra of town' that is outside municipal limits, and delivery trucks, of those having establishments within the municipalities, in their daily routine repeatedly cross these limits 'in going back and forth into these outlying additions.' The court found that trucks of that class 'use the state improved highways but slightly, for the streets of these outlying additions are not generally a part of the state system.' The District Court also directed attention to the fact that 'the practical difficulty of keeping track of the mileage of such delivery trucks as they cross back and forth is well-nigh insuperable' and that 'the revenue to be gained from such use would be insignificant and the cost of collection large.' We think that the Legislature could properly take these distinctions into account, and that there was a reasonable basis for differentiation with respect to that class of operations. In this view, the question is simply whether the fixing of the radius at twenty-five miles is so entirely arbitrary as to be unconstitutional. It is obvious that the Legislature in setting up such a zone would have to draw the line somewhere, \n\n[286 U.S. 352, 371]\n\u00a0\n and unquestionably it had a broad discretion as to where the line should be drawn. In exercising that discretion, the Legislature was not bound to resort to close distinctions or to attempt to define the particular differentiations as to traffic conditions in territory bordering on its various municipalities. Ohio Oil Company v. Conway, \n281 \nU.S. 146, 159\n, 50 S. Ct. 310. This Court has frequently held that the mere selection of a mileage basis in the regulation of railroads cannot be considered a violation of the Federal Constitution. The practical convenience of such a classification is not to be disregarded in the interest of a purely theoretical or scientific uniformity. Columbus & Greenville Ry. Co. v. Miller, \n283 \nU.S. 96, 101\n, 51 S. Ct. 392; Dow v. Beidelman, \n125 \nU.S. 680, 691\n, 8 S. Ct. 1028; New York, New Haven & Hartford R. Co. v. New York, \n165 \nU.S. 628, 633\n, 634 S., 17 S. Ct. 418; Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Arkansas, \n219 \nU.S. 453\n, 31 S. Ct. 275; Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co. v. Conley, \n230 \nU.S. 513, 522\n, 33 S. Ct. 985; St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern Ry. Co. v. Arkansas, \n240 \nU.S. 518, 521\n, 36 S. Ct. 443; Wilson v. New, \n243 \nU.S. 332, 341\n, 354 S., 37 S. Ct. 298, L. R. A. 1917E, 938, Ann. Cas. 1918A, 1024; Clark v. Maxwell, \n282 \nU.S. 811\n, 51 S. Ct. 211; Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry. Co. v. United States, \n284 \nU.S. 80, 93\n, 52 S. Ct. 87. No controlling considerations have been presented to overcome the presumption attaching to the legislative action in this case in fixing the radius of the zone for the purpose of establishing an exemption otherwise valid.\n The third exemption applies to 'the transportation of livestock and farm products to market by the owner thereof or supplies for his own use in his own motor vehicle.' In Smith v. Cahoon, supra, the state statute, which applied to all carriers for compensation over regular routes, including common carriers, exempted from its provisions 'any transportation company engaged exclusively in the transporting agricultural, horticultural, dairy or other farm products and fresh and Salt Fish and Oysters and Shrimp from the point of production to the \n\n[286 U.S. 352, 372]\n\u00a0\n assembling or shipping point enroute to primary market, or to motor vehicles used exclusively in transporting or delivering dairy products.' The stated distinction was thus established between carriers, and between private carriers, notwithstanding the fact that they were 'alike engaged in transporting property for compensation over public highways between fixed termini or over a regular route.' The Court was unable to find any justification for this discrimination between carriers in the same business, that is, 'between those who carry for hire farm products, or milk or butter, or fish or oysters, and those who carry for hire bread or sugar, or tea or coffee, or groceries in general, or other useful commodities.'\n The distinction in the instant case is of a different sort. The statute does not attempt to impose an arbitrary discrimination between carriers who transport property for hire, or compensation, with respect to the class of products they carry. The exemption runs only to one who is carrying his own live stock and farm products to market or supplies for his own use in his own motor vehicle. In sustaining the exemption, the District Court referred to the factual basis for the distinction. 'The Legislature knew,' said the court 'that as a matter of fact farm products are transported to town by the farmer, or by a nonexempt 'contract carrier' employed by him. The Legislature knew that as a matter of fact the use of the highways for the transportation of farm products by the owner is casual and infrequent and incidental; farmers use the highways to transport their products to market ordinarily but a few times a year. The Legislature rightly concluded that the use of the highways for carrying home his groceries in his own automobile is adequately compensated by the general tax imposed on all motor vehicles.' 55 F.(2d) at page 352. And the court properly excluded from consideration mere hypothetical \n\n[286 U.S. 352, 373]\n\u00a0\n and fanciful illustrations of possible discriminations which had no basis in the actual experience to which the statute was addressed. The court found a practical difference between the case of the appellants 'who operate fleets of trucks in the conduct of their business and who use the highways daily in the delivery of their products to their customers,' and that of 'a farmer who hauls his wheat or live stock to town once or twice a year.' The Legislature in making its classification was entitled to consider frequency and character of use and to adapt its regulations to the classes of operations, which by reason of their habitual and constant use of the highways brought about the conditions making regulation imperative and created the necessity for the imposition of a tax for maintainance and reconstruction. As the Court said in Alward v. Johnson, \n282 \nU.S. 509, 513\n, 514 S., 51 S. Ct. 273, 274, 75 A. L. R. 9: 'The distinction between property employed in conducting a business which requires constant and unusual use of the highways and property not so employed is plain enough.' See, also, Bekins Van Lines v. Riley, \n280 \nU.S. 80, 82\n, 50 S. Ct. 64; Carley & Hamilton v. Snook, \n281 \nU.S. 66, 73\n, 50 S. Ct. 204, 68 A. L. R. 194.\n The fourth exemption is 'of transportation of children to and from school.' The distinct public interest in this sort of transportation affords sufficient reason for the classification. The state was not bound to seek revenue for its highways from that source, and, without violating appellants' constitutional rights, could avail itself of other means of assuring safety in that class of cases.\n Appellants also refer to the provision of section 21, with respect to liability insurance, that 'no other or additional bonds or licenses' shall be required 'by any city or town or other agency of the state.' The propriety of this avoidance of a duplication of security is apparent.\n Decree affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Section 1.

UNITED STATES(1932)\nNo. 560\nArgued: April 14, 1932Decided: May 16, 1932\n\n\n\n\n[286 U.S. 290, 291]\n\u00a0\n Mr. George E. H. Goodner, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Charles B. Rugg, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n\n\n[286 U.S. 290, 292]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n For the year 1920 the petitioner filed a consolidated income tax return for itself and the Cimarron and Northwestern Railway Company and paid the tax shown as due. Subsequently a claim for refund was prosecuted, whereupon the Commissioner made a reaudit and added to the railway's income some $27,000. The refund granted was diminished by the amount of the additional tax resulting from the increase in income so determined. The petitioner objected to this reduction and brought suit \n\n[286 U.S. 290, 293]\n\u00a0\n in the Court of Claims to recover the full amount claimed to be refundable. The railway company is a short-line carrier whose road was in possession and control of the United States and operated by the Director General of Railroads from December 28, 1917, to June 3, 1918, when it was relinquished, and thereafter throughout the remainder of the period of federal control operated by its owner. Approximately $25,000 of the additional income determined by the Commissioner consisted of a payment to the railway pursuant to an award of the Interstate Commerce Commission under the terms of section 204 of the Transportation Act 1920.1 This section provided for such an award and payment to a railroad which during any part of the period of federal control competed for traffic, or connected, with one under federal control, and sustained a deficit in operating income for that portion of the period during which it operated its own railroad. The act directed the Commission to compare the results of such operation with those of the test period, defined as the three years ending June 30, 1917; and, if less favorable during the period of federal control than during the test period, to award an amount calculated as prescribed by the section. The Commission made an award and the Secretary of the Treasury paid the railway.\n The petitioner asserted (1) that the sum received was not income within the intent of the Sixteenth Amendment or section 213 of the Revenue Act of 1918, 40 Stat. 451; (2) that, if income, it was not taxable for 1920, as held by the Commissioner, but for 1923, the year in which the amount was determined and paid. The Court of Claims denied recovery.\n What we have said in Texas & Pacific Railway Co. v. United States (No. 634), \n286 \nU.S. 285\n, 52 S. Ct. 528, 76 L. Ed. -, decided this day, is determinative of the first contention. Section 209 of the Transportation Act 1920 (49 USCA  77) guaranteed the payment of any deficiency below a \n\n[286 U.S. 290, 294]\n\u00a0\n fixed minimum of operating income for the six months ensuing the termination of federal control to railroads which had been taken over by the United States. By the terms of section 204 payment was to be made to railroads not under federal control of a proportion of any operating deficit suffered in the period of such control. The underlying purpose of Congress was the same in both cases. Railroads falling within section 204 were principally short lines. They were known to have suffered serious losses in income due to routing arrangements and other administrative measures made necessary by government operation of the larger railroad systems. The Transportation Act did not contemplate that the payments to be made pursuant to section 204 were in any sense just compensation for the taking of property. There was no room for such reimbursement, as the short lines were during the time to which the section applied in the possession and management of their owners. Congress, nevertheless, realized that federal operation had caused them consequential losses, at least partial redress for which was the purpose of the section where actual deficits in income had resulted. For the reasons set forth in No. 634, we hold that these payments were not subsidies or bonuses, but were income within the intent of the amendment and the statute.\n The petitioner kept its accounts upon the accrual basis. The government insists, and the Court of Claims held, that the right to payment having ripened in 1920, the taxpayer should have returned the estimated award under section 204 as income for that year. The petitioner replies that a determination whether it would receive any award under the section and, if so, the amount of it, depended on so many contingencies that no reasonable estimate could have been made in 1920, and that the sum ultimately ascertained should be deemed income for 1923, the year of the award and payment. \n\n[286 U.S. 290, 295]\n\u00a0\n The Transportation Act took effect on February 28, 1920. On June 10 the Interstate Commerce Commission issued general instructions governing the compilation and submission of data by carriers entitled to awards under section 204. The petitioner correctly states that at the date of the act's adoption no railroad had a vested right in any amount; until the Commission made an award nothing could be paid, no proceeding was available to compel an allowance, or to determine the elements which should enter into the calculation. In short, says the petitioner, the carrier had no rights, but was dependent solely upon the Commission's exercise of an unrestrained discretion, and until an award was made nothing accrued. But we think that the function of the Commission under the act was ministerial, to ascertain the facts with respect to the carrier's operating income by a comparison of the experience during the test period with that during the term of federal control. The right to the award was fixed by the passage of the Transportation Act. What remained was mere administrative procedure to ascertain the amount to be paid. Petitioner's right to payment ripened when the act became law. What sum of money that right represented is, of course, a different matter.\n The petitioner says that at the date of the passage of the act it was impossible to predict that any award would be made to the railway, and, assuming one would eventuate, its amount could not be estimated, for the reason that the principles upon which awards were to be made had to be settled by the Commission and were not finally formulated until 1923. The government insists that, while adjustments or settlement of principles by the Commission might vary the amount to be awarded, the petitioner's case presented problems not differing from those confronting many business concerns which keep accounts on an accrual basis and have to estimate for the tax year the amount to be received on transactions undoubtedly \n\n[286 U.S. 290, 296]\n\u00a0\n allocable to such year. Admitting there might be differences and discrepancies between the railway's estimate and the amount awarded by the Commission, these, says the government, could, as in similar cases, have been adjusted by an additional assessment or a claim for refund after final determination of the amount due.\n The case does not fall within the principle that, where the liability is undetermined in the tax year, the taxpayer is not called upon to accrue any sum (Lucas v. American Code Co., \n280 \nU.S. 445\n, 50 S. Ct. 202), but presents the problem whether the taxpayer had in its own books and accounts data to which it could apply the calculations required by the statute and ascertain the quantum of the award within reasonable limits.\n The carriers kept their accounts according to standards prescribed by the Commission; and these necessarily were the source of information requisite for ascertainment of the results of operation in the two periods to be compared. In the calculation for two such brief periods allowance had to be made for the fact that certain operating charges entered in the books would not accurately reflect true income. Such, for instance, were maintenance charges and those to reserve accounts. The enormous increase in labor and material costs after the expiration of the test period had also to be considered in comparing charges for costs of repairs and renewals in the two periods. Section 204 incorporated by reference the terms of section 209 applicable to the method of treating such items, and the latter in turn referred to the relevant provisions of section 5(a) of the standard operating contract between the Director General and the various railroads. As might have been expected, the general principles thus formulated did not cover in detail questions of fact, the solution of which required is some degree the exercise of opinion and judgment. Thus difference might fairly arise as to when re- \n\n[286 U.S. 290, 297]\n\u00a0\n serve accounts ought to be closed out, as to how much of the sum actually expended for maintenance within a given time was properly allocable to that period, and how much to later years; at what price renewals and replacements should be charged in view of the rapidly mounting cost of material; what factor of difference should be allowed for the efficiency of labor in the pre-war and postwar periods. The petitioner points to the fact that these questions were raised by the railroads under section 209, that the Commission gave extended consideration to them, and that, as respects sundry of them, the applicable principles were not settled until 1921, 1922, and 1923. Petitioner might have added that the Commission, while attempting as far as possible to formulate general principles applicable to large groups of carriers, found it necessary in addition to consider the peculiar conditions and special circumstances affecting individual carriers in order in each case to do justice to the carrier and to the United States. \n2\n But in spite of these inherent difficulties we think it was possible for a carrier to ascertain with reasonable accuracy the amount of the award to be paid by the Government. Subsequent to its order of June 10, 1920, the Commission made no amendment or alteration of the rules with respect to the information to be furnished under section 204. Obviously the data had to be obtained from the railway's books and accounts and from entries therein all made prior to March 1, 1920. These accounts contained all the information that could ever be available touching relevant expenditures. Compare United States v. Anderson, \n269 \nU.S. 422\n, 46 S. Ct. 131. The petitioner was promptly informed by the terms of section 209 is supplemented by the instructions issued by the Commission of the method to be followed in allocating charges to operation during periods under in- \n\n[286 U.S. 290, 298]\n\u00a0\n quiry. It does not appear that a proper effort would not have obtained a result approximately in accord with that the Commission ultimately found.\n Much is made by the petitioner of the fact that, as a result of representations by the carriers, the Commission from time to time during 1921, 1922, and 1923 promulgated rulings respecting the method of adjusting book charges to actual experience, and it is asserted that petitioner could not in 1920 have known what these rulings were to be. But it is not clear that, if the taxpayer had acted promptly, an award could not have been made during 1920, or at least the principles upon which the Commission would adjust the railway's accounts to reflect true income have been settled during that year sufficiently to enable the railway to ascertain with reasonable accuracy the amount of the probable award. The reports of the Interstate Commerce Commission show that it was possible for a carrier whose claim arose under section 209 to obtain a final award early in 1921, prior to the time for preparing its income tax return. \n3\n From the record it would seem that, in spite of the fact that its teturn was not made until November, 1922, the petitioner made up its claim by taking maintenance charges as appearing in its books without attempt at allocation as between the limited periods in which they were entered and the probable useful life of the installations. Petitioner must have known that the entire amounts charged to maintenance during the respective periods would not be properly allowable in ascertaining true income for each period. The books and accounts fixed the maximum amount of any probable award, and, if petitioner had endeavored to make reasonable adjustments of book figures, it could have arrived at a figure to be accrued for the year 1920. Any necessary adjustment of its tax could \n\n[286 U.S. 290, 299]\n\u00a0\n readily have been accomplished by an amended return, claim for refund, or additional assessment, as the final award of the Commission might warrant.\n For these reasons the Court of Claims correctly held that the amount awarded was taxable income for the year 1920\n\n\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Chapter 91, 41 Stat. 456, 460 (49 USCA  73). \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Maintenance Expenses under Section 209, 70 I.

GETZ(1932)\nNo. 528\nArgued: March 21, 1932Decided: April 11, 1932\n\n\n\n\n[285 U.S. 434, 435]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Joseph L. Lewinson and W. H. Douglass, both of Los Angeles, Cal., Nat Schmulowitz, J. C. McKinstry, Joseph Haber, Jr., and Charles L.

The basis of the liability sought to be enforced is found in the following provision of section 3, art. 12, of the California Constitution of 1879: 'The directors or trustees of corporations and joint- stock associations shall be jointly and severally liable to \n\n[285 U.S. 434, 440]\n\u00a0\n the creditors and stockholders for all moneys embezzled or misappropriated by the officers of such corporation or joint-stock association, during the term of such director or trustee.'\n The bill alleges misappropriation and embezzlement of moneys of the corporation by its officers, with appropriate details to bring the respondent within the terms of the foregoing provision. The superior court sustained a demurrer to the complaint, for reasons not material here, and rendered final judgment accordingly. An appeal was taken to the state supreme court; and, while that appeal was pending, the provision of the state constitution above quoted was repealed. Thereupon, respondent moved to dismiss the appeal, on the ground that the cause of action had abated by reason of the repeal of the provision of law upon which it was based. The court sustained the motion and dismissed the appeal, Coombes v. Franklin (Cal. Sup.) 1 P.(2d) 992; and subsequently denied a petition for rehearing (Cal. Sup.) 4 P.(2d) 157.\n In substance, it was held that the right accorded to corporate creditors was created by, and dependent alone upon, the constitutional provision, said to have the force of a statute; and that when that was repealed, the right fell with it, being still inchoate, not reduced to possession nor perfected by final judgment. It was conceded that the liability created by the Constitution was in its nature contractual and, as a matter of law, entered into and became a part of every contract between the corporation and its creditors. But this contractual liability, it was said, was conditioned by the power reserved over corporate laws by section 1, art. 12, of the Constitution, as follows: 'All laws now in force in this State concerning corporations, and all laws that may be hereafter passed pursuant to this section, may be altered from time to time or repealed.' \n\n[285 U.S. 434, 441]\n\u00a0\n In virtue of this reservation of power, the state court held that the repeal of the liability provision was a known contingency constituting a part of the contract as much as the provision which imposed the liability.\n The decision of the Supreme Court of a state construing and applying its own Constitution and laws generally is binding upon this court; but that is not so where the contract clause of the Federal Constitution is involved. In that case this court will give careful and respectful consideration and all due weight to the adjudication of the state court, but will determine independently thereof whether there be a contract, the obligation of which is within the protection of the contract clause, and whether that obligation has been impaired; and, likewise, will determine for itself the meaning and application of state constitutional or statutory provisions said to create the contract or by which it is asserted an impairment has been effected.

Skelly, 1 Black, 436, 443.\n In substance, the contention of respondent here is that the reserved power provision, read into the contract as one of its terms, authorizes an extinction by repeal of the creditor's cause of action, unless previously reduced to final judgment.\n The authority of a state under the so-called reserved power is wide; but is not unlimited. The corporate charter may be repealed or amended, and, within limits not now necessary to define, the interrelations of state, corporation, and stockholders may be changed; but \n\n[285 U.S. 434, 442]\n\u00a0\n neither vested property rights nor the obligation of contracts of third persons may be destroyed or impaired. Tomlinson v. Jessup, 15 Wall. 454, 459; Lake Shore, etc., Railway Co. v. Smith, \n173 \nU.S. 684, 690\n, 19 S. Ct. 565. Compare Greenwood v. Freight Co., \n105 \nU.S. 13, 17\n, 19 S.; Shields v. Ohio, \n95 U.S. 319\n, 324. The right of this petitioner to enforce respondent's liability had become fully perfected and vested prior to the repeal of the liability provision. His cause of action was not purely statutory. It did not arise upon the constitutional rule of law, but upon the contractual liability created in pursuance of the rule. Although the latter derived its being from the former, it immediately acquired an independent existence competent to survive the destruction of the provision which gave it birth. The repeal put an end to the rule for the future, but it did not and could not destroy or impair the previously vested right of the creditor (which in every sense was a property right, Ettor v. Tacoma, \n228 \nU.S. 148, 156\n, 33 S. Ct. 428; Pritchard v. Norton, \n106 \nU.S. 124, 132\n, 1 S. Ct. 102) to enforce his cause of action upon the contract. Ettor v. Tacoma, supra; Hawthorne v. Calef, 2 Wall. 10, 22; Steamship Company v. Joliffe, 2 Wall. 450; Ochiltree v. Railroad Company, 21 Wall. 249, 252, 253; Harrison v. Remington Paper Co. (C. C. A.) 140 F. 385, 390, etc., 3 L. R. A. (N. S.) 954, 5 Ann. Cas. 314; Knickerbocker Trust Co. v. Myers (C. C.) 133 F. 764, 767.\n The Ettor Case, supra, involved a statute of the state of Washington which required municipalities to compensate for consequential damages. While that statute was in force actions were brought to recover for damages inflicted upon abutting property in consequence of street grading done by the authority and direction of the city of Tacoma. While these actions were being heard, the statute in respect of this liability was repealed; and the trial court directed a verdict for the city, on the theory that the right of action was statutory and fell with the \n\n[285 U.S. 434, 443]\n\u00a0\n statute, there being no saving clause. Judgment was affirmed by the state Supreme Court and the case came here on writ of of error. This court reversed the judgment and in the course of its opinion (pages 155-156 of 228 U. S., 33 S. Ct. 428, 430) said:\n'The court below gave a retrospective effect to the amendatory and repealing act by holding that the effect of the repeal was to destroy the right to compensation which had accrued while the act was in force. The obligation of the city was fixed. The plaintiffs in error had a claim which the city was as much under obligation to pay as for the labor employed to do the grading. It was a claim assignable and enforceable by a common-law action for a breach of the statutory obligation.\n\n'The necessary effect of the repealing act, as construed and applied by the court below, was to deprive the plaintiffs in error of any remedy to enforce the fixed liability of the city to make compensation. This was to deprive the plaintiffs in error of a right which had vested before the repealing act,-a right which was in every sense a property right. Nothing remained to be done to complete the plaintiffs' right to compensation except the ascertainment of the amount of damage to their property. The right of the plaintiffs in error was fixed by the law in force when their property was damaged for public purposes. and the right so vested cannot be defeated by subsequent legislation.'\n\n In the Hawthorne Case, supra, it was held that a state statute, incorporating a railroad company, which provided that the shares of the stockholders should be liable for the debts of the corporation, in effect pledges the liability or guarantee of the stockholders to the extent of their stock to the creditors of the company. 'They thereby virtually agree to become security to the creditors for the payment of the debts of the company, which have been contracted upon the faith of this liability.' Haw \n\n[285 U.S. 434, 444]\n\u00a0\n thorne supplied the corporation with materials to build its road and obtained judgment against it. Being unable to satisfy the judgment, he brought suit against Calef, a stockholder. The state Supreme Court rendered judgment against Hawthorne on the ground that the individual liability provision had been repealed by subsequent legislation, passed two months after the debt was contracted, and that such repeal had taken away the right to enforce the stockholders' liability. This court reversed on the ground that when the debt was contracted with the company the creditor held the stockholders' liability as security for its payment and the repealing act, by abolishing it, impaired the obligation of that contract.\n In the Joliffe Case, supra, this court had before it for determination substantially the same question that is involved here. There a California statute had created a Board of Pilot Commissioners, and authorized the board to license pilots, prescribe their qualifications, etc. The statute provided, with an exception, that when a vessel was spoken by a pilot and his service was declined he should be entitled to one-half pilotage fees. Joliffe, a pilot licensed under this statute, spoke a vessel of the steamship company and offered his service to pilot her out of the port of San Francisco. This was declined, and the pilot brought suit to recover for one-half the pilotage. Judgment was rendered against the company. Pending review in this court, a new statute was passed and the old act, in terms, repealed. The point was made that the claim to half pilotage fees having been given by statute, the right to recover fell with its repeal, and accordingly that the writ of error should be dismissed. This court held the point not well taken and declined to dismiss the writ. The transaction between the pilot and the ship, it was held (pages 457, 458 of 2 Wall.), gave rise to a quasi contract. 'The claim of the plaintiff below for half-pilotage fees, resting upon a transaction regarded by the law as a quasi contract, there is no just ground for the position that it fell with the repeal of the statute under which the trans- \n\n[285 U.S. 434, 445]\n\u00a0\n action was had. When a right has arisen upon a contract, or a transaction in the nature of a contract authorized by statute, and has been so far perfected that nothing remains to be done by the party asserting it, the repeal of the statute does not affect it, or an action for its enforcement. It has become a vested right which stands independent of the statute. And such is the position of the claim of the plaintiff below in the present action: the pilotage services had been tendered by him; his claim to the compensation prescribed by the statute was then perfect, and the liability of the master or owner of the vessel had become fixed.'\n Respondent, however, insists that long prior to the extension of credit to the corporation by petitioner's assignor, the decisions of the Supreme Court of California had established that the repeal of a law creating such a liability as that here involved extinguishes the cause of action; and that this amounted to a construction of the constitutional provision which entered into the contract and will be followed and applied by this court. Warburton v. White, \n176 \nU.S. 484, 495\n, 20 S. Ct. 404; Ennis Water Works v. Ennis, \n233 \nU.S. 652, 657\n, 34 S. Ct. 767. But upon a careful consideration of the California cases referred to, we are of opinion that they fail to establish the premises upon which the conclusion is based.\n The decisions chiefly relied upon are Moss v. Smith, 171 Cal. 777, 155 P. 90, and Willcox v. Edwards, 162 Cal. 455, 123 P. 276, Ann. Cas. 1913C, 1392; Moss v. Smith, involved section 309 of the Civil Code of California, which created a liability against directors who had participated in the creation of debts in excess of the subscribed capital stock. Suit was brought to enforce this liability against directors of a public utility company, but it appearing that during the pendency of the suit section 309 had been repealed as to public utility companies without a saving clause, the court held that all pending causes of action were thereby extinguished. The basis of the decision was that the statute was of a penal character; the court, however, saying that \n\n[285 U.S. 434, 446]\n\u00a0\n it was not of vital consequence whether it be viewed as penal or remedial. In any event, the liability was not held to be contractual. On the contrary, the court said (page 787 of 171 Cal., 155 P. 90, 94), 'The right of action against these directors conferred by section 309 was a statutory right pure and simple, having no foundation in contract, nor any existence at common law.' And it is significant that the court perceived a determinative distinction between section 309 of the Civil Code, and the provision of the Constitution here under consideration. 'Nothing in Winchester v. Howard, 136 Cal. 441, 64 P. 692, 69 P. 77, 89 Am. St. Rep. 153,' the court said (page 785 of 171 Cal., 155 P. 90, 93), 'is in conflict with this; in the first place, because the directors, under section 3, art. 12, of the Constitution, which section was the foundation of the action, are liable solely for loss sustained by embezzlement and misappropriation-a liability involving loss, and thus entirely different in character from that which appellants contend is imposed by section 309.' 'And that this statute,' the court already had said (page 783 of 171 Cal., 155 P. 90, 92), 'becomes highly penal in character the moment there is eliminated from it the consideration of compensation for loss is at once apparent.'\n As already suggested, Winchester v. Howard, 136 Cal. 432, 64 P. 692, 69 P. 77, 89 Am. St. Rep. 153, arose under section 3, art. 12, of the state Constitution, and the court there, in pointing out the purpose and effect of that provision, said (page 444 of 136 Cal., 69 P. 77, 82, 89 Am. St. Rep. 153): 'The constitution merely makes the directors sureties for their fellow directors and for the officers of the corporation for moneys when so misappropriated as to make the officer misappropriating liable, and authorizing the creditors and stockholders to sue. ... It is not penal in the technical sense, as it allows no recovery as a punishment, but only to compensate for a loss.'\n And again at page 448 of 136 Cal., 69 P. 77, 82, 89 Am. St. Rep. 153: 'There is no difference between this case and the ordinary contract of a surety, unless it can be said that this liability is placed upon the director against his will. \n\n[285 U.S. 434, 447]\n\u00a0\n Argument is hardly required to show that such is not the case. The state could refuse to grant corporate franchises altogether, or may grant on such terms as it pleases. The right to do business as a corporation, or to be a director, if I may speak of it as a right, is not a natural right. These directors took office knowing the responsibilities they assumed in so doing, and in the eye of the law did so as freely and voluntarily as they would have done had they signed a bond agreeing to be responsible for the corporate officers.'\n The distinction between the section of the Code and the constitutional provision, therefore, is clear. In the former the liability is wholly statutory; in the latter it is contractual.\n In Willcox v. Edwards, supra, the court had under consideration a constitutional provision repealing a former provision of the constitution making valid certain contracts for the sale of stocks on margin. The right to sue for the recovery of money paid under such a contract, the court held, was not a vested right depending upon a quasi contract arising by operation of law from the terms of the original constitutional provision, but a right dependent upon that provision standing alone; and that upon its repeal, without a saving clause, pending litigation fell for want of authority to maintain it. But it plainly appears that the decision would have been otherwise if the court had deemed the right to be contractual.\n Another case relied upon is Napa State Hospital v. Flaherty, 134 Cal. 315, 66 P. 322, 323. There a state statute made certain kindred of indigent insane persons liable for their board at the insane asylum to which such insane persons were committed. The right to maintain an action for nonpayment was conferred upon the board of trustees or directors. Such an action was brought; but the court held that the remedy had been repealed and the cause of action fell with it, putting its decision upon \n\n[285 U.S. 434, 448]\n\u00a0\n the ground that 'where a right is created solely by a statute, and is dependent upon the statute alone, and such right is still inchoate, and not reduced to possession, or perfected by final judgment, the repeal of the statute destroys the remedy, unless the repealing statute contains a saving clause.'\n The case here is entirely different. There the obligation which was imposed upon the relatives was purely statutory. No act was contemplated on their part by way of assumption of an obligation in order to fix the liability. No element of a contract was present. Here both parties acted. The creditor extended credit to the corporation; and his action in so doing, under the state constitutional provisions, brought into force for his benefit the costitutional obligation of the director, which, by becoming a director, the latter had voluntarily assumed and, thereby, in the eye of the law, created against himself a contractual liability in the nature of a suretyship. Harrison v. Remington Paper Co., supra, page 388 of 140 F., 3 L. R. A. (N. S.) 954, 5 Ann. Cas. 314. Doubts which otherwise might have existed in respect of the character and effect of the transaction are no longer open. It is settled by decisions of this and other federal courts (Ettor v. Tacoma, and cases cited in connection therewith, supra) that, upon the facts here disclosed, a contractual obligation arose; and the right to enforce it, having become vested, comes within the protection of both the contract impairment clause in article 1 ,  10, and the due process of law clause in the Fourteenth Amendment, of the federal Constitution.\n Decree reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO.\n I am unable to concur in the reversal of this judgment.\n'The directors or trustees of corporations and joint stock associations shall be jointly and severally liable to the creditors and stockholders for all moneys embezzled \n\n[285 U.S. 434, 449]\n\u00a0\n or misappropriated by the officers of such corporation or joint stock association during the term of office of such director or trustee.' Constitution of California, article 12,  3, repealed November 4, 1930\n\n\n\n The Supreme Court of California has said that the liability thus created is contractual (Dean v. Shingle, 198 Cal. 652, 246 P. 1049); but only in a qualified sense, as the expression of a legal fiction, is the statement true, nor did the court that made it intend otherwise. The liability would not be destroyed though the directors when assuming office and repeatedly thereafter were to repudiate the obligation utterly. They would be held for all their protestations upon a liability imposed by law. Indeed, they would have to answer to the creditors though they had ceased to be directors before the debts were in existence. If we put aside deceptive labels, borrowed from the law of quasi contracts, the tangle is unraveled. The petitioner had a contract with the corporation and not with any one else (Crane v. Hahlo, \n258 \nU.S. 142, 146\n, 42 S. Ct. 214), but annexed by law to the obligation of that contract was a liability purely statutory imposed on the directors. Compare Christopher v. Norvell, \n201 \nU.S. 216, 225\n, 26 S. Ct. 502, 5 Ann. Cas. 740; Bernheimer v. Converse, \n206 \nU.S. 516, 529\n, 27 S. Ct. 755. The decisions in California, when analyzed, will be found to hold nothing to the contrary. They amount merely to this, that the liability created by the statute, which is enforceable also by the shareholders, is not penal but remedial, and is limited to the damage resulting to the corporation from the loss of the embezzled moneys as if the director were a surety to the corporation for the acts of its defaulting officer. Dean v. Shingle, supra; compare, Winchester v. Howard, 136 Cal. 432, 64 P. 692, 69 P. 77, 89 Am. St. Rep. 153. In any event, this Court is not controlled by the label which the state court may affix to a liability growing out of a given state of facts. It determines for itself whether within the meaning of the Constitution the product is a contract to be pro- \n\n[285 U.S. 434, 450]\n\u00a0\n tected by the power of the nation. Appleby v. City of New York, \n271 \nU.S. 364, 380\n, 46 S. Ct. 569; Coolidge v. Long, \n282 \nU.S. 582, 597\n, 51 S. Ct. 306. As to this, its judgment is guided by realities and not by words. The section of the Constitution whereby contracts are secured against impairment is aimed at true agreements, and not at quasi contracts as distinguished from agreements implied in fact. Crane v. Hahlo, \n258 \nU.S. 142, 146\n, 42 S. Ct. 214; Louisiana v. New Orleans, \n109 \nU.S. 285, 288\n, 3 S. Ct. 211. Here whatever duty was assumed by a director through the acceptance of his office, was one that he owed in the first instance to the corporation itself, though the creditors and shareholders were privileged to enforce it. Dean v. Shingle, supra. Payment to the corporation before action brought would establish a defense, and even after action brought, any surplus remaining would go into the treasury. A distinction may exist between a liability cast upon directors and one cast upon the shareholders, who are quasi partners in the venture. Corning v. McCullough, 1 N. Y. 47, 49 Am. Dec. 287. To develop the implications of the distinction is unnecessary now.\n I start then with the assumption that the petitioner had a contract with a corporation secured in certain contingencies by a statutory liability. I add the assumption that the state of California was not at liberty, after the contract had been made and a cause of action had accrued thereunder, to make the security defeasible if it was indefeasible in its origin. Either the article of the Constitution prohibiting the impairment of contracts (U. S. Constitution, art. 1,  10) or the Fourteenth Amendment (which, however, is not invoked) might then stand in the way. Hawthorne v. Calef, 2 Wall. 10; Steamship Co. v. Joliffe, 2 Wall. 450; Ettor v. Tacoma, \n228 \nU.S. 148\n, 33 S. Ct. 428; Forbes Pioneer Boat Line v. Board of Commissioners, \n258 \nU.S. 338\n, 42 S. Ct. 325. The difficulty with the petitioner's case is this, that his security in its origin was not vested, but contingent. The meaning of the California Constitution \n\n[285 U.S. 434, 451]\n\u00a0\n is whatever the courts of California declare it to be. The obligation of the petitioner's contract is whatever the law of California attached to the contract at the hour of its making. Long before that time, the Supreme Court of that state had held that under the law of California a statutory cause of action, whether penal or remedial, may be canceled or modified by repeal or amendment until it has ripened into a judgment. Moss v. Smith, 171 Cal. 777, 788, 155 P. 90; Napa State Hospital v. Flaherty, 134 Cal. 315, 66 P. 322; Willcox v. Edwards, 162 Cal. 455, 466, 123 P. 276, Ann. Cas. 1913C, 1392. Compare Combes v. Franklin (Cal. Sup.) 1 P.(2d) 992, Id. ( Cal. Sup.) 4 P.(2d) 157, the decision under review. Consistent with these decisions is a provision of the Political Code: 'Any statute may be repealed at any time, except when it is otherwise provided therein. Persons acting under any statute are deemed to have acted in contemplation of this power of repeal.' California Political Code,  327, quoted in Moss v. Smith, supra, at page 787, of 171 Cal., 155 P. 90, 94. I assume for present purposes that the rule thus announced would be held of no effect if the statute and decisions declaring it had been made after Coombes became a creditor. Made as they were before that time they were reservations or conditions limiting the statutory liability, and to be read into the statute, and hence into any contract to which the statute was an incident, as if written there in words. Citizens' Savings Bank v. Owensboro, \n173 \nU.S. 636, 644\n, 19 S. Ct. 530; Farmers' Bank v. Fed. Reserve Bank, \n262 \nU.S. 649, 660\n, 43 S. Ct. 651, 30 A. L. R. 635. 'The claim of an irrepealable contract cannot be predicated upon a contract which is repealable.' Hammond Packing Co. v. Arkansas, \n212 \nU.S. 322, 346\n, 29 S. Ct. 370, 378, 15 Ann. Cas. 645. Either the petitioner took his cause of action subject to such infirmities or contingencies as were attached to it by the law of the state of its creation, or he did not take anything.\n This view of the case puts aside as irrelevant the provision of the California Constitution permitting the \n\n[285 U.S. 434, 452]\n\u00a0\n amendment of corporate charters, and sustains the repeal upon the ground that the liability by the law of its creation was defeasible in its origin.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice STONE join in this dissent. \n\n\n\n","46":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCORTES v. BALTIMORE INSULAR LINE(1932)\nNo. 12\nArgued: November 16, 1932Decided: December 5, 1932\n\n\n\n\n[287 U.S. 367, 368]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Basil O'Connor, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. George Whitefield Betts, Jr., of New York City, for respondent.\n\n\n\n[287 U.S. 367, 370]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Santiago, a seaman, shipped on the respondent's vessel for a voyage from the harbor of New York to Boca Grande, Fla., and return. On the home voyage, he fell ill of pneumonia, and died in a hospital after reaching the home port. His administrator, the petitioner, sued to recover damages for his death, which was charged to have been caused by the failure of the master of the ship to give him proper care. In the District Court there was a judgment for the petitioner, which was reversed upon appeal. The reversal was on the ground that the seaman's right of action for negligent care or cure was ended by his death, and did not accrue to the administrator for the use of next of kin. (C.C.A.) 52 F.(2d) 22. The case is here on certiorari. \n285 \nU.S. 535\n, 52 S.Ct. 458.\n By the general maritime law, a seaman is without a remedy against the ship or her owners for injuries to his person, suffered in the line of service, with two exceptions \n\n[287 U.S. 367, 371]\n\u00a0\n only. A remedy is his if the injury has been suffered as a consequence of the unseaworthiness of the ship or a defect in her equipment. The Osceola, \n189 \nU.S. 158\n, 23 S.Ct. 483; Chelentis v. Luckenbach S.S. Co., \n247 \nU.S. 372\n, 38 S.Ct. 501; Pacific S.S. Co. v. Peterson, \n278 \nU.S. 130, 134\n, 49 S.Ct. 75. A remedy is his also if the injury has been suffered through breach of the duty to provide him with 'maintenance and cure.' The duty to make such provision is imposed by the law itself as one annexed to the employment. The Osceola, supra. Contractual it is in the sense that it has its source in a relation which is contractual in origin, but, given the relation, no agreement is competent to abrogate the incident. If the failure to give maintenance or cure has caused or aggravated an illness, the seaman has his right of action for the injury thus done to him; the recovery in such circumstances including not only necessary expenses, but also compensation for the hurt. The Iroquois, \n194 \nU.S. 240\n, 24 S.Ct. 640. On the other hand, the remedy for the injury ends with his death in the absence of a statute continuing it or giving it to another for the use of wife or kin. Western Fuel Co. v. Garcia, \n257 \nU.S. 233, 240\n, 42 S.Ct. 89; Lindgren v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 38, 47\n, 50 S.Ct. 207. Death is a composer of strife by the general law of the sea as it was for many centuries by the common law of the land.\n The question then is to what extent the ancient rule has been changed by modern statute. Section 33 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, commonly known as the Jones Act1 (41 Stat. 1007,  33, 46 U.S. Code,  688 (46 USCA  688)), \n\n[287 U.S. 367, 372]\n\u00a0\n gives a cause of action to the seaman who has suffered personal injury through the negligence of his employer. For death resulting from such injury, it gives a cause of action to his personal representative. We are to determine whether death resulting from the negligent omission to furnish care or cure is death from personal injury within the meaning of the statute.\n The argument is pressed upon us that the care owing to a seaman disabled while in service is an implied term of his contract, and that the statute cannot have had in view the breach of a duty contractual in origin for which he had already a sufficient remedy under existing rules of law.\n We think the origin of the duty is consistent with a remedy in tort, since the wrong, if a violation of a contract, is also something more. The duty, as already pointed out, is one annexed by law to a relation, and annexed as an inseparable incident without heed to any expression of the will of the contracting parties. For breach of a duty thus imposed, the remedy upon the contract does not exclude an alternative remedy built upon the tort. The passenger in a public conveyance who has been injured by the negligence of the carrier, may sue for breach of contract if he will, but also at his election in trespass on the case. Jackson v. Old Colony Street Ry., 206 Mass. 477, 485, 92 N.E. 725, 30 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1046, 19 Ann.Cas. 615; Busch v. Interborough R.T. Co., 187 N.Y. 388, 391, 80 N.E. 197, 10 Ann.Cas. 460; Rich v. N.Y.C. & H. Rev. Railroad Co., 87 N.Y. 382, 390; Neil v. Flynn Lumber Co., 71 W.Va. 708, 77 S.E. \n\n[287 U.S. 367, 373]\n\u00a0\n 324. Cf. the cases cited in Pollock on Torts (13th Ed.) p. 557 et seq. The employee of an interstate carrier, injured through the omission to furnish him with safe and suitable appliances, may have a remedy under the Federal Employers' Liability Act  1 (45 U.S. Code  51 (45 USCA  51)), or at times under the Safety Appliance Act  1 to 6 (45 U.S. Code,  1 to 6 ( 45 USCA  1 to 6)), though the omission would not be actionable in the absence of a contract creating the employment. So, in the case at hand, the proper subject of inquiry is not the quality of the relation that gives birth to the duty, but the quality of the duty that is born of the relation. If the wrong is of such a nature as to bring it by fair intendment within the category of a 'personal injury' that has been caused by the 'negligence' of the master, it is not put beyond the statute because it may appropriately be placed in another category also.\n We are thus brought to the inquiry whether 'negligence' and 'personal injury' are terms fittingly applied to the acts charged to the respondent. The case is helped by illustrations. Let us suppose the case of a seaman who is starved during the voyage in disregard of the duty of maintenance, with the result that his health is permanently impaired. There is little doubt that in the common speech of men he would be said to have suffered a personal injury, just as much as a child in an orphan's home who had been wronged in the same way. Cf. Queen v. Instan, (1895) 1 Q.B. 450. Let us suppose the case of a seaman slightly wounded through his own fault, but suffering grievous hurt thereafter as a consequence of septic poisoning brought about by lack of treatment. The common speech of men would give a like description to the wrong that he had suffered. The failure to provide maintenance or cure may be a personal injury or something else according to the consequences. If the seaman has been able to procure his maintenance and cure out of his own or his friends' money, his remedy \n\n[287 U.S. 367, 374]\n\u00a0\n is for the outlay, but personal injury there is none. If the default of the vessel and its officers has impaired his bodily or mental health, the damage to mind or body is none the less a personal injury because he may be free at his election to plead it in a different count. Cf. Pacific S.S. Co. v. Peterson, supra, pages 137, 138 of 278 U.S., 49 S.Ct. 75. Nor is liability escaped by appeal to the distinction between acts of omission on the one hand and those of commission on the other. Moch Co. v. Rensselaer Water Co., 247 N.Y. 160, 167, 168, 159 N.E. 896, 62 A.L.R. 1199. A division is sometimes drawn between the termination of a relation at a time when it is still executory or future, and its termination when performance has gone forward to such a point that abandonment of duty becomes an active agency of harm. Moch Co. v. Rensselaer Co., supra. The respondent is not helped though its treatment of the seaman be subjected to that test. Here performance was begun when the vessel started on her voyage with Santiago aboard and with care and cure cut off from him unless furnished by officers or crew. From that time forth withdrawal was impossible and abandonment a tort. Given a relation involving in its existence a duty of care irrespective of a contract, a tort may result as well from acts of omission as of commission in the fulfillment of the duty thus recognized by law. Moch Co. v. Rensselaer Water Co., supra, citing Pollock on Torts (13th Ed.) p. 567; Kelley v. Met. Ry. Co., (1895) 1 Q.B. 944.\n We are told, however, that the personal injury from negligence covered by the statute must be given a narrow content, excluding starvation and malpractice, because for starvation and malpractice the seaman without an enabling act had a sufficient remedy before. The seaman may indeed have had such a remedy, but his personal representative had none if the wrong resulted in his death. While the seaman was still alive, his cause of action for personal injury created by the statute may have \n\n[287 U.S. 367, 375]\n\u00a0\n overlapped his cause of action for breach of the maritime duty of maintenance and cure, just as it may have overlapped his cause of action for injury caused through an unseaworthy ship. Pacific S.S. Co. v. Peterson, supra, page 138 of 278 U.S., 49 S.Ct. 75; Baltimore S.S. Co. v. Phillips, \n274 \nU.S. 316, 321\n, 324 S., 47 S.Ct. 600. In such circumstances it was his privilege, in so far as the causes of action covered the same ground, to sue indifferently on any one of them. The overlapping is no reason for denying to the words of the statute the breadth of meaning and operation that would normally belong to them, at all events when a consequence of the denial is to withhold any remedy whatever from dependent next of kin. A double remedy during life is not without a rational office if the effect of the duplication is to carry the remedy forward for others after death. The argument for the respondent imputes to the lawmakers a subtlety of discrimination which they would probably disclaim. There was to be a remedy for the personal representative if the seaman was killed by the negligent omission to place a cover over a hatchway or to keep the rigging safe and sound. There was to be none, we are told, if he was killed for lack of food or medicine, though the one duty equally with the other was attached by law to the relation. This court was held that the act is to be liberally construed in aid of its beneficent purpose to give protection to the seaman and to those dependent on his earnings. Jamison v. Encarnacion, \n281 \nU.S. 635\n, 50 S.Ct. 440. An assault by one member of the crew upon another with a view to hurrying up the work has been brought within the category of 'negligence,' and hence in a suit against the owner becomes an actionable wrong. Jamison v. Encarnacion, supra; Alpha S.S. Co. v. Cain, \n281 \nU.S. 642\n, 50 S.Ct. 443. Approaching the decision of this case in a like spirit of liberality, we put aside many of the refinements of construction that a different spirit might approve. \n\n[287 U.S. 367, 376]\n\u00a0\n The failure to furnish cure is a personal injury actionable at the suit of the seaman during life, and at the suit of his personal representative now that he is dead. Cf. U.S. Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corp. v. Greenwald (C.C.A.) 16 F.(2d) 948, 949.\n We are warned, however, that, in giving this content to the statute, we are omitting to give heed to its reference to the act regulating the remedies of railroad employees, and are ignoring the standards of duty thus carried over and adopted. The Employers' Liability Act for the protection of the employees of common carriers by railroad gives a remedy to such employees 'for ... injury or death resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers, agents, or employees of such carrier,' or by reason of any negligent defect in its roadbed or equipment. 35 Stat. 65,  1, 45 U.S. Code,  51 (45 USCA  51). True indeed it is that a common carrier by land is not subject to a duty, except in special circumstances, to give maintenance or cure to sick or disabled employees. We say except in special circumstances, for it would be hazardous to assert that such a duty may not rest upon the representative of a railroad as well as upon the master of a ship when the servant, exposed by the conditions of the work to extraordinary risks, is helpless altogether unless relief is given on the spot. Ohio & Mississippi Ry. Co. v. Early, 141 Ind. 73, 81, 40 N.E. 257, 28 L.R.A. 546; Shaw v. Chicago, M. & St. P.R. R. Co., 103 Minn. 8, 114 N.W. 85; Raasch v. Elite Laundry Co., 98 Minn. 357, 108 N.W. 477, 7 L.R.A.(N.S.) 940; Hunicke v. Meramec Quarry Co., 262 Mo. 560, 581, 597, 172 S.W. 43, L.R.A. 1915C, 789, Ann. Cas. 1915D, 493.2 The result, however, will not be different though we assume that the servant of a railroad company, if he has been injured without fault, may never call for help as due to him of right, however pressing the emergency and im- \n\n[287 U.S. 367, 377]\n\u00a0\n perative the need. We do not read the act for the relief of seamen as expressing the will of Congress that only the same defaults imposing liability upon carriers by rail shall impose liability upon carriers by water. The conditions at sea differ widely from those on land, and the diversity of conditions breeds diversity of duties. This court has said that 'the ancient characterization of seamen as 'wards of admiralty' is even more accurate now than it was formerly.' Robertson v. Baldwin, \n165 \nU.S. 275, 287\n, 17 S.Ct. 326, 331. Another court has said: 'The master's authority is quite despotic, and sometimes roughly exercised, and the conveniences of a ship out upon the ocean are necessarily narrow and limited.' Scarff v. Metcalf, 107 N.Y. 211, 215, 13 N.E. 796, 797, 1 Am.St. Rep. 807. Out of this relation of dependence and submission there emerges for the stronger party a corresponding standard or obligation of fostering protection. There is doubt, and that substantial, whether the administrator of a railroad engineer who by misadventure has fallen from his locomotive while the train is on a bridge has a cause of action under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (45 USCA  51-59) because of the failure of the crew of the train to come to the rescue of their comrade. Harris v. Penn. R.R. Co. (C.C.A.) 50 F.(2d) 866, 868.3 There is little doubt that rescue is a duty when a sailor falls into the sea, United States v. Knowles, 4 Sawy. 517, Fed. Cas. 15,540, and that a liability to respond in damages is cast upon the shipowners if he is abandoned to his fate. Harris v. Penn. R.R. Co., supra.\n The act for the protection of railroad employees does not define negligence. It leaves that definition to be filled in by the general rules of law applicable to the conditions in which a casualty occurs. Cf. Murray v. Chicago & N.W. Ry. Co. (C.C.) 62 F. 24, 31; Ward v. Erie R.R. Co., 230 N.Y. 230, 234, 129 N.E. 886; Michigan v. Michigan Trust Co., \n286 \nU.S. 334, 343\n, 52 S.Ct. 512. Congress did not mean \n\n[287 U.S. 367, 378]\n\u00a0\n that the standards of legal duty must be the same by land and sea. Congress meant no more than this, that the duty must be legal, i.e., imposed by law; that it shall have been imposed for the benefit of the seaman, and for to promotion of his health or safety; and that the negligent omission to fulfill it shall have resulted in damage to his person. When this concurrence of duty, of negligence and of personal injury is made out, the seaman's remedy is to be the same as if a like duty had been imposed by law upon carriers by rail.\n The Court of Appeals in its reversal of the District Court assumed without deciding that the care of the seaman had been negligent and that there was a causal relation between the negligence and the death. The correctness of that assumption is challenged by counsel for the shipowner. These issues of fact being still open and undecided should be disposed of by the court below.\n The judgment is reversed, and the cause remanded to the Court of Appeals for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] That 'any seaman who shall suffer personal injury in the course of his employment may, at his election, maintain an action for damages at law, with the right of trial by jury, and in such action all statutes of the United States modifying or extending the common-law right or remedy in cases of personal injury to railway employees shall apply; and in case of the death of any seaman as a result of any such personal injury the personal representative of such seaman may maintain an action for damages at law with the right of trial by jury, and in such action all statutes of the United States conferring or regulating the right of action for death in the case of railway employees shall be applicable.'\n Compare the Act of March 30, 1920, c. 111,  1, 41 Stat. 537, 46 U.S. Code,  761 (46 USCA  761) 'Death on the High Seas by Wrongful Act,' which extends to persons other than seamen, but is limited to suits in admiralty. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The authorities are brought together and carefully discriminated by Prof. Francis H.

Low Wash Suey v. Backus, \n225 \nU.S. 460, 468\n, 32 S.Ct. 734; Zakonaite v. Wolf, \n226 \nU.S. 272, 275\n, 33 S.Ct. 31; Tisi v. Tod, \n264 \nU.S. 131, 133\n, 44 S.Ct. 260; Vajtauer v. Commr. of Immigration, \n273 \nU.S. 103, 106\n, 47 S.Ct. 302.\n Certiorari was granted to resolve a question as to the construction of section 19 of the act of 1917, which the petitioner says authorized deportation for the cause assigned only within the five years ensuing entry. He entered this country much more than five years prior to the issuance of the warrant for his arrest.\n The section, containing nearly nine hundred words, is a single sentence, divided by semicolons and colons into clauses, qualified by five provisos. The opening clause is that 'At any time within five years after entry, any alien who at the time of entry was a member of one or more of the classes excluded by law;' and the predicate or final clause is, 'shall, upon the warrant of the Secretary of Labor, be taken into custody and deported.' Inserted between these, and separated from the first and from each other by semicolons, are eleven subject-clauses each referring to variously described aliens, as 'any alien who,' etc., and each having as its predicate the clause above quoted, 'shall be taken into custody,' etc. The evident purpose is to catalogue in one omnibus section the different classes of aliens who may be deported and thus avoid repetition of the predicate verbs.\n The dispute is as to whether the qualifying phrase of the first clause, 'within five years after entry,' is to be carried over from the clause in which it appears and is to be read into each following subject clause, including that applicable to the petitioner, or is to be limited in effect to its own clause. The petitioner urges that the grammatical structure of the sentence and the punctuation require the adoption of the first alternative, while in support of the second the government appeals to the evident mean- \n\n[287 U.S. 341, 344]\n\u00a0\n ing of the entire section, the legislative history, and settled departmental interpretation.\n It is to be noted that, of the eleven clauses following the first, three contain references to periods of time after entry within which the described aliens may be deported. Thus, with reference to the classes which may be shortly defined as 'anarchists' and 'convicts,' the phrase used is 'at any time after entry'; concerning those who have entered without inspection, the limitation is 'at any time within three years after entry.' Respecting the remaining seven categories contained in as many separate clauses (including that applicable to this case, 'any alien who manages ... any house of prostitution ...;') no words of time are employed. Certainly, then, the five-year limitation of the first clause does not apply to all the subsequent ones; and, since the phrase has a proper office in qualification of the class specified in the clause in which it appears, its effect should be limited to that class and not carried over to the others.\n It has often been said that punctuation is not decisive of the construction of a statute. Hammock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., \n105 U.S. 77\n; Ford v. Delta & P. Land Co., \n164 \nU.S. 662\n, 17 S.Ct. 230; Barrett v. Van Pelt, \n268 \nU.S. 85\n, 45 S.Ct. 437; United States v. Shereveport Grain & Elevator Company, \n287 \nU.S. 77\n, 53 S. Ct. 42. Upon like principle we should not apply the rules of syntax to defeat the evident legislative intent.\n The meaning of the sentence is made even plainer by the third proviso, which is:\n'Provided further, That the provisions of this section, with the exceptions hereinbefore noted, shall be applicable to the classes of aliens therein mentioned irrespective of the time of their entry into the United States.'\n\n There is nothing upon which this proviso may operate if such of the preceding clauses as contain no time limitation are qualified by the words of the first fixing the limitation at five years; not so, however, if each clause \n\n[287 U.S. 341, 345]\n\u00a0\n containing a time limitation is read separately as an exception to the general rule declared by the proviso. We must look to the whole of the section, in order not to give undue effect to particular words or clauses ( Brown v. Duchesne, 19 How. 183, 194; Pollard v. Bailey, 20 Wall. 520, 525), and when so read, the proviso precludes a construction which would carry into all subsequent clauses the five-year limitation contained in the first.\n If more were needed, the legislative history of section 19 shows that it is a compilation of earlier acts specifying different grounds for deportation; that in the prior legislation affecting aliens managing houses of prostitution, etc., no time limitation was included, and that, in combining those acts to form the present section, Congress did not intend to impose a period of limitation with respect to this cause for deportation. \n2\n The administrative interpretation, as evidenced by the applicable rules of the Bureau of Immigration adopted in 1917 and carried forward in later regulations, has been uniform to the effect that no time limitation is applicable in a case like the present. \n3\n The failure of Congress to alter or amend the section, notwithstanding this consistent construction by the department charged with its enforcement, creates a presumption in favor of the administrative interpretation, to which we should give great weight, even if we doubted the correctness of the ruling of the Department of Labor.

The award was made under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (Act of March 4, 1927, c. 509, 44 Stat. 1424, U. S. C. tit. 33,  901-950 (33 USCA  901-950)), and rested upon \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 37]\n\u00a0\n the finding of the deputy commissioner that Knudsen was injured while in the employ of Benson and prforming service upon the navigable waters of the United States. The complainant alleged that the award was contrary to law for the reason that Kundsen was not at the time of his injury an employee of the complainant and his claim was not 'within the jurisdiction' of the Deputy Commissioner. An amended complaint charged that the act was unconstitutional upon the grounds that it violated the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, the provision of the Seventh Amendment as to trial by jury, that of the Fourth Amendment as to unreasonable search and seizure, and the provisions of article 3 with respect to the judicial power of the United States. The District Judge denied motions to dismiss and granted a hearing de novo upon the facts and the law, expressing the opinion that the act would be invalid if not construed to permit such a hearing. The case was transferred to the admiralty docket, answers were filed presenting the issue as to the fact of employment, and, the evidence of both parties having been heard, the District Court decided that Knudsen was not in the employ of the petitioner and restrained the enforcement of the award. 33 F.(2d) 137; 38 F.(2d) 306. The decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals (45 F.( 2d) 66) and this Court granted writs of certiorari. \n283 \nU.S. 814\n, 51 S. Ct. 353\n\n\n The question of the validity of the act may be considered in relation to (1) its provisions defining substantive rights and (2) its procedural requirements.\n First. The act has two limitations that are fundamental. It deals exclusively with compensation in respect of disability or death resulting 'from an injury occurring upon the navigable waters of the United States' if recovery 'through workmen's compensation proceedings \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 38]\n\u00a0\n may not validly be provided by State law,' and it applies only when the relation of master and servant exists. Section 3.1 'Injury,' within the statute, 'means accidental injury or death arising out of and in the course of employment,' and the term 'employer' means one 'any of whose employees are employed in maritime employment, in whole or in part,' upon such navigable waters. Section 2(2)(4), 33 USCA  902 (2, 4). Employers are made liable for the payment to their employees of prescribed compensation 'irrespective of fault as a cause for the injury.' Section 4 ( 33 USCA  904). The liability is exclusive, unless the employer fails to secure payment of the compensation. Section 5 (33 USCA  905). The employer is required to furnish appropriate medical and other treatment. Section 7 (33 USCA  907). The compensation for temporary or permanent disability, total or partial, according to the statutory classification, and in case of the death of the employee, is fixed, being based upon prescribed percentages of average weekly wages, and the persons to whom payments are to be made are designated. Sections 6, 8, 9, 10 (33 USCA  906, 908, 909, 910). Employers must secure the pay- \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 39]\n\u00a0\n ment of compensation by procuring insurance or by becoming self-insruers in the manner stipulated. Section 32 (33 USCA  932). Failure to provide such security is a misdemeanor. Section 38 (33 USCA  938).\n As the act relates solely to injuries occurring upon the navigable waters of the United States, it deals with the maritime law, applicable to matters that fall within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction (Const. Art. 3,  2; Nogueira v. N. Y., N. H. & H. R. Co., \n281 \nU.S. 128, 138\n, 50 S. Ct. 303), and the general authority of the Congress to alter or revise the maritime law which shall prevail throughout the country is beyond dispute. 2 In limiting the application of the act to cases where recovery 'through workmen's compensation proceedings may not validly be provided by State law,' the Congress evidently had in view the decisions of this Court with respect to the scope of the exclusive authority of the national Legislature. \n3\n The pro- \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 40]\n\u00a0\n priety of providing by federal statute for compensation of employees in such cases had been expressly recognized by this Court,4 and within its sphere the statute was designed to accomplish the same general purpose as the Workmen's Compensation Laws of the states. \n5\n In de- \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 41]\n\u00a0\n fining substantive rights, the act provides for recovery in the absence of fault, classifies disabilities resulting from injuries, fixes the range of compensation in case of disability or death, and designates the classes of beneficiaries. In view of federal power to alter and revise the maritime law, there appears to be no room for objection on constitutional grounds to the creation of these rights, unless it can be found in the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. But it cannot be said that either the classifications of the statute or the extent of the compensation provided are unreasonable. In view of the difficulties which inhere in the ascertainment of actual damages, the Congress was entitled to provide for the payment of amounts which would reasonably approximate the probable damages. See Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Cram, \n228 \nU.S. 70, 84\n, 33 S. Ct. 437; compare Missouri Pacific R. Co. v. Tucker, \n230 \nU.S. 346, 348\n, 33 S. Ct. 961. Liability without fault is not unknown to the maritime law,6 and, \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 42]\n\u00a0\n apart from this fact, considerations are applicable to the substantive provisions of this legislation, with respect to the relation of master and servant, similar to those which this Court has found sufficient to sustain workmen's compensation laws of the states against objections under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. New York Central R. Co. v. White, \n243 \nU.S. 188\n, 37 S. Ct. 247, L. R. A. 1917D, 1, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 629; Mountain Timber Company v. Washington, \n243 \nU.S. 219\n, 37 S. Ct. 260, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 642; Ward & Gow v. Krinsky, \n259 \nU.S. 503\n, 42 S. Ct. 529, 28 A. L. R. 1207; Lower Vein Coal Co. v. Industrial Board, \n255 \nU.S. 144\n, 41 S. Ct. 252; Madera Sugar Pine Company v.

Industrial Board, \n284 \nU.S. 594\n, 52 S. Ct. 202, 76 L. Ed. -, decided January 18, 1932. See Nogueira v. N. Y., N. H. & H. R. Co., supra, at pages 136, 137 of 281 U. S., 50 S. Ct. 303.\n Second. The objections to the procedural requirements of the act relate to the extent of the administrative authority which it confers. The administration of the act-'except as otherwise specifically provided'-was given to the United States Employees' Compensation Commission,7 which was authorized to establish compensation districts, appoint deputy commissioners, and make regulations. Sections 39, 40 (33 USCA  939, 940). Claimants must give written notice to the deputy commissioner and to the employer of the injury or death within thirty days thereafter; the deputy commissioner may excuse failure to give such notice for satisfactory reasons. Section 12 (33 USCA  912). If the employer contests the right to compensation, he is to file notice to that effect. Section 14(d) 33 USCA  914(d). A claim for compensation must be filed with \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 43]\n\u00a0\n the deputy commissioner within a prescribed period, and it is provided that the deputy commissioner shall have full authority to hear and determine all questions in respect to the claim. Sections 13, 19(a), 33 USCA  913, 919(a). Within ten days after the claim is filed, the deputy commissioner, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Commission, must notify the employer and any other person who is considered by the deputy commissioner to be an interested party. The deputy commissioner is required to make, or cause to be made, such investigations as he deems to be necessary, and upon application of any interested party must order a hearing, upon notice, at which the claimant and the employer may present evidence. Employees claiming compensation must submit to medical examination. Section 19 (33 USCA  919). In conducting investigations and hearings, the deputy commissioner is not bound by common law or statutory rules of evidence, or by technical or formal rules or procedure, except as the act provides, but he is to proceed in such manner 'as to best ascertain the rights of the parties.' Section 23(a), 33 USCA  923(a). He may issue subpoenas, administer oaths, compel the attendance and testimony of witnesses, the production of documents or other evidence or the taking of depositions, and may do all things conformable to law which may be necessary to enable him effectively to discharge his duties. Proceedings may be brought before the appropriate federal court to punish for misbehavior or contumacy as in case of contempt. Section 27 (33 USCA  927 ). Hearings before the deputy commissioner are to be public and reported stenographically, and the Commission is to provide by regulation for the preparation of a record. Section 23(b).8 Compensation orders are to be filed in the office of the deputy commissioner, and copies must be sent \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 44]\n\u00a0\n to the claimant and employer. Section 19. The act provides that it shall be presumed, in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary, that the claim comes within the provisions of the act, that sufficient notice of claim has been given, that the injury was not occasioned solely by the intoxication of the injured employee, or by the willful intention of such employee to injure or kill himself or another. Section 20 (33 USCA  920). A compensation order becomes effective when filed, and, unless proceedings are instituted to suspend it or set it aside it becomes final at the expiration of thirty days. Section 21(a), 33 USCA  921(a). If there is a change in conditions, the order may be modified or a new order made. Section 22, (33 USCA  922). In case of default for thirty days in the payment of compensation, application may be made to the deputy commissioner for a supplementary order declaring the amount in default. Such an order is to be made after investigation, notice, and hearing, as in the case of claims. Upon filing a certified copy of the supplementary order with the clerk of the federal court, as stated, judgment is to be entered for the amount declared in default, if such supplementary order 'is in accordance with law.' Review of the judgment may be had as in civil suits for damages at common law, and the judgment may be enforced by writ of execution. Section 18 (33 USCA  918).\n The act further provides that, if a compensation order is 'not in accordance with law,' it 'may be suspended or set aside, in whole or in part, through injunction proceedings, mandatory or otherwise, brought by any party in interest' against the deputy commissioner making the order and instituted in the federal District Court for the judicial district in which the injury occurred. \n9\n Payment is not to be stayed pending such proceedings unless, on hearing after notice, the court allows the stay on evi- \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 45]\n\u00a0\n dence showing that the employer would otherwise suffer irreparable damage. Section 21(b), 33 USCA  921(b). Beneficiaries of awards or the deputy commissioner may apply for enforcement to the federal District Court, and, if the court determines that the order 'was made and served in accordance with law,' obedience may be compelled by writ of injunction or other proper process. Section 21(c).10\n As the claims which are subject to the provisions of the act are governed by the maritime law as established by the Congress and are within the admiralty jurisdiction, the objection raised by the respondent's pleading as to the right to a trial by jury under the Seventh Amendment is unavailing (Waring v. Clarke, 5 How. 441, 459, 460), and that under the Fourth Amendment is neither explained nor urged. The other objections as to procedure invoke the due process clause and the provision as to the judicial power of the United States.\n\n 1. \nThe contention under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment relates to the determination of questions of fact. Rulings of the deputy commissioner upon questions of law are without finality. So far as \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 46]\n\u00a0\n the latter are concerned, full opportunity is afforded for their determination by the federal courts through proceedings to suspend or to set aside a compensation order (section 21(b), by the requirement that judgment is to be entered on a supplementary order declaring default only in case the order follows the law (section 18), and by the provision that the issue of injunction or other process in a proceeding by a beneficiary to compel obedience to a compensation order is dependent upon a determination by the court that the order was lawfully made and served ( section 21(c). Moreover, the statute contains no express limitation attempting to preclude the court, in proceedings to set aside an order as not in accordance with law, from making its own examination and determination of facts whenever that is deemed to be necessary to enforce a constitutional right properly asserted. See Ohio Valley Water Co. v. Ben Avon Borough, \n253 \nU.S. 287, 289\n, 40 S. Ct. 527, 528; Ng Fung Ho. v. White, \n259 \nU.S. 276, 284\n, 285 S., 42 S. Ct. 492; Prendergast v. New York Telephone Co., \n262 \nU.S. 43, 50\n, 43 S. Ct. 466; Tagg Bros. & Moorhead v. United States, \n280 \nU.S. 420, 443\n, 444 S., 50 S. Ct. 220; Phillips v. Commissioner, \n283 \nU.S. 589, 600\n, 51 S. Ct. 608. As the statute is to be construed so as to support rather than to defeat it, no such limitation is to be implied. Panama Railroad Co. v. Johnson, \n264 \nU.S. 375, 390\n, 44 S. Ct. 391.\n Apart from cases involving constitutional rights to be appropriately enforced by proceedings in court, there can be no doubt that the act contemplates that as to questions of fact, arising with respect to injuries to employees within the purview of the act, the findings of the deputy commissioner, supported by evidence and within the scope of his authority, shall be final. To hold otherwise would be to defeat the obvious purpose of the legislation to furnish a prompt, continuous, expert, and inexpensive method for dealing with a class of questions of fact which are peculiarly suited to examination and determination by an administrative agency specially assigned to that task. \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 47]\n\u00a0\n The object is to secure within the prescribed limits of the employer's liability an immediate investigation and a sound practical judgment, and the efficacy of the plan depends upon the finality of the determinations of fact with respect to the circumstances, nature, extent, and consequences of the employee's injuries and the amount of compensation that should be awarded. And this finality may also be regarded as extending to the determination of the question of fact whether the injury 'was occasioned solely by the intoxication of the employee or by the willful intention of the employee to injure or kill himself or another.' While the exclusion of compensation in such cases is found in what are called 'coverage' provisions of the act (section 3 (33 USCA  903)), the question of fact still belongs to the contemplated routine of administration, for the case is one of employment within the scope of the act, and the cause of the injury sustained by the employee as well as its character and effect must be ascertained in applying the provisions for compensation. The use of the administrative method for these purposes, assuming due notice, proper opportunity to be heard, and that findings are based upon evidence, falls easily within the principle of the decisions sustaining similar procedure against objections under the due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n The statute provides for notice and hearing, and an award made without proper notice, or suitable opportu- \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 48]\n\u00a0\n nity to be heard, may be attacked and set aside as without validity. The objection is made that, as the deputy commissioner is authorized to prosecute such inquiries as he may consider necessary, the award may be based wholly or partly upon an ex parte investigation and upon unknown sources of information, and that the hearing may be merely a formality. The statute, however, contemplates a public hearing, and regulations are to require 'a record of the hearings and other proceedings before the deputy commissioners.' Section 23(b), 33 USCA  923(b). This implies that all proceedings by the deputy commissioner upon a particular claim shall be appropriately set forth, and that whatever facts he may ascertain and their sources shall be shown in the record and be open to challenge and opposing evidence. Facts conceivably known to the deputy commissioner, but not put in evidence so as to permit scrutiny and contest, will not support a compensation order. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co., \n227 \nU.S. 88, 93\n, 33 S. Ct. 185; The Chicago Junction Case, \n264 \nU.S. 258, 263\n, 44 S. Ct. 317; United States v. Abilene & Southern Railway Co., \n265 \nU.S. 274, 288\n, 44 S. Ct. 565. An award not supported by evidence in the record is not in accordance with law. But the fact that the deputy commissioner is not bound by the rules of evidence which would be applicable to trials in court or by technical rules of procedure (section 23(a), 33 USCA  923( a) does not invalidate the proceeding, provided substantial rights of the parties are not infringed. Interestate Commerce Commission v. Baird, \n194 \nU.S. 25, 44\n, 24 S. Ct. 563; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co., supra; Spiller v. Atchison, T. & S. F. Ry. Co., \n253 \nU.S. 117, 131\n, 40 S. Ct. 466; United States v. Abilene & Southern Railway Co., supra; Tagg Bros. & Moorhead v. United States, supra, at page 442 of 280 U. S., 50 S. Ct. 220.\n\n 2. \nThe contention based upon the judicial power of the United States, as extended 'to all Cases of admiralty \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 49]\n\u00a0\n and maritime Jurisdiction' (Const. art. 3), presents a distinct question. In Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Company, 18 How. 272, 284, this Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Curtis, said: 'To avoid misconstruction upon so grave a subject, we think it proper to state that we do not consider congress can either withdraw from judicial cognizance any matter which, from its nature, is the subject of a suit at the common law, or in equity, or admiralty; nor, on the other hand, can it bring under the judicial power a matter which, from its nature, is not a subject for judicial determination.'\n The question in the instant case, in this aspect, can be deemed to relate only to determinations of fact. The reservation of legal questions is to the same court that has jurisdiction in admiralty, and the mere fact that the court is not described as such is unimportant. Nor is the provision for injunction proceedings (section 21(b) open to objection. The Congress was at liberty to draw upon another system of procedure to equip the court with suitable and adequate means for enforcing the standards of the maritime law as defined by the act. The Genesee Chief, 12 How. 443, 459, 460. Compare Panama R. R. Co. v. Johnson, supra, at page 388 of 264 U. S., 44 S. Ct. 391. By statute and rules, courts of admiralty may be empowered to grant injunctions, as in the case of limitation of liability proceedings. Hartford Accident & Indemnity Co. v. Southern Pacific Co., \n273 \nU.S. 207, 218\n, 47 S. Ct. 357. See, also, Marine Transit Corporation v. Dreyfus, \n284 \nU.S. 263\n, 52 S. Ct. 166, decided January 4, 1932. The Congress did not attempt to define questions of law, and the generality of the description leaves no doubt of the intention to reserve to the Federal court full authority to pass upon all matters which this Court had held to fall within that category. There is thus no attempt to interfere with, but rather provision is made to facilitate, the exercise by the court of its jur- \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 50]\n\u00a0\n isdiction to deny effect to any administrative finding which is without evidence, or 'contrary to the indisputable character of the evidence,' or where the hearing is 'inadequate,' or 'unfair,' or arbitrary in any respect. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Louisville R. R. Co., supra, at pages 91, 92 of 227 U. S., 33 S. Ct. 185; Tagg Bros. & Moorhead v. United States, supra.\n As to determinations of fact, the distinction is at once apparent between cases of private right and those which arise between the government and persons subject to its authority in connection with the performance of the constitutional functions of the executive or legislative departments. The Court referred to this distinction in Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Company, supra, pointing out that 'there are matters, involving public rights, which may be presented in such form that the judicial power is capable of acting on them, and which are susceptible of judicial determination, but which congress may or may not bring within the cognizance of the courts of the United States, as it may deem proper.' Thus the Congress, in exercising the powers confided to it, may establish 'legislative' courts (as distinguished from 'constitutional courts in which the judicial power conferred by the Constitution can be deposited') which are to form part of the government of territories or of the District of Columbia,12 or to serve as special tribunals 'to examine and determine various matters, arising between the government and others, which from their nature do not require judicial determination and yet are susceptible of it.' But 'the mode of determining matters of this class is completely within congressional control. Congress may reserve to itself the power to decide, may delegate that power to executive officers, or may commit it to judicial tribunals.' Ex \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 51]\n\u00a0\n parte Bakelite Corporation, \n279 \nU.S. 438, 451\n, 49 S. Ct. 411, 413. Familiar illustrations of administrative agencies created for the determination of such matters are found in connection with the exercise of the congressional power as to interstate and foreign commerce, taxation, immigration, the public lands, public health, the facilities of the post office, pensions, and payments to veterans. \n13\n\u00a0\n\n The present case does not fall within the categories just described, but is one of private right, that is, of the liability of one individual to another under the law as defined. But, in cases of that sort, there is no requirement that, in order to maintain the essential attributes of the judicial power, all determinations of fact in constitutional courts shall be made by judges. On the common-law side of the federal courts, the aid of juries is not only deemed appropriate but is required by the Constitution itself. In cases of equity and admiralty, it is historic practice to call to the assistance of the courts, without the consent of the parties, masters, and commissioners or assessors, to pass upon certain classes of questions, as, for example, to take and state an account or to find the amount of damages. While the reports of masters and commissioners in such cases are essentially of an advisory nature, it has not been the practice to disturb their findings when they are properly based upon evidence, in the absence of errors of law,14 \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 52]\n\u00a0\n and the parties have no right to demand that the court shall redetermine the facts thus found. In admiralty, juries were anciently in use not only in criminal cases but apparently in civil cases also.15 The Act of February 26, 1845 (c. 20, 5 Stat. 726), purporting to extend the admiralty jurisdiction of the federal District Courts to certain cases arising on the Great Lakes, gave the right to 'trial by jury of all facts put in issue in such suits, where either party shall require it.' After the decision in the case of The Genesee Chief, supra, holding that the federal District Courts possessed general jurisdiction in admiralty over the lakes, and navigable waters connecting them, under the Constitution and the Judiciary Act of 1789 (chapter 20,  9, 1 Stat. pp. 76, 77), this Court regarded the Enabling Act of 1845 as 'obsolete and of no effect, with the exception of the clause which gives to either party the right of trial by jury when requested.' The Eagle, 8 Wall. 15, 25. And this provision, the court said, was 'rather a mode of exercising jurisdiction than any substantial part of it.' See R. S. 566, U. S. C., tit. 28,  770, 28 USCA  770.16 Chief Justice Taney, in delivering the opinion of the court in the case of The Genesee Chief, supra, referring to this requirement, thus broadly stated the authority of Congress to change the procedure in courts of admiralty. \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 53]\n\u00a0\n 'The power of Congress to change the mode of proceeding in this respect in its courts of admiralty, will, we suppose, hardly be questioned. The Constitution declares that the judicial power of the United States shall extend to 'all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.' But it does not direct that the court shall proceed according to ancient and established forms, or shall adopt any other form or mode of practice. The grant defines the subjects to which the jurisdiction may be extended by Congress. But the extent of the power as well as the mode of proceeding in which that jurisdiction is to be exercised, like the power and practice in all the other courts of the United States, are subject to the regulation of Congress, except where that power is limited by the terms of the Constitution, or by necessary implication from its language. In admiralty and maritime cases there is no such limitation as to the mode of proceeding, and Congress may therefore in cases of that description, give either party right of trial by jury, or modify the practice of the court in any other respect that it deems more conducive to the administration of justice.'\n It may also be noted that, while on an appeal in admiralty cases 'the facts, as well as the law, would be subjected to review and retrial,' this Court has recognized the power of the Congress 'to limit the effect of an appeal to a review of the law as applicable to facts finally determined below.' The Francis Wright, \n105 U.S. 381\n, 386; The Connemara (Sinclair v. Cooper) \n108 \nU.S. 352, 359\n, 2 S. Ct. 754. Compare Luckenbach S. S. Co. v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 533, 536\n, 537 S., 47 S. Ct. 186.\n In deciding whether the Congress, in enacting the statute under review, has exceeded the limits of its authority to prescribe procedure in cases of injury upon navigable waters, regard must be had, as in other cases where constitutional limits are invoked, not to mere matters of form, but to the substance of what is required. \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 54]\n\u00a0\n The statute has a limited application, being confined to the relation of master and servant, and the method of determining the questions of fact, which arise in the routine of making compensation awards to employees under the act, is necessary to its effective enforcement. The act itself, where it applies, establishes the measure of the employer's liability, thus leaving open for determination the questions of fact as to the circumstances, nature, extent, and consequences of the injuries sustained by the employee for which compensation is to be made in accordance with the prescribed standards. Findings of fact by the deputy commissioner upon such questions are closely analogous to the findings of the amount of damages that are made according to familiar practice by commissioners or assessors, and the reservation of full authority to the court to deal with matters of law provides for the appropriate exercise of the judicial function in this class of cases. For the purposes stated, we are unable to find any constitutional obstacle to the action of the Congress in availing itself of a method shown by experience to be essential in order to apply its standards to the thousands of cases involved, thus relieving the courts of a most serious burden while preserving their complete authority to insure the proper application of the law.\n\n 3. \nWhat has been said thus far relates to the determination of claims of employees within the purview of the act. A different question is presented where the determinations of fact are fundamental or 'jurisdictional,'17 in the sense that their existence is a condition precedent to the operation of the statutory scheme. These funda- \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 55]\n\u00a0\n mental requirements are that the injury occurs upon the navigable waters of the United States, and that the relation of master and servant exists. These conditions are indispensable to the application of the statute, not only because the Congress has so provided explicitly (section 3), but also because the power of the Congress to enact the legislation turns upon the existence of these conditions.\n In amending and revising the maritime law,18 the Congress cannot reach beyond the constitutional limits which are inherent in the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. \n19\n Unless the injuries to which the act relates occur upon the navigable waters of the United States, they fall outside that jurisdiction. \n20\n Not only is navigability itself a question of fact, as waters that are navigable in fact are navigable in law,21 but, where navigability is not in dispute, the locality of the injury, that is, whether it has occurred upon the navigable waters of the United States, determines the existence of the congressional power to create the liability prescribed by the statute. \n22\n Again, it \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 56]\n\u00a0\n cannot be maintained that the Congress has any general authority to amend the maritime law so as to establish liability without fault in maritime cases, regardless of particular circumstances or relations. It is unnecessary to consider what circumstances or relations might permit the imposition of such a liability by amendment of the maritime law, but it is manifest that some suitable selection would be required. In the present instance, the Congress has imposed liability without fault only where the relation of master and servant exists in maritime employment, and, while we hold that the Congress could do this, the fact of that relation is the pivot of the statute, and, in the absence of any other justification, underlies the constitutionality of this enactment. If the person injured was not an employee of the person sought to be held, or if the injury did not occur upon the navigable waters of the United States, there is no ground for an assertion that the person against whom the proceeding was directed could constitutionally be subjected, in the absence of fault upon his part, to the liability which the statute creates.\n In relation to these basic facts, the question is not the ordinary one as to the propriety of provision for administrative determinations. Nor have we simply the question of due process in relation to notice and hearing. It is rather a question of the appropriate maintenance of the federal judicial power in requiring the observance of constitutional restrictions. It is the question whether the Congress may substitute for constitutional courts, in which the judicial power of the United States is vested, an administrative agency-in this instance a single deputy commissioner23-for the final determination of the existence of the facts upon which the enforcement of the constitutional rights of the citizen depend. The recognition of \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 57]\n\u00a0\n the utility and convenience of administrative agencies for the investigation and finding of facts within their proper province, and the support of their authorized action, does not require the conclusion that there is no limitation of their use, and that the Congress could completely oust the courts of all determinations of fact by vesting the authority to make them with finality in its own instrumentalities or in the executive department. That would be to sap the judicial power as it exists under the federal Constitution, and to establish a government of a bureaucratic character alien to our system, wherever fundamental rights depend, as not infrequently they do depend, upon the facts, and finality as to facts becomes in effect finality in law.\n In this aspect of the question, the irrelevancy of state statutes and citations from state courts as to the distribution of state powers is apparent. A state may distribute its powers as it sees fit, provided only that it acts consistently with the essential demands of due process and does not transgress those restrictions of the Federal Constitution which are applicable to state authority. \n24\n In relation to the federal government, we have already noted the inappositeness to the present inquiry of decisions with respect to determinations of fact, upon evidence and within the authority conferred, made by administrative agencies which have been created to aid in the performance of governmental functions, and where the mode of determination is within the control of the Congress; as, e. g., in the proceedings of the Land Office pursuant to provisions for the disposition of public lands, of the authorities of the Post Office in relation to postal privileges, of the Bureau of Internal Revenue with respect to taxes, and of the Labor Department as to the \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 58]\n\u00a0\n admission and deportation of aliens. Ex parte Bakelite Corporation, supra. 25 Similar considerations apply to decisions with respect to determinations of fact by boards and commissions created by the Congress to assist it in its legislative process in governing various transactions subject to its authority, as, for example, the rates and practices of interstate carriers, the Legislature thus being able to apply its standards to a host of instances which it is impracticable to consider and legislate upon directly and the action being none the less legislative in character because taken through a subordinate body. \n26\n And where administrative bodies have been appropriately created to meet the exigencies of certain classes of cases and their action is of a judicial character, the question of the conclusiveness of their administrative findings of fact generally arises where the facts are clearly not jurisdictional27 and the scope of review as to such facts has been determined by the applicable legislation. None of the decisions of this sort touch the question which is presented where the facts involved are jurisdictional28 or where the question concerns the proper exercise of the judicial power of the United States in enforcing constitutional limitations.\n Even where the subject lies within the general authority of the Congress, the propriety of a challenge by judicial proceedings of the determinations of fact deemed to be jurisdictional, as underlying the authority of executive officers, has been recognized. When proceedings are taken against a person under the military law, and enlistment is denied, the issue has been tried and determined de novo upon habeas corpus. In re Grimley, \n137 U.S. 147\n, 154, \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 59]\n\u00a0\n 155, 11 S. Ct. 54. See, also, In re Morrissey, \n137 \nU.S. 157, 158\n, 11 S. Ct. 57; Givens v. Zerbst, \n255 \nU.S. 11, 20\n, 41 S. Ct. 227. While, in the administration of the public land system, questions of fact are for the consideration and judgment of the Land Department and its decision of such questions is conclusive, it is equally true that, if lands 'never were public property, or had previously been disposed of, or if Congress had made no provision for their sale, or had reserved them, the department would have no jurisdiction to transfer them.' This Court has held that 'matters of this kind, disclosing a want of jurisdiction, may be considered by a court of law. In such cases the objection to the patent reaches beyond the action of the special tribunal, and goes to the existence of a subject upon which it was competent to act.' Smelting Company v. Kemp, \n104 U.S. 636\n, 641. In such a case, the invalidity of the patent may be shown in a collateral proceeding. Polk's Lessee v. Wendal, 9 Cranch. 87; Patterson v. Winn, 11 Wheat. 380; Minter v. Crommelin, 18 How. 87; Morton v. Nebraska, 21 Wall 660, 675; Noble v. Union River Logging Railroad, \n147 \nU.S. 165, 174\n, 13 S. Ct. 271. The question whether a publication is a 'book' or a 'periodical' has been reviewed upon the evidence received in a suit brought to restrain the Postmaster General from acting beyond his authority in excluding the publication from carriage as second class mail matter. Hitchcock v. Smith, 34 App. D. C. 521, 530-533; Id., \n266 \nU.S. 54, 59\n, 33 S. Ct. 6.29\n\n\n[285 U.S. 22, 60]\n\u00a0\n In cases brought to enforce constitutional rights, the judicial power of the United States necessarily extends to the independent determination of all questions, both of fact and law, necessary to the performance of that supreme function. The case of confiscation is illustrative, the ultimate conclusion almost invariably depending upon the decisions of questions of fact. This court has held the owner to be entitled to 'a fair opportunity for submitting that issue to a judicial tribunal for determination upon its own independent judgment as to both law and facts.' Ohio Valley Water Company v. Ben Avon Borough, supra. See, also, Prendergast v. New York Telephone Company, \n262 \nU.S. 43, 50\n, 43 S. Ct. 466; Tagg Bros. & Moorhead v. United States, supra; Phillips v. Commissioner, \n283 \nU.S. 589, 600\n, 51 S. Ct. 608. Jurisdiction in the executive to order deportation exists only if the person arrested is an alien, and while, if there were jurisdiction, the findings of fact of the executive department would be conclusive, the claim of citizenship 'is thus a denial of an essential jurisdictional fact' both in the statutory and the constitutional sense, and a writ of habeas corpus will issue 'to determIne the status.' Persons claiming to be citizens of the United States 'are entitled to a judicial determination of their claims,' said this Court in Ng Fung Ho v. White, supra, at page 285 of 259 U. S., 42 S. Ct. 492, 495, and in that case the cause was remanded to the federal District Court 'for trial in that court of the question of citizenship.'\n In the present instance, the argument that the Congress has constituted the deputy commissioner a fact-finding tribunal is unavailing, as the contention makes the untenable assumption that the constitutional courts may be \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 61]\n\u00a0\n deprived in all cases of the determination of facts upon evidence even though a constitutional right may be involved. Reference is also made to the power of the Congress to change the procedure in courts of admiralty, a power to which we have alluded in dealing with the function of the deputy commissioner in passing upon the compensation claims of employees. But when fundamental rights are in question, this Court has repeatedly emphasized 'the difference in security of judicial over administrative action.' Ng Fung Ho v. White, supra. Even where issues of fact are tried by juries in the federal courts, such trials are under the constant superintendence of the trial judge. In a trial by jury in a federal court the judge is 'not a mere moderator,' but 'is the governor of the trial' for the purpose of assuring its proper conduct as well as of determining questions of law. Herron v. Southern Pacific Co., \n283 \nU.S. 91, 95\n, 51 S. Ct. 383 75 L. Ed. 857. In the federal courts, trial by jury 'is a trial by a jury of 12 men in the presence and under the superintendence of a judge empowered to instruct them on the law and to advise them on the facts, and ( except on acquittal of a criminal charge) to set aside their verdict, if, in his opinion, it is against the law or the evidence.' Capital Traction Co. v. Hof, \n174 \nU.S. 1, 13\n, 14 S., 19 S. Ct. 580, 585. Where testimony in an equity cause is not taken before the court, the proceeding is still constantly subject to the court's control. And while the practice of obtaining the assistance of masters in chancery and commissioners in admiralty may be regarded, as we have pointed out, as furnishing a certain analogy in relation to the normal authority of the deputy commissioner in making what is virtually an assessment of damages, the proceedings of such masters and commissioners are always subject to the direction of the court, and their reports are essentially advisory, a distinction of controlling importance when questions of a fundamental character are in issue.\n\n\n[285 U.S. 22, 62]\n\u00a0\n When the validity of an act of the Congress is drawn in question, and even if a serious doubt of constitutionality is raised, it is a cardinal principle that this Court will first ascertain whether a construction of the statute is fairly possible by which the question may be avoided. \n30\n We are of the opinion that such a construction is permissible and should be adopted in the instant case. The Congress has not expressly provided that the determinations by the deputy commissioner of the fundamental or jurisdictional facts as to the locality of the injury and the existence of the relation of master and servant shall be final. The finality of such determinations of the deputy commissioner is predicated primarily upon the provision (section 19(a), 33 USCA  919(a) that he 'shall have full power and authority to hear and determine all questions in respect of such claim.' But 'such claim' is the claim for compensation under the act and by its explicit provisions is that of an 'employee,' as defined in the act, against his 'employer.' The fact of employment is an essential condition precedent to the right to make the claim. The other provision upon which the argument rests is that which authorizes the federal court to set aside a compensation order if it is 'not in accordance with law.' Section 21(b), 33 USCA  921(b). In the absence of any provision as to the finality of the determination by the deputy commissioner of the jurisdictional fact of employment, the statute is open to the construction that the court in determining whether a compensation order is in accordance with law may determine the fact of employment which underlies the operation of the statute. And, to remove the question as to validity, we think that the statute should be so construed. Further, the act expressly requires that, \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 63]\n\u00a0\n if any of its provisions is found to be unconstitutional, 'or the applicability thereof to any person or circumstances' is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of the act and 'the applicability of such provision to other persons and circumstances' shall not be affected. Section 50 (33 USCA  950). We think that this requirement clearly evidences the intention of the Congress, not only that an express provision found to be unconstitutional should be disregarded without disturbing the remainder of the statute, but also that any implication from the terms of the act which would render them invalid should not be indulged. This provision also gives assurance that there is no violation of the purpose of the Congress in sustaining the determinations of fact of the deputy commissioner where he acts within his authority in passing upon compensation claims while denying finality to his conclusions as to the jurisdictional facts upon which the valid application of the statute depends.\n Assuming that the federal court may determine for itself the existence of these fundamental or jurisdictional facts, we come to the question, Upon what record is the determination to be made? There is no provision of the statute which seeks to confine the court in such a case to the record before the deputy commissioner or to the evidence which he has taken. The remedy which the statute makes available is not by an appeal or by a writ of certiorari for a review of his determination upon the record before him. The remedy is 'through injunction proceedings mandatory or otherwise.' Section 21(b). The question in the instant case is not whether the deputy commissioner has acted improperly or arbitrarily as shown by the record of his proceedings in the course of administration in cases contemplated by the statute, but whether he has acted in a case to which the statute is inapplicable. By providing for injunction proceedings, the Congress evidently contemplated a suit as in equity, and in such \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 64]\n\u00a0\n a suit the complainant would have full opportunity to plead and prove either that the injury did not occur upon the navigable waters of the United States or that the relation of master and servant did not exist, and hence that the case lay outside the purview of the statute. As the question is one of the constitutional authority of the deputy commissioner as an administrative agency, the court is under no obligation to give weight to his proceedings pending the determination of that question. If the court finds that the facts existed which gave the deputy commissioner jurisdiction to pass upon the claim for compensation, the injunction will be denied in so far as these fundamental questions are concerned; if, on the contrary, the court is satisfied that the deputy commissioner had no jurisdiction of the proceedings before him, that determination will deprive them of their effectiveness for any purpose. We think that the essential independence of the exercise of the judicial power of the United States, in the enforcement of constitutional rights requires that the federal court should determine such an issue upon its own record and the facts elicited before it.\n The argument is made that there are other facts besides the locality of the injury and the fact of employment which condition the action of the deputy commissioner. That contention in any aspect could not avail to change the result in the instant case. But we think that there is a clear distinction between cases where the locality of the injury takes the case out of the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, or where the fact of employment being absent there is lacking under this statute any basis for the imposition of liability without fault, and those cases which fall within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction and where the relation of master and servant in maritime employment exists. It is in the latter field that the provisions for compensation apply, and that, for the reasons stated in the earlier part of this opinion, the determina- \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 65]\n\u00a0\n tion of the facts relating to the circumstances of the injuries received, as well as their nature and consequences, may appropriately be subjected to the scheme of administration for which the act provides.\n It cannot be regarded as an impairment of the intended efficiency of an administrative agency that it is confined to its proper sphere, but it may be observed that the instances which permit of a challenge to the application of the statute, upon the grounds we have stated, appear to be few. Out of the many thousands of cases which have been brought before the deputy commissioners throughout the country, a review by the courts has been sought in only a small number,31 and an inconsiderable proportion of these appear to have involved the question whether the injury occurred within the maritime jurisdiction or whether the relation of employment existed.\n We are of the opinion that the District Court did not err in permitting a trial de novo on the issue of employment. Upon that issue the witnesses who had testified before the deputy commissioner and other witnesses were heard by the District Court. The writ of certiorari was not granted to review the particular facts, but to pass upon the question of principle. With respect to the facts, the two courts below are in accord, and we find no reason to disturb their decision.\n Decree affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS (dissenting).\n Knudsen filed a claim against Benson under section 19(a) of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, March 4, 1927, c. 509, 44 Stat. 1424, 1435, 33 USCA  919(a). Benson's answer denied, among other things, that the relation of employer and employee existed between him and the claimant. The evidence introduced before the deputy \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 66]\n\u00a0\n commissioner, which occupies 78 pages of the printed record, was directed largely to that issue and was conflicting. The deputy commissioner found that the claimant was in Benson's employ at the time of the injury, and filed an order for compensation under section 21(a), 33 USCA  921(a). Benson brought this proceeding under section 21(b) to set aside the order. The District Judge transferred the suit to the admiralty side of the court and held a trial de novo, refusing to consider upon any aspect of the case the record before the deputy commissioner. On the evidence introduced in court, he found that the relation of employer and employee did not exist, and entered a decree setting aside the compensation order. 33 F.(2d) 137, 38 F.(2d) 306. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decree. 45 F.(2d) 66. This Court granted certiorari. \n283 \nU.S. 814\n, 51 S. Ct. 353. In my opinion, the decree should be reversed, because Congress did not authorize a trial de novo.\n The primary question for consideration is not whether Congress provided, or validly could provide, that determinations of fact by the deputy commissioner should be conclusive upon the District Court. The question is: Upon what record shall the District Court's review of the order of the deputy commissioner be based? The courts below held that the respondent was entitled to a trial de novo; that all the evidence introduced before the deputy commissioner should go for naught; and that respondent should have the privilege of presenting new, and even entirely different, evidence in the District Court. Unless that holding was correct, the judgment below obviously cannot be affirmed.\n First. The initial question is one of construction of the Longshoremen's Act. The act does not in terms declare whether there may be a trial de novo either as to the issue whether the relation of employer and employee existed at the time of the injury, or as to any other issue, tried or triable, before the deputy commissioner. It provides, by section 19(a), that 'the deputy commissioner shall \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 67]\n\u00a0\n have full power and authority to hear and determine all questions in respect of' a claim; by section 21(a) that the compensation order made by the deputy commissioner 'shall become effective' when filed in his office, and, 'unless proceedings for the suspension or setting aside of such order are instituted as provided in subdivision (b) of this section, shall become final ...'; and by section 21(b) that, 'if not in accordance with law, a compensation order may be suspended or set aside, in whole or in part, through injunction proceedings ... instituted in the Federal district court. ...'\n The phrase in section 21(b) providing that the order may be set aside 'if not in accordance with law' was adopted from the statutory provision, enacted by the same Congress, for review by the Circuit Courts of Appeals of decisions of the Board of Tax Appeals. \n32\n This Court has settled that the phrase as used in the tax statute means a review upon the record made before the Board. Phillips v. Commissioner, \n283 \nU.S. 589, 600\n, 51 S. Ct. 608. The Compensation Commission has consistently construed the Longshoremen's Act as providing for finality of the deputy commissioners' findings on all questions of fact;33 and care \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 68]\n\u00a0\n has been taken to provide for formal hearings appropriate to that intention. Compare Brown v. United States, \n113 \nU.S. 568, 571\n, 5 S. Ct. 648; Mason v. Routzahn, \n275 \nU.S. 175, 178\n, 48 S. Ct. 50. The lower federal courts, except in the case at bar, have uniformly construed the act as denying a trial de novo of any issue determined by the deputy commissioner; have held that, in respect to those issues, the review afforded must be held upon the record made before the deputy commissioner; and that the deputy commissioner's findings of fact must be accepted as conclusive if supported by evidence, unless there was some irregularity in the proceeding before him. \n34\n Nearly all the state \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 69]\n\u00a0\n courts have construed the state workmen's compensation laws, as limiting the judicial review to matters of law. \n35\n Provisions in other federal statutes, similar to \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 70]\n\u00a0\n those here in question, creating, various administrative tribunals, have likewise been treated as not conferring the right to a judicial trial de novo. 36 \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 71]\n\u00a0\n The safeguards with which Congress has surrounded the proceedings before the deputy commissioner would be without meaning if those proceedings were to serve merely as an inquiry preliminary to a contest in the courts. \n37\n Specific provisions of the Longshoremen's Act make clear that it was the aim of Congress to expedite the relief afforded. With a view to obviating the delays incident to judicial proceedings the act substitutes an administrative tribunal for the court; and, besides providing for notice and opportunity to be heard, endows the proceedings before the deputy commissioner with the customary incidents of a judicial hearing. It prescribes that the parties in interest may be represented by counsel, section 19(d), 33 USCA  919(d); that the attendance of witnesses and the \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 72]\n\u00a0\n production of documents may be compelled, section 27(a), 33 USCA  927(a); that the hearings shall be public, and that they shall be stenographically reported, section 23(b), 33 USCA  923(b); that there shall be made 'a record of the hearings and other proceedings before the deputy commissioners,' section 23(b); that 'the deputy commissioner shall have full power and authority to hear and determine all questions in respect of' a claim, section 19(a); and that his order shall become final after thirty days, unless a proceeding is filed under section 21(b), 33 USCA  921(b) charging that it is 'not in accordance with law.' Procedure of this character, instead of expediting relief, would entail useless expense and delay if the proceedings before the deputy commissioner were to be repeated in court and the case tried from the beginning, at the option of either party. The conclusion that Congress did not so intend is confirmed by reference to the legislative history of the act. \n38\n Compare Caminetti v. United States, \n242 \nU.S. 470, 490\n, 37 S. Ct. 192, L. R. A. 1917F, 502, Ann. Cas. 1017B, 1168. \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 73]\n\u00a0\n Second. Nothing in the statute warrants the construction that the right to a trial de novo which Congress has concededly denied as to most issues of fact determined by the deputy commissioner has been granted in respect to the issue of the existence of the employer-employee relation. The language which is held sufficient to foreclose the right to such a trial on some issues forecloses it as to all. Whether the peculiar relation which the fact of employment is asserted to bear to the scheme of the statute and to the constitutional authority under which it was passed might conceivably have induced Congress to provide a special method of review upon that question, it is not necessary to inquire. For Congress expressly declared its intention to put, for purposes of review, all the issues of fact on the same basis, by conferring upon the deputy commissioner 'full power to hear and determine all questions in respect of such claim,' subject only to the power of the court to set aside his order 'if not in accordance with law.'\n The suggestion that 'such claim' may be construed to mean only a claim within the purview of the act seems to me without substance. Logically applied, the suggestion would leave the deputy commissioner powerless to hear or determine any issue of asserted nonliability under the act. For nonexistence of the employer employee relation is only one of many grounds of nonliability. Thus, there is no liability if the injury was occasioned solely by the intoxication of the employee; or if the injury was due to the willful intention of the employee to \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 74]\n\u00a0\n injure or kill himself or another; or if it did not arise 'out of or in the course of employment'; or if the employer was not engaged in maritime employment in whole or in part; or if the injured person was the employee of a subcontractor who has secured payment of compensation; or if the proceeding is brought against the wrong person as employer; or if the disability or death is that of a master or a member of the crew of any vessel; or if it is that of a person engaged by the master to load or unload or repair any small vessel under eighteen tons net; or if it is that of an officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof; or if it is that of an officer or employee of any state, or foreign government, or any political subdivision thereof; or if recovery for the disability or death through workmen's compensation proceedings may be validly provided by state law. And obviously there is no liability if there was in fact neither disability nor death. It is not reasonable to suppose that Congress intended to set up a fact-finding tribunal of first instance, shorn of power to find a portion of the facts required for any decision of the case; or that, in enacting legislation designed to withdraw from litigation the great bulk of maritime accidents, it contemplated a procedure whereby the same facts must be twice litigated before a longshoreman could be assured the benefits of compensation.\n The circumstance that Congress provided, in section 21(b), of the act ( 33 USCA  921(b), for review of orders of the deputy commissioner by injunction proceedings is urged as indicative of an intention that in such proceedings the complainant should have full opportunity to plead and prove any facts showing that the case lay outside the purview of the statute. But by this reasoning, again, many other questions besides those referred to by the Court would be open to retrial upon new, and different, evidence. The simple answer is that on bills in equity to set aside orders of a federal \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 75]\n\u00a0\n administrative board there is no trial de novo of issues of fact determined by that tribunal. As stated in Tagg Bros. & Moorhead v. United States, \n280 \nU.S. 420, 443\n, 50 S. Ct. 220, 226, concerning orders of the Secretary of Agriculture under the Packers and Stockyards Act (7 USCA  181 et seq.):\n'A proceeding under section 316 of the Packers and Stockyards Act (7 USCA  217) is a judicial review, not a trial de novo. The validity of an order of the Secretary, like that of an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission, must be determined upon the record of the proceedings before him-save as there may be an exception of issues presenting claims of constitutional right, a matter which need not be considered or decided now.'39\n\n In the review of the quasi judicial decisions of these federal administrative tribunals the bill in equity serves the purpose which at common law, and under the practice of many of the states, is performed by writs of certiorari. \n40\n It presents to the reviewing court the record of the proceedings before the administrative tribunal in order that determination may be made, among other things, whether the authority conferred has been properly exercised. \n41\n Neither upon bill in equity in the fed- \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 76]\n\u00a0\n eral courts nor writ of certiorari in the states is it the practice to permit fresh evidence to be offered in the reviewing court. There is no foundation for the suggestion that Congress intended to provide otherwise in the Longshoremen's Act.\n Third. It is said that the provision for a trial de novo of the existence of the employer employee relation should be read into the act in order to avoid a serious constitutional doubt. It is true that, where a statute is equally susceptible of two constructions, under one of which it is clearly valid and under the other of which it may be unconstitutional, the court will adopt the former construction. Presser v. Illinois, \n116 \nU.S. 252, 269\n, 6 S. Ct. 580; Knights Templars' Indemnity Co. v. Jarman, \n187 \nU.S. 197, 205\n, 23 S. Ct. 108; Carey v. South Dakota, \n250 \nU.S. 118, 122\n, 39 S. Ct. 403; Missouri Pacific R. R. Co. v. Boone, \n270 \nU.S. 466, 471\n, 472 S., 46 S. Ct. 341. But this act is not equally susceptible to two constructions. The court may not, in order to avoid holding a statute unconstitutional, engraft upon it an exception or other provision. Butts v. Merchants' & Miners' Transportation Co., \n230 \nU.S. 126, 133\n, 33 S. Ct. 964; The Employers' Liability Cases, \n207 U.S. 463\n, 500-502, 28 S. Ct. 141; Trade-Mark Cases, \n100 U.S. 82\n, 99; United States v. Fox, \n95 \nU.S. 670, 672\n, 673 S.; United States \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 77]\n\u00a0\n v. Reese, \n92 U.S. 214\n, 221. Compare Illinois Central R. R. Co. v. McKendree, \n203 \nU.S. 514, 529\n, 27 S. Ct. 153; Cella Commission Co. v. Bohlinger (C. C. A.) 147 F. 419, 423, 424, 8 L. R. A. (N. S.) 537. Neither may it do so to avoid having to resolve a constitutional doubt. To hold that Congress conferred the right to a trial de novo on the issue of the employer employee relation seems to me a remaking of the statute and not a construction of it.\n Fourth. Trial de novo of the issue of the existence of the employer employee relation is not required by the due process clause. That clause ordinarily does not even require that parties shall be permitted to have a judicial tribunal pass upon the weight of the evidence introduced before the administrative body. See Dahlstrom Metallic Door Co. v. Industrial Board, \n284 \nU.S. 594\n, 52 S. Ct. 202, 76 L. Ed. -. The findings of fact of the deputy commissioner, the Court now decides, are conclusive as to most issues, if supported by evidence. Yet as to the issue of employment the Court holds, not only that such findings may not be declared final, but that it would create a serious constitutional doubt to construe the act as committing to the deputy commissioner the simple function of collecting the evidence upon which the court will ultimately decide the issue.\n It is suggested that this exception is required as to issues of fact involving claims of constitutional right. For reasons which I shall later discuss, I cannot believe that the issue of employment is one of constitutional right. But even assuming it to be so, the conclusion does not follow that trial of the issue must therefore be upon a record made in the District Court. That the function of collecting evidence may be committed to an administrative tribunal is settled by a host of cases,42 and \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 78]\n\u00a0\n supported by persuasive analogies, none of which justify a distinction between issues of constitutional right and any others. Resort to administrative remedies may be made a condition precedent to a judicial hearing. Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. Solum, \n247 \nU.S. 477, 483\n, 484 S., 38 S. Ct. 550; First National Bank of Greeley v. Board of County Commissioners, \n264 \nU.S. 450, 454\n, 455 S., 44 S. Ct. 385; United States Navigation Co. v. Cunard S. S. Co., \n284 \nU.S. 474\n, 52 S. Ct. 247, decided February 15, 1932. This is so even though a party is asserting deprivation of rights secured by the Federal Constitution. First National Bank of Greeley v. Board of County Commissioners, supra. In federal equity suits, the taking of evidence on any issue in open court did not become common until 1913,43 compare Los Angeles Brush Manufacturing \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 79]\n\u00a0\n Corporation v. James, \n272 \nU.S. 701\n, 47 S. Ct. 286; and in admiralty it was not required by the rules of this Court until 1921.44 Compare The P. R. R. No. 35 (C. C. A.) 48 F.(2d) 122. On appeals in admiralty, further proof is now taken by a commission. \n45\n As was said concerning a similar tribunal in Washington ex rel. Oregon Railroad & Navigation Co. v, Fairchild, \n224 \nU.S. 510, 527\n, 32 S. Ct. 535, the function of the deputy commissioner is like that of a master in chancery who has been required to take testimony and report his findings of fact and conclusions of law. Compare Los Angeles Brush Corporation v. James, supra; Kimberly v. Arms, \n129 \nU.S. 512, 524\n, 525 S., 9 S. Ct. 355; Armstrong v. Belding Bros. & Co. (C. C. A.) 297 F. 728, 729. The holding that the difference between the procedure prescribed by the Longshoremen's Act and these historic methods of hearing evidence transcends the limits of congressional power when applied to the issue of the existence of a relation of employment, as distinguished from that of the circumstances of an injury or the existence of a relation of dependency, seems to me without foundation in reality. Certainly there is no difference to the litigant. \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 80]\n\u00a0\n Even in respect to the question, discussed by the Court, of the finality to be accorded administrative findings of fact in a civil case involving pecuniary liability, I see no reason for making special exception as to issues of constitutional right, unless it be that, under certain circumstances, there may arise difficulty in reaching conclusions of law without consideration of the evidence as well as the findings of fact. See Tagg Bros. & Moorhead v. United States, \n280 \nU.S. 420, 443\n, 50 S. Ct. 220. Compare Ohio Valley Water Co. v. Ben Avon Borough, \n253 \nU.S. 287\n, 40 S. Ct. 527. The adequacy of that reason need not be discussed. For as to the issue of employment no such difficulty can be urged. Two decades of experience in the states testify to the appropriateness of the administrative process as applied to this issue, as well as all others, in workmen's compensation controversies.\n Fifth. Trial de novo of the existence of the employer employee relation is not required by the Judiciary Article of the Constitution. The mere fact that the act deals only with injuries arising on navigable waters, and that independently of legislation such injuries can be redressed only in courts of admiralty,46 obviously does not preclude Congress from denying a trial de novo. For the Court holds that it is compatible with the grant of power under article 3 to deny a trial de novo as to most of the facts \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 81]\n\u00a0\n upon which rest the allowance of a claim and the amount of compensation. Its holding that the Constitution requires a trial de novo of the issue of the employer employee relation is based on the relation which that fact bears to the statutory scheme propounded by Congress, and to the constitutional authority under which the act was passed. The argument is that existence of the relation of employer and employee is, as a matter of substantive law, indispensable to the application of the statute, because the power of Congress to enact the legislation turns upon its existence; and that whenever the question of constitutional power depends upon an issue of fact that issue must, as a matter of procedure, be determinable independently upon evidence freshly introduced in a court. \n47\n Neither proposition seems to me well founded.\n Whether the power of Congress to provide compensation for injuries occurring on navigable waters is limited to cases in which the employer employee relation exists has not heretofore been passed upon by this Court and was not argued in this case. I see no justification for assuming, under those circumstances, that it is so limited. \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 82]\n\u00a0\n Without doubt the word 'employee' was used in the Longshoremen's Act in the sense in which the common law defines it. But that definition is not immutable; and no provision of the Constitution confines the application of liability without fault to instances where the relation of employment, as so defined, exists. \n48\n Compare Louis Pisitz Dry Goods Co. v. Yeldell, \n274 \nU.S. 112, 116\n, 47 S. Ct. 509, 51 A. L. R. 1376. Whether an individual is an employer or an independent contractor depends upon criteria often subtle and uncertain of application,49 criteria which have been developed, by proc- \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 83]\n\u00a0\n esses of judicial exclusion and inclusion, largely since the adoption of the Constitution50 and with reference, for the most part, to considerations foreign to industrial accident litigation. It is not to be assumed that Congress, having power to amend and revise the maritime law, is prevented from modifying those criteria and enlarging the liability imposed by this act so as to embrace all persons who are engaged or engage themselves in the work of another, including those now designated as independent contractors. In the Longshoremen's Act itself, Congress, far from declaring the relation of master and servant indispensable in all cases to the application of the statute, provided expressly that a contractor shall be liable to employees of a subcontractor who has failed to secure payment of compensation. Section 4(a) of the Act (33 USCA  904( a). State Workmen's Compensation Laws almost invariably contain provisions for liability either to independent contractors or to their employees, sometimes absolute and sometimes conditioned upon default by the immediate employer;51 and these pro- \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 84]\n\u00a0\n visions appear to have been uniformly upheld. \n52\n I cannot doubt that, even upon the view of the evidence taken by the District Court, Congress might have made Benson liable to Knudsen for the injury which he sustained.\n Sixth. Even if the constitutional power of Congress to provide compensation is limited to cases in which the \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 85]\n\u00a0\n employer meployee relation exists, I see no basis for a contention that the denial of the right to a trial de novo upon the issue of employment is in any manner subversive of the independence of the federal judicial power. Nothing in the Constitution, or in any prior decision of this Court to which attention has been called, lends support to the doctrine that a judicial finding of any fact involved in any civil proceeding to enforce a pecuniary liability may not be made upon evidence introduced before a properly constituted administrative tribunal, or that a determination so made may not be deemed an independent judicial determination. Congress has repeatedly exercised authority to confer upon the tribunals which it creates, be they administrative bodies or courts of limited jurisdiction, the power to receive evidence concerning the facts upon which the exercise of federal power must be predicated, and to determine whether those facts exist. The power of Congress to provide by legislation for liability under certain circumstances subsumes the power to provide for the determination of the existence of those circumstances. It does not depend upon the absolute existence in reality of any fact.\n It is true that, so far as Knudsen is concerned, proof of the existence of the employer employee relation is essential to recovery under the act. But under the definition laid down in Noble v. Union River Logging R. Co., \n147 \nU.S. 165, 173\n, 174 S., 43 S. Ct. 271, that fact is not jurisdictional. It is quasi jurisdictional. The existence of a relation of employment is a question going to the applicability of the substantive law, not to the jurisdiction of the tribunal. Jurisdiction is the power to adjudicate between the parties concerning the subject- matter. Compare Reynolds v. Stockton, \n140 \nU.S. 254, 268\n, 11 S. Ct. 773. Obviously, the deputy commissioner had not only the power but the duty to determine whether the employer employee relation existed. When a duly constituted tribunal has juris- \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 86]\n\u00a0\n diction of the parties and of the subject-matter, that jurisdiction is not impaired by errors, however grave, in applying the substantive law. Dennison v. Payne (C. C. A.) 293 F. 333, 341. Compare Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Schendel, \n270 \nU.S. 611, 617\n, 46 S. Ct. 420, 53 A. L. R. 1265; Marin v. Augedahl, \n247 \nU.S. 142, 149\n, 38 S. Ct. 452; Binderup v. Pathe Exchange, \n263 U.S. 291\n, 305-307, 44 S. Ct. 96. This is true of tribunals of special as well as of those of general jurisdiction. It is true of administrative, as well as of judicial, tribunals. If errors in the application of law may not be made the basis of collateral attack upon the decision of an administrative tribunal, once that decision has become final, no 'jurisdictional' defect can compel the independent re-examination in court, upon direct review, of the facts affecting such applicability.\n The 'judicial power' of article 3 of the Constitution is the power of the federal government, and not of any inferior tribunal. There is in that article nothing which requires any controversy to be determined as of first instance in the federal District Courts. The jurisdiction of those courts is subject to the control of Congress. \n53\n Mat- \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 87]\n\u00a0\n ters which may be placed within their jurisdiction may instead be committed to the state courts. If there be any controversy to which the judicial power extends that may not be subjected to the conclusive determination of administrative bodies or federal legislative courts, it is not because of any prohibition against the diminution of the jurisdiction of the federal District Courts as such, but because, under certain circumstances, the constitutional requirement of due process is a requirement of judicial process. An accumulation of precedents, already referred to,54 has established that in civil proceedings in- \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 88]\n\u00a0\n volving property rights determination of facts may constitutionally be made otherwise than judicially; and necessarily that evidence as to such facts may be taken outside of a court. I do not conceive that article 3 has properly any bearing upon the question presented in this case.\n Seventh. The cases cited by the Court in support of its conclusion that the statute would be invalid if construed to deny a trial de novo of issues of fact affecting the existence of the employer employee relation seem to me irrelevant. Most of those decisions dealt with tribunals exercising functions generically different from the function which Congress has assigned to the deputy commissioners under the Longshoremen's Act, and no question arose analogous to that now presented.\n By the Longshoremen's Act, Congress created fact-finding and fact- gathering tribunals, supplementing the courts and intrusted with power to make initial determinations in maters within, and not outside, ordinary judicial purview. The purpose of these administrative bodies is to withdraw from the courts, subject to the power of judicial review, a class of controversy which experience has shown can be more effectively and expeditiously handled in the first instance by a special and expert tribunal. The proceedings of the deputy commissioners are endowed with every substantial safeguard of a judicial hearing. Their conclusions are, as a matter of right, open to re-examination in the courts on all questions of law; and, we assume for the purposes of this discussion, may be open even on all questions of the weight of the evidence.\n The administrative bodies in the cases referred to by the Court, on the contrary, are in no sense fact-gathering \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 89]\n\u00a0\n or fact-finding tribunals of first instance. They are tribunals of final resort within the scope of their authority. Their concern is with matters ordinarily outside of judicial competence,-the deportation of aliens, the enforcement of military discipline, the granting of land patents, and the use of the mails-matters which are within the power of Congress to commit to conclusive executive determination. Compare Ex parte Bakelite Corporation, \n279 \nU.S. 438, 451\n, 49 S. Ct. 411. Their procedure may be summary and frequently is. \n55\n With respect to them, the function of the courts is not one of review but essentially of control-the function of keeping them within their statutory authority. \n56\n\u00a0\n\n[285 U.S. 22, 90]\n\u00a0\n No method of judicial review of the administrative action had been provided by Congress in any of the cases cited; and the question of the power to confine review to the administrative record accordingly did not arise. In each case, the Court held that, if the administrative officer had acted outside his authority, the unwritten law supplied a remedy, and that relief could be had, according to the nature of the case, on bill in equity or habeas corpus. \n57\n\u00a0\n\n[285 U.S. 22, 91]\n\u00a0\n The question decided in each case was that Congress should not be taken, in the absence of specific provision, to have intended to subject the individual to the uncontrolled action of a public administrative officer. See American School of Magnetic Healing v. McAnnulty, \n187 \nU.S. 94, 110\n, 23 S. Ct. 33. No comparable issue is presented here.\n Reliance is also placed, as illustrative of the necessary independence of the federal judicial power, upon the decision in Ohio Valley Water Co. v. Ben Avon Borough \n253 \nU.S. 287\n, 40 S. Ct. 527.58 That case, however, involved only the ques- \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 92]\n\u00a0\n tion of the scope of review, upon the administrative record, in confiscation cases. It held that the reviewing court must have power to weigh the evidence upon which the administrative tribunal entered the order. It decided nothing concerning the right to a trial de novo in court; and the opinion made no reference to such a trial. It could not have decided anything as to the effect of article 3 of the Constitution. For the case came here from the highest court of the state, arose under the Fourteenth Amendment, and did not relate to the jurisdiction of the lower federal courts. Moreover, in no event, can the issues presented in the review of rate orders alleged to be confiscatory, which involve difficult questions of mixed law and fact, be deemed parallel to those presented in the review of workmen's compensation awards. \n59\n Compare the issues in Ohio Valley Water Co. v. Ben Avon Borough, supra, with that in Dahlstrom Metallic Door Co. v. Industrial Board, \n284 \nU.S. 594\n, 52 S. Ct. 202, 76 L. Ed. -.\n Whatever may be the propriety of the rule permitting special re- examination in a trial court of so-called 'juris- \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 93]\n\u00a0\n dictional facts' passed upon by administrative bodies having otherwise final jurisdiction over matters properly committed to them, I find no warrant for extending the doctrine to other and different administrative tribunals whose very function is to hear evidence and make initial determinations concerning those matters which it is sought to re-examine. Such a doctrine has never been applied to tribunals properly analogous to the deputy commissioners, such as the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Secretary of Agriculture acting under the Packers and Stockyards Act (7 USCA  181 et seq.) and the like. \n60\n Logically applied it would seriously impair the entire administrative process. \n61\n\u00a0\n\n Eighth. No good reason is suggested why all the evidence which Benson presented to the District Court in this cause could not have been presented before the deputy commissioner; nor why he should have been permitted to try his case provisionally before the administrative tribunal and then to retry it in the District Court upon additional evidence theretofore withheld. To permit him to do so violates the salutary principle that administrative remedied must first be exhausted before resorting to the court, imposes unnecessary and burdensome expense upon the other party and cripples the effective administration of the act. Under the prevailing practice, by which the judicial review has been confined to questions of law, the proceedings before the deputy commissioners \n\n[285 U.S. 22, 94]\n\u00a0\n have proved for the most part noncontroversial;62 and relatively few cases have reached the courts. \n63\n To permit a contest de novo in the District Court of an issue tried, or triable, before the deputy commissioner will, I fear, gravely hamper the effective administration of the act. The prestige of the deputy commissioner will necessarily be lessened by the opportunity of relitigating facts in the courts. The number of controverted cases may be largely increased. Persistence in controversy will be encouraged. And since the advantage of prolonged litigation lies with the party able to bear heavy expenses, the purpose of the act will be in part defeated. \n64\n\u00a0\n\n[285 U.S. 22, 95]\n\u00a0\n In my opinion the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeal should be reversed and the case remanded to the District Court, sitting as a court of equity, for consideration and decision upon the record made before the deputy commissioner.\n Mr. Justice STONE and Mr. Justice ROBERTS join in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section three of the act as to 'Coverage' provides:\n'Sec. 3. (a) Compensation shall be payable under this Act in respect of disability or death of an employee, but only if the disability or death results from an injury occurring upon the navigable waters of the United States (including any dry dock) and if recovery for the disability or death through workmen's compensation proceedings may not validly be provided by State law. No compensation shall be payable in respect of the disability or death of-\n\n'(1) A master or member of a crew of any vessel nor any person engaged by the master to load or unload or repair any small vessel under eighteen tons net; or\n\n'(2) An officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof or of any State or foreign government, or of any political subdivision thereof.\n\n'(b) No compensation shall be payable if the injury was occasioned solely by the intoxication of the employee or by the willful intention of the employee to injure or kill himself or another.' 33 USCA  903. \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Waring v.

This power, we think, would permit enactment of a general Employers' Liability Law or general provisions for compensating injured employees; but it may not be delegated to the several states.' \n[\nFootnote 5\n] The Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate, in reporting upon the proposed measure, said (Sen. Rep. No. 973, 69th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 16):\n'The committee deems it unnecessary to comment upon the modern change in the reltion between employers and employees establishing systems of compensation as distinguished from liability. Nearly every State in the Union has a compensation law through which employees are compensated for injuries occurring in the course of their employment without regard to negligence on the part of the employer or contributory negligence on the part of the employee. If longshoremen could avail themselves of the benefits of State compensation laws, there would be no occasion for this legislation; but, unfortunately, they are excluded from these laws by reason of the character of their employment; and they are not only excluded but the Supreme Court has more than once held that Federal legislation can not, constitutionally, be enacted that will apply State laws to this occupation. (Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, \n244 \nU.S. 205\n, 37 S. Ct. 524, L. R. A. 1918C, 451, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 900; Knickerbocker Ice Co. v. Stewart, \n253 \nU.S. 149\n, 40 S. Ct. 438, 11 A. L. R. 1145; State of Washington v. W. C. Dawson & Co., \n264 \nU.S. 219\n, 44 S. Ct. 302.)' The House Committee in its report made the following statement (House Rep. No. 1767, 69th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 20): 'The principle of workmen's compensation has become so firmly established that simple justice would seem to require that this class of maritime workers should be included in this legislation. ... 'The bill as amended, therefore, will enable Congress to discharge its obligation to the maritime workers placed under their jurisdiction by the Constitution of the United States by providing for them a law whereby they may receive the benefits of workmen's compensation and thus afford them the same remedies that have been provided by legislation for those killed or injured in the course of their employment in nearly overy State in the Union.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] See, e. g., The Osceola, \n189 \nU.S. 158, 169\n, 23 S.

Ct. 229, the Court said: 'Our jurisprudence affords examples of legal liability without fault, and the deprivation of property without fault being attributable to its owner. The law of deodands was such an example. The personification of the ship in admiralty law is another.' See Holmes, 'The Common Law,' pp. 26-29; The China, 7 Wall. 53, 67, 68; Sherlock v.

The total number of cases disposed of during that year, including those brought forward from the preceding years, was 30,489, of which there were 13,261 'nonfatal' cases which caused no loss of time, and 4,067 of such cases in which the duration of disability did not exceed seven days. Compensation payments were completed in 11,776 cases. Hearings held by deputy commissioners during the fiscal year number 1,217, of which 905 involved compensation payments. At the end of the fiscal year, there were 102 cases pending in federal District Courts wherein the plaintiffs asked review of compensation orders.

St. Rep. 850, an action was brought against the members of a town board of health who had killed a horse in obedience to an order of the commissioners on contagious diseases among domestic animals, acting under the alleged authority of the state Legislature. The order recited that the animal had been examined and was adjudged to have the glanders. The judge before whom the case was tried 'found the horse had not the glanders,' but declined to rule against the defendants. The Supreme Judicial Court sustained exceptions, holding that 'The fact as to the horse having the disease was open to investigation in the present action, and, on the finding that it did not have it, the plaintiff was entitled to a ruling that the defendants had failed to make out their justification.'

See, e. g., Act of February 18, 1922, c. 57,  2, 42 Stat. 388, 389 ( 7 USCA  292). Compare the provision for review of reparation orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission, Act of June 18, 1910, c. 309, 313, 36 Stat. 539, 554, and of orders for the payment of money by the Shipping Board. Act of September 7, 1916, c. 451,  30, 39 Stat. 728, 737 (46 USCA  829). \n[\nFootnote 37\n] Compare Freund, 'Administrative Powers Over Persons and Property,' p. 279. \n\n[\nFootnote 38\n] Two bills providing workmen's compensation for longshoremen and harbor workers were before the Congress at the same time. H. R. 9498, which was first reported favorably to the House, declared in terms, sections 22, 24, that 'the decision of the deputy commissioner shall be final as to all questions of fact and except as provided in section 24 as to all questions of law.' This bill was abandoned by the House in favor of S. 3170, in order that some legislation on the subject, under what was regarded as an emergency, might be passed at that session. H. D., 69th Cong., 1st Sess., ser. 16, pt. 2, pp. 139-141. Although the differences between the two bills were minutely examined in the hearings before the House Committee on the Judiciary, no reference was made to any change in the provisions for review of compensation orders; but on the contrary it was affirmatively stated the Senate bill likewise enacted administrative finality upon questions of fact. Id., pt. 2, p. 200. The same statement was made in the Senate hearings. Id., pt. 1, pp. 53, 66. The bill was reported to the House as having been amended to 'conform substantially' to the bill theretofore reported. H. Rep., No. 1767, 69th Cong., 1st Sess. Both in this report and in the brief debates in both houses, the bill was described as designed to prevent the delay and injustice incident to litigation, and as affording to maritime workers the same remedies as those provided in state workmen's compensation laws. See 67 Cong. Rec. 10614; 68 Cong. Rec. 5410-5414, 5908. The state Workmen's Compensation Statutes have, almost universally, been construed to provide for final administrative determination of questions of fact, including the fact of the existence of an employment. See note 35, supra. \n\n[\nFootnote 39\n] Congress has incorporated by reference the provisions for review of orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission in authorizing judicial review of certain orders of the Federal Power Commission and the Shipping Board, as it did in the Packers and Stockyards Act. See note 36, supra. \n[\nFootnote 40\n] In People ex rel. New York & Queens Gas Co. v. McCall, 219 N. Y. 84, 88, 90, 113 N. E. 795, it was held that the scope of the review on certiorari of an order of the Public Service Commission was the same as that of the federal court on bill in equity of the orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission as declared in Interstate Commerce Commission v. Illinois Central R. R. Co., \n215 \nU.S. 452, 470\n, 30 S. Ct. 155. Compare Vanfleet, 'Collateral Attack on Judicial Proceedings,'  2, 3. \n[\nFootnote 41\n] Certiorari is the historic writ for determining whether the action of an inferior tribunal has been taken within its jurisdiction; and it has sometimes been held that the writ lies only to determine this question. Compare Jackson v. People, 9 Mich. 111, 77 Am. Dec. 491. But, although there is considerable divergence is the practice of the various states as to the scope of the review, the proceeding, apart from extraordinary statutory provisions, is universally upon the record and the evidence before the inferior tribunal, and not a trial de novo.

See Freund, 'Administrative Powers Over Persons and Property,' pp. 267-269. \n\n[\nFootnote 42\n] See the statutes and cases cited in note 5, supra. Similar decisions have been repeatedly made, under the Fourteenth Amendment, in cases coming from the state courts. This court has recently decided that a state Workmen's Compensation Act may validly provide for judicial review upon matters of law only. Dahlstrom Metallic Door Co. v. Industrial Board, \n284 \nU.S. 594\n, 52 S. Ct. 202, 76 L. Ed. -. See, also, New York Central R. R. Co. v. White, \n243 \nU.S. 188, 207\n, 208 S., 37 S. Ct. 247, L. R. A. 1917D, 1, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 629. In Missouri ex rel. Hurwitz v. North, \n271 \nU.S. 40, 42\n, 46 S. Ct. 384, it was held that a state board of health might be empowered, upon reasonable notice, specification of charges, and opportunity to be heard, to revoke a physician's license, subject only to review in the courts upon certiorari. (continued on p. 78) \n In Washington ex rel. Oregon Railroad & Navigation Co. v. Fairchild, \n224 \nU.S. 510, 527\n, 32 S.

Brooklyn, \n166 \nU.S. 685, 695\n, 17 S. Ct. 718, it was held that the findings of fact by commissioners in assessing damages in condemnation proceedings might be made final, leaving open to the court only the question whether there was any error in the basis of appraisal, or otherwise.

Compare 2 Daniell, 'Chancery Practice' (2d Ed.) 1045, 1046, 1053, 1054, 1069 et seq. \n\n[\nFootnote 44\n] Admiralty Rule 46, \n254 U.S. 698\n (28 USCA  723). Subsequent to 1842, when the procedure in admiralty became subject to rules promulgated by this Court, and prior to 1921, no rule specifically required that evidence be taken orally in open court, and the practice in some districts appears to have been to take proofs by a commission. Compare Admiralty Rules 44, 46, \n210 U.S. 558\n; The Guy C. Goss (D. C.) 53 F. 826, 827; The Wavelet (D. C.) 25 F. 733, 734. See, also, The Sun (D. C.) 271 F. 953, 954. Under the present rules the District Court may still, upon proper circumstances, refer causes in admiralty to a commissioner, without the consent of the parties, to hear the testimony and report conclusions on issues of fact and law. The P. R. R. No. 35 (C. C. A.) 48 F.(2d) 122; Sorenson & Co. v. Liverpool, Brazil & River Plate Steam Nav. Co. (D. C.) 47 F.(2d) 332. Compare The City of Washington, \n92 U.S. 31\n, 39; Los Angeles Brush Manufacturing Corporation v. James, \n272 \nU.S. 701\n, 47 S. Ct. 286. The commissioner's findings of fact are not disturbed unless clearly erroneous. The La Bourgogne (C. C. A.) 144 F. 781, 783, affirmed \n210 \nU.S. 95\n, 28 S. Ct. 664; Anderson v. Alaska S. S. Co. (C. C. A.) 22 F.(2d) 532, 535. \n[\nFootnote 45\n] See Admiralty Rule 45, \n254 U.S. 698\n (28 USCA  723); Supreme Court Rule 15, \n275 U.S. 607\n (28 USCA  354). \n\n[\nFootnote 46\n] The decision of the District Court, acquiesced in by the Circuit Court of Appeals and this Court, that the remedy under section 21(b) of the Longshoreman's Act is in admiralty, seems to me unfounded. The provision in that section for suspending or setting aside a compensation order by injunction clearly implies a proceeding upon bill in equity. Congress may authorize actions for maritime torts to be brought on the law side of the federal District Courts, Panama R. R. Co. v. Johnson, \n264 \nU.S. 375, 385\n, 44 S. Ct. 391; or in the state courts, Engel v. Davenport, \n271 \nU.S. 33, 37\n, 46 S. Ct. 410. See, also, Chelentis v. Luckenbach S. S. Co., \n247 \nU.S. 372, 384\n, 38 S. Ct. 501. No constitutional objection can exist, therefore, to giving effect to the remedy in equity provided in this Act. \n\n[\nFootnote 47\n] The opinion of the Court suggests that, upon similar reasoning, the issue whether the injury occurred on navigable waters must likewise be open to independent redetermination, upon the facts as well as the law, in the District Court. The question whether any peculiar significance attaches to such a controversy, entitling it to be twice tried, is not before us. It has never been decided that the power of Congress to provide compensation for injuries to workmen received in the course of maritime employment depends upon the injury having occurred upon navigable waters. See Benedict, 'The American Admiralty' (5th Ed.)  25. Compare Soper v. Hammond Lumber Co. (D. C.) 4 F.(2d) 872; State Industrial Commission v. Nordenholt Corporation, \n259 \nU.S. 263\n, 42 S. Ct. 473, 25 A. L. R. 1013. The Longshoremen's Act undertakes to cover only the field of admiralty jurisdiction within which the decisions of this Court have held uniformity to be required. See Stanley Morrison, 'Workmen's Compensation and the Maritime Law,' 38 Yale L. J. 472, 500. \n\n[\nFootnote 48\n] That Legislatures may abolish defenses recognized at common law and create new causes of action not so recognized is beyond question. So also is the power, under proper circumstances, to provide for liability without fault. Compare St. Louis & San Francisco Ry. Co. v. Mathews, \n165 \nU.S. 1\n, 17 S. Ct. 243; Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Zernecke, \n183 \nU.S. 582\n, 22 S. Ct. 229; St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern Ry. Co. v. Taylor, \n210 \nU.S. 281\n, 28 S. Ct. 616; New York Central R. R. Co. v. White, \n243 \nU.S. 188\n, 37 S. Ct. 247, L. R. A. 1917D, 1, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 629. Congress may provide that a carrier shall be liable for loss or damage to goods occurring beyond its own lines. Atlantic Coast Line R. R. Co. v. Riverside Mills, \n219 \nU.S. 186, 203\n, 31 S. Ct. 164, 169, 31 L. R. A. ( N. S.) 7. See, also, Atlantic Coast Line R. R. Co. v. Glenn, \n239 \nU.S. 388, 393\n, 36 S. Ct. 154. 'The rule,' said the Court, 'is adapted to secure the rights of the shipper by securing unity of transportation with unity of responsibility.' That Congress might not similarly secure unity of responsibility for injuries to all persons working upon the same enterprise, irrespective of the particular relation existing of contract or employment, is not to be assumed without argument and in the absence of circumstances presenting the question. The logic upon which workmen's compensation acts have been sustained does not require insistence upon a technical master and servant relation. Compare Ward & Gow v. Krinsky, \n259 \nU.S. 503\n, 42 S. Ct. 529, 28 A. L. R. 1207. See, also, Jeremiah Smith, 'Sequel to Workmen's Compensation Acts,' 27 Harv. L. Rev. 235, 344.\n The common law, of course, holds many examples of liability to third persons for injury sustained at the hands of an independent contractor or his servant. E. g., Ellis v. Sheffeld Co., 2 E. & B. 767; Pickard v. Smith, 10 C. B. (N. S.) 470; Doll v. Ribetti (C. C. A.) 203 F. 593. \n[\nFootnote 49\n] See the analysis and criticism in William O. Douglas, 'Vicarious Liability and Administration of Risk,' 38 Yale L. J. 584, 594-604. Compare O. W. Holmes, 'Agency,' 5 Harv. L.

Robertson Jones, 'Digest of Workmen's Compensation Laws' (10th Ed.). The provision in the New York Workmen's Compensation Act (Consol. Laws, c. 67),  56, is illustrative: 'A contractor, the subject of whose contract is, involves or includes a hazardous employment, who subcontracts all or any part of such contract shall be liable for and shall pay compensation to any employee injured . ...' In 1927, in recommending the extension of this provision to include owners or lessees as well as general contractors, the State Industrial Commissioner said: 'From the point of view of making sure of compensation to injured workers, all the reasons for the existing obligations put upon a general contractor for a piece of building work who sublets part of the work, are equally cogent for doing the same in case of an owner or lessee of premises who lets part of building work in precisely the same way. The practical need for doing it has been shown by experience to be extensive owing to the large amount of building work now being done under the method above noted and which this amendment is designed to cover.\n'The existing provision has proven very beneficial in the case of contractors, and it will be equally useful in the case of the type of owner-contractor, so to speak who must now be dealt with for solution of the same problem.'

It was not until the Act of March 3, 1875, c. 137, 18 Stat. 470, that Congress extended the jurisdiction of the circuit courts to 'cases arising under the laws of the United States,' thus permitting to be exercised 'the vast range of power which had lain dormant in the Constitution since 1789.' See Felix Frankfurter and James M. Landis, 'The Business of the Supreme Court,' pp. 65-68; Charles Warren, 'Federal Criminal Laws and the State Courts,' 38 Harv. L. Rev. 545. Large areas of the potential jurisdiction of the lower federal courts are now occupied by other tribunals. As to legislative courts, see Wilber Griffith Katz, 'Federal Legislative Courts,' 43 Harv. L. Rev. 894. Congress has repeatedly exercised power to exclude from the federal courts cases not involving the requisite jurisdictional amount. Cases arising under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (45 USCA  51-59) are triable in either the state courts or the federal District Courts. See Second Employers' Liability Cases, \n223 \nU.S. 1, 56\n, 57 S.-59, 32 S. Ct. 169, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 44; Douglas v. New York, New Haven & Hartford R. R. Co., \n279 \nU.S. 377\n, 49 S. Ct. 355.

So far as concerns the question here presented, it is immaterial whether the controversy is wholly between private parties or is between the government and a citizen. The fact that litigation under the Longshoremen's Act is, in substance, between private parties (even though under section 21(b) the deputy commissioner is the only necessary party respondent) does not warrant the inference that the administrative features of the act present a question not heretofore decided. The tribunals in note 36, supra, listed deal with matters outside the scope of the doctrine recently examined in Ex parte Bakelite Corporation, \n279 \nU.S. 438\n, 49 S. Ct. 411, 413. While the opinion in that case referred to 'various matters, arising between the government and others,' as appropriate for the cognizance of legislative courts, the reference was restricted to matters 'which from their nature do not require judicial determination and yet are susceptible of it,' the mode of determining which 'is completely within congressional control.' Id. at page 451 of 279 U. S., 49 S. Ct. 411, 413. The suggestion that due process does not require judicial process in any controversy to which the government is a party would involve a revision of historic conceptions of the nature of the federal judicial system. That all questions arising in the administration of the Interstate Commerce Act, for example, or between a taxpayer and the government under the tax laws, could be committed by Congress exclusively to executive officers, in respect to issues of law as well as of fact, has never been supposed. Thus there is no indication in the opinion in Ex parte Bakelite Corporation that the Commerce Court was a legislative court, although instances of the creation of such courts were considered in detail. See Wilber Griffith Katz, 'Federal Legislative Courts,' 43 Harv. L. Rev. 894, 914, 915. \n\n[\nFootnote 55\n] Compare Miller v. Horton, 152 Mass. 540, 26 N. E. 100, 10 L. R. A. 116, 23 Am. St. Rep. 850, and Pearson v. Zehr, 138 Ill. 48, 29 N. E. 854, 32 Am. St. Rep. 113, cited by the Court. These cases involved summary administrative action, and the complaining individuals had been given no opportunity to be heard on the question whether their property was in fact subject to the destruction ordered. The degree of finality appropriate in administrative action must always depend upon the character of the administrative hearing provided. Compare Dickinson, 'Administrative Justice and the Supremacy of Law,' pp. 260, 261; E. F. Albertsworth, 'Judicial Review of Administrative Action by the Federal Supreme Court,' 35 Harv. L. Rev. 127, 152, 153. In most states, the tendency appears to be to deny the right, in a tort action against an administrative officer, to question the existence of the fact justifying his act, if a hearing was provided or if a suit for injunction could have been brought. See Freund, 'Administrative Powers Over Persons and Property,' pp. 248-252; Kirk v. Board of Health, 83 S. C. 372, 383, 65 S. E. 387, 23 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1188.

In cases arising under the Workmen's Compensation Laws, where formal hearing is available, the Massachusetts and Illinois courts, in common with many others, have held the administrative finding of the fact of employment conclusive.

See Albert Levitt, 'The Judicial Review of Executive Acts,' 23 Mich. L. Rev. 588, 595 et. seq. This authority may embrace as well the determination of questions of law as of fact, depending upon the judicial construction given to the authority of the tribunal. Thus in Re Grimley, \n137 \nU.S. 147\n, 11 S. Ct. 54; in Re Morrissey, \n137 \nU.S. 157\n, 11 S. Ct. 57; Noble v. Union River Logging Railroad, \n147 \nU.S. 165\n, 13 S. Ct. 271; Smith v.

Ct. 595, all cited in note 57, infra, the Court recognized the conclusiveness of many decisions of law by the tribunals in question. Tribunals of this character are of course empowered, under ordinary circumstances, to make conclusive determinations of fact. See e. g., Passavant v. United States, \n148 \nU.S. 214, 219\n, 13 S.

Ct. 492, the statute authorized the deportation only of aliens, without provision for judicial review of the executive order. Act of February 5, 1917, c. 29,  19, 39 Stat. 874 (8 USCA  155), 889. Upon application for a writ of habeas corpus, by a person arrested who claimed to be a citizen, it was held that he was entitled to a judicial determination of that claim. No question arose as to whether Congress might validly have provided for review exclusively upon the record made in the executive department; nor as to the scope of review which might have been permissible upon such record.\n (b) In re Grimley, \n137 \nU.S. 147\n, 11 S. Ct. 54, and In re Morrissey, \n137 \nU.S. 157\n, 11 S. Ct. 57, deal with the action of military tribunals. Military tribunals from a system of courts separate from the civil courts and created by virtue of an independent grant of power in the Constitution. Article 1,  8, clauses 14, 16. They have authority to determine finally any case over which they have jurisdiction; 'and their proceedings ... are not open to review by the civil tribunals, except for the purpose of ascertaining whether the military court had jurisdiction of the person and subject-matter, and whether, though having such jurisdiction, it had exceeded its powers in the sentence pronounced.' Carter v. Roberts, \n177 U.S. 496\n, 498 20 S. Ct. 713; Grafton v. United States, \n206 \nU.S. 333, 347\n, 27 S. Ct. 749, 11 Ann. Cas. 640. As Congress did not provide any method for review by the courts of the decision of military tribunals, all questions of law concerning military jurisdiction are open to independent determination in the civil courts; and the cases of In re Grimley and In re Morrissey, decide nothing more. Whether Congress could make the findings of 'jurisdictional facts,' of military tribunals conclusive upon civil courts is a question which appears never to have been raised.\n (c) In Noble v. Union River Logging Railroad, \n147 \nU.S. 165, 174\n, 13 S. Ct. 271, relief was granted by bill in equity to stay illegal and unauthorized action of the Secretary of the Interior in respect to the public lands, there being no method of judicial review prescribed by statute.

No commentator, however, appears to have understood the decision as recognizing in any manner a right to trial de novo in court upon confiscation issues. \n\n[\nFootnote 59\n] It is cause for regret that the Court in determining this controversy should have declared, obiter, that in matters of state public utility regulation involving administrative action of a special character, and raising questions under a different constitutional provision, a mode of procedure is required contrary to that almost universally established under state law (see David E. Lilienthal. 'The Federal Courts and State Regulation of Public Utilities,' 43 Harv. L. Rev. 379, 412, 413), and calculated seriously to embarrass the operation of the administrative method in that field. \n\n[\nFootnote 60\n] But see Interstate Commerce Commission v. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co., \n227 \nU.S. 88, 92\n, 33 S. Ct. 185. The statement by Mr. Justice Jamar there, however, went no further than to indicate that in some circumstances the courts on review of orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission might pass an independent judgment upon the evidence adduced before the Commission.

Compensation payments were completed in 11,776 cases, or 38.8 per cent. of the total. In 17,328 cases, or 57 per cent., the injured employee failed to receive compensation because no time was lost, or less than seven days, on account of the injury. The balance of 1, 279 cases, amounting to 4.2 per cent. of the whole, were dismissed because they did not come within the scope of the law. Among the 18,607 noncompensated cases, formal claims were filed by the employee in only 1, 025 instances. See, also, Report of the Compensation Commission, 1930, pp. 68-70. \n[\nFootnote 63\n] For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1931, 101 new cases were filed in the District Courts, out of a total of 30,489 cases disposed of.

The decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals in the case at bar declaring the right to a trial de novo was rendered November 17, 1930, and the first opinion of the District Court on May 27, 1929. \n[\nFootnote 64\n] How serious these consequences will be is a question of speculation; but it is plain that they will be aggravated by the inherent uncertainty in the scope of the doctrine announced. The determination of what facts are 'jurisdictional' or 'fundamental' is calculated to provoke a multitude of disputes. That there is a difference in kind, for example, between the defense that the injured claimant is not an employee, and that he was not acting as an employee when he was injured, or that there is a difference between the latter defense and the defense that the disability, if any, from which he suffers resulted only in part, or not at all, from the employment in which he claims to have suffered it, are propositions which employers will be unlikely to accept until they have submitted them to the decision of the courts. The effectiveness of this legislation will be lessened by this opportunity for barren controversy over procedural rights and by delayed or thwarted determination of substantive ones. \n\n\n\n\n","49":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nD. GINSBERG & SONS v. POPKIN(1932)\nNo. 429\nArgued: February 16, 1932Decided: March 14, 1932\n\n\n\n Messrs. Leo J. Linder, of New York City, and Raymond J. Mawhinney, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Louis Jersawit, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The District Court in the Eastern District of New York adjudged the Foster Construction Corporation a bankrupt and in June, 1930, a trustee was appointed. Respondent was president, and petitioner was a creditor of \n\n[285 U.S. 204, 205]\n\u00a0\n the corporation. December 4, 1930, petitioner presented to one of the judges in the Southern district of New York a petition, the brief substance of which follows:\n In 1929, about the time the petition in bankruptcy was filed, respondent withdrew, and has failed to account for, a large amount of cash belonging to the corporation. He fled to Canada in order to avoid examination and did not return until January, 1930. About that time the court in the Eastern district issued an order of ne exeat against him but he fled again and later returned to the borough of Manhattan where he was then concealing himself with the intention of immediately leaving the United States to avoid examination. The petition stated that respondent's testimony would be in aid of creditors, and that, had he been requested so to do, the trustee would have refused to apply for his arrest, and that therefore the petitioner made the application for an ancillary order of examination and arrest in aid of itself and other creditors. It was shown that a judge in the Eastern district authorized petitioner to apply for this order in the Southern district.\n On these representations the judge made an order of examination and arrest. And on the same day he signed another order, under the caption 'Writ Ne Exeat,' commanding the marshal to apprehend respondent, take him into custody and bring him before the judge for examination, 'or, at his option, cause him to give sufficient bail or security in the sum of $10, 000 ... that he the said Joseph Popkin will not depart from or go ... beyond the territorial jurisdiction of this court without its leave, and will at all times and in all manner, respect and things, obey and comply with the lawful orders and decrees of the court herein for his examination, in default of which he is to be lodged in New York County Jail. ...' In obedience to that command the marshal arrested respondent. He gave the prescribed bail and \n\n[285 U.S. 204, 206]\n\u00a0\n the clerk released him from custody. Then respondent applied to a judge in the Southern district to have the order vacated on the ground that it was made without jurisdiction. The motion was denied. 47 F.(2d) 276. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. 50 F.(2d) 693.\n The petitioner contends that clause (15) of section 2 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 USCA  11(15), empowers district judges in bankruptcy cases upon the application of a creditor to issue orders directing the arrest of officers of bankrupt corporations.\n The words of section 2 relied on are: 'The courts of bankruptcy ... are hereby invested ... with such jurisdiction at law and in equity as will enable them to exercise original jurisdiction in bankruptcy proceedings ... to ... (15) make such orders, issue such process, and enter such judgments in addition to those specifically provided for as may be necessary for the enforcement of the provisions of this title.'\n Clause (15) is to be construed having regard to the other parts of section 2, to the provisions of the act in respect of examinations concerning the business and property of bankrupts, and to section 261 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  376) relating to writs of ne exeat.\n Section 2 creates courts of bankruptcy and in general terms, by twenty separately numbered clauses, confers upon them authority in respect of at least as many matters relating to bankruptcies. By clause (13) bankruptcy courts are empowered by means of fine or imprisonment to enforce obedience by bankrupts and others to all lawful orders and by clause (16) to punish persons for contempts committed before referees. Section 7a(9), 11 USCA  25(9), makes it the duty of the bankrupt, when present at the first meeting of creditors and at such other times as the court shall order, to submit to examination concerning his business, acts, and property. Section 21a, 11 USCA  44(a), empowers the court upon the application of a creditor to require any designated person, including the bankrupt, to appear for simi- \n\n[285 U.S. 204, 207]\n\u00a0\n lar examination. Section 9a, 11 USCA  27(a), exempts the bankrupt from arrest upon civil process issued from a court of bankruptcy except for contempt or disobedience of its lawful orders. And section 9b, 11 USCA  27(b), specifically governs arrests and detention of bankrupts about to leave the district in order to avoid examination. It is as follows:\n'The judge may, at any time after the filing of a petition by or against a person, and before the expiration of one month after the qualification of the trustee, upon satisfactory proof by the affidavits of at least two persons that such bankrupt is about to leave the district in which he resides or has his principal place of business to avoid examination, and that his departure will defeat the proceedings in bankruptcy, issue a warrant to the marshal, directing him to bring such bankrupt forthwith before the court for examination. If upon hearing the evidence of the parties it shall appear to the court of a judge thereof that the allegations are true and that it is necessary, he shall order such marshal to keep such bankrupt in custody not exceeding ten days, but not imprison him, until he shall be examined and released or give bail conditioned for his appearance for examination, from time to time, not exceeding in all ten days, as required by the court, and for his obedience to all lawful orders made in reference thereto.'\n\n Section 261 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  376), provides that writs of ne exeat may be granted by any district judge in cases where they might be granted by the District Court of which he is a judge, and declares: 'But no writ of ne exeat shall be granted unless a suit in equity is commenced, and satisfactory proof is made to the court or judge granting the same that the defendant designs quickly to depart from the United States.'\n In view of the general exemption of bankrupts from arrest under section 9a and the carefully guarded exception made by section 9b as to those about to leave the district to \n\n[285 U.S. 204, 208]\n\u00a0\n avoid examination, there is no support for petitioner's contention that the general language of section 2(15) is a limitation upon section 9(b) or grants additional authority in respect of arrests of bankrupts. General language of a statutory provision, although broad enough to include it, will not be held to apply to a matter specifically dealt with in another part of the same enactment. United States v. Chase, \n135 \nU.S. 255, 260\n, 10 S. Ct. 756. Specific terms prevail over the general in the same or another statute which otherwise might be controlling. Kepner v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 100, 125\n, 24 S. Ct. 797, 1 Ann. Cas. 655; In re Hassenbusch (C. C. A.) 108 F. 35, 38; United States ex rel. Kelley v. Peters (D. C.) 166 F. 613, 615. The construction contended for would violate the cardinal rule that, if possible, effect shall be given to every clause and part oa a statute. Washington Market Co. v. Hoffman, \n101 U.S. 112\n, 115; Ex parte Public Bank, \n278 \nU.S. 101, 104\n, 49 S. Ct. 43.\n Assuming that under section 2(15) bankruptcy courts are empowered to allow writs of ne exeat, that granted in this case was without warrant, for conditions made essential by the common law and as well by the Judicial Code were lacking.\n Speaking for the Supreme Court of Wisconsin in Davidor v. Rosenberg, 130 Wis. 22, 24, 109 N. W. 925, 118 Am. St. Rep. 986, Mr. Justice Winslow described the writ of ne exeat as follows: 'At common law it was simply a writ to obtain equitable bail. It was issued by a court of equity on application of the complainant against the defendant when it appeared that there was a debt positively due, certain in amount, or capable of being made certain, on an equitable demand not suable at law (except in cases of account and possibly some other cases of concurrent jurisdiction), and that the defendant was about to leave the jurisdiction, having conveyed away his property, or under other circumstances which would render any decree ineffectual. Dean v. Smith, 23 Wis. 483, 99 Am. Dec. 198; Rhodes v. \n\n[285 U.S. 204, 209]\n\u00a0\n Cousins, 6 Rand. (Va.) 188, 191, 18 Am. Dec. 715; Gibert v. Colt, 1 Hopk. Ch. (N. Y.) 496, 14 Am. Dec. 557, and note.'\n The writ is a restraint upon the common right of movement from place to place within the United States and upon emigration. It has been abolished in some states and its use is largely regulated and restricted by statute in others. 1 And section 261 of the Judicial Code strictly governs the granting of the writ in federal courts.\n Section 9(b) provides a substitute for and so excludes the use of the writ against bankrupts. As respondent is not a bankrupt, that subdivision does not authorize his arrest or afford him protection. There is no reason for stricter measures to compel others to submit to examination. General authority to compel attendance, and the giving of testimony is conferred by section 21a and section 2(13) and (16). And, in the absence of language specifically disclosing that purpose, Congress will not be deemed to have intended to subject officers of bankrupt corporations or other witnesses to arrests and detentions, by writ of ne exeat or otherwise, against which  9a and 9b protect bankrupt persons. We conclude that the court had no authority under section 2(15) or otherwise to make the order of arrest and ne exeat under consideration.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See authorities cited in note, 14 Am.

The last of these-the Dalton Manufacturing Corporation-was incorporated under the laws of New York in 1917; he paid for all the capital stock-$395,000; became a director, president, treasurer, and controlled its affairs. No other person was financially interested. He testified that his primary purpose in this venture was to perfect his sundry models and patented articles and sell the corporate shares profitably; he thought it would be better to market such articles through the corporation, to have the business in corporate form; he considered the corporation as a branch or part of his own business as an inventor and dealer in patents, etc.-as a means to an end, an instrumentality of his purpose. Also that he believed it essential thus to have his inventions manufactured and brought before the public; the corporations were used in order to develop and improve his inventions.\n The manufacturing corporation promptly took over certain Dalton patents, manufactured the articles, and sought to sell them. The petitioner endeavored to sell the corporate shares and thereby to obtain gain. From time to time he advanced large sums to pay debts and carry on the corporate business. These loans appeared on the books, but were not repaid. For six years credits were placed to his salary account; he withdrew nothing. In 1924 the corporation became hopelessly insolvent, and during 1925 passed out of existence. The evidence indicates losses during several preceding years. All creditors were paid by petitioner.\n The corporation and Dalton made separate returns for federal income taxes. In 1923 and 1924 he claimed large deductions-$157,035.50 and $162, 309.24-on account of bad debts due from it. \n\n[287 U.S. 404, 407]\n\u00a0\n In their joint income return for 1925 Dalton and his wife claimed a deduction of $395,000-the full amount paid for the then worthless shares of the manufacturing corporation. The Commissioner ruled that this loss occurred in 1924. Adjustments for that year showed $374,000 net loss by the Daltons. The Commissioner refused to apply this upon their 1925 return because not attributable to the operation of a trade or business regularly carried on by the taxpayer. If so applied, there would have been no taxable income for that year. Payment of $56,841.32 was demanded and made under protest. This suit to recover followed.\n Petitioners maintain that the $395,000 loss, adjudged by the collector to have occurred in 1924, was sustained in a trade or business regularly carried on by Mr. Dalton; consequently, the net loss for that year-$374,078.98-should have been deducted from the 1925 income under terms of the Revenue Act of 1924,  206(a) and (b), 26 USCA  937(a, b) and note, and Treasury Regulations 65, art. 1621. The District Court accepted their view; the Circuit Court of Appeals held otherwise.\n The latter court said:\n'There is no justification for saying that the business of the corporation was that of the appellee. During the period the appellee dealt with the corporation as an entity. When he paid the debts of the corporation, he drew on his personal account in favor of the corporation's account, and this made the corporation his debtor. Separate tax returns were filed by the corporation and by the appellee. He purchased the capital stock with the intention of disposing of it to the public. His individual time was spent in large part in matters of invention. ... The loss now sought to be deducted was an investment which he made in the corporation and did not occur in the operation of the trade or business regularly carried on by the appellee. ... \n\n[287 U.S. 404, 408]\n\u00a0\n 'By the statute, allowing the deductions and carrying over the loss for two years, Congress intended to give relief to persons engaged in an established business for losses incurred during a year of depression in order to equalize taxation in the two succeeding and more profitable years. It was not intended to apply to occasional or isolated losses. ...\n\n'This taxpayer did not regard the business losses of the Dalton Manufacturing Company as his loss. The loss sustained by the appellee which he seeks to charge off is a capital investment loss. The rule is well settled that the corporation will be looked upon as a legal entity . ...' 56 F.(2d) 16, 18.\n\n We agree with the conclusion of the Circuit Court of Appeals, and its judgment must be affirmed.\n The Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. 253, 260 U.S.C., title 26,  937 (26 USCA  937 (a)(1, 2)(b), provides:\n Section 206: '(a) As used in this section the term 'net loss' means the excess of the deductions allowed by section 955 or 986 of this title ( 214 or 234) over the gross income, with the following exceptions and limitations:\n'(1) Deductions otherwise allowed by law not attributable to the operation of a trade or business regularly carried on by the taxpayer shall be allowed only to the extent of the amount of the gross income not derived from such trade or business;\n\n'(2) In the case of a taxpayer other than a corporation, deductions for capital losses otherwise allowed by law shall be allowed only to the extent of the capital gains. ...\n\n'(b) If, for any taxable year, it appears upon the production of evidence satisfactory to the commissioner that any taxpayer has sustained a net loss, the amount thereof shall be allowed as a deduction in computing the net income of the taxpayer for the succeding taxable year ( hereinafter in this section called 'second year') and if such net loss is in excess of such net income (computed \n\n[287 U.S. 404, 409]\n\u00a0\n without such deduction), the amount of such excess shall be allowed as a deduction in computing the net income for the next succeeding taxable year hereinafter in this section called 'third year'); the deduction in all cases to be made under regulations prescribed by the commissioner with the approval of the Secretary.'\n\n In the courts below the petitioners unsuccessfully insisted that the loss upon sale of the corporate shares occurred in 1925 and should be offset against gains received during that year. Here that insistence is not renewed.\n The claim of right to offset the net loss of 1924 against 1925 gains cannot prevail, unless the requirements of the quoted section, Revenue Act of 1924, are met-the loss must have been 'attributable to the operation of a trade or business regularly carried on by the taxpayer.'\n In support of their position petitioners say:\n The losses of the manufacturing corporation were not the losses of the taxpayers. They do not seek to disregard the corporate entity, but respect it. Taken as a whole, this entity constituted a part of the individual trade or business of Hubert Dalton. His trade or business was not merely that of inventing; it included exploiting of his inventions, putting them on a paying basis by developing, manufacturing, improving, and selling them through corporations organized for that special purpose. All of these things formed a complete, comprehensive enterprise of which the corporation was part. It was an instrumentality of the taxpayer's business. Consequently, the investment in the corporate shares was part of business regularly carried on.\n Whether theoretically valid or not, this argument rests upon assumptions out of harmony with the facts disclosed by the record. Dalton was not regularly engaged in the business of buying and selling corporate stocks. He organized the manufacturing corporation, and took over \n\n[287 U.S. 404, 410]\n\u00a0\n all its shares with the intention of selling them at a profit. He treated it as something apart from his ordinary affairs, accepted credits for salaries as an officer, claimed loss to himself because of loans to it which had become worthless, and caused it to make returns for taxation distinct from his own. Nothing indicates that he regarded the corporation as his agent with authority to contract or act in his behalf. Ownership of all the stock is not enough to show that creation and management of the corporation was a part of his ordinary business. Certainly, under the general rule for tax purposes, a corporation is an entity distinct from its stockholders, and the circumstances here are not so unusual as to create an exception.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","51":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDANIEL v. GUARANTY TRUST CO. OF NEW YORK(1932)\nNo. 179\nArgued: December 11, 1931Decided: March 14, 1932\n\n\n\n Messrs. Winthrop B. Lane and Halleck F. Rose, both of Omaha, Neb., for petitioner.\n\n\n[285 U.S. 154, 157]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Porter R. Chandler, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n\n[285 U.S. 154, 158]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n December 10, 1920, the Peters Trust Company, of Omaha, Neb., was adjudged bankrupt by the United States District Court for that state. March 17, 1930, Herbert S. Daniel, petitioner here, became trustee of the estate.\n In April, 1930, the Guaranty Trust Company of New York presented to the same court a petition for the reclamation of designated bonds. It alleged that while insolvent and without intent to pay for them the Peters Company had fraudulently ordered and received these bonds from the Guaranty Company of New York; that title thereto had not passed to the Peters Company; that no part of the purchase price had been paid. Also 'that on the dates said bonds were shipped by the Guaranty Company of New York, said Guaranty Company of New York, sold, assigned and set over to your petitioner, Guaranty Trust Company, for a valuable consideration, the accounts against the said Peters Trust Company for said bonds, and your petitioner is now the owner of said bonds'; and that they were unlawfully withheld by the \n\n[285 U.S. 154, 159]\n\u00a0\n trustee. The prayer was 'that an order be entered instructing and directing, Herbert S. Daniel, Trustee of said Peters Trust Company, Bankrupt, to deliver to your petitioner the bonds described above and that your petitioner have such other and further relief as may seem just and proper.'\n The trustee answered. He denied that the bankrupt had acted fraudulently. He asserted that title to the bonds had vested in it and petitioner had no right to recover them.\n After such denials and allegations the trustee (answer, par. 7) stated that customers of the Peters Trust Company had placed orders with it to buy the bonds, that they had an interest in the controversy and should be made parties to the proceeding. Also (paragraph 8):\n'Your trustee further alleges, that the Guaranty Trust Company of New York, the petitioner and applicant herein, has in its possession, on deposit, approximately the sum of $31,224.60 which belongs to the bankrupt estate, and which was accumulated by the Receiver and Trustee of said bankrupt estate since the date it was adjudicated bankrupt. The trustee has made due demand upon the petitioner for delivery of the said money, but the Guaranty Trust Company of New York has refused to deliver the said funds or any part thereof, and should be required to account for all funds collected by it on behalf of the receiver or trustee of Peters Trust Company, Bankrupt, or the bankrupt estate, and be directed to deliver the same forthwith to Herbert S. Daniel, Trustee.'\n\n The answer concludes:\n'The trustee further prays for an order directing the Guaranty Trust Company of New York to account to him for all funds collected or now held by it belonging to the bankrupt estate, and be ordered to deliver the same (forthwith) to your trustee, and for such other relief as to the Court may seem just and equitable.' \n\n[285 U.S. 154, 160]\n\u00a0\n The matter went to the referee. The Guaranty Trust Company moved that paragraphs 7 and 8 be stricken from the answer because they pertained to an issue entirely separate from the one submitted by its petition. This was overruled. Thereupon, counsel for the trust company asked that the reclamation proceeding be dismissed, and then withdrew.\n\n The referee took testimony concerning the relationship and dealings among the parties. He found that the reclamation proceedings should be dismissed only in so far as they sought to obtain the securities. Also, 'the court further finds that the Guaranty Trust Company has in its hands the sum of $23,724.60 in cash, belonging to Herbert S. Daniel, trustee of the above named bankrupt; that said sum was accumulated by Herbert S. Daniel as receiver subsequent to February 12th, 1930, said moneys having been collected by said Guaranty Trust Company for and on behalf of said bankrupt estate from the Prudential Insurance Company of America on mortgages made by the bankrupt and sold to the Prudential Insurance Company of America, and that said Guaranty Trust Company has not made herein any claim to the said fund of $23,724.60, and has no claim to the said fund, or to any part thereof, and is merely holding the said sum of $ 23,724.60 as custodian and agent of Herbert S. Daniel, as trustee of the above named bankrupt, and that said sum should be delivered forthwith to said trustee.'\n The referee's final order directed the trustee to deliver the bonds to specified customers of the Peters Trust Company upon stated conditions, and further: 'That the Guaranty Trust Company of New York, the applicant herein, be, and it is hereby ordered and directed to forthwith pay over to Herbert S. Daniel, as trustee of the above bankrupt estate, the sum of $23, 724.60, of moneys in the hands of said Guaranty Trust Company of New \n\n[285 U.S. 154, 161]\n\u00a0\n York, belonging to Herbert S. Daniel, trustee of said bankrupt estate, with interest thereon at the rate of 7 per cent. annum from this date.'\n The District Court modified the referee's order as to interest and then affirmed it. The Guaranty Trust Company appealed. The Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the objection offered to the jurisdiction of the referee and upon that ground reversed the District Court. 49 F.(2d) 866, 868. It said:\n'... The petition of appellant for reclamation, and the portion of the trustee's answer which asked for affirmative relief were, in fact, petitions by the parties asking the referee to exercise his summary jurisdiction in proceedings in bankruptcy. The two proceedings were quite distinct. Appellant sought to recover certain bonds to which it claimed title. The trustee sought an order that appellant should pay over money of the bankrupt estate received by appellant, after bankruptcy. The proceedings would not have been more unrelated to each other, if the trustee had sought an order on appellant for the delivery of books and papers such as was asked in Babbitt v. Dutcher, \n216 \nU.S. 102\n, 30 S. Ct. 372, 17 Ann. Cas. 969, or an order for the examination of witnesses such as was asked in Elkus, Petitioner, \n216 \nU.S. 115\n, 30 S. Ct. 377. We have been cited to no authority for the proposition that a creditor or other petitioner asking specific relief against a bankrupt's estate, as provided by the Bankruptcy Act, thereby becomes subject to summary orders by the referee in matters entirely disconnected from the subject-matter of such claim or petition, and no such authority is believed to exist.'\n\n The conclusion of the Circuit Court of Appeals is correct, and its decree must be affirmed.\n In the circumstances, did the referee have jurisdiction to enter the turnover order against the trust company? \n\n[285 U.S. 154, 162]\n\u00a0\n The answer must be 'No' unless that company by filing its petition for reclamation entered its general appearance and in effect consented to submit itself to summary proceedings before that officer in respect of matters having no immediate relation to the claim which it had presented.\n In practice such a rule might lead to unfortunate complications and deprive owners of property of fair opportunity to recover. The risk incident to a general appearance and consent to adjudication of claims of all kinds might easily deter where the right to recover is clear. Moreover, the choice would not be between tribunals merely, but between the ordinary processes in a plenary suit and a summary hearing. We are not cited to any opinion by an appellate court which definitely approves the view advanced by the petitioner. We cannot conclude that the demand for speedy administration of bankrupt estates is enough to justify such a radical departure from ordinary procedure. And the suggestion that it is possible to impose equitable terms as a condition to an order of reclamation is not helpful. No such conditional order was proposed or entered.\n The petitioner maintains that read together and properly construed General Order xxxvii (11 USCA  53) and Equity Rule 30 (28 USCA  723) applied in the circumstances and invested the referee with jurisdiction to act as he did.\n General Order xxxvii-general provisions: 'In proceedings in equity, instituted for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of the act, or for enforcing the rights and remedies given by it, the rules of equity practice established by the Supreme Court of the United States shall be followed as nearly as may be. In proceedings at law, instituted for the same purpose, the practice and procedure in cases at law shall be followed as nearly as may be. But the judge may, by special order in any case, vary the time allowed for return of process, \n\n[285 U.S. 154, 163]\n\u00a0\n for appearance and pleading, and for taking testimony and publication, and may otherwise modify the rules for the preparation of any particular case so as to facilitate a speedy hearing.'\n No. 30, Rules of Practice for the Courts of Equity of the United States, provides: '... The answer must state in short and simple form any counterclaim arising out of the transaction which is the subjectmatter of the suit, and may, without cross-bill, set out any set-off or counterclaim against the plaintiff which might be the subject of an independent suit in equity against him, and such set-off or counterclaim, so set up, shall have the same effect as a cross-suit, so as to enable the court to pronounce a final decree in the same suit on both the original and the cross-claims.'\n Section 2, Bankruptcy Act (11 USCA  11), grants to bankruptcy courts 'such jurisdiction at law and in equity as will enable them to exercise original jurisdiction in bankruptcy proceedings ... to ... (7) cause the estates of bankrupts to be collected, reduced to money and distributed, and determine controversies in relation thereto, except as herein otherwise provided.' And section 38 of the act (11 USCA  66) extends to referees 'jurisdiction to ... (4) perform such part of the duties, except as to questions arising out of the applications of bankrupts for compositions or discharges, as are by this title conferred on courts of bankruptcy ... of their respective districts, except as herein otherwise provided.'\n Counsel for petitioner assert: Bankruptcy proceedings constitute a branch of equity jurisdiction; a court sitting in bankruptcy is a court of equity. Fidelity Trust Company v. Gaskell (8th C. C. A.) 195 F. 865, 871. Remington on Bankruptcy, Vol. 1, p. 48,  23.\n And then they say: 'Obviously, except as the privilege of modification is granted to facilitate speedy hearings, the rules of equity practice are applicable, without limitation or reservation, to all equitable proceedings in \n\n[285 U.S. 154, 164]\n\u00a0\n courts of bankruptcy,' including of course summary proceedings before referees.\n Without regard to other objections to the reasoning offered to support petitioner's view, it is obviously unsound unless the words 'proceedings in equity,' in General Order xxxvii apply to summary proceedings before a referee like those here in question. And we think no such intendment can be attributed to them.\n This order contains general provisions designed to bring about prompt settlement of bankrupt estates. To that end it directs that, in proceedings in equity and at law instituted for the purpose of carrying the Bankruptcy Act into effect and enforcing rights and remedies given thereby, the rules which govern practice in equity and law courts shall be observed, but that the judge may modify them 'so as to facilitate a speedy hearing.'\n Many of the equity rules are inapplicable to summary proceedings before referees. Such proceedings are not in equity as that term is commonly understood. General Order iv (11 USCA  53)-conduct of proceedings-uses the words 'Proceedings in bankruptcy' when referring to the practice to be followed by bankruptcy courts; other orders use the word 'proceedings.'\n The distinction between summary proceedings and plenary suits in adverted to in Weidhorn v. Levy, \n253 \nU.S. 268, 271\n, 273 S., 40 S. Ct. 534. There it is also suggested that 'proceedings in equity' and 'proceedings at law,' as used in General Order xxxvii, refer to something other than 'proceedings in bankruptcy.'\n Our conclusion accords with what has been held by other federal courts.

A.) 277 F. 948; In re Kenney & Greenwood (D. C.) 23 F.(2d) 681.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","52":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDENVER & R. G. W. R. CO. v. TERTE(1932)\nNo. 130\nArgued: November 24, 1931Decided: January 4, 1932\n\n\n\n\n[284 U.S. 284, 285]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Thomas Hackney, of Kansas City, Mo., for petitioners.\n Mr. Clay C. Rogers, of Kansas City, Mo., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Missouri brings up for review a judgment which denied a petition for prohibition without an accompanying opinion.\n Following the local practice, the Denver & Rio Grande Western Railroad Company (Rio Grande) and the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Company (Santa Fe ) presented their petition directly to the Supreme Court. After setting out the proceedings in an action against them pending in the Jackson county circuit court, it alleged that if the cause proceeded to trial an undue burden on interstate commerce would result; also the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution (art. 1,  8, cl. 3) and the Fourteenth Amendment would be violated. It asked that the presiding judge be restrained from entertaining further jurisdiction.\n On August 26, 1930, Curtis, then residing in Missouri, brought the above-mentioned action against both the Santa Fe and the Rio Grande under the Federal Em- \n\n[284 U.S. 284, 286]\n\u00a0\n ployers' Liability Act (45 USCA  51-59). He sought damages for personal injuries said to have resulted from their joint negligence on December 26, 1929, while he was employed by them at an interlocking track and signal plant near Pueblo, Colorado.\n A writ of attachment against the Rio Grande was served by garnishee process upon several railroad companies said to be indebted to it. Summonses for both defendants were served upon their agents.\n Defendants, appearing specially, moved to quash the attachment and summonses and presented affidavits to support their motions. The plaintiff filed counter affidavits. It appeared that properly to defend the cause would require attendance of witnesses from Colorado at large expense; also the attendance of some witnesses for the plaintiff who resided in Missouri. The trial court overruled the motions. Thereupon, the defendants petitioned the Supreme Court as above stated.\n The Rio Grande, a Delaware corporation, operates lines which lie wholly within Colorado, Utah, and New Mexico. It neither owns nor operates any line in Missouri; but it does own and use some property located there. It maintains one or more offices in the state and employs agents who solicit traffic. These agents engage in transactions incident to the procurement, delivery, and record of such traffic. It is not licensed to do business in Missouri.\n The Santa Fe , a Kansas corporation, owns and operates railroad lines in Missouri, Kansas, Colorado, and other states. It is licensed to do business in Missouri and has an office and agents in Jackson county. These agents transact the business ordinarily connected with the operation of a carrier by railroad.\n After being injured at Pueblo, and before instituting his action against the railroad companies, Curtis removed to and became a bona fide resident and citizen of Missouri. \n\n[284 U.S. 284, 287]\n\u00a0\n According to the doctrine approved in Hoffman v. State of Missouri ex rel. Foraker, \n274 \nU.S. 21\n, 47 S. Ct. 485, we think the Santa Fe was properly sued in Jackson county. The Supreme Court committed no error of which we can take notice by refusing to prohibit further prosecution of the action against that company. The mere fact that the Santa Fe was named a codefendant with the Rio Grande was not enough to defeat jurisdiction of the court over the former.\n Under the rule approved in Michigan Central R. Co. v. Mix, \n278 \nU.S. 492\n, 49 S. Ct. 207, the Rio Grande properly claimed exemption from suit in Jackson county. It was not necessary to join the two railroad companies in one action. Whatever liability exists is several. The prohibition against burdening interstate commerce cannot be avoided by the simple device of a joint action. Nor can this be evaded merely by attaching the property of the nonresident railroad corporation. Obviously, the burden and expense which the carrier must incur in order to make defense in a state where the accident did not occur has no relation to the nature of the process used to bring it before the court.\n The alleged residence in Missouri of persons whose testimony plaintiff supposed would be necessary to prove his claim was not enough to justify retention of jurisdiction by the circuit court. While this circumstance might enable plaintiff to try his cause there with less inconvenience than elsewhere it would not prevent imposition of a serious burden upon interstate commerce. And, we have held, it is the infliction of this burden that deprives the courts of jurisdiction over cases like this. Davis v. Farmers' Co-operative Equity Co., \n262 \nU.S. 312\n, 43 S. Ct. 556. Further, as a practical matter, courts could not undertake to ascertain in advance of trial the number and importance of probable witnesses within and without the state and retain \n\n[284 U.S. 284, 288]\n\u00a0\n or refuse jurisdiction according to the relative inconvenience of the parties.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court must be reversed. The cause will be remanded there for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","53":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDETROIT INTERNATIONAL BRIDGE CO. v. CORPORATION TAX APPEAL BOARD(1932)\nNo. 51\nArgued: November 11, 1932Decided: December 5, 1932\n\n\n\n Appeal from the Supreme Court of the State of Michigan. \n\n[287 U.S. 295, 296]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Victor W. Klein, of Detroit, Mich., Alfred A. Cook, of New York City, and Thomas G. Long, of Detroit, Mich., for appellant.\n Alice E. Alexander and Mr. Paul W. Voorhies, both of Lansing, Mich., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellant is a Michigan corporation engaged in operating the international bridge spanning the river between Detroit and Sandwich, Ontario. Acting under Act No. 85 of 1921, as amended by Act No. 175 of 1929, the secretary of state calculated, and appellee confirmed his determinations, that appellant was liable for a license fee tax of $3,000 for 1929 and $2,935.95 for 1930. Appellant obtained a review in the state Supreme Court, and there maintained, as it still insists, that by its articles of association its powers are limited to constructing, owning, maintaining, and operating the bridge for the use of traffic and to taking tolls therefor, that in 1930 it was engaged exclusively in foreign commerce, and that the statute, construed to impose a fee for the privilege of doing that business, violates the commerce clause. The bridge was under construction during a part of 1929, and no question is here presented as to the fee for that year. The court overruled appellant's contention, and, except as to an item not now material, entered judgment affirming the determination of the fees. 257 Mich. 52, 240 N.W. 68.\n The sole question is whether as construed the state law violates the commerce clause (Const. U.S. art. 1,  8, cl. 3).\n The statute, section 4, as amended, declares that every corporation, excepting certain companies that need not be named, organized under the laws of the state 'shall ... for the privilege of exercising its franchise and of transacting its \n\n[287 U.S. 295, 297]\n\u00a0\n business within this state, pay to the secretary of state an annual fee of two and one-half mills upon each dollar of its paid-up capital and surplus, but such privilege fee shall in no case be less than ten dollars nor more than fifty thousand dollars. It is the intent of this section to impose the tax herein provided for upon every corporation, foreign or domestic, having the privilege of exercising corporate franchises within this state, irrespective of whether any such corporation chooses to actually exercise such privilege during any taxable period.'\n In Re Detroit Properties Corp. (1931) 254 Mich. 523, at page 525, 236 N.W. 850, 851, the state Supreme Court held: 'The privilege fee is an excise tax, not upon the right to be a corporation, but upon the activities of the corporation in the exercise of its corporate franchise, or, as it is sometimes expressed, upon the franchise 'to do,' not upon the franchise 'to be.' ... Actual transaction of business by a domestic corporation is not a condition of the tax. It is imposed on the right to transact.' And this court follows that construction. Michigan v. Michigan Trust Co., \n286 \nU.S. 334, 342\n, 52 S.Ct. 512\n\n\n Appellee insists that to own and operate the bridge and take tolls for its use does not involve intercourse between Michigan and Ontario, and that therefore appellant is not engaged in foreign commerce, and further maintains that appellant has power to engage in business other than the operation of the bridge. We do not consider whether appellant is engaged in foreign commerce, for we are of opinion that it has failed to establish that it has no power to carry on any business that is not within the protection of the commerce clause. Aetna Insurance Co. v. Hyde, \n275 \nU.S. 440, 448\n, 48 S.Ct. 174.\n Appellant has the burden to establish the facts on which it asserts the invalidity of the statute. Weaver v. Palmer Bros. Co., \n270 \nU.S. 402, 410\n, 46 S.Ct. 320. The record contains only \n\n[287 U.S. 295, 298]\n\u00a0\n a part of the third article of its articles of association: 'The purpose or purposes of this corporation are as follows: To construct, own and\/or operate a highway bridge across the Detroit River from Detroit, Michigan, to Sandwich Province of Ontario, Canada, and the approaches thereto; To maintain and operate such bridge and the approaches thereto for the use of vehicular and pedestrian traffic, and to charge and collect tolls for such use.'\n Appellant asserts that its powers are solely limited to these purposes. But appellee in its brief brings forward the entire article, containing in its final paragraph a specification of power that is not limited, incident, or appurtenant to the authority to construct, maintain, and operate the bridge: 'This corporation may maintain offices or agencies, conduct its business or any part thereof, purchase, lease or otherwise acquire, hold, mortgage, convey and assign real or personal property, and do all or any of the acts herein set forth, outside of the State of Michigan as well as within said State.' It is clear that, in addition to general power to own and operate the bridge and to do all that is related to that enterprise, appellant is by the last-quoted provision empowered, as contended by appellee, to carry on the business of buying and selling real and personal property within the state of Michigan and elsewhere.\n Indeed, appellant did not at first claim that its powers and activities are limited to foreign commerce. On the contrary, it sent to the secretary of state with its annual report of 1929 the prescribed minimum fee of $10, and with that of 1930 the sum of $145.92. It did not then construe the act as not applicable to any business within the scope of its authorization under its articles and the laws of the state, but merely that it was not liable for as much as the state taxing authorities laid against it.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","54":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDUNN v. UNITED STATES(1932)\nNo. 393\nArgued: November 24, 1931Decided: January 11, 1932\n\n\n\n\n[284 U.S. 390, 391]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Roger O'Donnell, of Washington, D. C., and Raymond T. Coughlin, of Sacramento, Cal., for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Thomas D. Thacher, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner was indicted in three counts, first, for maintaining a common nuisance by keeping for sale at a specified place intoxicating liquor, second, for unlawful possession of intoxicating liquor and third, for the unlawful sale of such liquor. The jury acquitted him on the \n\n[284 U.S. 390, 392]\n\u00a0\n second and third counts, and found him guilty on the first. No question was raised in the courts below with respect to the sufficiency of the indictment on the first count, and no such question has been presented here. The case was tried upon the assumption that the indictment was good as to that count, and in the opinion of the majority, we should make the same assumption.\n The defendant says that the evidence did not warrant a conviction and that the verdict on the second and third counts is inconsistent with that upon the first and that for this reason also he is entitled to be discharged. The evidence was the same for all the counts. The defendant owned the establishment where the alleged sale took place. It consisted of a front room where fishing tackle, sporting goods, cigars and soft drinks were sold, and a larger room in the rear with pool tables and a bar. Two prohibition agents and two unknown men walked in and ordered from the defendant three glasses of whisky and one of beer and were served without further conversation. A little later two more drinks were called for and furnished. The whisky was served in ordinary whisky glasses from underneath the bar and the money paid for it, twenty-five cents a glass, was put into a cash register behind the bar. The testimony, if believed, showed a regular course of business, which manifestly was continuous, Fisher v. United States (C. C. A.) 32 F.(2d) 602, 604, and warranted a verdict of guilty on the nuisance count. The defendant gave evidence that he was elsewhere at the time of the alleged sale and did not make it. He contends that the verdict is inconsistent, since it negatives possession and affirms the nuisance, the proof of the commission of both alleged offienses consisting of identical evidence. The Government says that even though the jury seems to have believed that the defendant was elsewhere at the time of the alleged sale and did not make it, the verdict \n\n[284 U.S. 390, 393]\n\u00a0\n is not necessarily inconsistent, for some third person, with defendant's knowledge, may have been doing business on the premises, and if so they were a nuisance, and the defendant was guilty although he neither possessed nor sold intoxicating liquors upon them; that whereas the Government's witnesses may have been mistaken in saying that the defendant sold, they may have been right to the extent that someone did, and if that be true the defendant's knowledge could be inferred, this being his place of business and he being habitually present there. It is further argued that it may be inferred that he received the money coming from the sale, and that he knowingly abetted the seller in the acts that created the nuisance on the premises that the defendant controlled.\n Consistency in the verdict is not necessary. Each count in an indictment is regarded as if it was a separate indictment. Latham v. The Queen, 5 Best & Smith, 635, 642, 643; Selvester v. United States, \n170 \nU.S. 262\n, 18 S. Ct. 580. If separate indictments had been presented against the defendant for possession and for maintenance of a nuisance, and had been separately tried, the same evidence being offered in support of each, an acquittal on one could not be pleaded as res judicata of the other. Where the offenses are separately charged in the counts of a single indictment the same rule must hold. As was said in Steckler v. United States (C. C. A.) 7 F.(2d) 59, 60:\n'The most that can be said in such cases is that the verdict shows that either in the acquittal or the conviction the jury did not speak their real conclusions, but that does not show that they were not convinced of the defendant's guilt. We interpret the acquittal as no more than their assumption of a power which they had no right to exercise, but to which they were disposed through lenity.'\n\n Compare Horning v. District of Columbia, \n254 \nU.S. 135\n, 41 S. Ct. 53. \n\n[284 U.S. 390, 394]\n\u00a0\n That the verdict may have been the result of compromise, or of a mistake on the part of the jury, is possible. But verdicts cannot be upset by speculation or inquiry into such matters.\n Judgment affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER (dissenting).\n The indictment contains three counts, and accuses petitioner of violations of the liquor laws. The first is under section 33 and the other two are under section 12 of title 27, U. S. Code (27 USCA  12, 33), being, respectively, sections 21 and 3 of title 2 of the National Prohibition Act, 41 Stat. 308, 314. The pertinent words are:\n's 33. Any ... building ... or place where intoxicating liquor is manufactured, sold, kept, or bartered in violation of this chapter ( title), and all intoxicating liquor and property kept and used in maintaining the same, is hereby declared to be a common nuisance, and any person who maintains such a common nuisance shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. ...'\n\n's 12. No person shall ... sell ... or possess any intoxicating liquor except as authorized in this chapter (title). ...'\n\n The first count cites section 33 and charges that petitioner on the 4th of July, 1930 (the evidence shows that June 26 was meant), 'at a place known as No. 301-2d Street, in the City of Eureka ... did ... maintain a common nuisance, in then and there knowingly and willfully committing a prohibited and unlawful act of keeping for sale at said place certain intoxicating liquor ... to wit: five drinks of whisky and one drink of beer. ...' The second cites section 12, and charges that he then and there committed a prohibited and unlawful act of 'possession of the said certain intoxicating liquor.' The third cites section 12, and charges that on June 26, 1930, he did then and \n\n[284 U.S. 390, 395]\n\u00a0\n there knowingly and willfully commit a prohibited and unlawful act of 'sale of certain intoxicating liquor ... to wit: five drinks of whisky and one drink of beer.'\n The nuisance charged is specifically limited to the 'keeping for sale' of the six drinks mentioned. The unlawful possession count is limited to the same drinks. The unlawful sale alleged is limited to six drinks. The evidence showed that the same liquor constituted the sole basis of each count.\n At the trial it was shown that petitioner owned and carried on business in the place described; that there was a front room where sporting goods, cigars, and soft drinks were sold and a back room in which defendant had a bar, pool and card tables, and all kinds of soft drinks. The bar was used to wait on customers in that room. There were some one- ounce whisky glasses which petitioner testified were used to serve bitters.\n Two federal prohibited agents testified that about 7:30 o'clock in the afternoon of June 26, 1930, they and two unknown men, whom they referred to as 'pick-ups,' entered the rear room and found petitioner behind the bar; that one of the agents bought from petitioner 'three whiskys and one beer,' and paid him a dollar, which he rang up on the cash register; that the other agent bought from him two more drinks of whisky; and that all such liquor was consumed on the premises by the agents and their companions. No other sale was shown. No arrest, search, or seizure was then made or attempted. Marron v. United States, \n275 \nU.S. 192\n, 48 S. Ct. 74. Eight days later federal officers having a warrant for arrest, accompanied by one of the prohibition agents, raided the place and arrested petitioner. There was no evidence that any liquor was found. Petitioner testified and introduced other evidence to show that he was absent from Eureka and not in the place until some time between 8 and 8:30 o'clock that evening. \n\n[284 U.S. 390, 396]\n\u00a0\n The trial court charged:\n'The element of nuisance is the keeping of intoxicating liquor for sale. If you find from the evidence that the defendant had in his possession any liquor ... for the purpose of such sale, then you must find the defendant guilty. ...\n\n'If you find from the evidence that the defendant unlawfully possessed intoxicating liquor, of course it will be your duty to find him guilty of that charge. ...\n\n'Of course, if ... you believe that he is guilty ... of having sold liquor at his said place of business it will be your duty to find him guilty of that charge. ...\n\n'When an indictment charges a defendant with crime, it is not necessary for the Government to prove that the act was committed by the defendant personally, but it is sufficient for the Government to prove that the act was committed by an agent of the defendant and committed in the course of the agency and in furtherance of it. ...\n\n'I instruct you ... that it is the law that 'Whoever directly commits any act constituting an offense defined in any law of the United States or aids or abets or procures its commission is a principal' (Apparently referring to 18 U. S. C.,  550, 18 USCA  550 ). ...\n\n'The defendant has introduced evidence tending to show that he was not present at the time and place of the commission of the crime charged in this indictment. ... If the evidence of an alibi in connection with all the other evidence raises a reasonable doubt of the presence of the defendant at the time and place of the crime he should acquitted.'\n\n The jury acquitted petitioner on the possession and sales counts, and convicted him on the nuisance count.\n The court by the first quoted instruction, in harmony with the pleadings, authorized the conviction of petitioner upon the finding of the possession for sale of the \n\n[284 U.S. 390, 397]\n\u00a0\n six drinks without more. The familiar rules that the principal may be held for acts of his agent, and that one who aids or procures the commission of crime is a principal applied equally to all the accusations and were not limited to the first count. The charge that, if petitioner were absent, he must be acquitted, also applied on all counts. There is no ground to hold that the jury, notwithstanding petitioner's absence from the place when the prohibition agents were there, found him guilty of nuisance, and that because of that absence it found him not guilty of the very act alleged to constitute the nuisance. The jury must have rejected his alibi. And, if petitioner through another kept for sale the liquor as charged in the first count, he necessarily acted through the same agent as to the identical possession alleged in the second.\n The definition of nuisance in section 33 manifestly requires continuity of maintenance; that is, a practice or course of business. Inherently it is a continuous offense having duration. Cf. Ex parte Snow, \n120 \nU.S. 274, 281\n, 7 S. Ct. 556; Blockburger v. United States, 284 U. S. -, 52 S. Ct. 180, 76 L. Ed. -. This is confirmed by section 34, 27 USCA, which authorizes temporary and permanent injunctions for the abatement of such nuisances. But to hold that unlawful possession or a single sale without more constitutes a nuisance as defined 'would be to render meaningless the other provisions of the law in which the Congress has denounced these specific acts, and provided punishment for their violation.' Barker v. United States (C. C. A. 289 F. 249, 250. A single sale, if attended by circumstances warranting the inference that the defendant is engaged in a practice of which the sale is but an instance, may be sufficient to establish the offense. But mere possession for sale in a building of a half-dozen drinks does not measure up to the standard. Lewinsohn v. United States (C. C. A.) 278 F. 421, 425; Reynolds v. United States (C. C. A.) 282 F. 256, 258; Singer v. United States (C. C. A.) 288 F. 694, 696; \n\n[284 U.S. 390, 398]\n\u00a0\n Miller v. United States (C. C. A.) 300 F. 529, 537; United States v. Ward ( C. C. A.) 6 F.(2d) 182; Schechter v. United States (C. C. A.) 7 F.(2) 881; Fisher v. United States (C. C. A.) 32 F.(2d) 602, 604.\n The facts alleged in the first count are not sufficient to constitute nuisance. They amount only to a charge of unlawful possession. The count contains nothing as to the character of the place. No practice or course of business maintained or intended is alleged. The facts set forth are not distinguishable from those alleged as constituting the unlawful possession charged in the second count. It is of no legal significance that the pleader cited section 33 in the first count, and section 12 in the others and referred to the offense as 'nuisance' and failed to characterize or name those charged in the others. Williams v. United States, \n168 \nU.S. 382, 389\n, 18 S. Ct. 92; Hammer v. United States, \n271 \nU.S. 620, 625\n, 46 S. Ct. 603; People v. Aro, 6 Cal. 207, 65 Am. Dec. 503; State v. Murray, 41 Iowa, 580.\n By finding petitioner not guilty under the second and third counts, the jury conclusively established that the evidence was not sufficient to prove the unlawful possession or sale there alleged. Since the first count charged nothing more than unlawful possession, this amounted to contradictory findings on the same fact. But, even if that count charged a nuisance, the unlawful keeping of that liquor for sale was essential to the offense, in fact the corpus delicti, and the verdict of guilty necessarily included a finding of the very possession that was conclusively negatived by the verdict under the second count. If the finding of guilt on the first count were not contradicted by another finding contained in the same verdict, or if it stood alone, a judgment would properly be entered thereon convicting petitioner of the unlawful possession. 18 U. S. C.  565 (18 USCA  565). Samlin v. United States (C. C. A.) 278 F. 170; Sparf & Hansen v. United States, \n156 \nU.S. 51, 62\n, 715 S., 15 S. Ct. 273; Wallace v. United States, \n162 \nU.S. 466, 476\n, 16 S. Ct. 859. \n\n[284 U.S. 390, 399]\n\u00a0\n This is not a failure of the jury to pass on all the counts submitted to them as in Selvester v. United States, \n170 \nU.S. 262\n, 18 S. Ct. 580, and Latham v. The Queen, 5 B. & S. 635, cited in the opinion here. In this case the jury responded to all the issues, but the findings cannot be recondciled. Possession was alleged in the second count and negatived by the jury. Nothing remains to support the opposite finding under the first count. The repugnancy is such that, if the first is accepted, the second must be rejected. I am of opinion that this record plainly requires an express and unqualified decision that these findings conflict and are completely repugnant.\n What is the legal effect of such conflict in the verdict?\n Where the jury's action reflects mere inconsistency in the consideration of the evidence which results in apparently illogical or unreasonable conclusions, courts will disregard differences and give effect to the verdict. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n In civil cases, where there is conflict between a special and general verdict, the former will prevail. Lemke v. Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway Co., 39 Wis. 449. If here the first count stated facts which, taken with the specified possession of six drinks, would be sufficient to constitute nui- \n\n[284 U.S. 390, 400]\n\u00a0\n sance, the finding of not guilty on the possession count would be in principle and effect a special finding negativing that element of the offense charged. Cf. People v. Piper, 50 Mich. 390, 15 N. W. 523. In a civil case, if the inconsistency is between findings in a special verdict in respect of a controlling fact, no judgment can be entered. As said by Chief Justice Ryan: 'The verdict on a material point finds for each party, and against each party; being, in effect, equivalent to disagreement of the jury. The answer assumes to cut a single and indivisible truth in two . ... Not judgment can rest on such a verdict, and no court should receive it.' Carroll v. Bohan, 43 Wis. 218, 220; Haas v. Chicago & Northwestern Railway Co., 41 Wis. 44, 51; Davis v. Town of Farmington, 42 Wis. 425, 431; German Insurance Co. v. Smelker, 38 Kan. 285, 16 P. 735. Under the common law a jury may give a special verdict in a criminal case. 2 Hawkins P. C. (8th Ed.) c. 47,  3; 4 Blackstone, pp. 360, 361; Commonwealth v. Call, 21 Pick. (Mass.) 509, 514, 32 Am. Dec. 284; Commonwealth v. Eichelberger, 119 Pa. 254, 263, 13 A. 422, 4 Am. St. Rep. 642; State v. Bray, 89 N. C. 480; People v. Piper, supra. No judgment may be entered upon an uncertain special verdict. People v. Olcott, 2 Johns. Cas. (N. Y.) 301, 311, 1 Am. Dec. 168.\n In criminal cases no form of verdict will be good which creates a repugnancy or absurdity in the conviction. 2 Bishop, New Criminal Procedure (2d Ed.)  1015a(5).\n Where one by different counts is accused of two crimes which by reason of their nature cannot be committed by the same person, a verdict of guilty on both counts will be held so inconsistent with itself and so uncertain in law that no judgment can be entered thereon. Such verdicts are so meaningless as to be without force. Regina v. Evans, 7 Cox C. C. 151, 157; Rosenthal v. United States (C. C. A.) 276 F. 714; Commonwealth v. Haskins, 128 Mass. 60; Tobin v. People, 104 Ill. 565. And see Commonwealth v. Lowrey, 158 Mass. 18, 20, 32 N. E. 940. \n\n[284 U.S. 390, 401]\n\u00a0\n In Regina v. Evans, supra, one count accused the prisoner of stealing sheep. Another count charged him with having received them on the same day. There was a verdict amounting to a finding of guilty on each count. The court of queen's bench held it inconsistent. The Chief Justice announcing the judgment said (page 157 of 7 Cox C. C.): 'This record must therefore be dealt with as if there had been a special verdict, on which the court should find matter which would not justify either an acquittal or conviction. The practice in such a case has been to award a venire de novo. The cases in Lord Raymond's reports, and the later cases, sanction such a course, and we cannot see any good grounds for distinguishing an uncertain general verdict, such as this, from an uncertain special verdict.'\n In Rosenthal v. United States, supra, three were indicted under the Act of February 13, 1913, 37 Stat. 670. One count accused them of having bought and received property that had been stolen from a car, then being a shipment in interstate commerce, knowing it to have been so stolen. The second count charged that at the same time and place they had that property in their possession under like circumstances and with like knowledge.\n On the first count the jury found all not guilty. On the other count all were acquitted but one, and he was found guilty. The evidence showed that the property had been stolen and disclosed only one transaction between the thieves and the defendant who was found guilty. The court said ( page 715 of 276 F.): 'By its verdict upon the first count of the indictment the jury found that the plaintiff in error neither bought nor received the cigarettes from them (the thieves) with knowledge of the theft, and by its verdict upon the second count that the plaintiff in error was at the same time and place in possession of the property with such guilty knowledge. The two findings were thus wholly inconsistent and conflicting. For this reason we feel obliged to reverse the judgment and remand the case for a new trial.' \n\n[284 U.S. 390, 402]\n\u00a0\n Upon the indictment of several for an offense that could not be committed without the participation of two or more of them a verdict of guilty against one and of not guilty for the others, is deemed wholly repugnant and invalid, 1 Chitty, Criminal Law (5th Am. Ed.) p. 640. On indictment of riot against three, a verdict finding less than number guilty is void, for more than two must riot. Harison v. Errington, Popham ( 2d Ed.) 202; Rex v. Heaps, 2 Salk. 593; The King v. Sudbury, 12 Mod. 262; Rex v. Scott, 3 Burr. 1262, 1264. And on a charge of conspiracy against two, a verdict convicting only one is void. United States v. Hamilton, 26 Fed. Cas. pages 90, 91, No. 15,288; Feder v. United States (C. C. A.) 257 F. 694, 696, 5 A. L. R. 370; People v. Olcott, supra, 2 Johns. Cas. (N. Y.) 310, 311; Queen v. Manning, 12 Q. B. D. 241, 245; Queen v. Thompson, 16 A . & E. 832, 844 et seq. And on the trial together of persons accused as principal and accessory, acquittal of the former renders a verdict against the latter bad because entirely inconsistent with the innocence of the person charged as the principal offender. 2 Coke's Inst. 184; Foster, p. 360; 1 Hale P. C. (1st. Am. Ed.) p. 625; 2 Hawkins P. C., c. 29,  47; United States v. Crane, 4 McLean, 317, 319, Fed. Cas. No. 14,888; Commonwealth monwealth v. Andrews. 3 Mass. 126, 131.\n One accused in different counts of an indictment of the same crime, there being no difference in the means alleged to have been employed, may not be adjudged guilty on a verdict of conviction on one count and of acquittal on the other. Speiller v. United States (C. C. A.) 31 F.(2d) 682, 684; State v. Akers, 278 Mo. 368, 370, 213 S. W. 424; State v. Headrick, 179 Mo. 300, 307, 78 S. W. 630. Cf. Commonwealth v. Edds, 14 Gray (Mass.) 406, 410; United States v. Malone (C. C.) 9 F. 897, 900.\n Where there is a verdict of not guilty on one count and a verdict of guilt on another, and the former necessarily determines that the evidence failed to establish a fact \n\n[284 U.S. 390, 403]\n\u00a0\n which is an essential ingredient of the offense charged in the other count, then, in determining whether the evidence was sufficient to sustain the finding of guilt, the court must exclude from consideration the fact so found in favor of the accused. And so in every such case the question of law for the court always is whether, outside the fact eliminated by the verdict of not guilty, the evidence was sufficient to warrant the conviction. Hohenadel Brewing Co. v. United States (C. C. A.) 295 F. 489; Peru v. United States (C. C. A.) 4 F.(2d) 881; Murphy v. United States (C. C. A.) 18 F.(2d) 509; Boyle v. United States (C. C. A.) 22 F.(2d) 547; Kuck v. State, 149 Ga. 191, 193, 99 S. E. 622. And see Baldini v. United States (C. C. A.) 286 F. 133.\n Under an indictment by one count accusing eight persons of conspiracy to maintain a nuisance and alleging as an overt act the maintenance of that nuisance and by another charging that they did knowingly maintain such nuisance, a verdict acquitting them of the conspiracy (i. e., the agreement to maintain) and convicting them of having knowingly maintained the identical nuisance specified in the conspiracy charge will not support a judgment of guilt. This for the reason that, by the verdict that all knowingly maintained the nuisance, the jury necessarily found that there was an agreement amount them to maintain the nuisance. The court said: 'It is unthinkable that eight men should for a period of time have knowingly maintained and operated the place where intoxicating liquor was sold and kept for sale, without some kind of an agreement among themselves.' Boyle v. United States, supra, 548 of 22 F. (2d).\n A brewing company indicted for violation of the National Prohibition Act was accused by the first count of unlawful manufacture at divers times between dates more than a year apart. By the five counts following it was accused of unlawful sales at different times; and by the sev- \n\n[284 U.S. 390, 404]\n\u00a0\n enth count it was accused of nuisance during that period, in that it maintained a place where liquor was manufactured, kept, and bartered. The jury found defendant not guilty under the first six counts, and guilty of nuisance under the seventh. The court held the facts alleged in the counts on which defendant was acquitted were to be deemed as nonexistent and excluded from consideration in determining whether there was evidence to sustain the nuisance charged. Finding no evidence outside the facts so negatived, the court held conviction could not be sustained. Hohenadel Brewing Co. v. United States, supra.\n The government cites Carrignan v. United States (C. C. A.) 290 F. 189; Marshallo v. United States (C. C. A.) 298 F. 74; Steckler v. United States ( C. C. A.) 7 F.(2d) 59; and Gozner v. United States (C. C. A.) 9 F.(2d) 603. And see Seiden v. United States (C. C. A.) 16 F.(2d) 197.\n In the Carrignan Case defendant was accused in two counts of violation of liquor laws; the first count charged unlawful sale and the second maintenance of a nuisance. The opinion does not disclose details alleged. The jury acquitted on the sale charge and convicted of nuisance. The court distinguished the Rosenthal Case, supra, and said (page 190 of 290 F.): 'In the present case, plaintiff in error could have been convicted and sentenced upon both counts of the indictment. He could have been found guilty of either offense without having been guilty of the other.' And it supported that statement by reference to the evidence. It is to be inferred from the opinion that the allegations in the nuisance count were not, as they are here, limited to the liquor bought by the government agent. No repugnancy as a matter of law was found or dealt with in the opinion, and there is nothing in recognition or support of the principle here contended for by the government.\n In the Marshallo Case the indictment was in two counts for violation of liquor laws; the first was for nuisance and \n\n[284 U.S. 390, 405]\n\u00a0\n the second for unlawful possession. The opinion does not show details alleged. Marshallo was shown to be owner and proprietor of the place. Government employees testified: The place was a soft drink parior having a lunch bar and back room, two witnesses went into the back room and ordered three drinks. Marshallo was behind the bar, bottles of liquor were passed from the cellar through a hole in the floor, three drinks were handed to the waiter, payment was made and rung up on a cash register. Immediate examination of the cellar disclosed a large quantity of liquor kept there. The jury found Marshallo guilty of nuisance, not guilty of possession. He insisted that the verdict of guilt of nuisance could not stand because inconsistent with the acquittal of possession. The court held there was ample evidence of nuisance, and sustained the verdict citing the Carrignan Case. The opinion does not suggest that, outside the possession so specifically found not proved, there was not ample evidence to establish defendant guilty of nuisance. The opinion shows no such conflict or repugnancy that if one finding were true the other necessarily must be false.\n In the Steckler Case-which the opinion of this court cites-a druggist with a permit to possess liquor for sale under prescribed regulations was indicted for violation of liquor laws in four counts; the first charged nuisance, the maintenance of a place where liquor was kept for sale in violation of the act; the second unlawful possession; the third an unlawful sale on April 8; the fourth another unlawful sale on that day. The jury found him guilty of unlawful possession, and acquitted him on the other counts. The court held Marshallo v. United States, controlling and- it need not be considered whether justifiably-dealt with the case as if there were an irreconcilable conflict. It said (page 60 of 7 F.(2d): 'No doubt it has generally been assumed that, if the verdict was rationally inconsistent, the conviction ought not to stand, and probably that was \n\n[284 U.S. 390, 406]\n\u00a0\n the common law, though it is hard to find a case squarely so holding.' It concluded that the acquittal on the nuisance and sales counts was an 'assumption of a power which they (the jury) had no right to exercise, but to which they were disposed through lenity,' and so sustained the conviction.\n In the Gozner Case, the indictment charged violation of the liquor laws; the first count charged unlawful possession; the second unlawful possession of property for use in the manufacture of intoxicating liquor; the third manufacture; and the fourth the maintenance of a nuisance. Gozner was acquitted on the first three and convicted of nuisance. The court held the findings of not guilty on the three counts did not have the force of res adjudicata precluding conviction on the other count. But it was not held or suggested that, excluding the facts necessarily found not proved under the first three counts, there was not evidence to warrant conviction of defendant for the maintenance of the nuisance. The reasoning of the court does not apply in this case. One of the judges in a dissenting opinion insisted that there was a legal inconsistency between the findings of not guilty in favor of Gozner on the three counts and his conviction on the fourth, and maintained that, outside the facts necessarily negatived by the acquittals, there was no evidence to convict of nuisance.\n I am of opinion that the authorities establish as well settled, (1) that when, upon an indictment charging the same offense in different counts, the jury acquits as to one and convicts on the other defendant is entitled to a new trial; and (2) that when different crimes are charged in separate counts and the jury acquits as to one and convicts on the other, the conviction will be sustained unless, excluding the facts which the jury in reaching its verdict of \n\n[284 U.S. 390, 407]\n\u00a0\n acquittal necessarily found not proved, it must be held as a matter of law that there is not sufficient evidence to warrant the verdict of guilty; and, where the evidence outside the facts so conclusively negatived by the acquittal on one count is not sufficient to sustain guilt on the other count, defendant is entitled to a new trial.\n The rule first stated is applicable here. Excluding the possession negatived by the finding under the second count, there is nothing of substance left in the first count, for its specifications were limited to the keeping for sale of the identical drinks alleged in the second count to have been unlawfully possessed. Moreover, even if it be thought that nuisance was sufficiently alleged in the first count, the unlawful possession of the six drinks was an essential ingredient of the offense alleged. The evidence having been found insufficient to establish such possession, it cannot be held adequate to warrant conviction under the first count. The finding of not guilty is a final determination that possession, the gravamen of both counts, was not proved.\n The law does not permit investigations into the deliberations of juries for ascertainment as a matter of fact upon what considerations verdicts are reached; the soundness of that rule has never been questioned. There are stronger reasons against speculating whether, or assuming that, the jury through tenderness of disposition, mercy, or forbearance acquitted while knowing that its duty was to convict the accused. Conflict between the findings may not be explained. The inference that the jury, seeking rightly to discharge its duty, made a mistake, is to be preferred over the suggestion that it found for defendant upon an assumption of power it may not lawfully exert.\n I am of opinion that the verdict does not support the judgment. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Dimmick v.

ELLERMAN'S WILSON LINE(1932)\nNo. 20\nArgued: October 19, 1932Decided: December 12, 1932\n\n\n\n\n[287 U.S. 420, 421]\n\u00a0\n Messrs, T. Catesby Jones and James W. Ryan, both of New York City, for petitioners.\n\n\n\n[287 U.S. 420, 423]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Cletus Keating, of New York City, for respondent. \n\n[287 U.S. 420, 424]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Earle and Stoddart, Incorporated, and other owners of cargo shipped on the steamship Galileo, sued her owner and operator, Ellerman's Wilson Line, Limited, in the federal court for southern New York, for breach of contract to deliver at destination. The defendant pleaded in bar the fire statute, which provides: 'No owner of any vessel shall be liable to answer for or make good to any person any loss or damage, which may happen to any merchandise whatsoever, which shall be shipped, taken in, or put on board any such vessel, by reason or by means of any fire happening to or on board the vessel, unless such fire is caused by the design or neglect of such owner.' Rev. Stat.  4282, Act of March 3, 1851, c. 43,  1, 9 Stat. 635 (46 USCA  182).\n The District Court made these findings: Shortly after the departure from New York, coal in a temporary bunker was found to be afire through spontaneous combustion. Following appropriate efforts to extinguish the fire, the vessel sank, and practically the entire cargo was lost. The immediate cause of the loss was the fire, to which no design or neglect of the owner contributed. The immediate cause of the fire was the condition of the coal at the time the voyage was commenced, which rendered the vessel unseaworthy. The sole cause of the unseaworthiness was the gross negligence of the ship's chief engineer in putting a new supply of coal on top of old coal then known to be heated. The Circuit Court of Appeals concurred in these findings and affirmed the decree which dismissed the libel. 54 F.(2d) 913. This court granted certiorari on the ground of conflict of decisions. \n286 \nU.S. 535\n, 52 S.Ct. 498\n\n\n The cargo owners concede that ordinarily the phrase in the fire statute, 'neglect of such owner,' means personal negligence of the owner, or, in case of a corporate \n\n[287 U.S. 420, 425]\n\u00a0\n owner, negligence of its managing officers or agents; and that the negligence of the master, chief engineer, or other ship's officers does not deprive the owner of the statutory immunity. Walker v. Transportation Co., 3 Wall. 150; Craig v. Continental Insurance Co., \n141 \nU.S. 638, 646\n, 12 S.Ct. 97. The contention is that the statute does not confer immunity where the fire resulted from unseaworthiness existing at the commencement of the voyage and discoverable by the exercise of ordinary care; or, at least, that the statute does not afford immunity where the owners warrant by their bills of lading, as it is asserted they have done here, that they will 'exercise due diligence to make the steamer seaworthy.'\n First. The fire statute, in terms, relieves the owners from liability 'unless such fire is caused by the design or neglect of such owner.' The statute makes no other exception from the complete immunity granted. The cargo owners do not make the broad contention that the statute affords no protection to the vessel owner if the fire was caused by unseaworthiness existing at the commencement of the voyage. \n1\n Their contention is that it \n\n[287 U.S. 420, 426]\n\u00a0\n does not relieve the owner if the unseaworthiness was discoverable by due diligence. The argument is that the duty of the owner to make the ship seaworthy before starting on her voyage is nondelegable, and if the unseaworthiness could have been discovered by due diligence there was necessarily neglect of the vessel owner.\n In support of this contention, the cargo owners place some reliance upon The Edwin I. Morrison, \n153 \nU.S. 199\n, 14 S.Ct. 823; The Caledonia, \n157 \nU.S. 124\n, 15 S.Ct. 537; and The Carib Prince, \n170 \nU.S. 655\n, 18 S.Ct. 753. Those cases enunciate the rule that in every contract of affreightment there is, unless otherwise expressly stipulated, an implied warranty of seaworthiness at the commencement of the voyage. The warranty is absolute that the ship is in fact seaworthy at that time, and the liability does not depend upon the knowledge or ignorance, the care or negligence, of the shipowner or charterer. Obviously, those cases lend no support to the contention that breach of the implied warranty of seaworthiness constitutes 'neglect' of the vessel owner under the fire statute. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The cargo owners rely chiefly upon International Navigation Co. v. Farr & Bailey Mfg. Co., \n181 \nU.S. 218\n, 21 S.Ct. 591, and The Wildcroft, \n201 \nU.S. 378\n, 26 S.Ct. 467. Those cases involved the construction of the Harter Act (46 USCA  190-195), and the language there employed is different. The Harter Act provides in section 3 (46 USCA  192) that the vessel owner shall not be liable if he 'shall exercise due diligence to make the said vessel in all respects seaworthy.' And under that act the require- \n\n[287 U.S. 420, 427]\n\u00a0\n ment of due diligence is not satisfied if there is negligence on the part of any of the ship's employees. International Navigation Co. v. Farr & Bailey Mfg. Co., supra. But the act does not purport to create any general duty on the part of shipowners. Its requirement of due diligence is imposed as a condition of securing immunity from liability for certain kinds of losses, like those due to errors in navigation or management. That the provisions of the Harter Act do not refer to liability for losses arising from fire is made clear by section 6 (27 Stat. 446) which declares that the act 'shall not be held to modify or repeal sections four thousand two hundred eighty-one, four thousand two hundred eighty-two, and four thousand two hundred eighty-three of the Revised Statutes'-section 4282 ( 46 USCA  182) being the fire statute. The courts have been careful not to thwart the purpose of the fire statute by interpreting as 'neglect' of the owners the breach of what in other connections is held to be a nondelegable duty. \n3\n Nothing \n\n[287 U.S. 420, 428]\n\u00a0\n contained in the opinion of this court in The Malcolm Baxter, Jr., \n277 \nU.S. 323\n, 48 S.Ct. 516, is to be taken as indicating a different view.\n Second. No provision in any bill of lading deprives the vessel owner of the protection given by the fire statute. There are 238 bills of lading on 18 different forms. In no bill of lading is there an express warranty of seaworthiness. In each, there is a provision expressly incorporating the fire statute. Many of the bills of lading contain also this provision: 'It is mutually agreed that ... the carrier shall not be liable, as carrier or otherwise, for any loss, damage, delay or default, whether occurring during transit or before, ... occasioned by fire or flood, from any cause or wheresoever occurring; ... by explosion, bursting of boilers, breakage of shafts, of any latent defect in hull, machinery, or appurtenances, or unseaworthiness of the steamer, whether existing at the time of shipment, or at the beginning of the voyage, provided the owners have exercised due diligence to make the steamer seaworthy. ...' So far as loss from fire is concerned, the quoted provision leaves the area of personal neglect unchanged, adding nothing to the obligations of the vessel owner. And in view of the express incorporation of the fire statute in the bill of lading, the provision is not to be construed as a waiver of the statutory immunity for loss by fire. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n[287 U.S. 420, 429]\n\u00a0\n Third. There was no personal contract of the vessel owner superseding the fire statute. The cargo owners invoke the rule announced in Pendleton v. Benner Line, \n246 \nU.S. 353\n, 38 S.Ct. 330, and Luckenbach v. McCahan Sugar Refining Co., \n248 \nU.S. 139\n, 39 S.Ct. 53, 1 A.L. R. 1522. Those cases have no application here. They declare that the statutes limiting the amount of liability of a shipowner to the amount or value of his interest in the vessel and her freight then pending (Act of March 3, 1851, c. 43,  3, Rev. Stat.  4283 (46 USCA  183) Act of June 26, 1884, c. 121,  18, 23 Stat. 53, 57 (46 USCA  189)) do not apply to personal contracts of the owner. \n5\n Here the inquiry is not whether there was a 'personal contract,' on which the shipowner can be held to the full amount of the loss, but whether he can be held liable at all. He cannot be held liable unless by agreement, or otherwise, he has waived the benefit of the fire statute. The only basis for the claim of waiver is the bill of lading. What has already been said concerning their provisions disposes of that inquiry.\n Moreover, the rule announced in the Pendleton and Luckenbach Cases has been applied by this court only to private charter parties executed by the owner. The bills of lading, which are said to contain 'personal contracts,' were not executed by the respondent or by any of its officers or managers. They were given, in large part, by agents of railroads or other steamship companies, and are to be regarded merely as ship's documents. Compare Capitol Transportation Co. v. Cambria Steel Co., \n249 \nU.S. 334, 336\n, 39 S.Ct. 292.\n The District Court was right in dismissing the libel, and the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is accordingly affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Such a contention with respect to the English act was rejected by the House of Lords. Louis Dreyfus & Co. v. Tempus Shipping Co., (1931) A.C. 726. See, also, Virginia Carolina Chemical Co. v. Norfolk & N.A. Steam Shipping Co., (1912) 1 K.B. 229; Ingram & Royle v. Services Maritimes du Tre port, (1914) 1 K.B. 541. Compare Royal Exchange Assurance v. Kingsley Navigation Co., (1923) A.C. 235, construing the Canadian act. The English act relieves the shipowner from liability for loss from fire where the loss occurred 'without his actual fault or privity.' Merchants Shipping Act, 1894, sec. 502; 57 & 58 Vict., c. 60. The original English fire statute of 1786, 26 Geo. III, c. 86, which was the model for the American statute of 1851, contained no exception for the owner's fault or privity; the American enactment was a deliberate departure in that respect. The bill as originally reported contained an exception onl for the 'design' of the owner, but this was amended to read 'design or neglect.' See 23 Cong. Globe, 31st Cong., 2d Sess., p. 715. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Compare, also, Christopher v. Grueby (C.C.A.) 40 F.(2d) 8, 12, 13, cited in behalf of the cargo owners, which deals with the liability of the shipowner to seamen for failure to provide a seaworthy vessel; and Bethlehem Corporation v. Gutradt Co. (C.C.A.) 10 F.(2d) 769, likewise cited, which deals with the responsibility of the ship owner, apart from statutory exemption, for loss arising from the default of a ship builder on a contract to repair. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] in all the cases where immunity from liability for damage by fire was held to be lost because of neglect of the owners, the courts have based their finding of neglect on the action of the owners or managing agents, or upon their failure to see that action was taken where it was their duty to act. The Elizabeth Dantzler (D.C.) 263 F. 596; Hines v. Butler (C.C.A.) 278 F. 877; Williams S.S. Co. v. Wilbur (C.C.A.) 9 F.(2d) 622; Arkell & Douglas v.

Charbonnier (C.C.A.) 45 F.(2d) 174; The Older (D.C.) 1 F.Supp. 119. In The Etna Maru (D.C.) 20 F.(2d) 143, the District Court was of opinion that the fire statute did not confer immunity where the loss was due to unseaworthiness existing at the beginning of the voyage. As an alternative ground of decision, however, the court held that the vessel owner had not overcome a presumption of personal neglect, arising from the fact of unseaworthiness. On appeal the case was affirmed (C.C.A.) 33 F.(2d) 232, but apparently on the ground that the fire statute, like the statutes limiting the extent of liability, leaves the owner liable, in any event, up to the value of the ship. But compare The Rapid Transit (D.C.) 52 F. 320, 321. In so far as the decision rests on the ground advanced by the cargo owners here, it cannot be approved. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Compare The Strathdon (C.C.A.) 101 F. 600, 602; The Hoffmans (D.C.) 171 F. 455, 462, 463; The Yungay (D.C.) 58 F.(2d) 352, 357; D'Utassy v.

UNITED STATES(1932)\nNo. 790\nArgued: April 11, 1932Decided: May 31, 1932\n\n\n\n Attorney General Mitchell for the United States.[ Edwards v. United States \n286 U.S. 482 (1932) ]\n\n\n\n[286 U.S. 482, 484]  Mr. M. Walton Hendry, of Washington, D. C., for Edwards.\n\n Mr. Hatton W. Summers, of Dallas, Tex., for the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives, as amicus curiae, by special leave of Court.\n\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n Private Bill No. 510 of the 71st Congress (chapter 595, 46 Stat. 2163) provided that the Court of Claims should have jurisdiction to adjudicate a certain claim of the plaintiff against the government. The court states that the bill was approved by the President on March 5, 1931, that is, \n\n[286 U.S. 482, 485]  within ten days (Sundays excepted) after it was presented to him, but after the final adjournment of the Congress which passed it. The following question is certified:\n\n'Did the Act of March 5, 1931 (46 Stat. 2163), becomes law when it was approved by the President on March 5, 1931, after the final adjournment on March 4, 1931, of the Congress which had passed it?'\n No difference of opinion between the parties as to the validity of the measure, as thus approved, is disclosed in the argument at bar. The President approved the bill upon the advice of the Attorney General (36 Op. Attys. Gen. 403) who, in accord with the plaintiff, submits that the certified question should be answered in the affirmative. In view of the opinion at one time expressed by the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives (H. R. Report No. 108, 38th Cong., 1st sess., June 11, 1864), the Attorney General advised the Judiciary Committee of that House of the pendency of the present cause, and we granted to Mr. Sumners, the chairman of that Committee, at his request, leave to appear as amicus curiae. He has stated to the Court that the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives is now of the opinion that the President has the power asserted and he has presented an argument in support of the President's action. While no contention to the contrary has been urged upon us in the instant case, our attention has been directed to opposing views strongly held in the past, and these-no less than those now advanced- we have carefully considered in reaching our conclusion.\n\n The question arises under the second paragraph of section 7 of article 1 of the Constitution, which reads as follows:\n\n'Every Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a Law, be presented to the President of the United States; if he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, \n\n[286 U.S. 482, 486]  with his Objections to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such Reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall be sent, together with the Objections, to the other House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of that House, it shall become a Law. ... If any Bill shall not be returned by the President within ten Days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the Same shall be a Law, in like Manner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return, in which Case it shall not be a Law.'\n The last sentence of this provision clearly indicates two definite and controlling purposes: First, to insure promptness and to safeguard the opportunity of the Congress for reconsideration of bills which the President disapproves; hence, the fixing of a time limit so that the status of measures shall not be held indefinitely in abeyance through inaction on the part of the President. Second, to safeguard the opportunity of the President to consider all bills presented to him, so that it may not be destroyed by the adjournment of the Congress during the time allowed to the President for that purpose. As this Court said in The Pocket Veto Case, \n279 \nU.S. 655, 677, 678 S., 49 S. Ct. 463, 466, 64 A. L. R. 1434: 'The power thus conferred upon the President cannot be narrowed or cut down by Congress, nor the time within which it is to be exercised, lessened, directly or indirectly.' The constitutional provision is explicit as to the consequences in case the bill is not signed by the President within the time fixed. The bill then becomes a law, unless the Congress by adjournment has prevented the return of the bill, and, in the latter event, it is not to be a law. But the provision is not explicit as to the consequence in case the bill is approved by the President \n\n[286 U.S. 482, 487]  within the time fixed and in the meantime the Congress has adjourned.\n\n The proceedings and debates of the Constitutional Convention throw no light upon this question. See The Pocket Veto Case, supra, at page 675 of 279 U. S., 49 S. Ct. 463. Nor has the provision received a practical construction so positive and consistent as to be determinative. The general practice of Presidents, in being present at the Capitol for the purpose of signing bills during the closing hours of the sessions of the Congress, has indicated the existence of doubt and the desire to avoid controversy. \n1 It appears that the question was raised during the administration of President Monroe, and, in view of a difference of opinion among his advisers, the bill in question was not signed. \n2 President \n\n[286 U.S. 482, 488]  Lincoln, on March 12, 1863, approved a bill after the Congress had adjourned sine die on March 4, 1863, the bill having been passed on March 3, 1863 (chapter 120, 12 Stat. 820). This action was not left unchallenged. The Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives made a unanimous report, in response to a resolution of the House, that the act was not in force. \n3 It does not appear that the House acted upon this report. But the Congress soon after passed an act which referred to the Act of \n\n[286 U.S. 482, 489]  March 12, 1863, as having been approved, and added to its provisions. Act of July 2, 1864, c. 225, 13 Stat. 375.4 The Act of March 12, 1863, was the subject of several decisions of this Court, and in these no question appears to have been raised as to its validity in view of the time of its approval by the President. 5 President Johnson refused to sign a bill which he received on April 1, 1867, as the Congress had taken a recess from March 30, 1867, to July 3, 1867. 6\n It appears that President Cleveland was urged to approve a bill after the adjournment of the Congress, but he did not do so.7 President Harrison, acting on the advice of Attorney General Miller (20 Op. Attys. Gen. 503), signed a number of bills during a recess of the Congress. Upon the opinion of Attorney General Palmer that the action was constitutional (32 Op. Attys. Gen. 225), President Wilson singed several bills after the adjournment sine die \n\n[286 U.S. 482, 490]  of the Second Session of the Sixty-Sixth Congress. \n8 This precedent was followed in the instant case by President Hoover, relying upon the opinion of Attorney General Mitchell that there was no ground for a distinction as to the President's power in this respect between the case of adjournment at the close of a session and the final adjournment of the Congress.\n\n The authority of the President to approve bills during a recess of the Congress, but within the time fixed by the Constitution, has been sustained by this Court. La Abra Silver Mining Co. v. United States, \n175 \nU.S. 423, 20 S. Ct. 168. It appeared in that case that on December 22, 1892, two days after presentation of the bill to the President, the Congress had taken a recess until January 4, 1893. The bill was signed by the President on December 28, 1892. The Court expressly reserved the question, as one not before the Court, whether the President could approve a bill 'after the final adjournment of Congress for the session.' But the reasoning of the opinion applies with as much force to the case of an adjournment, whether it is at the close of a session or is the final adjournment of the Congress, as to the case of a recess for a specified period.\n\n The Court effectively answered the opposing contention based upon the legislative character of the President's function in approving or disapproving bills. See Smiley v. Holm, \n285 \nU.S. 355, 52 S. Ct. 397, 76 L. Ed. -. The fact that it is a legislative function does not mean that it can be performed only while Congress is in session. The President acts legislatively under the Constitution, but he is not a constituent part of the Congress. \n9 In the La Abra Case the Court said \n\n[286 U.S. 482, 491]  (p. 454 of 175 U. S., 20 S. Ct. 168, 178): 'It is said that the approval by the President of a bill passed by Congress is not strictly an executive function, but is legislative in its nature; and this view, it is argued, conclusively shows that his aproval can legally occur only on a day when both Houses are actually sitting in the performance of legislative functions. Undoubtedly the President when approving bills passed by Congress may be said to participate in the enactment of laws which the Constitution requires him to execute. But that consideration does not determine the question before us. As the Constitution, while authorizing the President to perform certain functions of a limited number that are legislative in their general nature, does not restrict the exercise of those functions to the particular days on which the two Houses of Congress are actually sitting in the transaction of public business, the court cannot impose such a restriction upon the Executive.' From this point of view, and so far as the character of the President's function is concerned, it obviously makes no difference whether the Congress has adjourned sine die or to a day named.\n\n The Court's reasoning in the case cited also meets the objection that, if the President may approve bills after adjournment, his action would be free of any limitation of time. The constitutional provision does not admit of such a construction. The intention is clearly shown that in any event the President must act within the prescribed ten days, and the opinion in the La Abra Case is explicit as to the President's duty in this respect. The Court said (pages 453, 454 of 175 U. S., 20 S. Ct. 168, 178): 'The time within which he (the President) must approve or disapprove a bill is prescribed. If he approve a bill, it is made his duty to sign it. The Constitution is silent as to the time of his signing, except that his approval of a bill duly presented to him-if the bill is to become a law merely by virture of such approval-must be manifested by his signature within ten \n\n[286 U.S. 482, 492]  days, Sundays excepted, after the bill has been presented to him. It necessarily results that a bill when so signed becomes from that moment a law. But in order that his refusal or failure to act may not defeat the will of the people, as expressed by Congress, if a bill be not approved and be not returned to the House in which it originated within that time, it becomes a law in like manner as if it had been signed by him.' But, if this limitation of time applies to the President's action when the Congress is in recess, it is apparent that the limitation equally governs his action when the Congress has adjourned. The constitutional provision affords no basis for a distinction between the two cases.\n\n There is nothing in the words of the Constitution which prohibits the President from approving bills, within the time limited for his action, because the Congress has adjourned, and the spirit and purpose of the clause in question forbid the implication of such a restriction. The provision that a bill shall not become a law if its return has been prevented by the adjournment of Congress is apposite to bills that are not signed, not to those that are signed. There is no requirement that bills that are signed should be returned. No further action is required by Congress in respect of a bill which has been presented to the President, unless he disapproves it and returns it for reconsideration as the Constitution provides. We may quote again from the opinion in the La Abra Case (Id.): 'It has properly been the practice of the President to inform Congress by message of his approval of bills, so that the fact may be recorded. But the essential thing to be done in order that a bill may become a law by the approval of the President is that it be signed within the prescribed time after being presented to him. That being done, and as soon as done, whether Congress is informed or not by message from the President of the fact of his approval of it, the bill becomes a law, and is \n\n[286 U.S. 482, 493]  delivered to the Secretary of State as required by law.' \n10\n\n Another objection has been raised that, if the authority of the President to approve bills continues after adjournment of the Congress, an incoming President might approve bills passed during the official term of his predecessor. \n11 But it does not follow that because an incoming President, to whom a bill has not been presented by the Congress, cannot approve it, that a continuing President, to whom a bill has been presented by the Congress, must be debarred of his opportunity to give his approval within the time which the Constitution has prescribed.\n\n Regard must be had to the fundamental purpose of the constitutional provision to provide appropriate opportunity for the President to consider the bills presented to him. The importance of maintaining that opportunity unimpaired increases as bills multiply. The Attorney General calls attention to the fact that at the time here in question, that is, between February 28, 1931, and noon of March 4, 1931, 269 bills were presented to the President for his consideration, 184 of which were presented to him during the last twenty-four hours of the session. No possible reason, either suggested by constitutional theory or based upon supposed policy, appears for a construction of the Constitution which would cut down the opportunity of the President to examine and approve bills merely because the Congress has adjourned. No public interest would be conserved by the requirement of hurried and inconsiderate examination of bills in the closing hours of a session, with the result that bills may be approved which on further consideration would be dis- \n\n[286 U.S. 482, 494]  approved or may fail although on such examination they might be found to deserve approval.\n\n In the instant case, the President, to whom the bill was presented, approved it within the time prescribed by the Constitution, and upon that approval it became a law. The question certified is answered in the affirmative.\n\n It is so ordered. \nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1] See Memoirs of John Quincy Adams (1875), vol. 7, pp. 233, 234. \n\n[\nFootnote 2] John Quincy Adams gives the following account of this incident:\n'Another question discussed was, whether the President could now sign the Act concerning the Florida wreckers, which was examined and actually announced to the House as having been signed, but accidentally, among forty or fifty other Acts approved the last evening before the close of the session, remained without his signature. Could the President sign an Act, Congress not being in session? Wirt thought he could. So did I. The article of the Constitution concerning the signature of the President to Acts of Congress was read and analyzed. Nothing in it requiring that the President should sign while Congress are in session.\n'Calhoun said that uniform practice had established a practical construction of the Constitution.\n'I observed that the practice had merely grown out of the precedents in the British Parliament. But the principles were different. The King was a constituent part of Parliament, and no Act of Parliament could be valid without the King's approbation. But the president is not a constituent part of Congress, and an Act of Congress may be valid as law without his signature or assent.\n'Calhoun still thought that the uniform practice made the law. ... And as the Act was to commence its operation only in October, and was not of an urgent character, it was concluded to be the safest course to leave the Act unsigned, and state the facts to Congress at their next session.' Memoirs of John Quincy Adams (1875), vol. 6, pp. 379, 380. \n\n[\nFootnote 3] The Committee said that the act had been approved by the President 'under the belief that the last clause of the section of the Constitution, above quoted, was designed more especially to prevent Congress from enacting laws without the approval of the Executive, which might be done by the passage of bills by the two houses, followed by an adjournment, before the President could examine and return them, were it not for the declaration that in such cases the bills shall not be laws; and did not relate to cases wherein the Executive should approve bills sent to him by Congress within ten days, even though an adjournment should occur before the return of the bills.\n'That there is force and plausibility in this position, a little reflection will discover to any mind; but the committee cannot receive it as a correct interpretation of the Constitution.\n'The ten days' limitation contained in the section above quoted refers to the time during which Congress remains in session, and has no application after adjournment. Hence if the Executive can hold a bill ten days after adjournment, and then approve it, he can as well hold it ten months before approval. This would render the laws of the country too uncertain, and could not have been intended by the framers of the Constitution.\n'The spirit of the Constitution evidently requires the performance of every act necessary to the enactment and approval of laws to be perfect before the adjournment of Congress.\n'The committee, therefore, conclude that the act referred to, approved March 12, 1863, is not in force; and in this conclusion the committee are unanimous.'

NORTH GERMAN LLOYD(1932)\nNo. 42\nArgued: Decided: December 5, 1932\n\n\n\n The Attorney General and Mr. Charles B. \nRugg, Asst. Atty. Gen., for petitioner.\n Mr. Melville J. France, of New York City, for respondent. \n\n[287 U.S. 324, 325]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent, an operator of steamships, brought suit in the District Court for Southern New York to recover a fine imposed on it by the Secretary of Labor, under section 6 of the Quota Act of 1921, c. 8, 42 Stat. 5, as amended May 11, 1922, c. 187, 42 Stat. 540, for bringing into the United States an alien, inadmissible under that act. Upon pleadings and affidavits, the District Court gave summary judgment for the respondent which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, 54 F.(2d) 997. The case is here on certiorari, \n286 \nU.S. 538\n, 52 S. Ct. 641\n\n\n The Quota Act of 1921 imposed restrictions on the number of immigrants of any nationality who might annually be admitted to the United States, but provided by section 2(a)(4) that the restriction should not apply to 'aliens visiting the United States as tourists or temporarily for business or pleasure.' The 1922 amendment of the act added section 6,1 which provides:\n'That it shall be unlawful for any person ... to bring to the United States ... any alien not admissible under the terms of this Act or regulations made thereunder, and if it appears to the satisfaction of the Secretary of Labor that any alien has been so brought, such person ... shall pay to the collector of customs ... the sum of $200 for each alien so brought, and in addition a sum equal to that paid by such alien for his transportation ... such latter sum to be delivered ... to the alien. ...'\n\n The section also provides:\n'Such fine shall not be remitted or refunded unless it appears to the satisfaction of the Secretary of Labor that such inadmissibility was not known to, and could not have been ascertained by the exercise of reasonable diligence by, such person ... prior to the departure of the vessel. ...' \n\n[287 U.S. 324, 326]\n\u00a0\n The record in the present case raises no question of the correctness or sufficiency of the procedure before the Secretary of Labor. The only issue is the legality upon the unchallenged facts of the imposition of the fine and the refusal of the Secretary to remit it.\n\n On February 14, 1924, respondent brought a German alien to the United States on its steamship 'Bremen.' On embarkation the alien had represented to the respondent that he was going to the United States on a temporary visit for the purpose of collecting an inheritance, and was in possession of a United States consular visa, bearing the notation: 'Purpose to proceed to the United States on business only within the meaning of section 2 of the Restrictive Immigration Law.' Upon arrival in the United States, the alien was detained by immigration officials, and, upon a hearing before a Board of Special Inquiry, his claim that he was visiting the United States temporarily for business was rejected. He was ordered deported, on the ground that he was a quota immigrant, and the quota applicable to his nationality was then exhausted. At the hearing before the Board, it appeared that he arrived without money or a return ticket. His passage had been paid by a relative in the United States. He claimed to be coming to the United States to collect an inheritance of $400, but was without documentary evidence to support this claim, and it had cost him nearly one-half of the amount of the legacy to come here.\n The Secretary notified the respondent that the ascertained facts indicated its liability to a fine (including the repayment of passage money) for bringing the alien to the United States, but permitted the vessel to clear upon respondent's depositing with the collector under protest the amounts to be paid. The imposition of the fine was protested on the ground that respondent had accepted the alien for transportation in good faith, in reliance upon the consular visa and the notation upon it. It does not \n\n[287 U.S. 324, 327]\n\u00a0\n appear that the respondent made any inquiry as to the truth of the alien's claim to be a temporary visitor to the United States for the purpose of collecting an inheritance. After a hearing, the Secretary required payment of the fine and passage money and refused to remit the penalties.\n The court below held that the fine was illegally imposed, for, if the alien was in fact within the excepted class, he was admissible; hence it was lawful for him to come to the United States to present evidence in support of his right to enter, and it was lawful for the respondent to bring him. Te respondent argues here, in addition, that the general purpose of the Quota Act was to exclude immigrants, and the provisions of section 6 imposing penalties for bringing an 'alien,' must be read as applicable only to aliens who seek admission as immigrants.\n DBThe statute itself answers the contention that the act does not apply because the alien did not embark as an immigrant. Section 6 refers to 'any alien not admissible under the terms of this Act' and section 2(d) provides that when the aliens of any nationality admitted in any fiscal year shall exceed the quota 'all other aliens of such nationality, except as otherwise provided in this Act, who may apply for admission during the same fiscal year, shall be excluded.' Thus all aliens, whether they seek admission as immigrants or not, if they are not within the quota or one of the excepted classes, are 'not admissible under the terms of' the Quota Act.\n We do not think it can be said, in the face of the explicit language of the statute, that the respondent could lawfully bring the alien, because he lawfully might come to the United States. The statute imposes no penalty upon the alien for coming beyond the possible denial of his application to enter. But it does declare that it shall be unlawful for the steamship company to bring him if 'not admissible,' as was the case, and imposes the penalty if \n\n[287 U.S. 324, 328]\n\u00a0\n the Secretary finds, as he did, that an inadmissible alien has been brought. In plain terms, the act placed on respondent the burden of acting at its peril that the fine might be imposed in the case of this alien, as with any other, if the event should prove that he was inadmissible. Whether the same result would follow if, as in Compagnie Francaise de Navigation a Vapeur v. Elting (C.C.A.) 19 F.(2d) 773; see North German Lloyd v. Elting (C.C.A.) 48 F.(2d) 547, 549, the line transported an alien entitled under the Immigration Rules to present evidence that he had not abandoned a domicile previously acquired in the United States, we need not now determine.\n The burden which the statute imposses on the transportation companies is lightened, though not removed,2 by the provision authorizing the Secretary to remit the fine if it appears to his satisfaction that the inadmissibility of the alien could not have been ascertained by the steamship company 'by the exercise of reasonable diligence' before sailing. We assume that it was the duty of the Secretary to remit the fine if the evidence established that the alien's inadmissibility could not have been ascertained by respondent by the exercise of reasonable diligence before the vessel sailed. But we cannot say that the discretion which, under the statute he alone may exercise, was abused. Respondent was bound to know the law that \n\n[287 U.S. 324, 329]\n\u00a0\n the consular visa on the alien's passport did not entitle him to entry as a member of the excepted class. Cf. United States ex rel. Spinosa v. Curran (D.C.) 4 F.(2d) 613, affirmed (C.C.A.) 4 F.(2d) 614. The Secretary gave respondent a hearing and acted on substantial evidence, already detailed, tending to show that, by the exercise of reasonable diligence in making inquiry of the alien before sailing, the respondent could have ascertained that he was not entitled to admission as a member of the excepted class.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 6 of the Quota Act was superseded by section 16 of the Immigration Act of 1924, c. 190, 43 Stat. 153, 163, 8 U.S.C.,  216 (8 USCA  216). \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section 6 of the Quota Act of 1921 was added by amendment of May 11, 1922, c. 187, 42 Stat. 540. The amendment as originally introduced imposed a fine upon the steamship company for bringing to the United States an alien who was inadmissible under the statute, and ended with the words 'such fine shall not be remitted or refunded.' In conference the words quoted were deleted, and what is now the third sentence of section 6, providing for remission of the fine by the Secretary, was substituted. H.R. No. 945, 67th Cong., 2d Sess. Before this change, the effect of the section was to impose the fine without qualification if the steamship company brought to the United States an inadmissible alien. The addition of provisions for remission of the fine, once imposed, did not alter its meaning. \n\n\n\n\n","58":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nERIE R. CO. v. DUPLAK(1932)\nNo. 608\nArgued: April 20, 1932Decided: May 23, 1932\n\n\n\n\n[286 U.S. 440, 441]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Ralph E. Cooper, George S. Hobart, and Duane E. Minard, all of Newark, N. J., for petitioner.\n Mr. Jack Rinzler, of Passaic, N. J., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Michael Duplak, a boy five years of age, sustained personal injuries, resulting in the loss of a leg, while playing upon a railroad bridge built by petitioner over a canal in Passaic, N. J. The track crossing the bridge was used only for drilling freight cars-that is, for pulling them into and out from sidings. At the time of the accident the boy was resting on his right knee, looking down into the water of the canal, with his left leg extended over the rail and under one of a string of cars standing on the bridge. While he was in that position, other cars were backed against the standing cars, causing them to move and run over the boy's leg. A sign stood at one end of the bridge warning of danger and forbidding all persons to go upon the bridge. It appeared that from time to time boys had played upon the bridge and had put diving boards on the lower tiers which were used during the summer when the boys were swimming. Naturally, they were not in use in December, when the accident happened. \n\n[286 U.S. 440, 442]\n\u00a0\n In an action brought in the name of the boy and his parents in a federal District Court for New Jersey, a verdict and judgment were rendered against the petitioner, and affirmed on appeal by the court of appeals. 53 F.(2d) 846.\n It is unnecessary to discuss the question of negligence. The case is ruled by a statute of the state of New Jersey, which makes it unlawful 'for any person other than those connected with or employed upon the railroad to walk along the tracks of any railroad except when the same shall be laid upon a public highway; if any person shall be injured by an engine or car while walking, standing or playing on any railroad ... such person ... shall not recover therefor any damages from the company owning or operating said railroad.' Laws of New Jersey 1903, c. 257, p. 645,  55 (3 Comp. St. 1910, p. 4245,  55). This statute has been construed by the Supreme Court of the state so as to deny recovery for the injury of a child twenty-one months old who had strayed upon the private right of way of a railroad company at a place not a public crossing, and who was there struck by a car, resulting in the loss of one of his legs. The court held that the statute barred recovery by any person who walked, stood, or played upon a railroad, and applied to all persons alike without distinction as to age or physical or mental condition. Barcolini v. Atlantic City & S. R. R. Co., 82 N. J. Law, 107, 81 A. 494.\n The rule of this decision was accepted and applied in Erie R. R. Co. v. Hilt, \n247 \nU.S. 97\n, 38 S. Ct. 435. That was the case of a boy less than seven years old, who had been playing marbles near a siding of the railroad and was injured while endeavoring to reach a marble which had rolled under a car standing upon the siding. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit sustained a recovery. This court reversed on the New Jersey statute, supra, \n\n[286 U.S. 440, 443]\n\u00a0\n as construed in the Barcolini Case. An attempt is made to distinguish the instant case, but, upon comparison of the facts here disclosed with those of the Barcolini and Hilt Cases, we are unable to find any such difference as to constitute a substantial basis for making a distinction.\n We find it unnecessary to consider whether the conduct of the railroad company amounted to an invitation to the boy to play upon the bridge. There was certainly no express invitation. The right of way was inclosed by a fence, so far as that could be done without interfering with the movement of cars, and a warning sign put up at one end of the bridge. However, the point is settled by the state law and effectually disposed of by the Hilt Case. The facts there were before the court, but are not fully recited in the opinion. As shown by the decision of the Court of Appeals ( Erie R. Co. v. Hilt (C. C. A.) 246 F. 800, 801), there was open ground next to the siding used as a driveway to the station and the siding. This had been used as a playground by children, some very young, who were accustomed to play on the open ground, on the siding itself, and over and about the cars standing on the rails. The practice was frequent and well known to the railroad. Children sometimes were driven or ordered away, but with little effect, since there was no barrier to keep them off. Notwithstanding that the bearing of these facts was more strongly against the railroad than is the case here, it was held that, in the face of the statute, there could be no recovery. 'The statute,' this court said (page 101 of 247 U. S., 38 S. Ct. 435, 436), 'seemingly adopts in an unqualified form the policy of the common law as understood we believe in New Jersey, Massachusetts, and some other States, that while a landowner cannot intentionally injure or lay traps for a person coming upon his premises without license, he is not bound to provide for the trespasser's \n\n[286 U.S. 440, 444]\n\u00a0\n safety from other undisclosed dangers, or to interrupt his own otherwise lawful occupations to provide for the chance that some one may be unlawfully there.'\n In support of that statement, Turess v. New York, Susq. & West. R. Co ., 61 N. J. Law, 314, 40 A. 614, among other cases, is cited. There the court rejected the contention that the railroad company was liable for an injury to a child who had come upon the property of the company and had been injured while playing on a turntable, which was claimed to be an attractive nuisance. See, also, Kaproli v. Central R. R. of N. J., 105 N. J. Law, 225, 143 A. 343, 60 A. L. R. 1430. The effect of the Hilt decision is to accept the state statute, as construed by the state court, as having put a negative upon the implied invitation and attractive nuisance doctrines; and the same statute necessarily controls here whatever, otherwise, might be the rule.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","59":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nESTERN AIR TRANSPORT v. SOUTH CAROLINA TAX COMMISSION(1932)\nNo. 504\nArgued: February 25, 1932Decided: March 14, 1932\n\n\n\n\n[285 U.S. 147, 148]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Wm. Henry White, Jr., of Washington, D. C., and Christie Benet, of Columbia, S. C., for appellant.\n\n\n[285 U.S. 147, 150]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John M. Daniel, Atty. Gen., and J. Fraser Lyon, of Columbia, S. C., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought to restrain the collection of a tax, imposed by the state of South Carolina, of 6 cents a gallon with respect to gasoline purchased by complainant in that state and used by complainant in interstate commerce. The complainant charged that the state act \n\n[285 U.S. 147, 151]\n\u00a0\n placed a direct burden upon interstate commerce and hence was repugnant to the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution. Article I,  8. The District Court, composed of three judges as required by statute, denied an interlocutory injunction (52 F.(2d) 456) and the complainant appeals to this Court. Judicial Code,  266, U. S. C., tit. 28,  380 (28 USCA  380).\n From the findings of the District Court it appears that the complainant is a Delaware corporation operating, in interstate commerce, air transport lines across the state of South Carolina; that its planes make regular stops at various points in the state but do not carry freight or passengers between such points, and practically its entire business is interstate in character; that it purchases gasoline in South Carolina for the use of its planes and that the seller adds to the price the amount of the state gasoline tax which the seller is required to pay under the act in question, and thus complainant has to pay 6 cents a gallon more than it otherwise would, the excess amounting to about $5,000 a year.\n The tax is described in the statute1 as a license tax which, as applied in the instant case against the dealer, \n\n[285 U.S. 147, 152]\n\u00a0\n is for the privilege of carrying on the business of selling gasoline within the state. The tax is thus imposed upon the seller and the sales in question are intrastate sales. The appellant emphasizes the fact that the tax has been construed by the Supreme Court of the state to be an excise tax and not a property tax. Gregg Dyeing Company v. Query, 164 S. E. 588, Supreme Court of South Carolina, decided April 13, 1931. So far as the present question is concerned, the distinction is not important. If such a license tax for the privilege of making sales within the state were regarded as in effect a tax upon the goods sold,2 its validity could not be questioned in the circumstances here disclosed, as in that aspect the tax would be upon a part of the general mass of property within the state and hence subject to the state's authority to tax, although the property might actually be used in interstate commerce. \n3\n 'It is elementary,' said the court in New Jersey Telephone Co. v. Tax Board, \n280 \nU.S. 338, 346\n, 50 S. Ct. 111, 113, 'that a state may tax property used to carry on interstate commerce.' Treating the tax as an excise tax upon the sales4 does not change the result in the instant case, as the sales are still purely intrastate transactions. Superior Oil Company v. Mississippi, \n280 \nU.S. 390, 395\n, 50 S. Ct. 169. Undoubtedly, purchases of goods within a state may form part of trans \n\n[285 U.S. 147, 153]\n\u00a0\n actions in interstate commerce ahd hence be entitled to enjoy a corresponding immunity. \n5\n But the mere purchase of supplies or equipment for use in conducting a business which constitutes interstate commerce is not so identified with that commerce as to make the sale immune from a nondiscriminatory tax imposed by the State upon intrastate dealers. There is no substantial distinction between the sale of gasoline that is used in an airplane in interstate transportation and the sale of coal for the locomotives of an interstate carrier, or of the locomotives and cars themselves bought as equipment for interstate transportation. A nondiscriminatory tax upon local sales in such cases has never been regarded as imposing a direct burden upon interstate commerce and has no greater or different effect upon that commerce than a general property tax to which all those enjoying the protection of the state may be subjected.\n In Helson v. Com. of Kentucky, \n279 \nU.S. 245\n, 49 S. Ct. 279, upon which the appellant relies, the tax was laid by Kentucky with respect to gasoline purchased by the plaintiffs in error in Illinois and used within Kentucky in the operation of a ferry boat on the Ohio river between the two states. The Court found that the tax was laid directly upon the use of the gasoline in interstate transportation.

Martin and Samuel B. Bassett, both of Seattle, Wash., for petitioner.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a motion by Winfield A. Green for leave to file a petition for a writ of mandamus against the federal District Court for the Western District of Washington to show cause why the writ should not issue requiring the judge thereof to conform to the opinion of this court in Langnes v. Green, \n282 \nU.S. 531\n, 51 S. Ct. 243. In that case Green had \n\n[286 U.S. 437, 438]\n\u00a0\n brought an action against Langnes in a superior court of the state of Washington to recover damages for personal injury suffered while employed upon the Aloha, a fishing vessel of which Languages was the sole owner. Four months thereafter, while that action was pending, Langnes brought a proceeding in the federal District Court, praying a limitation of liability under the appropriate provisions of the Revised Statutes. The parties stipulated that the vessel was of no greater value than the sum of $ 5,000. Upon the filing of the petition, the District Court issued an order restraining further proceedings in the state court, and a monition to all claimants to present their claims within a time fixed. Green filed his claim in the amount of $25,000 for damages, which was the only claim ever filed, and thereupon moved to dissolve the restraining order. The District Court denied the motion, and tried the cause in respect of respondent's claim, holding there was no liability and entering a decree accordingly. 32 F.(2d) 284. An appeal followed to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. That court reversed the decree and remanded the cause upon grounds which need not now be stated. 35 F.(2d) 447.\n We reversed the decrees of both courts, and remanded the cause to the District Court for further proceedings. We held that the action was properly brought in the state court under section 24(3) of the Judicial Code, U. S. C., Title 28,  41(3), 28 USCA,  41(3), which saves to suitors in all cases of admiralty 'the right of a common-law remedy where the common law is competent to give it,' and that the petition for a limitation of liability also was properly brought in the federal District Court. The situation then being that one statute afforded the right to a common-law remedy, and another the right to seek a limitation of liability, we said that a case was presented for the exercise of the sound discretion of the District Court whether to dissolve the restraining order and permit the state court \n\n[286 U.S. 437, 439]\n\u00a0\n to proceed, or to retain complete jurisdiction; and, upon consideration of the matter, we held that such discretion should have been exercised so as to permit the state court to proceed.\n But we also said that the District Court, as a matter of precaution, should retain the petition for a limitation of liability 'to be dealt with in the possible but (since it must be assumed that respondent's motion was not an idle gesture but was made with full appreciation of the state court's entire lack of admiralty jurisdiction) the unlikely event that the right of petitioner to a limited liability might be brought into question in the state court, or the case otherwise assume such form in that court as to bring it within the exclusive power of a court of admiralty.'\n As authority for that disposition of the matter we cited The Lotta (D. C.) 150 F. 219, 223, where Judge Brawley, dealing with a similar situation, had taken that course. We quoted from his opinion, among other things, the following:\n'All that the petitioner can fairly claim is that he should not be subject to a personal judgment for an indefinite amount and beyond the value of his interest in the Lotta and her freight. ... If it should hereafter appear in the course of the proceedings in the state court that a question is raised as to the right of petitioner to a limited liability, this court has exclusive cognizance of such a question ... and the decision upon the question of the injunction is predicated upon the assumption that that question is not involved in the suit in the state court, and that the only questions to be decided there are, first, whether the defendant is liable at all, and, if so, as to the value of the vessel and her freight, which is the limit of defendant's liability.'\n\n It is clear from our opinion that the state court has no jurisdiction to determine the question of the owner's \n\n[286 U.S. 437, 440]\n\u00a0\n right to a limited liability, and that, if the value of the vessel be not accepted as the limit of the owner's liability, the federal court is authorized to resume jurisdiction and dispose of the whole case.\n Notwithstanding the foregoing, Green, following the remission of the cause to the state court, put in issue the right of the owner to limited liability, by challenging the seaworthiness of the vessel and the lack of the owner's privity or knowledge. The matter was properly brought before the federal District Court, and that court held that, the question of the owner's right to limited liability having been raised, the cause became cognizable only in admiralty, and that its further prosecution in the state court should be enjoined. In this the District Court was right, and the motion for leave to file the petition for writ of mandamus must be denied.\n The District Court, however, gave Green until a time fixed to withdraw, in the state court, the issue as to the right to limited liability, in which event the restraining order was not to issue. That court, upon being seasonably advised of the proceeding here and of our disposition of it, will, no doubt, grant further reasonable time to allow Green to elect whether to withdraw the admiralty issue which he has raised in the state court; and the denial of the motion is made without prejudice to such action.\n Leave denied. \n\n\n\n","61":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEX PARTE UNITED STATES(1932)\nNo. 19\nArgued: Decided: December 5, 1932\n\n\n\n The Attorney General and Mr. Thomas D. \nThacher, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D.C., for the United States.[ Ex parte United States \n287 U.S. 241\n (1932) ]\n\n\n[287 U.S. 241, 243]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Francis Biddle, of Philadelphia, Pa., for respondent.\n\n\n[287 U.S. 241, 244]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an application for a writ of mandamus requiring the federal District Judge sitting in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania \n\n[287 U.S. 241, 245]\n\u00a0\n and the court itself to set aside an order denying a petition of the United States attorney for the issue of a bench warrant for the arrest of Joseph V. Wingert (see United States v. Wingert, 55 F.(2d) 960), and directing that such bench warrant be issued. The case is here for decision upon the return of the court and judge to a rule to show cause why the application for the writ should not be granted. The facts follow.\n On March 10, 1932, a grand jury for the district, duly impaneled, returned an indictment against Wingert, charging him with violating certain provisions of the banking laws of the United States. No question is raised as to the regularity of the proceedings before the grand jury, or as to the sufficiency of the indictment. On March 22, the United States attorney presented to the court a written petition praying that a bench warrant issue for Wingert's arrest. The District Court, with nothing before it, so far as the record discloses, but the petition and the indictment, denied the petition and refused to issue the warrant. The sole ground alleged in the return for such denial is that the matter was within the judicial discretion of the court, and therefore not subject to mandamus proceedings.\n\n 1. \nIt first is necessary to determine whether under these facts we have jurisdiction to issue the writ. Section 716, Rev. Stats. (section 262 of the Judicial Code, U.S.C., title 28,  377 (28 USCA  377)), provides that this court and other federal courts 'shall have power to issue all writs not specifically provided for by statute, which may be necessary for the exercise of their respective jurisdictions, and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.' As early as 1831 it was settled that this court had power to issue a mandamus directed to a federal Circuit Court commanding that court to sign a bill of exceptions, such action being in the nature of appellate jurisdiction. In re Crane, 5 Pet. 190, 193. In Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch, 137, 175, it was held \n\n[287 U.S. 241, 246]\n\u00a0\n that to warrant the issue of a mandamus by this court, in cases where original jurisdiction had not been conferred by the Constitution (see Commonwealth of Kentucky v. Dennison, Governor, &c., 24 How. 66, 97), it must be shown to be an exercise of appellate jurisdiction, or to be necessary to enable the court to exercise its appellate jurisdiction. McClellan v. Carland, \n217 \nU.S. 268, 280\n, 30 S.Ct. 501, 504, laid down the general rule applicable both to this court and to the Circuit Courts of Appeals, that the power to issue the writ under R.S.  716 is not limited to cases where its issue is required in aid of a jurisdiction already obtained, but that 'where a case is within the appellate jurisdiction of the higher court a writ of mandamus may issue in aid of the appellate jurisdiction which might otherwise be defeated by the unauthorized action of the court below.' See, also, Delaware, L. & W.R. Co. v. Rellstab, \n276 \nU.S. 1, 5\n, 48 S.Ct. 203; In re Babcock (C.C. A.) 26 F.(2d) 153, 155; Barber Asphalt Paving Co. v. Morris (C.C.A.) 132 F. 945, 952-956, 67 L.R.A. 761.\n Perhaps it would be enough to satisfy the test afforded by these decisions to point to the limited authority of this court under chapter 2564, 34 Stat. 1246, U.S.C., title 18,  682, 18 USCA  682 (U.S.C., title 28,  345, 28 USCA  345) to exercise direct appellate jurisdiction to review a decision of the District Court in the possible event that some action of that court might give rise to a right of review at the instance of the government. We prefer, however, to put our determination upon the broader ground that, even if the appellate jurisdiction of this court could not in any view be immediately and directly invoked, the issue of the writ may rest upon the ultimate power which we have to review the case itself by certiorari to the Circuit Court of Appeals in which such immediate and direct appellate jurisdiction is lodged.\n It is true this court has held that it was without authority to issue a writ of mandamus to the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, because, since the creation of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, this \n\n[287 U.S. 241, 247]\n\u00a0\n court could not review the judgments and decrees of the Supreme Court of the district directly by appeal or writ of error. In re Massachusetts, \n197 \nU.S. 482\n, 25 S.Ct. 512. And see, also, Ex parte Glaser, \n198 \nU.S. 171\n, 25 S.Ct. 653. Assuming that an application of those decisions to the present case would necessitate a denial of the writ, later cases clearly indicate that the rule as thus limited to longer obtains. In McClellan v. Garland, supra, 217 U.S. page 279, 30 S.Ct. 501, this court significantly suggested that it should be slow to reach a conclusion which would have the result of depriving the court of the power to issue the writ in proper cases to review the action of the federal courts inferior in jurisdiction to itself. And in Re Abdu, \n247 \nU.S. 27, 28\n, 38 S.Ct. 447, Mr. Chief Justice White, speaking for the court, said:\n'The existence of ultimate discretionary power here to review the cause on its merits and the deterrent influence which the refusal to file must have upon the practical exertion of that power in a case properly made gives the authority to consider the subject which the rule presents.'\n\n This statement, it is true, related to the refusal of a Circuit Court of Appeals to direct its clerk to file the record in an appeal from a District Court; but it was followed broadly in Los Angeles Brush Mfg. Corp. v. James, \n272 \nU.S. 701\n, 47 S.Ct. 286. In that case an application for mandamus was made to this court to compel a District Court to hear a patent case, instead of referring it to a master, in alleged violation of Equity Rules 46, 59 (28 USCA  723). This court, after pointing out that the hearing of the cause in review would normally be had in the Circuit Court of Appeals, and could come here only in due course by certiorari, and saying that it was unnecessary to decide whether the writ would issue direct to the District Court in matters as to which the Circuit Court of Appeals would or should ordinarily have power to issue a mandamus to the same end in aid of its appellate jurisdiction, continued ( page 706 of 272 U.S., 47 S.Ct. 286, 288): \n\n[287 U.S. 241, 248]\n\u00a0\n 'However that may be, we think it clear that, where the subject concerns the enforcement of the equity rules which by law it is the duty of this court to formulate and put in force, and in a case in which this court has the ultimate discretion to review the case on its merits, it may use its power of mandamus and deal directly with the District Court in requiring it to conform to them. Ex parte Abdu, \n247 \nU.S. 27, 28\n, 38 S.Ct. 447; Ex parte Crane, 5 Pet. 190, 192, 193, 194. This is not to say that, in every case where the equity rules are the subject of interpretation and enforcement in the District Court, such questions may as of course be brought here and considered in a direct proceeding in mandamus. The question of thus using the writ of mandamus would be a matter of discretion in this court, and it would decline to exercise its power where the issue might more properly come up by mandamus in an intermediate appellate court or in regular proceedings on review. If it clearly appeared, however, that a practice had been adopted by District Judges as to the order or procedure in hearing causes at variance with the equity rules, our writ might well issue directly to such judges.'\n In other, and readily distinguishable, cases where the direct appellate jurisdiction was vested in the Circuit Court of Appeals, this court, in the exercise of its discretion, has declined to issue the writ and relegated the applicant to his remedy in that court. Ex parte Apex Electric Mfg. Co., \n274 \nU.S. 725\n, 47 S.Ct. 766; Ex parte Daugherty, \n282 \nU.S. 809\n, 51 S.Ct. 180; Ex parte Krentler- Arnold Hinge Last Co., \n286 \nU.S. 533\n, 52 S.Ct. 621\n\n\n The rule deducible from the later decisions, and which we now affirm, is that this court has full power in its discretion to issue the writ of mandamus to a federal District Court, although the case be one in respect of which direct appellate jurisdiction is vested in the Circuit Court of Appeals-this court having ultimate discretionary jurisdiction by certiorari-but that such power will be exercised only where a question of public importance is involved, or \n\n[287 U.S. 241, 249]\n\u00a0\n where the question is of such a nature that it is peculiarly appropriate that such action by this court should be taken. In other words, application for the writ ordinarily must be made to the intermediate appellate court, and made to this court as the court of ultimate review only in such exceptional cases. That the present case falls within the latter description seems clear. The effect of the refusal of the District Court to issue a warrant upon an indictment fair upon its face and properly found and returned is equivalent to a denial of the absolute right of the government, as matters stand, to put the accused on trial, since that cannot be done in his absence. The mere statement discloses the gravity and public importance of the question. It is obvious that, if a like attitude should be taken by District Courts generally, serious interference with the prosecution of persons indicted for criminal offenses might result. Undoubtedly, upon the theory presented by the government, mandamus is the appropriate remedy; and the writ may well issue from this court in order to expedite the settlement of the important question involved, and, incidentally, in furtherance of the general policy of a prompt trial and disposition of criminal cases. Accordingly, we pass to a consideration of the merits.\n\n 2. \nThe theory of the court below is that its denial of the petition of the government for a bench warrant was an exercise of its judicial discretion, and therefore not reviewable by mandamus. This view of the matter cannot be sustained. The question whether there was probable cause for putting the accused on trial was for the grand jury to determine, and, the indictment being fair on its face, the court to which it was returned, upon the application of the United States attorney, should have issued the warrant as a matter of course. Cases are cited said to be to the contrary, but they are not in point. They are either cases where the warrant was sought from a magistrate upon complaint in the absence of an indictment, or \n\n[287 U.S. 241, 250]\n\u00a0\n was sought under the removal statute, R.S.  1014, U.S.C., title 18,  591 ( 18 USCA  591). Obviously, the first named cases are without application. In cases arising under the removal statute, the indictment is produced and considered, not as a basic pleading, but merely as evidence establishing or tending to establish the commission of the offense and which may or may not settle the question of probable cause. In the trial court to which the indictment has been returned it is 'the very foundation of the charge.' Benson v. Henkel, \n198 \nU.S. 1, 12\n, 25 S.Ct. 569, 571; Morse v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 80, 83\n, 45 S.Ct. 209; Fetters v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 638, 642\n, 51 S.Ct. 596.\n It reasonably cannot be doubted that, in the court to which the indictment is returned, the finding of an indictment, fair upon its face, by a properly constituted grand jury, conclusively determines the existence of probable cause for the purpose of holding the accused to answer. Compare McGrain v. Daugherty, \n273 U.S. 135\n, 156-158, 47 S.Ct. 319, 50 A.L.R. 1; Hale v. Henkel, \n201 U.S. 43\n, 60-62, 26 S.Ct. 370. The refusal of the trial court to issue a warrant of arrest under such circumstances is, in reality and effect, a refusal to permit the case to come to a hearing upon either questions of law or of fact, and falls little short of a refusal to permit the enforcement of the law. The authority conferred upon the trial judge to issue a warrant of arrest upon an indictment does not, under the circumstances here disclosed, carry with it the power to decline to do so under the guise of judicial discretion; or, as this court suggested in Ex parte United States, \n242 \nU.S. 27, 42\n, 37 S.Ct. 72, L.R.A. 1917E, 1178, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 355, the power to enforce does not inherently beget a discretion permanently to refuse to enforce. In United States v. Thompson, \n251 \nU.S. 407\n, 40 S.Ct. 289, an order of a federal District Court quashing an indictment on the ground that the charge, having been submitted to a previous grand jury, had been resubmitted to a later one without leave of court first obtained, was set aside. This court there said that the power and duty of the grand jury to investigate is original \n\n[287 U.S. 241, 251]\n\u00a0\n and complete, and may be exercised upon its own motion and upon such knowledge as it may derive from any source which it may deem proper, and is not exhausted or limited by adverse action taken by a previous grand jury, and that a United States district attorney may present, without leave of court, charges which a previous grand jury has ignored. The necessary effect of the District Court's order, it was said (pages 412, 413 of 251 U.S., 40 S.Ct. 289, 291), 'was to bar the absolute right of the United States to prosecute by subjecting the exercise of that right, not only as to this indictment, but as to all subsequent ones for the same offenses, to a limitation resulting from the exercise of the judicial power,' and to bar the lawful authority of the United States attorney and of the grand jury 'by the application of unauthorized judicial discretion.' These observatons are pertinent here.\n Rule made absolute. \n\n\n\n","62":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFIRST NAT. BANK OF BOSTON v.

Fordyce, all of St. Louis, Mo., of counsel), for executors of James N. Jarvie's Estate, amicus curiae.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question presented for our determination by this appeal is whether the state of Maine has power, under the Fourteenth Amendment, to impose a tax upon a transfer by death of shares of stock in a Maine corporation, forming part of the estate of a decedent, who, at the time of his death, was domiciled in the commonwealth of Massachusetts.\n The facts which give rise to the question follow. In 1924, Edward H. Haskell died testate, a resident of Massachusetts. The greater part of his property consisted of shares of stock in the Great Northern Paper Company, a Maine corporation, having most of its property in that state. His will was probated in Massachusetts, where the stock, as a part of his estate, had been made liable to an inheritance tax of like character to the inheritance tax in force in Maine. The Massachusetts tax amounted to over $ 32,000 and was paid on legacies and distributive shares made up in greater part of the proceeds of the paper company stock. Ancillary administration was taken out in a Maine probate court, and an inheritance tax amounting to over $62,000 was \n\n[284 U.S. 312, 321]\n\u00a0\n assessed under the Maine statutes1 on the property passing by the will. Upon this amount, the tax paid to Massachusetts was allowed as a credit, and an action of debt was brought to recover the balance. Upon an agreed statement embodying the foregoing facts, the case was referred for final decision to the Supreme Judicial Court of the state of Maine, sitting as a law court. That court rendered judgment for the state, holding that the shares of stock were 'within its jurisdiction, and there subject to an inheritance tax, even though the owner was a nonresident decedent, regardless of whether the certificates of stock were at the time of the death in the state of the domicile or in the taxing state'; and that the Fourteenth Amendment thereby was not infringed. 130 Me. 123, 154 A. 103, 108.\n Beginning with Blackstone v. Miller, \n188 \nU.S. 189\n, 23 S. Ct. 277, decisions of this court rendered before Farmers Loan Co. v. Minnesota, \n280 \nU.S. 204\n, 50 S. Ct. 98, 65 A. L. R. 1000, it may be conceded would preclude a successful challenge to the judgment of the state court. In the first-named case, it was held that a deposit in a New York trust company to the credit of Blackstone, who died domiciled in Illinois, was subject \n\n[284 U.S. 312, 322]\n\u00a0\n to a transfer tax imposed by New York, notwithstanding the fact that the whole succession, including the deposit, had been similarly taxed in Illinois. That decision was overruled by the Farmers Loan Company Case, and with it, of course, all intermediate decisions so far as they were based on Blackstone v. Miller.\n A review of these decisions would serve no useful purpose. While in some of them a restatement of the doctrine of Blackstone v. Miller was unnecessary to a determination of the points presented for consideration, and in others the facts might be distinguished from those of the present case, nevertheless the authority of the Blackstone Case was accepted by all. Frick v. Pennsylvania, \n268 \nU.S. 473\n, 45 S. Ct. 603, 42 A. L. R. 316, was one of the latest to approve that case and give countenance to the general doctrine that intangible property (unlike tangible property) might be subjected to a death transfer tax in more than one state; but this and all other instances of such approval, whether express or tacit, with the overthrow of the foundation upon which they rested, have ceased to have other than historic interest.\n It was by the Frick Case, however, that the rule became definitely fixed that, as to tangible personal property, the power to tax is exclusively in the state where the property has an actual situs; and this, as will be seen later, has an important bearing on the present case. Mr. Frick, domiciled in Pennsylvania, died testate owning tangible personal property having an actual situs in New York and Massachusetts. His will was probated in Pennsylvania, and a transfer tax was imposed under a Pennsylvania statute which provided for such a tax on all property of a resident decedent, whether within or without the state. Ancillary letters were granted in New York and Massachusetts. We decided, pages 488-492 of 268 U. S., 45 S. Ct. 603, 604, that the Pennsylvania tax, in so far as it was imposed upon the transfer of tangible personalty, having an actual situs in other states, was in contravention of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Upon a review of former decisions, it was held: ( 1) That the exaction of a tax beyond \n\n[284 U.S. 312, 323]\n\u00a0\n the power of the state to impose was a taking of property in violation of the due process clause; (2) that while the tax laws of a state may reach every object which is under its jurisdiction, they cannot be given extraterritorial operation; and (3) that as respects tangible personal property, having an actual situs in a particular state, the power to subject it to state taxation rests exclusively in that state, regardless of the owner's domicile.\n The tax there under consideration was not a property tax, but one laid on the transfer of property on the death of the owner, and, as to that, the court said (page 492 of 268 U. S., 45 S. Ct. 603, 605): 'But to impose either tax the state must have jurisdiction over the thing that is taxed, and to impose either without such jurisdiction is mere extortion and in contravention of due process of law.'\n See, also, Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky, \n199 \nU.S. 194, 204\n, 26 S. Ct. 36, 4 Ann. Cas. 493; Rhode Island Hospital Trust Co. v. Doughton, \n270 \nU.S. 69, 80\n, 46 S. Ct. 256, 43 A. L. R. 1374\n\n\n The decision of this court in the Farmers Loan Company Case was foreshadowed by its decision in Safe Deposit & T. Co. v. Virginia, \n280 \nU.S. 83\n, 50 S. Ct. 59, 67 A. L. R. 386. There it was held that intangibles, such as stocks and bonds, in the hands of the legal holder of the title in the state of his residence, may not be taxed at the domicile of the equitable owner in another state; and, in respect of taxation of the same securities by two states, we said (page 94 of 280 U. S., 50 S. Ct. 59, 61): 'It would be unfortunate, perhaps amazing, if a legal fiction originally invented to prevent personalty from escaping just taxation should compel us to accept the irrational view that the same securities were within two states at the same instant and because of this to uphold a double and oppressive assessment.'\n A little later at the same term, the Farmers Loan Company Case was decided. \n280 \nU.S. 204\n, 50 S. Ct. 98, 65 A. L. R. 1000. The facts are recited at page 208 of 280 U. S., 50 S. Ct. 98, 99. Henry R. Taylor, domiciled in New York, died testate leaving negotiable bonds and certificates of indebtedness issued by the state of Minnesota and two of her municipalities. Some of them were regis \n\n[284 U.S. 312, 324]\n\u00a0\n tered; none were connected with business carried on by or for the decedent in Minnesota. His will was probated and his estate administered in New York, and a tax exacted by that state on the testamentary transfer. Minnesota assessed an inheritance tax upon the same transfer, which was upheld by her Supreme Court. This court, applying the maxim mobilia sequuntur personam, held that the situs for taxation was in New York, and that the tax was there properly imposed. The contention on behalf of the state was that the obligations were debts of Minnesota and her municipal corporations, subject to her control; that her laws gave them validity, protected them, and provided means for enforcing payment; and that, accordingly, they had a situs for taxation also in that state.\n This court agreed that Blackstone v Miller, and certain approving opinions lent support to the view that ordinarily choses in action might be subjected to taxation both at the domicile of the debtor and that of the creditor, and that two states might tax on different and more or less inconsistent principles the same testamentary transfer of such property without conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment. But it was said that the tendency of that view was to disturb good relations among the states; that the practical effect of it had been bad; and that a preponderance of the states had endeavored to avoid the evil by resort to reciprocal exemption laws. Upon these and other considerations, which we shall not stop to particularize, the case was overruled as no longer constituting a correct exposition of existing law. The view that two states have power to tax the same transfer on different and inconsistent principles was distinctly rejected; and the general reasons which support the rule that tangibles and their testamentary transfer may be taxed only by the state where they are found were held to be sufficient to inhibit the taxation by two states of intangibles with a \n\n[284 U.S. 312, 325]\n\u00a0\n taxable situs imposed by due application of the mobilia maxim.\n After saying that choses in action, no less than tangible personalty, demand protection against multiple taxation, the court, at page 212 of 280 U. S., 50 S. Ct. 98, 100, concluded: 'Taxation is an intensely practical matter, and laws in respect of it should be construed and applied with a view of avoiding, so far as possible, unjust and oppressive consequences. We have determined that in general intangibles may be properly taxed at the domicile of their owner, and we can find no sufficient reason for saying that they are not entitled to enjoy an immunity against taxation at more than one place similar to that accorded to tangibles. The difference between the two things, although obvious enough, seems insufficient to justify the harsh and oppressive discrimination against intangibles contended for on behalf of Minnesota.'\n Notwithstanding the registration of certain of the bonds, and notwithstanding the contention that Minnesota protects the debt, compels its payment, and permits its transfer, we concluded that the testamentary transfer was properly taxable in New York, but not also in Minnesota.\n This case was followed by Baldwin v. Missouri, \n281 \nU.S. 586\n, 50 S. Ct. 436, 72 A. L. R. 1303. There the testator, domiciled in Illinois at the time of her death, had credits for cash deposited in banks located in Missouri, and certain bonds of the United States and promissory notes; all physically within that state. Some of the notes, executed by residents of Missouri, were secured on lands in that state. Applying the principles of the Farmers Loan Company Case, we held that the situs of these credits, bonds, and notes was at the domicile of the testator, and there passed from the dead to the living; that they were not within Missouri for taxation purposes; and that the transfer was not subject to the power of that state. \n\n[284 U.S. 312, 326]\n\u00a0\n Beidler v. South Carolina Tax Commission, \n282 \nU.S. 1\n, 51 S. Ct. 54, presented still another phase of the subject. There it appeared that a resident of Illinois died in that state. At the time of his death, a South Carolina corporation was indebted to him in a large sum upon an open unsecured account entered upon the books of the corporation kept in South Carolina. Again applying the principles of the Farmers Loan Company Case, we held that the transfer by death of this debt was taxable only by the state of the domicile.\n It long has been settled law that real property cannot be taxed, or made the basis of an inheritance tax, except by the state in which it is located. More recently it became settled that the same rule applies with respect to tangible personal property. And it now is established by the three cases last cited that certain specific kinds of intangibles, namely, bonds, notes, and credits, are subject to the imposition of an inheritance tax only by the domiciliary state; and this notwithstanding the bonds are registered in another state, and the notes secured upon lands located in another state, resort to whose laws may be necessary to secure payment.\n The rule of immunity from taxation by more than one state, deducible from the decisions in respect of these various and distinct kinds of property, is broader than the applications thus far made of it. In its application to death taxes, the rule rests for its justification upon the fundamental conception that the transmission from the dead to the living of a particular thing, whether corporeal or incorporeal, is an event which cannot take place in two or more states at one and the same time. In respect of tangible property, the opposite view must be rejected as connoting a physical impossibility; in the case of intangible property, it must be rejected as involving an inherent and logical self-contradiction. Due regard for the processes of correct thinking compels the \n\n[284 U.S. 312, 327]\n\u00a0\n conclusion that a determination fixing the local situs of a thing for the purpose of transferring it in one state carries with it an implicit denial that there is a local situs in another state for the purpose of transferring the same thing there. The contrary conclusion as to intangible property has led to nothing but confusion and injustice by bringing about the anomalous and grossly unfair result that one kind of personal property cannot, for the purpose of imposing a transfer tax, be within the jurisdiction of more than one state at the same time, while another kind, quite as much within the protecting reach of the Fourteenth Amendment, may be, at the same moment, within the taxable jurisdiction of as many as four states, and by each subjected to a tax upon its transfer by death, an event which takes place, and in the nature of things can take place, in one of the states only.\n A transfer from the dead to the living of any specific property is an event single in character and is effected under the laws, and occurs within the limits, of a particular state; and it is unreasonable and incompatible with a sound construction of the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to hold that jurisdiction to tax that event may be distributed among a number of states.\n It is true, there are such differences between bonds and stocks as might justify their being placed in separate categories for some purposes. But, plainly, they may not be so placed for the purpose of subjecting a transfer by death of the former to a tax by one state only, and a similar transfer of the latter to a tax by two or more states. Both are intangibles and both generally have been recognized as resting in contract, or, technically, as 'choses in action.' Hawley v. Malden, \n232 \nU.S. 1, 12\n, 34 S. Ct. 201, 202, Ann. Cas. 1916C, 842; Blodgett v. Silberman, \n277 \nU.S. 1, 14\n, 48 S. Ct. 410. The reciprocal inheritance statutes now in force in a preponderating number of the \n\n[284 U.S. 312, 328]\n\u00a0\n states of the Union make no distinction between the various classes of intangible personal property. The New York statute, for example, under that term includes 'deposits in banks, mortgages, debts, receivables, shares of stock, bonds, notes, credits, evidences of an interest in property, evidences of debt and choses in action generally.' Gen. Laws N. Y. 1930, c. 710,  1. This impressive recognition of the substantial identity of the enumerated intangibles, for purposes of death taxation, is entitled to weight.\n A distinction between bonds and stocks for the essentially practical purposes of taxation is more fanciful than real. Certainly, for such purposes, the differences are not greater than the differences between tangible and intangible property, or between bonds and credits. When things so dissimilar as bonds and household furniture may not be subjected to contrary rules in respect of the number of states which may tax them, there is a manifest incongruity in declaring that bonds and stocks, possessing, for the most part, the same or like characteristics, may be subjected to contrary rules in that regard.\n We conclude that shares of stock, like the other intangibles, constitutionally can be subjected to a death transfer tax by one state only.\n The question remains: In which state, among two or more claiming the power to impose the tax, does the taxable event occur? In the case of tangible personalty, the solution is simple: The transfer, that is, the taxable event, occurs in that state where the property has an actual situs, and it is taxable there and not elsewhere. In the case of intangibles, the problem is not so readily solved, since intangibles ordinarily have no actual situs. But it must be solved unless gross discrimination between the two classes of property is to be sanctioned; and this court has solved it in respect of the intangibles heretofore dealt with by applying the maxim mobilia sequuntur personam. \n\n[284 U.S. 312, 329]\n\u00a0\n Farmers Loan Co. v. Minnesota, supra, 280 U. S. at pages 211, 212, 50 S. Ct. 98, 65 A. L. R. 1000; Baldwin v. Missouri, supra; Beidler v. So. Car. Tax Commission, supra.\n This ancient maxim had its origin when personal property consisted in the main of articles appertaining to the person of the owner, such as gold, silver, jewels, and apparel, and, less immediately, animals and products of the farm and shop. Such property was usually under the direct supervision of the owner and was often carried about by him on his journeys. Under these circumstances, the maxim furnished the natural and reasonable rule. In modern times, due to the vast increase in the extent and variety of tangible personal property not immediately connected with the person of the owner, the rule has gradually yielded to the law of the place where the property is kept and used. Pullman's Palace-Car Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n141 \nU.S. 18, 22\n, 11 S. Ct. 876; Eidman v. Martinez, \n184 \nU.S. 578, 581\n, 22 S. Ct. 515; Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky, supra, \n199 \nU.S. 206\n, 26 S. Ct. 36, 4 Ann. Cas. 493. But in respect of intangible property, the rule is still convenient and useful, if not always necessary; and it has been adhered to as peculiarly applicable to that class of property. Blodgett v. Silberman, supra, \n277 \nU.S. 9, 10\n, 48 S. Ct. 410; Farmers Loan Co. v. Minnesota, supra, \n280 \nU.S. 211\n, 50 S. Ct. 98, 65 A. L. R. 1000; Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky, supra, \n199 \nU.S. 206\n, 26 S. Ct. 36, 4 Ann. Cas. 493.\n The considerations which justify the application of the fiction embodied in the maxim to death transfer taxes imposed in respect of bonds, certificates of indebtedness, notes, credits, and bank deposits, apply, with substantially the same force, in respect of corporate shares of stock. And since death duties rest upon the power of the state imposing them to control the provilege of succession, the reasons which sanction the selection of the domiciliary state in the various cases first named sanction the same selection in the case last named. In each case, there is wanting, on the part of a state other than that of the domicile, any real taxable relationship to the event which is the subject of the tax. Ownership of shares by \n\n[284 U.S. 312, 330]\n\u00a0\n the stockholder and ownership of the capital by the corporation are not identical. The former is an individual interest giving the stockholder a right to a proportional part of the dividends, and the effects of the corporation when dissolved, after payment of its debts. Delaware Railroad Tax, 18 Wall. 206, 229, 230; Rhode Island Trust Co. v. Doughton, \n270 \nU.S. 69, 81\n, 46 S. Ct. 256, 43 A. L. R. 1374; Eisner v. Macomber, \n252 \nU.S. 189, 213\n, 214 S., 40 S. Ct. 189, 9 A. L. R. 1570. And this interest is an incorporeal property right which attaches to the person of the owner in the state of his domicile. The fact that the property of the corporation is situated in another state affords no ground for the imposition by that state of a death tax upon the transfer of the stock. Rhode Island Trust Co. v. Doughton, supra. And we are unable to find in the further fact of incorporation under the laws of such state adequate reason for a different conclusion.\n Undoubtedly the state of incorporation may tax the transfer of the stock of a nonresident decedent and the issue of a new certificate to take the place of the old, under the power generally to impose taxes of that character. But plainly such a tax is not a death duty which flows from the power to control the succession; it is a stock transfer tax which flows from the power of the state to control and condition the operations of the corporation which it creates. A formal transfer of the stock upon the books of the corporation, and the issue of new certificates, bear a relation to the succession differing little, if at all, in substantial effect from that borne by the registration of the state bonds, involved in the Farmers Loan Company Case, or the necessity of invoking the law of Missouri in respect of notes secured on Missouri lands, involved in the Baldwin Case. Practical considerations of wisdom, convenience, and justice alike dictate the desirability of a uniform general rule confining the jurisdiction to impose death transfer taxes as to in \n\n[284 U.S. 312, 331]\n\u00a0\n tangibles to the state of the domicile; and these considerations are greatly fortified by the fact that a large majority of the states have adopted that rule by their reciprocal inheritance tax statutes. In some states, indeed, the rule has been declared independently of such reciprocal statutes. The requirements of due process of law accord with this view.\n We do not overlook the possibility that shares of stock, as well as other intangibles, may be so used in a state other than that of the owner's domicile as to give them a situs analogous to the actual situs of tangible personal property. See Farmers Loan Company Case, supra, 280 U. S. at page 213, 50 S. Ct. 98, 65 A. L. R. 1000. That question heretofore has been reserved, and it still is reserved to be disposed of when, if ever, it properly shall be presented for our consideration.\n We hold that the exaction of the tax here assailed was not within the power of the state under the Fourteenth Amendment; and, accordingly, the judgment below must be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Judgment reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE (dissenting).\n Recognizing that responsibility must rest primarily on those who undertake to blaze a new path in the law, to say how far it shall go, and notwithstanding the decisions of this court in Safe Deposit & Trust Co. v. Virginia, \n280 \nU.S. 83\n, 50 S. Ct. 59, 67 A. L. R. 386; Farmers Loan & Trust Co. v. State of Minnesota, \n280 \nU.S. 204\n, 50 S. Ct. 98, 65 A. L. R. 1000; Baldwin v. Missouri, \n281 \nU.S. 586\n, 50 S. Ct. 436, 72 A. L. R. 1303; Beidler v. South Carolina Tax Commission, \n282 \nU.S. 1\n, 51 S. Ct. 54, I am not persuaded that either logic, expediency, or generalizations about the undesirability of double taxation justify our adding to the cases recently overruled, the long list of those which, without a dissenting voice, have supported taxation like the present. No decision of this court requires that result. See Baldwin v. Missouri, supra, 281 U. S. page 596, 50 S. Ct. 436, 72 A. L. R. 1303. \n\n[284 U.S. 312, 332]\n\u00a0\n Such want of logic as there may be in taxing the transfer of stock of a nonresident at the home of the corporation results from ascribing a situs to the shareholder's intangible interests which, because of their very want of physical characteristics, can have no situs, and again in saying that the rights, powers, and privileges incident to stock ownership and transfer which are actually enjoyed in two taxing jurisdictions, have situs in one and not in the other. Sutus of an intangible, for taxing purposes, as the decisions of this court, including the present one, abundantly demonstrate, is not a dominating reality, but a convenient fiction which may be judicially employed or discarded, according to the result desired.\n The decedent, if we disregard the fiction and its attendant maxims, acquired rights and privileges with respect to a corporation created by Maine and under its control. The nature and extent of his interest are defined by the laws of Maine, and his power to secure the complete transfer of it is dependent upon them. These characteristics of corporate shares, distinguishing them in several respects from unsecured obligations to pay money, have long been explicitly recognized by this court as the source of state power to tax nonresident stockholders, and as sufficient ground for its exercise. See Frick v. Pennsylvania, \n268 \nU.S. 473, 497\n, 45 S. Ct. 603, 607, 42 A. L. R. 316; Baker v. Baker, Eccles & Co., \n242 \nU.S. 394, 401\n, 37 S. Ct. 152; Hawley v. Malden, \n232 \nU.S. 1, 12\n, 34 S. Ct. 201, Ann. Cas. 1916C, 842; Rhode Island Hospital Trust Co. v. Doughton, \n270 \nU.S. 69, 81\n, 46 S. Ct. 256, 43 A. L. R. 1374. See, also, Corry v. Baltimore, \n196 \nU.S. 466\n, 25 S. Ct. 297. Compare Citizens' National Bank v. Durr, \n257 \nU.S. 99\n, 42 S. Ct. 15; Cream of Wheat Co. v. County of Grand Forks, \n253 \nU.S. 325\n, 40 S. Ct. 558. This court has recently said, in Frick v. Pennsylvania, supra: 'The decedent owned many stocks in corporations of states, other than Pennsylvania, which subjected their transfer on death to a tax and prescribed means of enforcement which practically gave those states the status \n\n[284 U.S. 312, 333]\n\u00a0\n of lienors in possession. As those states had created the corporations issuing the stocks, they had power to impose the tax and to enforce it by such means, irrespective of the decedent's domicile, and the actual situs of the stock certificates. Pennsylvania's jurisdiction over the stocks necessarily was subordinate to that power. Therefore to bring them into the administration in that state it was essential that the tax be paid . ... We think it plain that such value as the stocks had in excess of the tax is all that could be regarded as within the range of Pennsylvania's taxing power.'\n The withdrawal from appellee of authority to impose the present tax, in terms which would sweep away all power to impose any form of tax with respect to the shares of a domestic corporation if owned by nonresidents, would seem to be a far greater departure from sound and accepted principles, and one having far more serious consequences, than would the disregard of wholly artificial notions of the situs of intangibles.\n The present tax is not double in the sense that it is added to that imposed by Massachusetts, since the Maine statute directs that the latter be deducted from the former. But, as the stockholder could secure complete protection and effect a complete transfer of his interest only by invoking the laws of both states, I am aware of no principle of constitutional interpretation which would enable us to say that taxation by both states, reaching the same economic interest with respect to which he was sought and secured the benefits of the laws of both, is so arbitrary or oppressive as to merit condemnation as a denial of due process of law. Only by recourse to a form of words, saying that there is no taxable subject within the state, by reason of the fictitious attribution to the intangible interest of the stockholder of a location elsewhere, is it possible to stigmatize the tax as arbitrary. \n\n[284 U.S. 312, 334]\n\u00a0\n Affirmance of this judgment involves no declaration that the tax may be imposed by three or more states instead of two, and, under the decisions of this court, there is no ground for supposing that it could be. See Rhode Island Trust Co. v. Doughton, \n270 \nU.S. 69\n, 46 S. Ct. 256, 43 A. L. R. 1374. Even if it be assumed that some protection from multiple taxation, which the Constitution has failed to provide, is desirable, and that this court is free to supply it, that result would seem more likely to be attained, without injustice to the states, by familiar types of reciprocal state legislation, than by stretching the due proces clause to cover this case. See 28 Columbia L. Rev. 806; 43 Harvard L. Rev. 641. We can have no assurance that resort to the Fourteenth Amendment, as the ill-adapted instrument of such a reform, will not create more difficulties and injustices than it will remove. See 30 Columbia L. Rev. 405, 406.\n The present denial to Maine of power to tax transfers of shares of a nonresident stockholder in its own corporation, in the face of the now accepted doctrine that a transfer of his chattels located there and equally under its control, Frick v. Pennsylvania, supra, and that his rights as cestui que trust in a trust of property within the state, Safe Deposit & Trust Co. v. Virginia, supra, may be taxed there and not elsewhere, makes no such harmonious addition to a logical pattern of state taxing power as would warrant overturning an established system of taxation. The capital objection to it is that the due process clause is made the basis for withholding from a state the power to tax interests subject to its control and benefited by its laws; such control and benefit are together the ultimate and indubitable justification of all taxation.\n I think the judgment should be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS concur in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 1, chap. 69, rev. St. Maine, 1916, provides:\n'All property within the jurisdiction of this state, and any interest therein, whether belonging to inhabitants of this state or not, and whether tangible or intangible, which shall pass by will, by the intestate laws of this state, ... shall be subject to an inheritance tax for the use of the state as hereinafter provided. ...'\n\n Section 25 of the same chapter in substance provides that, in case of transfers of stock owned by a nonresident decedent in a Maine corporation, the tax shall be paid to the Attorney General at the time of the transfer.\n Section 37, chap. 51, Rev.

The tax was challenged upon the ground that copyrights are instrumentalities of the United States. On demurrer, the suit was dismissed, and the Supreme Court of the state, the justices being equally divided in opinion, affirmed the judgment. 172 Ga. 403, 157 S. E. 664. The case comes here on appeal.\n The Gross Receipts Tax Act (Georgia Laws 1929, p. 103) describes the tax as laid 'upon the privilege of engaging in certain occupations' and 'upon certain business and commercial transactions and enterprises.' As the tax is measured by gross receipts, the case is not ruled by Educational Films Corporation v. Ward, \n282 \nU.S. 379\n, 51 S. Ct. 170, where the tax was based upon the net income of the corporation. Appellant insists, and we think rightly, that the operation of the statute here in question, in its application to gross receipts, is to impose a direct charge upon the royalties. Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company v. Wisconsin, \n275 \nU.S. 136, 141\n, 48 S. Ct. 55. See, also, Crew Levick Company v. Pennsylvania, \n245 \nU.S. 292, 297\n, 38 S.

Article 1,  8, par. 8. The production to which the protection of copyright may be accorded is the property of the author and not of the United States. But the copyright is the creature of the federal statute passed in the exercise of the power vested in the Congress.

In creating this right, the Congress did not reserve to the United States any interest in the production itself, or in the copyright, or in the profits that may be derived from its use. Nor did the Congress provide that the right, or the gains from its exercise, should be free of tax. The owner of the copyright, if he pleases, may refrain from vending or licensing and content himself with simply exercising the right to exclude others from using his property. Compare Continental Paper Bag Co. v. Eastern Paper Bag Co., \n210 \nU.S. 405, 422\n, 424 S., 28 S. Ct. 748. The sole interest of the United States and the primary object in conferring the monopoly lie in the general benefits derived by the public from the labors of authors. A copyright, like a patent, is 'at once the equivalent given by the public for benefits bestowed by the genius and meditations and skill of individuals, and the incentive to \n\n[286 U.S. 123, 128]\n\u00a0\n further efforts for the same important objects.' Kendall v. Winsor, 21 How. 327, 328; Grant v. Raymond, 6 Pet. 218, 241, 242.\n The principle of the immunity from state taxation of instrumentalities of the federal government, and of the corresponding immunity of state instrumentalities from federal taxation-essential to the maintenance of our dual system-has its inherent limitations. It is aimed at the protection of the operations of government (McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 436), and the immunity does not extend 'to anything lying outside or beyond governmental functions and their exertion.' (Indian Motocycle Co. v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 570, 576\n, 579 S., 51 S. Ct. 601, 603). Where the immunity exists, it is absolute, resting upon an 'entire absence of power' (Johnson v. Maryland, \n254 \nU.S. 51, 55\n, 56 S., 41 S. Ct. 16), but it does not exist 'where no direct burden is laid upon the governmental instrumentality, and there is only a remote, if any, influence upon the exercise of the functions of government' (Willcuts v. Bunn, \n282 \nU.S. 216, 225\n, 51 S. Ct. 125, 127).\n In this instance, the mere fact that a copyright is property derived from a grant by the United States is insufficient to support the claim of exemption. Nor does the fact that the grant is made in furtherance of a governmental policy of the United States, and because of the benefits which are deemed to accrue to the public in the execution of that policy, furnish ground for immunity. The disposition by the government of public lands, in order to advance the general interest by promoting settlement, illustrates the principle and its limitation. The property of the United States is not subject to state taxation (Van Brocklin v. Tennessee, \n117 \nU.S. 151\n, 6 S. Ct. 670), but the property of individual owners, although derived from the United States under its public land laws, may be taxed. The power to tax exists as soon as the ownership is changed. Witherspoon v. Duncan, 4 Wall. 210, 219. \n\n[286 U.S. 123, 129]\n\u00a0\n Though the legal title remains in the government, if the proceedings have reached the point where nothing more remains to be done by the entryman, and the government no longer has any beneficial interest in the land and does not exclude the entryman from the use of it, he is regarded as the beneficial owner and the land as subject to taxation. Bothwell v. Bingham County, \n237 \nU.S. 642, 647\n, 35 S. Ct. 702.1\n Again, the possessory right of a qualified locator after discovery of minerals is a property right in the full sense, unaffected by the fact that the paramount title to the land is in the United States, and such interest from early times has been held to be vendible, inheritable, and taxable. Forbes v. Gracey, \n94 \nU.S. 762, 766\n, 767 S.; Elder v. Wood, \n208 \nU.S. 226, 232\n, 28 S. Ct. 263; Union Oil Company v. Smith, \n249 \nU.S. 337, 349\n, 39 S. Ct. 308; Irwin v. Wright, \n258 \nU.S. 219, 231\n, 42 S. Ct. 293.2 It is thus apparent that the mere fact that a property right is created by statute to fulfill a governmental purpose does not make it nontaxable when it is held in private ownership and exercised for private advantage. See Susquehanna Power Co. v. State Tax Commission (No. 1), \n283 \nU.S. 291, 297\n, 51 S. Ct. 434\n\n\n\n\n[286 U.S. 123, 130]\n\u00a0\n We are of the opinion that no controlling distinction can be based, in the case of copyrights, upon the character of the right granted. The argument that it is in the nature of a franchise or privilege bestowed by the government is met by the fact that it is not a franchise or privilege to be exercised on behalf of the government or in performing a function of the government. The 'mining claim' above mentioned, or the possessory right to explore and work a mine under the applicable federal laws and regulations, may also be regarded as a franchise or privilege, but the Court found the right to be noen the less taxable, observing in Forbes v. Gracey, supra, that 'Those claims are the subject of bargain and sale, and constitute very largely the wealth of the Pacific coast States.' Copyright is a right exercised by the owner during the term at his pleasure and exclusively for his own profit and forms the basis for extensive and profitable business enterprises. The advantage to the public is gained merely from the carrying out of the general policy in making such grants and not from any direct interest which the government has in the use of the property which is the subject of the grants. After the copyright has been granted, the government has no interest in any action under it save the general one that its laws shall be obeyed. Operations of the owner in multiplying copies, in sales, in performances or exhibitions, or in licensing others for such purposes, are manifestly not the operations of the government. A tax upon the gains derived from such operations is not a tax upon the exertion of any governmental function.\n In Gillespie v. Oklahoma, \n257 \nU.S. 501\n, 42 S. Ct. 171, the question concerned income derived from leases of restricted Indian lands. The leases were deemed to be instrumentalities of the United States in carrying out its duties to the Indians, and the Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Holmes, concluded that the tax imposed by Oklahoma was 'a direct \n\n[286 U.S. 123, 131]\n\u00a0\n hamper upon the effort of the United States to make the best terms that it can for its wards.' Id., page 506 of 257 U. S., 42 S. ct. 171, 173. A similar result was reached in the recent ruling in relation to what was deemed to be the correlative case of leases by Oklahoma of lands held by the state for the support of its schools. Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Company, \n285 \nU.S. 393\n, 52 S. Ct. 443, 76 L. Ed. -, decided April 11, 1932. These decisions are not controlling here. The nature and purpose of copyrights place them in a distinct category, and we are unable to find any basis for the supposition that a nondiscriminatory tax on royalties hampers in the slightest degree the execution of the policy of the copyright statute.\n We agree, however, with the contention that in this aspect royalties from copyrights stand in the same position as royalties from the use of patent rights, and what we have said as to the purposes of the government in relation to copyrights applies as well, mutatis mutandis, to patents which are granted under the same constitutional authority to promote the progress of science and useful arts. The affirmance of the judgment in the instant case cannot be reconciled with the decision in Long v. Rockwood, \n277 \nU.S. 142\n, 48 S. Ct. 463, upon which appellant relies, and, in view of the conclusions now reached upon a re-examination of the question, that case is definitely overruled.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See, also, Carroll v.

CO.(1932)\nNo. 411\nArgued: Decided: March 14, 1932\n\n\n\n\n[285 U.S. 127, 128]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George S. Wright and Alex F. Weisberg, both of Dallas, Tex., for petitioners.\n\n\n[285 U.S. 127, 130]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Fryer & Cunningham, of El Paso, Tex., for plaintiff American Grocery Co.\n Messrs. John P. Bullington, of Houston, Tex., and Roscoe H. Hupper, of New York City, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The American Grocery Company and others brought this action against the Mallory Steamship Company, the Galveston Wharf Company, and the Galveston, Harrisburg & San Antonio Railway Company to recover the value of a carload of sardines destroyed by fire at Galveston, Tex., while en route to El Paso in that state. The goods had been shipped from Maine to El Paso on a through bill of lading issued by the Seaport Navigation Company and describing the route as 'Mallory, Southern Pacific.' The Mallory Steamship Company had transported the goods from New York to Galveston, and at the time of the fire the goods were on the pier which that company had leased from the Galveston Wharf Company. The latter company, a chartered transportation company not named in the bill of lading, owned, in addition to certain piers, railroad trackage from these piers to connections with railroads running out of Galveston, including that of the Galveston, Harrisburg & San Antonio Railway Company; that being the Southern Pacific line described in the bill of lading as the delivering carrier. There was no attempt to prove negligence on the part of any of the defendants. The district court, a jury being waived, held that the goods had been delivered by the Mallory Steamship Company to \n\n[285 U.S. 127, 131]\n\u00a0\n the Galveston Wharf Company, that the latter was in possession of the goods as a common carrier, and that at the time of the loss they had not been delivered to the Galveston, Harrisburg & San Antonio Railway Company. The judgment, entered in the district court against the wharf company, was reversed by the Court of Civil Appeals, which directed judgment against the railway company upon the ground that the wharf company was acting as a transfer agent for the railway company, and was not liable for the loss. 13 S.W.(2d) 983. The Supreme Court of the state reversed the judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals and affirmed that of the district court. 25 S.W.( 2d) 588, 36 S.W.(2d) 985. This Court granted a writ of certiorari. \n284 \nU.S. 608\n, 52 S. Ct. 41, 76 L. Ed. -.\n The wharf company, petitioner, in the view that the question of the liability of carriers under an interstate bill of lading is governed by the federal decisions,1 contends that the state court erred in holding (1) that the possession of the shipment at the time of the fire had passed from the steamship company to the wharf company; (2) that the wharf company had possession as a connecting carrier and not as agent of the railroad carrier named in the bill of lading; and (3) that the wharf company was liable as insurer of the shipment when its filed tariff provided that it should not be liable save for its negligence. The American Grocery Company, plaintiff in the action (which joined in the Wharf Company's petition for certiorari), contends that it is entitled to recover 'from some one of the three defendants in the trial court,' and that it is the steamship company which should be held liable. The railway company, respondent, also urges that there had been no delivery of the goods by the steamship company, and further that, it \n\n[285 U.S. 127, 132]\n\u00a0\n such delivery had been made, the wharf company held the goods as common carrier and not as the railway company's agent, and that the tariff of the wharf company was inapplicable.\n First. The Court of Civil Appeals, while reversing the judgment of the district court, did not disturb the finding that the steamship company had delivered the goods to the wharf company, but on the contrary reaffirmed it. The Supreme Court held that this finding was supported by evidence, and reached its conclusion upon that basis. The petitioners insist that the three courts were in error, and that the finding is opposed to the undisputed evidence. We are unable to agree with this contention. The tracks of the wharf company were on the pier, and there the steamship company and the wharf company had adjoining offices. The wharf company had its own force of men on the pier to handle the shipments for rail transportation. It was the practice to have cars spotted conveniently to receive the shipments according to the routing. The steamship company placed the goods on the pier in convenient locations where the wharf company, which according to custom had already received the billing and had full information of the shipments, could load them into the waiting cars. \n2\n In the instant \n\n[285 U.S. 127, 133]\n\u00a0\n case, it appeared that the ship had arrived early in the morning (January 13, 1926) and had been fully discharged by 5:30 o'clock in the afternoon; that, as the goods were unloaded, they were put in the usual manner in suitable locations for the picking up and loading into cars by the wharf company; that, out of 1,081 tons so discharged on that day and put in the designated places, the wharf company had actually loaded into cars all but 379 tons, and that carloads similarly routed, and placed in approximately the same location as the shipment here involved, had been so loaded. There was evidence that the latter shipment had been suitably placed on the wharf befofe 4 o'clock in the afternoon, and was ready by that time for loading by the wharf company and completely at its disposal,3 but the wharf com- \n\n[285 U.S. 127, 134]\n\u00a0\n pany stopped work about 6:30 o'clock without loading it, and that it was burned that night. Questions are raised with respect to notice of readiness for loading and as to the checking of the shipment, but it cannot be said that the testimony is so clear and definite on these subjects as to preclude a finding of delivery to the wharf company. No receipt had been given by the wharf company, but the state court found, upon evidence, that the steamship company did not require the wharf company to give receipts before it removed shipments from the wharf, and that receipts were often given a considerable time after such removal. On points where the testimony permitted conflicting inferences, the state court was entitled to reach its conclusion that the shipment had been placed under the complete control of the wharf company, to be handled according to its own convenience, and hence should be deemed to have been delivered to the wharf company. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n Second. The wharf company did not dispute that it was a common carrier. As such, it had facilities and rendered service. It is also manifest that it received the goods for transportation to the connection with the railway company that was to take them to destination. This service of the wharf company was that of a common carrier furnishing a necessary link in the transportation under the through bill of lading. The wharf company was thus in fact and in law a connecting carrier, and that it was not named in the bill of lading is unimportant. The bill of lading, required to be issued by the \n\n[285 U.S. 127, 135]\n\u00a0\n initial carrier upon an interstate shipment, 'governs the entire transportation, and thus fixes the obligations of all participating carriers to the extent that the terms of the bill of lading are applicable and valid.' Georgia, Florida, & Alabama Railway Co. v. Blish Milling Co., \n241 \nU.S. 190, 194\n, 195 S., 36 S. Ct. 541, 543. See, also, Kansas Southern Railway Co. v. Carl, \n227 \nU.S. 639, 648\n, 33 S. Ct. 391; Great Northern Railway Co. v. Galbreath Cattle Co., \n271 \nU.S. 99, 102\n, 46 S. Ct. 439. Under such a bill of lading, each connecting carrier may be sued for damages occurring while the goods are in its possession, and its liability 'is fixed by the applicable valid terms of the original bill.' It may not vary the terms of the through bill. Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway Co. v. Ward, \n244 \nU.S. 383, 387\n, 37 S. Ct. 617; Texas & Pacific Railway Co. v. Leatherwood, \n250 \nU.S. 478, 480\n, 39 S. Ct. 517; Cobb v. Brown (C. C. A.) 193 F. 958. In this instance, the bill of lading provided that the carrier in possession of the property described 'shall be liable as at common law for any loss thereof or damage thereto, except as hereinafter provided.' The wharf company became subject to this liability, and did not bring itself within any of the exceptions stated in the bill.\n The wharf company was not entitled to escape this liability upon the ground that it was acting as the agent of the railway company. The case of Missouri Pacific Railroad Co. v. Reynolds-Davis Grocery Co., \n268 \nU.S. 366\n, 45 S. Ct. 516, upon which the petitioners rely, is not in point. There, the Missouri Pacific, the delivering carrier named in the bill of lading, had employed the St. Louis-San Francisco to perform a switching service in making the required delivery at the place of destination. The court held that the Missouri Pacific was the delivering carrier and was liable as such; it could not defeat that liability by the employment of an agent for service at the terminal. In the present case, the wharf company was the connecting carrier in possession of the goods at the time of the loss, and was responsible accordingly.\n\n\n[285 U.S. 127, 136]\n\u00a0\n Third. Equally unavailing is the wharf company's defense, based upon the provision of its filed tariff, that it should be liable only for negligence. The respondent, the railway company, insists that this limitation was by its terms applicable only in connection with the rate for the handling of traffic after it had been loaded into cars, and that another rate without such limitation related to the service in loading the goods from the wharf into the cars. Apart from this contention, which is not without force, it is sufficient to say that the attempted limitation of liability in any event did not affect the plaintiffs who were entitled to the transportation of the goods under the conditions set forth in the through bill of lading pursuant to which the wharf company was performing its service. As we have said, the wharf company was not entitled to vary the liability, as determined by the terms of the through bill, by its arrangements with the railway company.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Southern Railway Co. v.

Ct. 516. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The testimony of the general manager of the wharf company contains the following:\n'It is our privilege to begin loading as soon as it is put on the wharf, unless a hold order is put on some specific shipment, which happens only occasionally. So that as soon as freights were deposited on the wharf by the forces of the Mallory, there was nothing to prevent our forces from immediately picking it up and trucking it to the cars. That was all left to the judgment and discretion of the Galveston Wharf Company's supervisor of forces on the docks. It was not a matter within the control of the Mallory Line. ... As the freights were placed on the wharf by the Mallory Line, it was purely a matter of the Wharf Company to determine just how and when to load the particular shipment in the usual manner . ... It is the Mallory Line's usual performance to deposit it on the floor, and it is picked up and loaded into the cars by the Galveston Wharf Company. As to the particular time it is picked up, that is wholly in control of the Wharf Company. After it had been placed, and it was O. K.'d to go, we were at liberty to pick it up and send it forward at any time we got ready, and it was not necessary for us to ask permission of the Mallory Line about it. Unless there is some special feature connected with it, as a hold order, the usual course is to load it and get rid of it. So far as the actual physical handling of the shipment from the time it is put, and assuming that it is ready to go, that is under the control of the Wharf Company.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] There was testimony by the chief dock clerk of the steamship company as follows:\n'After we placed the shipment in the designated territory, that is all we have to do with it. If we have broken cases, we set them aside, and the Mallory Line coopers come along and put them into condition, and we are through with it, and it is ready for the Wharf Company to load out . ... Some of these packages were broken, not a large amount. They were put into condition that day. I would say that this particular carload of sardines was ready to be put on the cars before 4:00 o'clock. After that time we had nothing to do with it. The Mallory Line was through with it. As to whether any of the representatives of the Wharf Company or raiload company had examined this shipment, I say they had. When the damaged cases were recoopered, they put the O. K. mark on them after we recoopered them.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] See Pratt v. Railway Company, \n95 U.S. 43\n, 46; Merriam v. Hartford & New Haven Railroad Co., 20 Conn, 354, 52 Am.

Gen., for the United States. \n\n[287 U.S. 112, 115]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case is here on certiorari, \n286 \nU.S. 539\n, 52 S.Ct. 648, to review a judgment of conviction for conspiracy to violate the Mann Act (36 Stat. 825, 18 U.S.C.  397 et seq. (18 USCA  397 et seq.)). Petitioners, a man and a woman, not then husband and \n\n[287 U.S. 112, 116]\n\u00a0\n wife, were indicted in the District Court for Northern Illinois, for conspiring together, and with others not named, to transport the woman from one state to another for the purpose of engaging in sexual intercourse with the man. At the trial without a jury there was evidence from which the court could have found that the petitioners had engaged in illicit sexual relations in the course of each of the journeys alleged; that the man purchased the railway tickets for both petitioners for at least one journey; and that in each instance the woman, in advance of the purchase of the tickets, consented to go on the journey and did go on it voluntarily for the specified immoral purpose. There was no evidence supporting the allegation that any other person had conspired. The trial court overruled motions for a finding for the defendants, and in arrest of judgment, and gave judgment of conviction, which the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed, 57 F. (2d) 617, on the authority of United States v. Holte, \n236 \nU.S. 140\n, 35 S.Ct. 271, L.R.A. 1915D, 281.\n The only question which we need consider here is whether, within the principles announced in that case, the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction. There the defendants, a man and a woman, were indicted for conspiring together that the man should transport the woman from one state to another for purposes of prostitution. In holding the indictment sufficient, the court said (page 144 of 236 U.S., 35 S.Ct. 271, 272): 'As the defendant is the woman, the district court sustained a demurrer on the ground that although the offense could not be committed without her, she was no party to it, but only the victim. The single question is whether that ruling is right. We do not have to consider what would be necessary to constitute the substantive crime under the act of 1910 (the Mann Act), or what evidence would be required to convict a woman under an indictment like \n\n[287 U.S. 112, 117]\n\u00a0\n this; but only to decide whether it is impossible for the transported woman to be guilty of a crime in conspiring as alleged.' The court assumed that there might be a degree of co-operation which would fall short of the commission of any crime, as in the case of the purchaser of liquor illegally sold. But it declined to hold that a woman could not under some circumstances not precisely defined, be guilty of a violation of the Mann Act and of a conspiracy to violate it as well. Light is thrown upon the intended scope of this conclusion by the supposititious case which the court put (page 145 of 236 U.S., 35 S.Ct. 271, 272): 'Suppose, for instance, that a professional prostitute, as well able to look out for herself as was the man, should suggest and carry out a journey within the act of 1910 in the hope of black-mailing the man, and should buy the railroad tickets, or should pay the fare from Jersey City to New York,-she would be within the letter of the act of 1910 and we see no reason why the act should not be held to apply. We see equally little reason for not treating the preliminary agreement as a conspiracy that the law can reach, if we abandon the illusion that the woman always is the victim.'\n In the present case we must apply the law to the evidence; the very inquiry which was said to be unnecessary to decision in United States v. Holte, supra.\n First. Those exceptional circumstances envisaged in United States v. Holte, supra, as possible instances in which the woman might violate the act itself, are clearly not present here. There is no evidence that she purchased the railroad tickets or that hers was the active or moving spirit in conceiving or carrying out the transportation. The proof shows no more than that she went willingly upon the journeys for the purposes alleged. \n\n[287 U.S. 112, 118]\n\u00a0\n Section 2 of the Mann Act1 (18 U.S.C.  398 (18 USCA  398)), violation of which is charged by the indictment here as the object of the conspiracy, imposes the penalty upon 'any person who shall knowingly transport or cause to be transported, or aid or assist in obtaining transportation for, or in transporting, in interstate or foreign commerce ... any woman or girl for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose. ...' Transportation of a woman or girl whether with or without her consent, or causing or aiding it, or furthering it in any of the specified ways, are the acts punished, when done with a purpose which is immoral within the meaning of the law. See Hoke v. United States, \n227 \nU.S. 308, 320\n, 33 S.Ct. 281, 43 L. R.A.(N.S.) 906, Ann. Cas. 1913E, 905.\n The act does not punish the woman for transporting herself; it contemplates two persons-one to transport and \n\n[287 U.S. 112, 119]\n\u00a0\n the woman or girl to be transported. For the woman to fall within the ban of the statute she must, at the least, 'aid or assist' some one else in transporting or in procuring transportation for herself. But such aid and assistance must, as in the case supposed in United States v. Holte, supra, \n236 \nU.S. 145\n, 35 S.Ct. 271, L.R.A. 1915D, 281, be more active than mere agreement on her part to the transportation and its immoral purpose. For the statute is drawn to include those cases in which the woman consents to her own transportation. Yet it does not specifically impose any penalty upon her, although it deals in detail with the person by whom she is transported. In applying this criminal statute we cannot infer that the mere acquiescence of the woman transported was intended to be condemned by the general language punishing those who aid and assist the transporter,2 any more than it has been inferred that the purchaser of liquor was to be regarded as an abettor of the illegal sale. State v. Teahan, 50 Conn. 92; Lott v. United States (C.C.A.) 205 F. 28, 46 L.R.A.(N. S.) 409; cf. United States v. Farrar, \n281 \nU.S. 624, 634\n, 50 S.Ct. 425, 68 A.L.R. 892. The penalties of the statute are too clearly directed against the acts of the transporter as distinguished from the consent of the subject of the transportation. So it was intimated in United States v. Holte, supra, and this conclusion is not disputed by the government here, which contends only that the conspiracy charge will lie though the woman could not commit the substantive offense.\n Second. We come thus to the main question in the case, whether, admitting that the woman by consenting, has \n\n[287 U.S. 112, 120]\n\u00a0\n not violated the Mann Act, she may be convicted of a conspiracy with the man to violate it. Section 37 of the Criminal Code (18 U.S.C.  88 (18 USCA  88)), punishes a conspiracy by two or more persons 'to commit any offense against the United States.' The offense which she is charged with conspiring to commit is that perpetrated by the man, for it is not questioned that in transporting her he contravened section 2 of the Mann Act. Cf. Caminetti v. United States, \n242 \nU.S. 470\n, 37 S.Ct. 192, L.R.A. 1917F, 502, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 1168. Hence we must decide whether her concurrence, which was not criminal before the Mann Act, nor punished by it, may, without more, support a conviction under the conspiracy section, enacted many years before. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n As was said in the Holte Case (page 144 of 236 U.S., 35 S.Ct. 271, 272), an agreement to commit an offense may be criminal, though its purpose is to do what some of the conspirators may be free to do alone. \n4\n Incapacity of one to commit the substantive offense does not necessarily imply that he may with impunity conspire with others who are able to commit it. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n[287 U.S. 112, 121]\n\u00a0\n For it is the collective planning of criminal conduct at which the statute aims. The plan is itself a wrong which, if any act be done to effect its object, the state has elected to treat as criminal. Clune v. United States, \n159 \nU.S. 590, 595\n, 16 S.Ct. 125. And one may plan that others shall do what he cannot do himself. See United States v. Rabinowich, \n238 \nU.S. 78, 86\n, 87 S., 35 S.Ct. 682\n\n\n But in this case we are concerned with something more than an agreement between two persons for one of them to commit an offense which the other cannot commit. There is the added element that the offense planned, the criminal object of the conspiracy, involves the agreement of the woman to her transportation by the man, which is the very conspiracy charged.\n Congress set out in the Mann Act to deal with cases which frequently, if not normally, involve consent and agreement on the part of the woman to the forbidden transportation. In every case in which she is not intimidated or forced into the transportation, the statute necessarily contemplates her acquiescence. Yet this acquiescence, though an incident of a type of transportation specifically dealt with by the statute, was not made a crime under the Mann Act itself. Of this class of cases we say that the substantive offense contemplated by the statute itself involves the same combination or community of purpose of two persons only which is prosecuted here as conspiracy. If this were the only case covered by the act, it would be within those decisions which hold, consistently \n\n[287 U.S. 112, 122]\n\u00a0\n with the theory upon which conspiracies are punished, that where it is impossible under any circumstances to commit the substantive offense without co-operative action, the preliminary agreement between the same parties to commit the offense is not an indictable conspiracy either at common law. Shannon and Nugent v. Commonwealth, 14 Pa. 226; Miles v. State, 58 Ala. 390; cf. State v. Law, 189 Iowa, 910, 179 N.W. 145, 11 A.L.R. 194; see State ex rel. Durner v. Huegin, 110 Wis. 189, 243, 85 N.W. 1046, 62 L. R.A. 700, or under the federal statute. \n6\n See United States v. Katz, \n271 \nU.S. 354, 355\n, 46 S.Ct. 513; Norris v. United States (C.C.A.) 34 F.(2d) 839, 841, reversed on other grounds \n281 \nU.S. 619\n, 50 S.Ct. 424; United States v. Dietrich (C.C.) 126 F. 664, 667. But criminal transportation under the Mann Act may be effected without the woman's consent as in cases of intimidation or force (with which we are not now concerned). We assume, therefore, for present purposes, as was suggested in the Holte Case, supra, page 145 of 236 U.S., 35 S.Ct. 271, 272, that the decisions last mentioned do not in all strictness apply. \n7\n We do not rest \n\n[287 U.S. 112, 123]\n\u00a0\n our decision upon the theory of those cases, nor upon the related one that the attempt is to prosecute as conspiracy acts identical with the substantive offense. United States v. Dietrich (C.C.) 126 F. 664. We place it rather upon the ground that we perceive in the failure of the Mann Act to condemn the woman's participation in those transportations which are effected with her mere consent, evidence of an affirmative legislative policy to leave her acquiescence unpunished. We think it a necessary implication of that policy that when the Mann Act and the conspiracy statute came to be construed together, as they necessarily would be, the same participation which the former contemplates an an inseparable incident of all cases in which the woman is a voluntary agent at all, but does not punish, was not automatically to be made punishable under the latter. It would contravene that policy to hold that the very passage of the Mann Act effected a withdrawal by the conspiracy statute of that immunity which the Mann Act itself confers.\n It is not to be supposed that the consent of an unmarried person to adultery with a married person, where the latter alone is guilty of the substantive offense, would render the former an abettor or a conspirator, compare In re Cooper, 162 Cal. 81, 85, 121 P. 318, or that the acquiescence of a woman under the age of consent would make her a co- conspirator with the man to commit statutory rape upon herself. Compare Queen v. Tyrrell, (1894) 1 Q.B. 710. The principle, determinative of this case, is the same.\n On the evidence before us the woman petitioner has not violated the Mann Act and, we hold, is not guilty of a conspiracy to do so. As there is no proof that the man conspired with anyone else to bring about the transportation, the convictions of both petitioners must be\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO concurs in the result. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Any person who shall knowingly transport or cause to be transported, or aid or assist in obtaining transportation for, or in transporting, in interstate or foreign commerce, or in any Territory or in the District of Columbia, any woman or girl for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose, or with the intent and purpose to induce, entice, or compel such woman or girl to become a prostitute or to give herself up to debauchery, or to engage in any other immoral practice; or who shall knowingly procure or obtain, or cause to be procured or obtained, or aid or assist in procuring or obtaining, any ticket or tickets, or any form of transportation or evidence of the right thereto, to be used by any woman or girl in interstate or foreign commerce, or in any Territory or the District of Columbia, in going to any place for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose, or with the intent or purpose on the part of such person to induce, entice, or compel her to give herself up to the practice of prostitution, or to give herself up to debauchery, or any other immoral practice, whereby any such woman or girl shall be transported in interstate or foreign commerce, or in any Territory or the District of Columbia, shall be deemed guilty of a felony, and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $5, 000, or by imprisonment of not more than five years, or by both such fine and imprisonment, in the discretion of the court.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section 3 of the act (18 U.S.C.  399 (18 USCA  399)), directed toward the persuasion, inducement, enticement, or coercion of the prohibited transportation, also includes specifically those who 'aid or assist' in the inducement or the transportation. Yet it is obvious that those words were not intended to reach the woman who, by yielding to persuasion, assists in her own transportation. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Section 30, Act of March 2, 1867 (14 Stat. 471, 484), 'except for an omitted not relevant provision, ... has continued from that time to this, in almost precisely its present form.' See United States v. Gradwell, \n243 \nU.S. 476, 481\n, 37 S.Ct. 407, 409. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] The requirement of the statute that the object of the conspiracy be an offense against the United States, necessarily statutory, United States v. Hudson, 7 Cranch, 32, avoids the question much litigated at common law (see cases cited in Wright, The Law of Criminal Conspiracies ( Carson Ed. 1887) and in Sayre, Criminal Conspiracy, 35 Harv.L.Rev. 393) of the criminality of combining to do an act which any one may lawfully do alone. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] So it has been held repeatedly that one not a bankrupt may be held guilty under section 37 of conspiring that a bankrupt shall conceal property from his trustee (Bankruptcy Act  29b, 11 U.S.C.  52(b), 11 USCA  52(b). Tapack v. United States (C.C.A.) 220 F. 445, certiorari denied \n238 \nU.S. 627\n, 35 S.Ct. 664; Jollit v. United States ( C.C.A.) 285 F. 209, certiorari denied \n261 \nU.S. 624\n, 43 S.Ct. 519; Israel v. United States (C.C.A.) 3 F.(2d) 743; Kaplan v.

These cases proceed upon the theory (see United States v. Rabinowich, supra, \n238 \nU.S. 86\n, 35 S.Ct. 682, 684) that only a bankrupt may commit the substantive offense though we do not intimate that others might not be held as principals under Criminal Code,  332 (18 U.S.C.  550 (18 USCA  550)). Cf. Barron v. United States (C.C.A.) 5 F.(2d) 799.\n In like manner Chadwick v. United States (C.C.A.) 141 F. 225, sustained the conviction of one not an officer of a national bank for conspiring with an officer to commit a crime which only he could commit. And see United States v. Martin, Fed. Cas. No. 15,728, 4 Cliff. 156; United States v. Stevens (D.C.) 44 F. 132. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The rule was applied in United States v. New York Cent. & H.R.R. Co . (C.C.) 146 F. 298; United States v. Sager (C.C.A.) 49 F.(2d) 725. In the following cases it was recognized and held inapplicable for the reason that the substantive crime could be committed by a single individual: Chadwick v. United States (C.C.A.) 141 F. 225; Laughter v. United States ( C.C.A.) 259 F. 94; Lisansky v. United States (C.C.A.) 31 F.(2d) 846, 67 A. L.R. 67, certiorari denied \n279 \nU.S. 873\n, 49 S.Ct. 514. The conspiracy was also deemed criminal where it contemplated the co-operation of a greater number of parties than were necessary to the commission of the principal offense, as in Thomas v. United States (C.C.A.) 156 F. 897, 17 L.R.A.(N.S.) 720; McKnight v. United States (C.C.A.) 252 F. 687. Cf. Vannata v. United States (C.C.A.) 289 F. 424; Ex parte O'Leary (C.C.A.) 53 F.(2d) 956. Compare Queen v. Whitchurch, 24 Q.B.D. 420. \n[\nFootnote 7\n] It should be noted that there are many cases not constituting 'a serious and substantially continued group scheme for co-operative law breaking' which may well fall within the recommendation of the 1925 conference of senior circuit judges that the conspiracy indictment be adopted 'only after a careful conclusion that the public interest so requires.'

MARVEL RARE METALS CO.(1932)\nNo. 57\nArgued: November 17, 1932Decided: December 12, 1932\n\n\n\n Messrs. Lawrence Bristol and Charles Neave, both of New York City, for petitioners.\n Messrs. William C. McCoy and Harold Elno Smith, both of Cleveland, Ohio, for respondents. \n\n[287 U.S. 430, 431]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioners, New York corporations having their principal offices in that state, brought this suit in the northern district of Ohio against defendants, two corporations having regular and established places of business in that district and two individuals residing there. The complaint alleges that the defendants infringed plaintiffs' rights under certain patents relating to the manufacture of hard-metal products by making, using, and selling tools and parts thereof embodying such inventions. The answer avers that the patents are invalid and denies infringement alleging that all manufacture by defendants has been under one or more of five patents granted defendant Gebauer. And the answer sets up a counterclaim against plaintiffs for the infringement of one of these patents and prays injunction against such infringement and an accounting. But it does not allege that plaintiffs are inhabitants of the district or that they infringed defendants' patent and have a regular and established place of business there. The plaintiffs moved to dismiss the counterclaim for want of jurisdiction. The District Court granted their motion. Defendants appealed. Plaintiffs moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the dismissal of the counterclaim does not amount to the refusal of an injunction under section 129, Judicial Code (28 USCA  227), and was not appealable under that section. The Circuit Court of Appeals denied the motion and reversed the order appealed from. 56 F.(2d) 823.\n Plaintiffs insist that the court erred in refusing to dismiss the appeal. Equity Rule 30 (28 USCA  723) declares: 'The defendant by his answer shall set out ... his defense to each claim asserted in the bill . ... The answer must state in short and simple form and counterclaim arising out of the transaction which is the subject-matter of the suit, and \n\n[287 U.S. 430, 432]\n\u00a0\n may, without cross-bill, set up any set-off or counterclaim against the plaintiff which might be the subject of an independent suit in equity against him, and such set-off or counterclaim, so set up, shall have the same effect as a cross-suit, so as to enable the court to pronounce a final decree in the same suit on both the original and the cross-claims.' \n268 U.S. 709\n. It is clear that in this suit the court in a single decree may finally determine the merits of the cause of action alleged in the complaint and the counterclaim set up in the answer. The order dismissing the counterclaim is interlocutory. Winters v. Ethell, \n132 \nU.S. 207, 210\n, 10 S.Ct. 56; In re South & N.A. Railroad Co., \n95 U.S. 221\n, 225; Ayres v. Carver, 17 How. 591, 595. The general rule is that review of interlocutory orders must await appeal from the final decree. But in proceedings for injunctions and receivers exceptions have been made by section 129, Judicial Code:\n'Where, upon a hearing in a district court, or by a judge thereof in vacation, an injunction is granted, continued, modified, refused, or dissolved by an interlocutory order or decree, or an application to dissolve or modify an injunction is refused, or an interlocutory order or decree is made appointing a receiver, or refusing an order to wind up a pending receivership or to take the appropriate steps to accomplish the purposes thereof, such as directing a sale or other disposal of property held thereunder, an appeal may be taken from such interlocutory order or decree to the circuit court of appeals. ... The appeal ... must be applied for within thirty days from the entry of such order or decree, and shall take precedence in the appellate court; and the proceedings in other respects in the district court shall not be stayed during the pendency of such appeal unless otherwise ordered by the court, or the appellate court, or a judge thereof. ...' 28 U.S.C.  227 (28 USCA  227). \n\n[287 U.S. 430, 433]\n\u00a0\n The reasons suggested by plaintiffs in support of the contention that the order is not appealable are that there was no hearing upon any application for an injunction and that the dismissal of the counterclaim was not the refusal of an injunction. But by their motion to dismiss, plaintiffs themselves brought on for hearing the very question that, among others, would have been presented to the court upon formal application for an interlocutory injunction. That is, whether the allegations of the answer are sufficient to constitute a cause of action for injunction. And the court necessarily decided that upon the facts alleged in the counterclaim defendants were not entitled to an injunction. It cannot be said, indeed plaintiffs do not claim, that the dismissal did not deny to defendants the protection of the injunction prayed in their answer. The ruling of the Circuit Court of Appeals that an injunction has been denied by an interlocutory order which is reviewable under section 129 is sustained by reason and supported by the weight of judicial opinion. Emery v. Central Trust & Safe Deposit Co. (C.C.A.) 204 F. 965, 968; Ward Baking Co. v. Weber Bros. (C.C.A.) 230 F. 142. Historical Pub. Co. v. Jones Bros. Pub. Co. (C.C.A.) 231 F. 638, 643. Naivette v. Philad Co. (C.C.A.) 54 F.( 2d) 623. Cf. Banco Mercantil v. Taggart Coal Co. (C.C.A.) 276 F. 388, 390. 1 Plaintiffs' motion to dismiss the appeal was rightly denied.\n\n Plaintiffs maintain that the Circuit Court of Appeals erred in sustaining the counterclaim.\n They call attention to Equity Rule 30 and cite section 48 of the Judicial Code: 'In suits brought for the infringement of letters patent the district courts ... shall have jurisdiction, in law or in equity, in the district of which the defendant is an inhabitant, or in any district in which \n\n[287 U.S. 430, 434]\n\u00a0\n the defendant ... shall have committed acts of infringement and have a regular and established place of business. ...' 28 U.S.C.  109 (28 USCA  109). They argue that a counterclaim for patent infringement cannot be maintained over plaintiffs' objection if it does not contain allegations showing that plaintiffs are inhabitants of or committed acts of infringement and have a regular place of business within the district in which they commenced their suit. And they insist that to construe the rule more broadly would make it repugnant to the statute.\n Rule 30 is without force as against conflicting statutory provisions. Washington-Southern Co. v. Baltimore Co., \n263 \nU.S. 629\n, 44 S.Ct. 220. It deals with counterclaims of two classes. The first includes every counterclaim arising out of the transaction which is the subject matter of the suit and which must be set up in the answer. The second class includes counterclaims not so arising but which might be the subject of an independent suit in equity and which may but need not be so set up. Amer. Mills Co. v. Amer. Surety Co., \n260 \nU.S. 360, 364\n, 43 S.Ct. 149. We may assume that the counterclaim in question does not arise out of the subject matter of plaintiffs' suit. But, unless section 48 prevents, it may be set up in the answer. Marconi Wireless Telegraph Co. v. National E.S. Co. (D.C.) 206 F. 295; Electric Boat Co. v. Lake Torpedo Boat Co. (D.C.) 215 F. 377; United States Expansion Bolt Co. v. Kroncke Co . (D.C.) 216 F. 186; Id. (C.C.A.) 234 F. 868; Buffalo Specialty Co. v. Vancleef (D.C.) 217 F. 91; Champion Spark Plug Co. v. Champion Ignition Co . (D.C.) 247 F. 200; Victor Talk. March. Co. v. Brunswick-Balke-Collender Co. (D.C.) 279 F. 758.\n Section 24(7) of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  41(7) is the source from which District Courts derive jurisdiction of cases arising under the patent laws. Under that clause and until the enactment of section 48 a suit for infringement might have been maintained in any district in which jurisdiction of defendant could be obtained. In re Hohorst, Petitioner, \n150 U.S. 653\n, \n\n[287 U.S. 430, 435]\n\u00a0\n 661, 14 S.Ct. 221. And see In re Keasbey & Mattison Co., Petitioner, \n160 U.S. 221\n-230, 16 S.Ct. 273. Section 48 relates to venue. It confers upon defendants in patent cases a privilege in respect of the places in which suits may be maintained against them. And that privilege may be waived. Lee v. Chesapeake & Ohio Ry., \n260 \nU.S. 653\n, 43 S.Ct. 230, Gulf Smokeless Coal Co. v. Sutton, Steele & Steele (C.C.A.) 35 F.(2d) 433, 438. The section does not, as to counterclaims, purport to modify the rule, prevailing prior to its enactment. The setting up of a counterclaim against one already in a court of his own choosing is very different, in respect to venue, from hailing him into that court. Section 48, taken according to the meaning ordinarily given to the words used, applies only to the latter, and we find no warrant for a construction that would make it include the former. This Court has recently declared that one who sues in a federal court of equity to enjoin the infringement of his patent, thereby submits himself to the jurisdiction of the court with respect to all the issues of the case, including those pertaining to a counterclaim praying that he be restrained from infringing a patent of the defendant.

The master of the vessel did not produce a manifest for the cargo when a manifest was demanded by the boarding officer. Thereafter a libel of information was filed by the government under sections 584 and 594 of the Tariff Act of 1922 (Act of Sept. 21, 1922, c. 356, 42 Stat. 858, 980, 982, 19 U. S.

The Circuit Court of Appeals advanced the view \n\n[286 U.S. 70, 73]\n\u00a0\n that the suit was not strictly one for the forfeiture of the vessel, but one for the enforcement of money penalties charged upon the vessel by reason of the misconduct of the master. 56 F.(2d) 590.

Three of the cars were seized at San Ysidro, California, and the fourth at Calexico, California. Each car was observed crossing the international boundary line from Mexico and traveling \n\n[286 U.S. 49, 54]\n\u00a0\n some distance thereafter in the United States, and in each instance the concealed liquor was discovered at an official stopping place of the United States Customs Service. The seizures were effected by Customs officers.\n\n'All four drivers of the cars were arrested. Each was charged with violations of the Tariff Act of 1930; namely unlawfully importing liquor into the United States, and knowingly concealing and facilitating the transportation of such liquor. Each indictment alleged failure to obtain a permit, failure to pay duties, and failure to make entry at the custom house. The four defendants entered pleas of guilty to the first count, which charged importation, and were sentenced by the court. In each case, the remaining count was dismissed.\n\n'A libel of information in rem was filed by the United States attorney against each automobile, claiming its forfeiture under the provisions of Sections 3061 and 3062 of the Revised Statutes (19 USCA 482 and 483). In three of the cases the General Motors Acceptance Corporation intervened as owner of the attached automobiles, and in the other case the vehicle was claimed by the Howard Automobile Company. All the interveners set up proof of ownership, averred that they were innocent of any illegal acts in which the vehicles may have been involved, and prayed the court to dismiss the libels, contending that the government's sold remedy was under Section 26, Title II, of the National Prohibition Act (27 USCA 40).\n\n'In each case, it was stipulated that the liquor alleged to have been found in the automobile was intoxicating in fact and fit for beverage purposes. It was further stipulated, subject to the objection by the libelant that such a purported defense was incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, that neither the seller nor the intervener had any notice of the illegal use, or intended illegal use, of the automobile.\n\n\n\n[286 U.S. 49, 55]\n\u00a0\n 'The government offered in evidence at the forfeiture proceedings the judgment roll, consisting of the indictment and sentence, in the criminal cases, at which, as stated above. pleas of guilty had been entered. The intervener in each case objected to the introduction of this judgment roll, on the ground that it was incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial; that no proper foundation had been laid; that the roll was not binding upon the intervener; and that it did not show that the intervener was a party to the criminal action or had notice of it. The objections were overruled and the records were admitted in evidence, to which the respective interveners duly excepted.\n'Testimony of customs officers showed that the four automobiles were driven across the international boundary some distance into the United States before being searched and seized.\n\n'The District Court entered decrees of forfeiture in all four cases, finding that each automobile was engaged in smuggling dutiable merchandise into the United States in violation of the customs laws thereof.\"\n\n The four interveners having appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, that court certified for answer by this court the following questions (Judicial Code,  239, 28 U. S. C.  346 (28 USCA  346)):\n'1. Does Section 26 of Title II of the National Prohibition Act repeal by implication and render inoperative in liquor importation and transportation cases the forfeiture provisions of the Customs Laws, in so far as offending vehicles are concerned? Or, putting the question in another form:\n\n'2. Do the mandatory provisions of Section 26 of the National Prohibition Act apply when the automobile has been seized while in the act of transporting intoxicating liquor across the border and some distance into the United States?\n\n\n\n[286 U.S. 49, 56]\n\u00a0\n\n'3. May the government, in such a case, ignore such mandatory provisions, arrest the driver, and elect to forfeit the automobile under the customs laws?\n\n'4. Is the record in the criminal case wherein the driver pleaded guilty of violating the customs laws (Tariff Act of 1930) admissible in the separate forfeiture proceedings wherein the intervener is the only party appearing, for the purpose of showing unlawful importation by the automobile, or for any other purpose?'\n\n The importation of intoxicating liquors without permit and without payment of customs duties is a violation of the Tariff Act and a criminal offense thereunder. This was the law under the Tariff Act of 1922, enacted after the adoption of the Eighteenth Amendment. Tariff Act of 1922, c. 356 ,  593(b), 42 Stat. 982, U. S. C. title 19,  497 (19 USCA  497). It is still the law under the present Tariff Act of 1930,  593, U. S. C. title 19,  1593 (19 USCA  1593). True, the drivers of the cars who brought these liquors from Mexico into California were subject to prosecution under the National Prohibition Act, title 2,  29, 27 U. S. Code,  46 (27 USCA  46). They were subject to prosecution under the Tariff Act also ( Callahan v. United States, \n285 \nU.S. 515\n, 52 S. Ct. 454, 76 L. Ed. -, April 11, 1932), and under that act they were indicted and convicted.\n The appellants would have us hold that prosecution of the offender may be based at the election of the government either on the one act or on the other, but that forfeiture of the implements used in his offending may be based on only one of them. The consequence of such a holding would be to withdraw from the tariff acts remedies and sanctions existing for the better part of a century. Forfeiture of vehicles bearing smuggled goods is one of the time-honored methods adopted by the government for the repression of the crime of smuggling. The provisions of the Revised Statutes, sections 3061 and 3062, which carried forward the provisions of earlier acts (Act of July 18, 1866, c. 201, 14 Stat. 178,  3), have in turn been \n\n[286 U.S. 49, 57]\n\u00a0\n carried forward into the United States Code. U. S. Code, title 19,  482, 483 (19 USCA  482, 483). By implication, if not in express terms, they were recognized as law in the Tariff Act of 1922, which declares it to be the duty of any customs agent who has made seizure of a vehicle for violation of the customs law to turn the vessel over to the collector of the district. Tariff Act of 1922, c. 356,  602, U. S. Code, title 19,  509 (19 USCA  509). They are recognized by like provisions in the Tariff Act of 1930. Act of 1930, c. 497,  602, U. S. Code, title 19,  1602 (19 USCA  1602). Indeed, the same implication persists in the Prohibition Law itself, or in Acts connected with it. By section 1 of the act of March 3, 1925, c. 438, 43 Stat. 1116, U. S. Code, title 27,  41 (27 USCA  41), 'any vessel or vehicle summarily forfeited to the United States for violation of the customs laws, may, in the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury, under such regulations as he may prescribe, be taken and used for the enforcement of the provisions of this title (i. e., the title, Intoxicating Liquors) in lieu of the sale thereof as provided by law' (cf. 27 U. S. Code,  42 (27 USCA  42)). Certain it is therefore that vehicles carrying smuggled merchandise other than intoxicating liquors may still be seized and forfeited under the provisions of the tariff acts and those of the Revised Statutes ancillary thereto. The forfeiture may be enforced even against innocent owners, though the Secretary of the Treasury may remit it, upon such terms as he deems reasonable, if satisfied that there was neither willful negligence nor intent to violate the law. Rev.St.  3078; Tariff Acts of 1922 (19 USCA  520, 532) and 1930, sections 613, 618 (19 USCA  1613, 1618). The penalty is at times a hard one, but it is imposed by the statute in terms too clear to be misread. Beyond all room for question, the owner of a vehicle bearing smuggled merchandise runs the risk of forfeiture, subject to remission by the grace of an administrative officer, where the merchandise is medicine or wheat or dry goods or machinery, subjects of legitimate trade upon payment of the lawful duties. The argu- \n\n[286 U.S. 49, 58]\n\u00a0\n ment for the interveners is that the intention of Congress was to make the risk a lighter one where the trade is wholly illegitimate, i. e., where the merchandise smuggled consists of intoxicating liquors. They tell us that perhaps a forfeiture under the tariff acts will be permitted when what is laden in the vehicle is partly intoxicating liquor and partly something else. Cf. Commercial Credit Co. v. United States (C. C. A.) 53 F.( 2d) 977, 978, 979. They insist, however, that the remedy under those acts must be held to be excluded when liquor and liquor only is the subject- matter of the carriage.\n Section 26, title 2 of the National Prohibition Act (41 Stat. 305, 315, U. S. C. title 27,  40 (27 USCA  40)), which is quoted in the margin,1 is said to lead to that bizarre result. We think its purpose is misread when such a meaning is ascribed to it. \n\n[286 U.S. 49, 59]\n\u00a0\n Section 26, title 2 of the National Prohibition Act is not directed against smuggling, though the conduct that it does cover may be an incident of smuggling. The Eighteenth Amendment distinguishes the importation of intoxicating liquors into the United States from their transportation within, or their exportation from, the United States, just as it distinguishes each of these activities from manufacture and from sale. The National Prohibition Act maintains the same distinction. Sections 3061 and 3062 of the Revised Statutes (19 USCA  482, 483) are aimed at importation from without the United States, and not at transportation within. Section 26, title 2, of the National Prohibition Act (27 USCA  40), is aimed at transportation within, and not at importation from without. We do not mean that the government may not separate the transaction into its criminal components, and prosecute or forfeit, according to its choice, for the one constituent or for the other. Cf. Callahan v. United States, supra. It may elect to seize under the prohibition act for wrongful transportation (ignoring the preliminary or later acts of importation or exportation), and in that event the prosecution must proceed on the same basis. Cf. Port Gardner Co. v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 564\n, 47 S. Ct. 165; Commercial Credit Co. v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 226, 231\n, 48 S. Ct. 232; Richbourg Motor Co. v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 528\n, 50 S. Ct. 385, 73 A. L. R. 1081. If the seizure is for transportation only, the owner of the vehicle will have whatever protection comes from section 26, and may reclaim what has been taken if he has acted in good faith. Restitution in such circumstances will be granted as of right, and not by an act of grace as it is where the seizure has been for evasion of the customs. \n\n[286 U.S. 49, 60]\n\u00a0\n Neither owner nor offender, however, has the privilege of choice between forfeiture upon the footing of illegal transportation and forfeiture upon the footing of a smuggled importation. The choice is for the government.\n We are told that this conclusion is inconsistent with Richbourg Motor Co. v. United States, supra, where seizure under another section of the Revised Statutes (section 3450 (27 USCA  1181)) was held to be excluded. The section there considered had no relation to the customs. It had been adopted as an internal revenue law many years before the National Prohibition Act, at a time when the sale of intoxicating liquors for beverage purposes was still a lawful business. By its terms there might be a forfeiture of a vessel or other means of conveyance which had been used to remove goods or commodities with intent to defraud the United States of a tax imposed thereon. This provision was held to have been superseded in the circumstances there disclosed by the forfeiture provisions in the act prohibiting the transportation of intoxicating liquors. National Prohibition Act. tit. 2,  26 (27 USCA  40). We are unwilling to extend the ruling to a situation like the one at hand. Two grounds of distinction mark the limits of extension. The first is that in the Richbourg Motor Company Case, the operator of the automobile was arrested at the time of the seizure and arraigned before a United States Commissioner on a charge of illegal transportation of intoxicating liquors. There was a clear election to go forward under the provisions of the Prohibition Act, and not under any other. Section 26 is explicit in its requirement that the officer seizing the vehicle under the authority of that section shall at once proceed against the person arrested 'under the provisions of this title.' By parity of reasoning the court held that when there has been arrest and seizure under section 26 because of wrongful transportation, the forfeiture of what has been seized must go forward on the same footing. Cf. Commercial Credit Co. v. United \n\n[286 U.S. 49, 61]\n\u00a0\n States, \n276 \nU.S. 226, 231\n, 48 S. Ct. 232; United States v. One Ford Coupe, \n272 \nU.S. 321, 325\n, 47 S. Ct. 154, 47 A. L. R. 1025. There is, however, a second ground of distinction that is independent of the conduct of the officer discovering the offense. It has relation to the difference between section 3450 of the Revised Statutes on the one hand and sections 3061 and 3062 on the other in respect of the wrong to be redressed. The act of removal from one place within the United States to another with intent to evade the tax upon spirituous liquors is one more nearly identical with that of transportation within the United States in violation of the prohibition law than is a wrongful importation in evasion of the customs. The bond of integration is closer and more intimate. Cf. United States v. American Motor Boat K-1231 (C. C. A.) 54 F. ( 2d) 502, 505. Removal from one place within the United States to another in order to evade a tax is differentiated from unlawful transportation by the quality of the intent, and not by anything else. Importation is differentiated also by the nature of the act.\n To refuse to give heed to these distinctions will lead us into a morass of practical difficulties as well as doctrinal refinements. If forfeiture of a vehicle seized in the course of importation must always be under section 26, and not under other statutes, then the smuggler arrested at the same time must always be prosecuted under the prohibition act. and never for the smuggling, since seizure under section 26 must be followed, as we have seen, by prosecution of the arrested person under that title and no other. We cannot bring ourselves to believe that Congress had in view the creation of so great a breach in historic remedies and sanctions. Cf. United States v. American Motor Boat K-1231, supra. Derangement of a system thus rooted in tradition is not to be inferred from a section aimed upon its face at transportation within the United States and not at importation from without. Cf. Maul v. United States, \n274 \nU.S. 501, 508\n, 47 S. Ct. 735. Repeals by implication are \n\n[286 U.S. 49, 62]\n\u00a0\n not favored (Henderson's Tobacco, 11 Wall. 652; United States v. Tynen, 11 Wall. 88, 92), and least of all where inveterate usage forbids the implication. Indeed, the breach, if we once allow it, will hardly be confined within the ramparts of the acts that regulate the duties upon imports. If a forfeiture under the customs laws is forbidden where there has been an unlawful importation of intoxicating liquors, we shall have difficulty in upholding a forfeiture where there has been a violation of the navigation laws or other cognate statutes. Already the net of these complexities has entangled the decisions. Cf. The Ruth Mildred, \n286 \nU.S. 67\n, 52 S. Ct. 473, 76 L. Ed. -, and The Sebastopol, \n286 \nU.S. 70\n, 52 S. Ct. 474, 76 L. Ed. -, decided herewith. Courts accepting the conclusion that the customs forfeiture are ended in respect of intoxicating liquors have been unable to extricate themselves from the conclusion that forfeitures under the navigation acts have fallen at the same time. A halt must be called before the tangle is so intricate that it can no longer be unraveled.\n We hold, then, that Richbourg Motor Company v. United States, supra, does not rule the case at hand. The question is one as to which the decisions of the other federal courts are almost equally divided. On the one side are United States v. Ford Coupe Automobile (D. C.) 43 F.(2d) 212; United States v. One Studebaker Automobile (D. C.) 45 F.(2d) 430; The Ruth Mildred (D. C.) 47 F.(2d) 336; Colon v. Hanlon (C. C. A.) 50 F.(2d) 353; United States v. One Buick Coupe (D. C.) 54 F.(2d) 800. On the other are The Pilot (C. C. A.) 43 F.(2d) 491; United States v. One Reo Coupe Automobile (D. C.) 46 F.(2d) 815; The Daisy T. (D. C.) 48 F.(2d) 370; United States v. James Hayes (D. C.) 52 F.(2d) 977; Maniscalco v. United States (C. C. A.) 53 F. (2d) 737; United States v. American Motor Boat K- 1231 (C. C. A.) 54 F.(2d) 502. The list is not exhaustive. The courts of each group have invoked the Willis-Campbell Act (Act of Nov. 23, 1921, c. 134, 42 Stat. 222, 223,  5 (27 USCA  3)), but have drawn opposing inferences from it. By that act, all laws relating to the \n\n[286 U.S. 49, 63]\n\u00a0\n manufacture, taxation, and traffic in intoxicating liquors and all penalties for their violation in force when the National Prohibition Act was adopted, were continued in force except such provisions as are 'directly in conflict with the provisions of the National Prohibition Act' ( see United States v. Staloff, \n260 \nU.S. 477\n, 43 S. Ct. 197). The advocates of an implied repeal insist that there is a direct conflict between a statute whereby immunity for innocent lienors or owners is given as of right and a statute whereby immunity is on the footing of an act of grace. To this the retort is made by the opponents of repeal that the spheres of the two immunities are diverse and that the apparent conflict is unreal. Transportation within the United States is the sphere of the one, and importation from without the sphere to the other.\n Of the four questions certified, those numbered 2 and 3 are adequately answered when we answer question Number 1.\n The answer to question 4 may depend upon circumstances imperfectly disclosed in the certificate, and is not shown to be necessary. White v. Johnson, \n282 \nU.S. 367\n, 51 S. Ct. 115.\n The second, third, and fourth questions are not answered, and the first question is answered, 'No.'\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'When the commissioner, his assistants, inspectors, or any officer of the law shall discover any person in the act of transporting in violation of the law, intoxicating liquors in any wagon, buggy, automobile, water or aircraft, or other vehicle, it shall be his duty to seize any and all intoxicating liquors found therein being transported contrary to law. Whenever intoxicating liquors transported or possessed illegally shall be seized by an officer he shall take possession of the vehicle and team or automobile, boat, air or water craft, or any other conveyance, and shall arrest any person in charge thereof. Such officer shall at once proceed against the person arrested under the provisions of this chapter in any court having competent jurisdiction; but the said vehicle or conveyance shall be returned to the owner upon execution by him of a good and valid bond, with sufficient sureties, in a sum double the value of the property, which said bond shall be approved by said officer and shall be conditioned to return said property to the custody of said officer on the day of trial to abide the judgment of the court. The court upon conviction of the person so arrested shall order the liquor destroyed, and unless good cause to the contrary is shown by the owner, shall order a sale by public auction of the property seized, and the officer making the sale, after deducting the expenses of keeping the property, the fee for the seizure, and the cost of the sale, shall pay all liens, according to their priorities, which are established, by intervention or otherwise at said hearing or in other proceeding brought for said purpose, as being bona fide and as having been created without the lienor having any notice that the carrying vehicle was being used or was to be used for illegal transportation of liquor, and shall pay the balance of the proceeds into the Treasury of the United States as miscellaneous receipts. All liens against property sold under the provisions of this section shall be transferred from the property to the proceeds of the sale of the property . ...' \n\n\n\n\n","69":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGRAU v.

Blakely, both of Covington, Ky., for petitioner. \n\n[287 U.S. 124, 125]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Thomas D.Thacher, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n\n\n\n[287 U.S. 124, 126]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner was convicted under an indictment in two counts, the first charging the unlawful manufacture of whisky, and the second possession of property designed for the unlawful manufacture of intoxicating liquors. \n1\n He complains that certain articles offered at the trial were obtained by virtue of a void search warrant, and that the trial court erred in overruling a motion to quash the process and to suppress the evidence, and in admitting it at the trial. The Circuit Court of Appeals overruled errors assigned to the District Court's action and affirmed the judgment. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The assertion is that the warrant is void for failure to observe the statutory requirement that it state the 'par- \n\n[287 U.S. 124, 127]\n\u00a0\n ticular grounds or probable cause' for issuance, and for the further reason that it is based on affidavits which do not 'set forth the facts tending to establish the grounds of the application or probable cause for believing that they exist.' \n3\n We need not consider the alleged defect of the warrant, as we think the objection to the affidavits well taken, and the warrant consequently without lawful foundation.\n Two affidavits were made before the commissioner. One purported to state the facts; the other merely asserted a belief that the statements in the first were true, and is clearly insufficient. Byars v. United States, \n273 \nU.S. 28\n, 47 S.Ct. 248.\n So far as material, the more detailed affidavit states that 'on or about October 14, 1931, he (affiant) went around and about the premises hereinafter described and saw persons haul cans, commonly used in handling whisky, and what appeared to be corn sugar up to and into the place and saw the same car or truck haul similar cans, apparently heavily loaded away from there and smelled odors and fumes of cooking mash coming from the place, and he says there is a still and whisky mash on the premises.'\n Pursuant to the process issued, officers seized a still, its appurtenances, and 350 gallons of whisky, and these were offered and admitted in evidence at the trial.\n Section 25 of title 2 of the National Prohibition Act4 provides: 'No search warrant shall issue to search any private dwelling occupied as such unless it is being used for the unlawful sale of intoxicating liquor, or unless it \n\n[287 U.S. 124, 128]\n\u00a0\n is in part used for some business purpose such as a store, shop, saloon, restaurant, hotel, or boarding house.'\n The affidavit fails to state the place to be searched is not a private dwelling, and the record affirmatively shows it was. At most the deposition charges the manufacture of whisky; no averment of sale is made; indeed no facts are given from which sale, on or off the premises described, necessarily is to be inferred. The court below, however, held that the facts set forth warranted a belief that the dwelling was being used as headquarters for the merchandising of liquor. This was deemed a sufficient compliance with the statutory permission for search of a dwelling if 'used for the unlawful sale of intoxicating liquor.'\n The broad construction of the act by the Court of Appeals unduly narrows the guaranties of the Fourth Amendment, in consonance with which the statute was passed. Those guaranties are to be liberally construed to prevent impairment of the protection extended. Boyd v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 616, 635\n, 6 S.Ct. 524; Gouled v. United States, \n255 \nU.S. 298, 304\n, 41 S.Ct. 261; Go-Bart Co. v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 344, 357\n, 51 S.Ct. 153. Congress intended, in adopting section 25 of title 2 of the National Prohibition Act, to preserve, not to encroach upon, the citizen's right to be immune from unreasonable searches and seizures, and we should so construe the legislation as to effect that purpose.\n A search warrant may issue only upon evidence which would be competent in the trial of the offense before a jury (Giles v. United States (C.C.A.) 284 F. 208; Wagner v. United States (C.C.A.) 8 F.(2d) 581), and would lead a man of prudence and caution to believe that the offense has been committed (Steele v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 498, 504\n, 45 S.Ct. 414). Tested by these standards, the affidavit was insufficient. While a dwelling used as a manufactory or headquarters \n\n[287 U.S. 124, 129]\n\u00a0\n for merchandising may well be and doubtless often is the place of sale, its use for those purposes is not alone probable cause for believing that actual sales are there made.\n The process should have been quashed, and the articles seized delivered to the petitioner.

Hurd, of Great Falls, Mont., for respondent. \n\n[287 U.S. 358, 359]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Sunburst Oil & Refining Company, the respondent, brought suit against petitioner, Great Northern Railway Company, to recover payments claimed to be overcharges for freight. The charges were in conformity with a tariff schedule approved by the Railroad Commission of Montana for intrastate traffic. After payment had been made, the same commission which had approved the schedule held, upon a complaint by the shiper, that the rates so approved were excessive and unreasonable. In this action to recover the excess so paid, the shipper recovered a judgment which was affirmed upon appeal. 7 P.(2d) 927. The question, broadly stated, is whether the annulment by retroaction of rates valid when exacted is an unlawful taking of property within the Fourteenth Amendment. A writ of certiorari brings the case here. \n287 \nU.S. 580\n, 53 S.Ct. 7, 77 L.Ed. --.\n By a statute of Montana (Rev. Codes 1921,  3794) the Board of Railroad Commissioners is empowered to fix rates of carriage for intrastate shipments. The rates thereby established are not beyond recall. They may be changed by the board itself on the complaint either of shipper or of carrier, if found to be unreasonable. Revised Codes of Montana,  3796. In an action against the board, they may be set aside upon a like showing by a judgment of the court. Sections 3809, 3810. Until changed or set aside, they 'shall prima facie be deemed to be just, reasonable, and proper.' Section 3810\n\n\n The meaning of the statute was considered by the Supreme Court of Montana in a cause determined in May, 1921. Doney v. Northern Pacific Railway Co., 60 Mont. 209, 199 P. 432. A shipper of lumber brought suit against a carrier to recover transportation charges which were alleged to be unreasonable, though they were in accord- \n\n[287 U.S. 358, 360]\n\u00a0\n ance with the published tariff. He did this without a preliminary application to the board to modify the schedule. He did it without a preliminary suit in which the board, being brought into court as a defendant, would have opportunity to sustain the schedule and resist the change. The court held that, until one of these preliminary conditions had been satisfied, no action for restitution could be maintained against the carrier. It coupled that decision with the statement that, upon compliance with one or other of the conditions, the excess, thus ascertained, might be the subject of recovery.\n The procedure there outlined was followed by this respondent. It filed a complaint with the board to the effect that the existing tariff for the carriage of crude petroleum distillate was excessive and unreasonable, in that the rate of 20 1\/2 cents was based upon an estimated weight of 7.4 pounds per gallon, whereas the actual weight is not more than 6.6 pounds per gallon. The board sustained the complaint. In doing so it ruled, in conformity with the decision in the Doney Case, that the published schedule prescribed the minimum and the maximum to which carrier and shipper were required to adhere while the schedule was in force, but that by the true construction of the statute the duty of adherence was subject to a condition or proviso whereby annulment or modification would give a right of reparation for the excess or the deficiency. The revision of the tariff was followed by this suit against the carrier, and later by a judgment for the shipper which is now before us for review.\n The appeal to the Supreme Court of Montana was heard at the same time as an appeal in another cause involving a like question, and the two were decided together, though with separate opinions. Montana Horse Products Co. v. Great Northern Railway Co., 7 P.(2d) 919; Sunburst Oil & Refining Co. v. Great \n\n[287 U.S. 358, 361]\n\u00a0\n Northern Railway Co., 7 P(2d) 927. The court held that the ruling in the Doney Case was erroneous and would not be followed in the future; that a rate established by the commission had the same effect as one established by the Legislature; that the statute giving power to the Commission or the court to declare a rate unreasonable was not to be read as meaning that a declaration of invalidity should apply to intermediate transactions; but none the less that the ruling in the Doney Case was law until reversed and would constitute the governing principle for shippers and carriers who, during the period of its reign, had acted on the faith of it. An opinion handed down upon a motion for rehearing restates the rationale of the decision, and perhaps with greater clearness. 7 P.(2d) 927, 929. We are thus brought to the inquiry whether the judgment thus rendered does violence to any right secured to the petitioner by the Federal Constitution.\n The subject is likely to be clarified if we divide it into two branches. Was a federal right infringed by the action of the trial court in adhering to the rule imposed upon it in the Doney Case by the highest court of the state? If there was no infringement then, did one come about later when the Supreme Court of Montana disavowed the rule of the Doney Case for the future, but applied it to the past?\n\n 1. \nThe trial court did not impair a federal right by giving to a statute of the state the meaning that had been ascribed to it by the highest court of the state, unless such impairment would have resulted if the meaning had been written into the statute by the Legislature itself. But plainly no such consequence would have followed if that course had been pursued. The Doney Case was decided, as we have seen, in 1921. The transactions complained of occurred between August, 1926, and August, 1928. Carrier and shipper understood at that time that \n\n[287 U.S. 358, 362]\n\u00a0\n the rates established by the commission as the delegate of the Legislature were provisional and tentative. Valid for the time being the rates indubitably were, a prop for conduct while they stood, but the prop might be removed, and charges, past as well as present, would go down at the same time. By implication of law there had been written into the statute a to all concerned that payments exacted by a carrier in conformity with a published tariff were subject to be refunded if found thereafter, upon sufficient evidence, to be excessive and unreasonable. The Constitution of the United States would have nothing to say about the validity of a notice of that tenor written in so many words into the body of the act. Carrier and shipper would be presumed to bargain with each other on the basis of existing law. Coombes v. Getz, \n285 \nU.S. 434\n, 52 S.Ct. 435. The validity of the notice is no less because it was written into the act by a process of construction. Supreme Lodge, Knights of Pythias, v. Meyer, \n265 \nU.S. 30, 32\n, 44 S.Ct. 432. The inquiry is irrelevant whether we would construe the statute in the same way if the duty of construction were ours and not another's. Supreme Lodge, Knights of Pythias, v. Meyer, supra, page 33 of 265 U.S., 44 S.Ct. 432, 433. Enough for us that the construction, whether we view it as wise or unwise, does not expose the court that made it to the reproach of withholding from the carrier the privileges and immunities established by the Constitution of the nation.\n Arizona Grocery Co. v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway, \n284 \nU.S. 370\n, 52 S.Ct. 183, holds nothing to the contrary. This court in disposing of that case was not dealing with any question of constitutional law. It was construing a federal statute. Congress had delegated to the Interstate Commerce Commission the power to fix rates and to revoke them. The holding was that the grant of power to revoke did not include by fair intendment a power to invalidate by relation the rates established in the past. The opinion of the court does not speak of the Constitution, but \n\n[287 U.S. 358, 363]\n\u00a0\n plants itself upon the statute, and from that source and no other derives its energy. In none of its pages is there a hint, much less a holding, that a denial of due process would result from the declaration of provisional rates if the will to make them provisional had been written into the Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA  1 et seq.), and written there in advance of carriage and of payment. The essence of such a system is that under it rates can be 'experimentally laid down and experimentally tried out.' Hutcheson, J., in Eagle Cotton Oil Co. v. Southern Railway Co. ( C.C.A.) 51 F.(2d) 443, 447. The statute of Montana differs in many ways from the act considered by this court. We do not need to ask ourselves the question whether the differences, to our thinking, are important or trivial. There might be no differences at all, and still the meaning of the Montana statute would be a problem for the Montana courts, and not one for us after they had had their say.\n\n 2. \nIf the carrier did not suffer a denial of due process through the action of the trial court in subjecting the published tariff to the doctrine of the Doney Case then standing unimpeached, the petitioner, to prevail, must be able to show that a change was brought about through something done or omitted by the Supreme Court of Montana in deciding the appeal.\n We think the posture of the case from the viewpoint of constitutional law was the same after the decision of the appeal as it was after the trial. There would certainly have been no denial of due process if the court in affirming the judgment had rendered no opinion or had stated in its opinion that the Doney Case was approved. The petitioner is thus driven to the position that the Constitution of the United States has been infringed because the Doney Case was disapproved, and yet, while disapproved, was followed. Adherence to precedent as establishing a governing rule for the past in respect of the meaning of a statute is said to be a denial \n\n[287 U.S. 358, 364]\n\u00a0\n of due process when coupled with the declaration of an intention to refuse to adhere to it in adjudicating any controversies growing out of the transactions of the future.\n We have no occasion to consider whether this division in time of the effects of a decision is a sound or an unsound application of the doctrine of stare decisis as known to the common law. Sound or unsound, there is involved in it no denial of a right protected by the Federal Constitution. This is not a case where a court, in overruling an earlier decision, has given to the new ruling a retroactive bearing, and thereby has made invalid what was valid in the doing. Even that may often be done, though litigants not infrequently have argued to the contrary. Tidal Oil Co. v. Flanagan, \n263 \nU.S. 444, 450\n, 44 S.Ct. 197; Fleming v. Fleming, \n264 \nU.S. 29\n, 44 S.Ct. 246; Brinkerhoff-Faris Co. v. Hill, \n281 \nU.S. 673, 680\n, 50 S.Ct. 451; cf. Montana Bank v. Yellowstone County, \n276 \nU.S. 499, 503\n, 48 S.Ct. 331. This is a case where a court has refused to make its ruling retroactive, and the novel stand is taken that the Constitution of the United States is infringed by the refusal.\n We think the Federal Constitution has no voice upon the subject. A state in defining the limits of adherence to precedent may make a choice for itself between the principle of forward operation and that of relation backward. It may say that decisions of its highest court, though later overruled, are law none the less for intermediate transactions. Indeed, there are cases intimating, too broadly (cf. Tidal Oil Co. v. Flanagan, supra), that it must give them that effect; but never has doubt been expressed that it may so treat them if it pleases, whenever injustice or hardship will thereby be averted. Gelpcke v. Dubuque, 1 Wall. 175; Douglass v. County of Pike, \n101 U.S. 677\n, 687; Loeb v. Columbia Township Trustees, \n179 \nU.S. 472, 492\n, 21 S.Ct. 174; Harris v. Jex, 55 N.Y. 421, 14 Am.Rep. 285; Menges v. Dentler, 33 Pa. 495, 499, 75 Am.Dec. 616; Com. v. Fidelity & Columbia Trust Co., 185 Ky. 300, 215 S.W. 42; Mason v. Cotton Co., 148 N.C. 492, 510, 62 S.E. 625, 18 L.R.A.( N.S.) 1221, 128 Am.St.Rep. 635; Hoven v. \n\n[287 U.S. 358, 365]\n\u00a0\n McCarthy Bros. Co., 163 Minn. 339, 204 N.W. 29; Farrior v. New England Mortgage Security Co., 92 Ala. 176, 9 So. 532, 12 L.R.A. 856; Falconer v. Simmons, 51 W.Va. 172, 41 S.E. 193.1 On the other hand, it may hold to the ancient dogma that the law declared by its courts had a Platonic or ideal existence before the act of declaration, in which event the discredited declaration will be viewed as if it had never been, and the reconsidered declaration as law from the beginning. Tidal Oil Co. v. Flanagan, supra; Fleming v. Fleming, supra; Central Land Co. v. Laidley, \n159 \nU.S. 103, 112\n, 16 S.Ct. 80; see, however, Montana Bank v. Yellowstone County, supra. \n2\n The alternative is the same whether the subject of the new decision is common law (Tidal Oil Co. v. Flanagan, supra) or statute. Gelpcke v. Dubuque, supra; Fleming v. Fleming, supra. The choice for any state may be determined by the juristic philosophy of the judges of her courts, their conceptions of law, its origin and nature. We review, not the wisdom of their philosophies, but the legality of their acts. The state of Montana has told us by the voice of her highest court that, with these alternative methods open to her, her preference is for the first. In making this choice, she is declaring common law for those within her borders. The common law as administered by her judges ascribes to the decisions of her highest court a power to bind and loose that is unextinguished, for intermediate transactions, by a decision overruling them. As applied to such transactions, we may say of the earlier decision that it has not been overruled at all. It has been translated into a judgment of affirmance and recognized as law anew. \n\n[287 U.S. 358, 366]\n\u00a0\n Accompanying the recognition is a prophecy, which may or may not be realized in conduct, that transactions arising in the future will be governed by a different rule. If this is the common-law doctrine of adherence to precedent as understood and enforced by the courts of Montana, we are not at liberty, for anything contained in the Constitution of the United States, to thrust upon those courts a different conception either of the binding force of precedent or of the meaning of the judicial process.\n There is still to be considered a question of jurisdiction which has been reserved till this stage of the opinion, for the answer to it becomes easier after a consideration of the merits has brought into clear relief the challenge to the judgment. The first mention of the Fourteenth Amendment to be found in the record is in the petition for rehearing, where also there is a statement that the constitutional question was presented on the first hearing of the appeal and is now renewed and amplified. The answer to the petition for rehearing by counsel for the respondent is also in the record, and contains what is in substance an admission that the constitutional point had been duly made at the time and in the manner stated by the moving party. The court, in denying the application, did so by reference to its opinion on a similar motion in a companion suit decided at the same time (Montana Horse Products Co. v. Great Northern Ry. Co., supra), and nowhere in that opinion did it contest the statement of counsel that the effect of the Fourteenth Amendment had been argued at every stage. We have then in the record what is in essence the stipulation of counsel followed by the acquiescence of the court. Whether this without more avoids the application of the general rule that a constitutional question is urged too late, if put forward for the first time upon a petition for rehearing (American Surety Co. v. Baldwin, \n287 \nU.S. 156\n, 53 S.Ct. 98, November 14, 1932; Godchaux Co. v. Estopinal, \n251 \nU.S. 179\n, 40 S.Ct. 116), we are not \n\n[287 U.S. 358, 367]\n\u00a0\n required to determine, for here there is more, and that enough to bring the case within a well-recognized exception. The rule, general as it is, does not extend to cases where the constitutional question, however tardily raised, is considered and decided (Consolidated Turnpike Co. v. Norfolk & O.V. Ry. Co., \n228 \nU.S. 326, 334\n, 33 S.Ct. 510; Cumberland Coal Co. v. Board, \n284 \nU.S. 23\n, 52 S.Ct. 48), nor does it apply where the grounds of the decision supply a new and unexpected basis for a claim by the defeated party of the denial of a federal right (Brinkerhoff-Faris Trust & Savings Co. v. Hill, \n281 \nU.S. 673, 678\n, 50 S.Ct. 451; Missouri ex rel. Missouri Insurance Co. v. Gehner, \n281 \nU.S. 313, 320\n, 50 S.Ct. 326; American Surety Co. v. Baldwin, supra). This case is clearly within the second of these exceptions, if it is not also within the first. We have seen that the assault upon the judgment is made along two lines. The first is a challenge to the constitutional validity of the ruling in the Doney Case, and involves a misconception of the decision in Arizona Grocery Co. v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co., supra. The second is a challenge to the constitutional validity of the ruling in this case whereby the statute is adjudged to mean one thing for some cases and another thing for others. This latter objection the petitioner could not make in advance of the event.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of Montana is accordingly\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Other cases have been collected in the writings of learned authors: Von Moschzisker, Stare Decisis in Courts of Last Resort, 37 Harvard Law Review 409, 421; Freeman, Retroactive Operation of Decisions, 18 Columbia Law Review 230; Carpenter, Court Decisions and the Common Law, 17 Columbia Law Review 593; also 29 Harvard Law Review 80. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Cf.

QUERY(1932)\nNo. 170\nArgued: December 10, 1931Decided: May 31, 1932\n\n\n\n Messrs. James M. Lynch, of Florence, S. C., and P. F. Henderson, of Aiken, S. C., for appellants. \n\n[286 U.S. 472, 473]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John M. Daniel, Atty. Gen., and J. Fraser Lyon, of Columbia, S. C., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By these actions, within the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of South Carolina, appellants sought to restrain the enforcement of the state statute known as the 'Gasoline Tax Act of 1930' (Acts So. Car., 1930, p. 1390). The statute was assailed upon state and federal grounds, the latter being that the act violated the commerce clause (article 1,  8, par. 3), and the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution. The state court overruled these contentions and dismissed the complaints. The cases are brought here by appeal. \n\n[286 U.S. 472, 474]\n\u00a0\n The provisions of the statute which give rise to the federal questions are found in sections 1 and 6 as follows:\n'Section 1. ... Every person, firm, corporation, municipality, ... in the State of South Carolina which shall import into this State from any other State or foreign Country, or shall receive by any means into this State, and keep in storage in this State for a period of twenty-four hours or more, after the same shall have lost its interstate character as a shipment in interstate commerce, any gasoline or any other like products of petroleum or under whatever name designated, which is intended to be stored or used for consumption in this State, shall pay a license tax of six cents per gallon for every gallon of gasoline, or other like products of petroleum aforementioned, which shall have been shipped or imported into this State from any other State or foreign country, and which shall hereafter, for a period of twenty-four hours after it loses its interstate character as a shipment of interstate commerce be kept in storage in this State to be used and consumed in this State by any person, firm, or corporation, municipality, ... and which has not already been subjected to the payment of the license taxes imposed upon the sale thereof by acts of the General Assembly of the State of South Carolina, the same being Act No. 34, Acts of 1925, approved the 23rd day of March, 1925, and Act No. 102, Acts of 1929, approved the 16th day of March, 1929, imposing license taxes for the privilege of dealing in gasoline or other like products or petroleum: Provided, That this Act shall not impose a tax upon crude petroleum, residium or smudge oil: Provided, further, That one per cent. to cover loss by evaporation, spillage or otherwise shall be deducted by the taxpayer when remitting the tax required by this Act. ...\n\n\n\n[286 U.S. 472, 475]\n\u00a0\n 's 6. Nothing within this Act shall be construed to impose a license tax upon any selling agent, consumer, or retailer, selling, consigning, shipping, distributing or using gasoline, combinations thereof, or substitutes therefor, which may have been bought from any oil company on which the license taxes imposed by Act No. 34, Acts of the General Assembly of 1925, approved the 23rd of March, 1925, and Act No. 102, Acts of the General Assembly of 1929, approved the 16th day of March, 1929, have been paid nor shall this Act be construed as applying in the case of interstate commerce.'\n In the case of Gregg Dyeing Company (No. 170), the facts alleged in the complaint were admitted by demurrer, and other facts were stipulated as if the complaint had set them forth. It thus appeared that plaintiff conducted a bleachery in Aiken, S. C., and used gasoline in its processes; that its practice is to buy gasoline in bulk from dealers outside the state of South Carolina and to have the gasoline shipped in interstate commerce to plaintiff's plant where the gasoline is unloaded and stored, and kept in storage, in plaintiff's tanks, for more than twenty-four hours and until it is needed for use, and in its entirety is used by plaintiff in its manufacturing business and for its own purposes, and is not brought into the state for resale and is not resold; that there is in Charleston, S. C., a refinery maintained by the Standard Oil Company at which large quantities of gasoline are produced; that much of the gasoline thus produced, and much that is brought into the state by oil companies for resale, is stored within the state for more than twenty-four hours before it is sold or used, and is not taxed for its importation and\/or storage in South Carolina, but is taxed when it is used or sold in that state by such oil companies; and that such gasoline, produced \n\n[286 U.S. 472, 476]\n\u00a0\n in the refinery above mentioned, as is shipped to other states is not taxed in South Carolina. Final judgment was rendered in favor of defendants upon the demurrer. 164 S. E. 588.\n In the case brought by the City of Greenville (No. 245), plaintiff alleged that it was a municipal corporation which had brought into the state of South Carolina gasoline in tank car lots, purchased outside the state, and thereafter had stored, and used and consumed it for public purposes. Defendants demurred, there was an agreed statement of facts in addition to the allegations of the complaint, and the judgment upon the demurrer thus raised the same federal questions as those presented in the case first mentioned.\n In maintaining rights asserted under the Federal Constitution, the decision of this Court is not dependent upon the form of a taxing scheme, or upon the characterization of it by the state court. We regard the substance rather than the form, and the controlling test is found in the operation and effect of the statute as applied and enforced by the state. St. Louis Southwestern Railway Co. v. Arkansas, \n235 \nU.S. 350, 362\n, 35 S. Ct. 99; Hanover Fire Insurance Co. v. Harding, \n272 \nU.S. 494, 509\n, 510 S., 47 S. Ct. 179, 49 A. L. R. 713. The operation and effect of this tax act has been determined definitely by the state court in the instant cases. Construing the act, that court has said:\n'The Act in question may be said to be complementary to the other statutes of South Carolina under which are assessed a gallonage tax on gasoline and other petroleum products. Indeed, it expressly excludes from its provisions all gasoline upon which a like tax has been paid under other statutes. It so declares in its title and specifically designates in its body the statutes, payment of the tax under which exempts from its burden. ...\n\n'In South Carolina, commencing about a decade ago, the General Assembly expressed its public policy as to revenue to be derived from the use of gasoline, vol. 32, Stat. at Large, p. 835. The tax then imposed was two \n\n[286 U.S. 472, 477]\n\u00a0\n cents a gallon. In 1925, the tax was increased to five cents, and in 1929, to six cents on the gallon. These statutes, however, only reached 'dealers' in this commodity.\n\n'Statutes of this nature have been uniformly construed as imposing a tax on the ultimate consumer or user, as will be hereafter shown. Realizing that large users of gasoline either were evading or would evade the payment of the tax imposed under these Acts, by bringing in gasoline in quantities from without the State, and storing it for their own purposes, the Legislature in 1930 enacted the statute under consideration, applying the six cents tax to every person, firm, corporation, municipality or any subdivision subject to its terms . ... Thus, with the Act of 1930 complementing the other statutes referred to, all consumers of gasoline in South Carolina pay a tax of 6 cents per gallon, no matter what the origin of, or State in which, the gasoline is produced. ...\n\n'On its face, the Act expressly negatives an intention to tax interstate commerce. It does not purpose to tax any gasoline until twenty-four hours after it has lost its interstate character. It seeks to operate only after the commodity has been severed from its interstate character and has become at rest as a part of the general mass of property in this State subject to the protection of its laws . ...\n\n'The tax here imposed is an excise tax and not a property tax. ... All oil companies in South Carolina, including the Standard Oil Company in Charleston, S. C., are required to pay and do pay the tax upon any gasoline they sell and all that they use in South Carolina, whether it be for operating their trucks upon the highways or otherwise (34 Stat. at Large, p. 197). ...\n\n'The tax applies only to persons who store with intent to use and consume the gasoline in South Carolina. ... Mere storage after manufacture or production is not \n\n[286 U.S. 472, 478]\n\u00a0\n enough to provoke the application of the tax. The only kind of storage affected is that with intent to use and consume the product in South Carolina. Such intention on its part petitioner admits to exist in the instant case, and in all future transactions. The fact that the Standard Oil Company at Charleston, S. C. manufactures and produces large quantities of gasoline which is stored at its refinery and which is untaxed before its sale or use in South Carolina, does not, to our mind, work a discrimination against petitioner or producers in other States. It is admitted that that company, like all others, is required to pay and does pay a tax of six cents on all of its products sold in South Carolina or used and consumed in its business.'\n\n We may lay aside, as not here involved, any question relating to importations from foreign countries. As to interstate commerce, the questions are (1) whether the act as applied by the state court imposes a direct burden upon that commerce, and (2) whether, although the subject of the tax would otherwise be within the power of the state, the tax is invalid because it creates an unconstitutional discrimination against transactions in interstate commerce.\n As to the first question, we are not concerned with what the tax is called, but with what the statute does. It imposes an exaction with respect to gasoline purchased in other states and brought into South Carolina and there placed by appellants, in storage for future use within the State. By the terms of the act, as construed by the state court and applied to these appellants, interstate commerce in relation to the subject of the tax has ended. The gasoline has come to rest within the state, having been placed in appellants' storage tanks and added to appellants' property kept for local purposes. In such circumstances the state has the authority 'to tax the products or their storage or sale.' Texas Co. v. \n\n[286 U.S. 472, 479]\n\u00a0\n Brown, \n258 \nU.S. 466, 478\n, 42 S. Ct. 375, 379; Sonneborn Bros. v. Cureton, \n262 U.S. 506\n. 519, 520, 43 S. Ct. 643; Hart Refineries v. Harmon, \n278 \nU.S. 499, 501\n, 502 S., 49 S. Ct. 188, 189. Not only may local sales of gasoline thus brought into the state be taxed, but its use as well. This was specifically determined in Bowman v. Continental Oil Co., \n256 \nU.S. 642, 648\n, 649 S., 41 S. Ct. 606. See Hart Refineries v. Harmon, supra; Breece Lumber Co. v. Asplund, \n283 \nU.S. 788\n, 51 S. Ct. 352. There is an exception in the case of a tax directly on use in interstate commerce, as on use in interstate transportation. Helson v. Kentucky, \n279 \nU.S. 245, 252\n, 49 S. Ct. 279; Eastern Air Transport v. South Carolina Tax Commission, \n285 \nU.S. 147\n, 52 S. Ct. 340, 76 L. Ed. -, decided March 14, 1932. In view of these well-established principles, we find no ground for concluding that the state could not impose the tax with respect to the gasoline of appellants which was kept within the state for use in their local enterprises. As the Court said, in Hart Refineries v. Harmon, supra, interstate transportation having ended, the taxing power of the state in respect of the commodity may, so far as the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution is concerned, 'be exerted in any way which the state's Constitution and laws permit.' This, of course, is on the assumption that the tax does not discriminate against the commodity because of its origin in another state.\n The state court answered the contention as to discrimination against interstate commerce by referring to other statutes of the state imposing a tax upon the sale and use of gasoline within the state. The state court said that the act in question 'taxes all gasoline stored for use and consumption upon which a like tax has not been paid under other statutes. By the kindred Acts all users are taxed.' But appellants question the right to invoke other statutes to support the validity of the act assailed. To stand the test of constitutionality, they say, the act must be constitutional 'within its four corners,' that is, \n\n[286 U.S. 472, 480]\n\u00a0\n considered by itself. This argument is without merit. The question of constitutional validity is not to be determined by artificial standards. What is required is that state action, whether through one agency or another, or through one enactment or more than one, shall be consistent with the restrictions of the Federal Constitution. There is no demand in that Constitution that the state shall put its requirements in any one statute. It may distribute them as it sees fit, if the result, taken in its totality, is within the state's constitutional power. Where the Supreme Court of the state has held that two or more statutes must be taken together, we accept that conclusion as if written into the statutes themselves. Hebert v. Louisiana, \n272 \nU.S. 312, 317\n, 47 S. Ct. 103, 48 A. L. R. 1102. See Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., \n220 \nU.S. 61, 73\n, 31 S. Ct. 337, Ann. Cas. 1912C, 160.\n Reading together the statutes with respect to gasoline taxes, the state court took the view that, as to the gasoline tax with respect to sales within the state, the burden actually rests upon the consumer, although not placed upon the consumer directly. No reason is found to challenge this view. Texas Co. v. Brown, supra, 258 U. S. at page 479, 42 S. Ct. 375; Panhandle Oil Co. v. State of Mississippi ex rel. Knox, \n277 \nU.S. 218, 222\n, 48 S. Ct. 451, 56 A. L. R. 583; Indian Motocycle Co. v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 578, 579\n, 51 S. Ct. 601. So far as dealers in gasoline within the state are concerned, there appears to be no ground for appellants' claim of discrimination. The point with respect to appellants is that they are not dealers, but users, consumers of gasoline in their business. They are required to pay the tax with respect to the gasoline they keep for such use and consumption within the state. As to such gasoline, they pay precisely the same amount per gallon as other consumers within the state are in effect required to pay through the tax on the dealers from whom such consumers buy. Discrimination is asserted in relation to manufacturers who produce gasoline within the state and consume it in their enterprises. Appellants have directed particular \n\n[286 U.S. 472, 481]\n\u00a0\n attention to the case of a refining company which produces gasoline in South Carolina and consumes gasoline in its business and also sells it within the state. The state court, construing the applicable statute, has held that in such a case the producing company is taxed with respect to the gasoline it uses as well as with respect to the gasoline it sells. The decision is unequivocal that 'all oil companies in South Carolina are required to pay and do pay the tax upon any gasoline they sell and all that they use in South Carolina.' With respect, then, to the gasoline used by appellants in their business, there is in this aspect no discrimination against them because their gasoline has its origin in another state, as others either buying or producing gasoline within the state pay the tax at the same rate in relation to their consumption.\n Discrimination, like interstate commerce itself, is a practical conception. We must deal in this matter, as in others, with substantial distinctions and real injuries. Shaffer v. Carter, \n252 \nU.S. 37, 55\n, 40 S. Ct. 221. Appellants' attack upon the tax comes to this, in the last analysis, that the tax in their case is laid with respect to the gasoline they have bought outside the state and keep in storage for use and consumption in their business, whereas others are taxed, not with respect to the gasoline they keep in store for use and consumption, but for the gasoline they use and consume. But appellants have admitted, as the state court has said, that 'the only kind of storage affected' is that for the purpose of use and consumption. In this view the state court found no distinction of substance with respect to the practical operation of the taxing statutes in pari materia, as all in like case, appellants and others who use gasoline in their business enterprises, pay the same amount on the gasoline they consume. Appellants had the burden of showing an injurious discrimination against them because they bought their gasoline outside the state. This burden they have \n\n[286 U.S. 472, 482]\n\u00a0\n not sustained. They have failed to show that, whatever distinction there existed in form, there was any substantial discrimination in fact.\n The same considerations, with respect to discrimination, apply to the claim that the statute in question violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The statement of this Court in General American Tank Car Corporation v. Day, \n270 \nU.S. 367, 373\n, 46 S. Ct. 234, 236, is apposite: 'In determining whether there is a denial of equal protection of the laws by such taxation, we must look to the fairness and reasonableness of its purposes and practical operation, rather than to minute differences between its application in practice and the application of the taxing statute or statutes to which it is complementary.'\n The right of the city of Greenville (No. 245) to raise the questions presented under the Federal Constitution does not appear to have been challenged or passed upon by the state court and has not been discussed at this bar. Accordingly, that question has not been considered here.\n Judgments affirmed. \n\n\n\n","72":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGULF STATES STEEL CO. v. U.S.(1932)\nNo. 24\nArgued: October 20, 1932Decided: November 7, 1932\n\n\n\n\n[287 U.S. 32, 33]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John W. Drye, Jr., of New York City, James P. McGovern, of Washington, D.C., and John M. Perry, of New York City, for petitioners.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Whitney North Seymour, of Washington, D. C.,\n\n\n\n[287 U.S. 32, 34]\n\u00a0\n for the United States.\n Mr. John E. Hughes, of Washington, D.C., filed a brief as amicus curiae.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In the District Court for Alabama-August 25, 1930-the United States sued the Gulf States Steel Company, principal, and National Surety Company, surety, petitioners here, upon a bond dated September 9, 1925, whereby they agreed to pay Snead, collector of internal revenue, so much of the additional income and profits taxes for 1917 assessed by him against the principal in 1921 'as is not abated.' Judgment on a verdict went for plaintiffs; the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed; the matter is here by certiorari.\n Petitioners say the sole question presented is whether the additional taxes were abated by the determination of the Board of Tax Appeals (July 10, 1928) in a proceeding brought by the Steel Company to review the Commissioner's final rejection of its demand for abatement. The Board held 'that the respondent is now barred by statute from collecting any part of the additional assessment made in April, 1921, and that there is no deficiency for the year 1917.' It directed entry of an order to that effect.\n The petition for certiorari asserts: 'The sole question in this case is whether the final decision of the Board that there was no deficiency 'abated' the tax.' The following is the only specification of error relied on here: 'That the Court erred in holding that the claim for the deficiency of taxes was not abated by the final decision of the United States Board of Tax Appeals that there was no deficiency.' And in their brief counsel for petitioners say: 'The sole \n\n[287 U.S. 32, 35]\n\u00a0\n question in this case is whether the final decision of the Board that there was no deficiency 'abated' the tax.'\n March 28, 1918, the Steel Company filed its income and excess profits tax return for 1917, and shortly thereafter paid the amount apparently due. In April, 1921, the Commissioner made a deficiency assessment of $153,815. 30; May 6, 1921, the company filed claim and demand for abatement of this entire sum upon the ground that the additional assessment was unwarranted and illegal in so far as it resulted (1) from the failure to compute the invested capital by including the actual cash value of claimant's property on January 1, 1914; (2) from the action of the examiners in deducting only 7 per cent. of invested capital, instead of 8 per cent.; and (3) from disallowance of certain interest payments as part of invested capital.\n March 13, 1923, fifteen days before the five-year statute would have barred collection of the deficiency assessment, the additional tax being wholly unpaid and the abatement claim undetermined, in order to secure delay and further consideration of objections, the taxpayer as principal, with the American Surety Company as surety, gave the collector a bond for $ 175,350, which recites:\n'The condition of the above obligation is such that, if the said Gulf States Steel Company will indemnify the said W. E. Snead as Collector as aforesaid, or his successor in office, against all loss, cost, damage, and expense to which he may be put by reason of having allowed the said Gulf States Steel Company to withhold the payment to him, as such Collector, of the sum of One Hundred and Fifty-three Thousand Eight Hundred Fifteen and 30\/100 Dollars ($153,815.30), claimed of it under the War Revenue Act of 1917, pending the filing, by the said Gulf States Steel Company of additional facts and information in support of a claim for the abatement of said amount heretofore filed by it, then this obligation to be null and void, otherwise, to be and remain in full force and effect.'\n\n April 3, 1925, in order to obtain release of the American Surety Company from the above-described bond, also to \n\n[287 U.S. 32, 36]\n\u00a0\n make certain the payment of whatever the commissioner might thereafter finally declare to be payable under the deficiency assessment of 1921, the Steel Company executed a second obligation and pledged as security $200, 000 United States Liberty loan bonds. This obligation recites:\n'Whereas the Gulf States Steel Company did execute a bond in the penal sum of One Hundred Seventy-five Thousand, Three Hundred and Fifty Dollars, ($175,350.00), and in favor of W. E. Snead, Collector of Internal Revenue, for the District of Alabama, which said bond was signed by the American Surety Company of New York, as surety, under date of the 13th day of March, 1923, and was given in support of a claim for the abatement of assessments, penalties and interests, under the Revenue Act of 1917. Being desirous of relieving the above bound surety Company and further securing the payment of any amount found to be due the United States government under the above Revenue Act, now, therefore, if the undersigned Gulf States Steel Company shall pay to W. E. Snead, Collector, or his successors in office, such amount of the claim as is not abated, together with all costs, damages, penalties, interest, or other expense connected therewith, then this obligation shall be void, otherwise it shall remain in full force and effect.'\n\n September 9, 1925, the Steel Company as principal, and National Surety Company as surety, executed the bond in suit, conditioned as follows:\n'Whereas, an additional income tax has been assessed for the year 1917 in the sum of One Hundred Fifty-three Thousand Eight Hundred and Fifteen Dollars and Thirty Cents ($153,815.30), with penalty and interest against the Gulf States Steel Company of Birmingham, Alabama. A claim for the abatement of the additional tax was filed with the Collector of Internal Revenue for the District of Alabama at Birmingham. On the third day of April, \n\n[287 U.S. 32, 37]\n\u00a0\n 1925, the Gulf States Steel Company did execute its bond securing the payment of so much of the additional assessment, penalties and interest as is not abated. In lieu of surety on the above bond the said company did deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, under Section 1029 of the Revenue Act of 1924, the following described United States, Fourth Liberty Loan 4 1\/2% Gold Bonds of 1933-8 series, being of the par value of $ 200,000.00 (coupons), numbers --. The above bonds were deposited on account and subject to the orders of W. E. Snead, Collector of Internal Revenue for the District of Alabama. Now, therefore, if W. E. Snead, Collector of Internal Revenue, shall release and surrender the said bonds to the said Company, and the principal, or sureties, either or both, shall pay to the said Collector so much of the amount of the claim as is not abated, together with penalties and interest thereon as provided by Law, then this obligation shall be of no efect. Otherwise, it shall reamin in full no effect. Otherwise, it shall remain in full\n\n May 12, 1926, the Commissioner finally rejected in toto the Steel Company's long pending claim for abatement of the additional assessment of 1921 and gave proper notice. This notice among other things stated: 'You are allowed 60 days (not counting Sunday as the sixtieth day) from the date of mailing of this letter within which to file a petition with the United States Board of Tax Appeals, Earle Building, Washington, D.C., contesting in whole or in part the correctness of this determination.'\n By an original petition to the Board of Tax Appeals, July 9, 1926, the Steel Company asked a 'redetermination of the deficiency set forth by the respondent (Commissioner) in his notice of deficiency ... dated May 12, 1926.' The prayer follows:\n'The petitioner prays for relief from the deficiency asserted by the respondent and from payment of the taxes \n\n[287 U.S. 32, 38]\n\u00a0\n assessed in the following and each of the following particulars:\n\n'(a) That the petitioner be allowed as a deduction from its gross income for the year 1917, the sum of $47,021.82 as amortization of the cost to it of the lease (or stock) of Clinton Mining Company or as depletion or exhaustion of the leased properties based upon a cost of $145, 000.00; or\n\n'(b) That the Clinton Mining Company be granted a reasonable allowance for the exhaustion or depletion of the leased properties based upon a March 1, 1913, value of the leasehold, and that amount so allowed be deducted in computing the consolidated net income of the petitioners and Clinton Mining Company for the year 1917:\n\n'(c) That the petitioner be allowed $11,000,000.00 in computing its invested capital for 1917, on account of the property paid in for stock on December 1, 1913\n\n\n\n'Wherefore petitioner prays that this Board may hear and determine the deficiency herein alleged.'\n\n By an amended petition, March 2, 1927 (after Bowers v. New York & Albany Lighterage Co. (February, 1927) \n273 \nU.S. 346\n, 47 S.Ct. 389), the Steel Company renewed its request for 'a redetermination of the deficiency set forth by the respondent in his notice of deficiency' dated May 12, 1926.\n The petitions are identical, except the amended one contains two new paragraphs which allege extinguishment through the statute of limitations of all liability of the Steel Company for the additional taxes; also the following new prayer:\n'(d) That the Board determine that the liability of the petitioner for the payment of the alleged deficiency has been extinguished by the running of the Statute of Limitations upon its collection and\/or that the collection of said alleged deficiency was barred at the expiration of five years after said returns were filed.' \n\n[287 U.S. 32, 39]\n\u00a0\n The Board of Tax Appeals in July, 1928, held: 'None of the bonds in the instant case can be said to constitute a consent in writing by both the Commissioner and the taxpayer to a later determination, assessment and collection of the tax in question, and no other exception to the running of the statute of limitations provided in any of the Acts being present, and no suit or proceeding for the collection of tax having been begun prior to the expiration of five years from the date of filing the return, and the five-year period having expired prior to the passage of the Revenue Act of 1924, we hold that the respondent is now barred by statute from collecting any part of the additional assessment made in April, 1921, and that there is no deficiency for the year 1917. Bowers v. New York & Albany Lighterage Company (\n273 \nU.S. 346\n, 47 S.Ct. 389); C. B. Shaffer v. Commissioner (12 B.T.A. 298); United States v. John Barth Co. ( \n279 \nU.S. 370\n, 49 S.Ct. 366); Art Metal Works v. Commissioner, 9 B.T.A. 491. Our decision in this respect in no wise disposes of any questions arising as to liability on the bond.' The consequent formal entry recites: 'It is ordered and adjudged that the collection of the deficiency, if any, in income and excess profits taxes for the year 1917 is barred by the Statute of Limitations. ...'\n\n Bowers v. New York & Albany Lighterage Co. (February 21, 1927) \n273 \nU.S. 346\n, 47 S.Ct. 389, construed the provision, Revenue Act 1921, prohibiting suit or proceeding for the collection of income or excess profits taxes, after five years subsequent to the return and held it applied both to suits in court and to distraint proceedings. Prior to this tax officers went upon the view that the statute of limitations did not apply to distraint.\n United States v. John Barth Co., \n279 \nU.S. 370\n, 49 S.Ct. 366, May 13, 1929, ruled that the limitation in Revenue Acts 1918, 1919, 1921, and 1924 upon the time within which income and \n\n[287 U.S. 32, 40]\n\u00a0\n excess profits taxes may be assessed and suits begun to collect is inapplicable where the suit is upon a bond given to secure payment of taxes theretofore returned and assessed, in order to obtain postponement of payment pending decision upon claim for abatement; also, that a bond made in such circumstances affords a cause of action separate and distinct from one to collect the tax.\n Prior to 1924, in order to contest the Commissioner's assessment, the taxpayer had to pay the sum demanded and bring suit to recover. Graham v. Du Pont, \n262 \nU.S. 234, 258\n, 43 S.Ct. 567.\n Title IX, Board of Tax Appeals, Act June 2, 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. 253, 336, established the Board of Tax Appeals and authorized it to hear appeals from the Commissioner's action in respect of deficiencies before payments, etc. Under this act, if the Board disallowed an alleged deficiency, thereafter the Commissioner could enforce collection only by suit in court.\n The Revenue Act, February 26, 1926, Title X; Board of Tax Appeals, c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, 105, 107, amended Title IX, Board of Tax Appeals, Organization and Procedure, Act of 1924, supra, by adding thereto, among other things (under subtitle 'Organization and Procedure'), the following wholly new paragraph: 'Sec. 906(e) If the assessment or collection of any tax is barred by any statute of limitations, the decision of the board to that effect shall, for the purposes of this chapter and of this title (the Revenue Act of 1926), be considered as its decision that there is no deficiency in respect of such tax.' (26 USCA  1217 note.) Section 274(a) and (b) of this act are in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[287 U.S. 32, 41]\n\u00a0\n The Revenue Act, May 29, 1928, 'Title IV, Administrative Provisions,' 45 Stat. 791, 871, 872, c. 854,  601 (26 USCA  1217), amended the above- quoted section 906(e) to read: 'If the assessment or collection of any tax is barred by any statute of limitations, the decision of the Board to that effect shall be considered as its decision that there is no deficiency in respect of such tax.'\n The original complaint in the present cause alleges that the Steel Company's claim for abatement of the additional assessment for the year 1917 was rejected by the Commissioner May 12, 1926, 'for the full amount thereof, whereby there remained unpaid and unabated of the said assessment One Hundred Fifth-three Thousand, Eight Hundred Fifteen Dollars and Thirty Cents $153,815.30), which said finding and determination of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue rejecting said claim for abatement has remained and now is in full force, vigor and effect, unvacated, unreversed and unmodified and is subject to no credits, set-offs or counterclaims other than here- \n\n[287 U.S. 32, 42]\n\u00a0\n inafter set forth.' Petitioners denied this allegation. They maintained that the Commissioner's action had been reversed and the additional taxes abated by the opinion and ruling of the Board of Tax Appeals, and this seems to have been the only point relied upon in the Circuit Court of Appeals which rejected petitioners' theory and approved the challenged judgment on the bond.\n Concerning the Board's action, that court said: 'This is not a finding that the tax or any part of it should be abated. It does not abate any part of it. It is but a formal judgment that the tax, as tax, is, because the bar of limitations has fallen, not collectible. Since it is this and no more, it has the effect upon the suit on the bond here and no more, that the fact found in the Barth case and the legal conclusion there announced, that time had run against the tax and that it was therefore uncollectible, had on the suit on the bond there.'\n The bond in suit must be construed in the light of surrounding circumstances. U.S., for Use of Hill v. American Surety Co., \n200 \nU.S. 197, 203\n, 204 S., 205, 26 S.Ct. 168. They are narrated above.\n As in United States v. John Barth Co., supra, the plain purpose of the first bond, March 13, 1923, was to prevent immediate collection of the assessed additional taxes and to provide against any loss which might follow delay whether through extinguishment of rights under the statute of limitations or otherwise. We think it sufficiently clear that the two succeeding bonds were intended to continue the protection afforded by the first. The taxpayer, having attained its purpose through these bonds, now claims that the United States cannot enforce the obligation which induced the delay contemplated by all parties. It seeks escape through literal construction of a statute evidently designed to protect taxpayers in different circumstances.\n Considering the state of the record, it is only necessary now to pass on one point: Were 'the additional assessments, penalties and interest' 'abated' by the Board of \n\n[287 U.S. 32, 43]\n\u00a0\n Tax Appeals' final determination, within the meaning of the bond in suit? Unless this is answered in the affirmative, the judgment below must stand. There is no suggestion that it should be upset upon any other ground.\n Petitioners maintain that the Board had jurisdiction of the appeal from the Commissioner, that it definitely ruled 'the collection of the deficiency, if any, of income and excess profits taxes for the year 1917 is barred by the Statute of Limitations,' and that the necessary result of this ruling was abatement of the additional assessments, mentioned in the 1925 bond. This conclusion, they say, is inescapable under the clear mandate of section 906(e), Revenue Act of 1924, as amended by the Acts of 1926 and 1928: 'If the assessment or collection of any tax is barred by any statute of limitations, the decision of the Board to that effect shall be considered as its decision that there is no deficiency in respect of such tax.'\n As the provisions of section 906(e) first came into the law after execution of the bond, they could not then have been within contemplation of the parties. The bond of 1925, like the two preceding ones, was given to protect the United States against loss; it referred to the tax liability existing March 13, 1923, $153,815.30, and was intended to guarantee payment of that sum unless reduced or annulled by some future action of the Commissioner. Payment might have been enforced; but the taxpayer claimed the amount assessed was too high and procured further delay for investigation by executing the bond. The possible abatement- partial reduction or annulment-there referred to depended upon the future decision of the Commissioner.\n On appeal to the Board, the taxpayer challenged the assessment as erroneous; also, because under the statute of limitations there remained no right to enforce the tax. As to the first ground, the Board found nothing. It declared only that the statute had run against the right to collect the tax-this upon the taxpayer's prayer. In no \n\n[287 U.S. 32, 44]\n\u00a0\n proper sense was there a redetermination of the deficiency assessed in 1923. The anticipated bar of the tax by the statute could not affect the controversy-was not the point in issue, was not disputed. The bond required payment of a stated sum under the assessment already made, unless this should be abated by the Commissioner. What abatement should be allowed was the matter before him, and a re-examination of his determination was necessarily limited to those matters which might have been presented to him. By the prayer based on the statute of limitations, the taxpayer defeated a determination of the real controversy.\n In the circumstances, possibly, a decision upon the merits might have been regarded as the Commissioner's action within the implication of the bond. The effective scope of the decision rendered is no broader than the issue, opinion, and findings. It left undisturbed the Commissioner's assessment of 1923. This the bond undertook to pay wholly without regard to the right to enforce the tax as such.\n The existence of the bar under the statute, as against the lien or right to enforce the tax as such, was never the subject of controversy-was not denied. And, as the present suit is not to enforce the tax as such, but an obligation given in contemplation of the loss of right to enforce, a decision proclaiming this loss is but announcement of something expected by all parties-an unfruitful pronouncement upon an immaterial point. United States v. John Barth Co., supra. See United States v. Martin Hotel Co. (C.C.A.) 59 F.(2d) 549. As the Board failed to pass upon the Commissioner's refusal to reduce the amount of the assessment, that sum, with interest, etc., now represents what is due upon the bond. The Board expressly disclaimed purpose to rule concerning this obligation-the question was not present. It might, with propriety, have examined the objections to the amount of the 1923 assessment; but the taxpayer asked another course. \n\n[287 U.S. 32, 45]\n\u00a0\n Section 906(e) may find proper application on an ordinary appeal, as for example, where the Commissioner's right to assess is challenged because the statute of limitations had run, or where, as in Bowers v. New York & Albany Lighterage Co., supra, the collector asserts the right to enforce payment by distraint after the statutory bar. It can have no application to what may have been said or done by the Board when undertaking to redetermine a deficiency having no possible relation to the statute of limitations.\n The literal construction of section 906(e) proposed by the petitioners would lead to consequences manifestly unjust, if not absurd. When the bond in suit was executed, the statute had extinguished the right of the United States to enforce the tax as such. That Congress thereafter actually intended to release the parties whenever the Board should declare this fact is beyond belief. The thing announced by the Board had no real relation to the obligation of the bond. When possible, every statute should be rationally interpreted with the view of carrying out the legislative intent. We cannot attribute to Congress the purpose necessary to support petitioners' urgence.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Sec. 274. (a) If in the case of any taxpayer, the Commissioner determines that there is a deficiency in respect of the tax imposed by this title, the Commissioner is authorized to send notice of such deficiency to the taxpayer by registered mail.

Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (d) or (f) of this section or in section 279, 282, or 1001, no assessment of a deficiency in respect of the tax imposed by this title and no distraint or proceeding in court for its collection shall be made, begun, or prosecuted until such notice has been mailed to the taxpayer, nor until the expiration of such 60-day period, nor, if a petition has been filed with the Board, until the decision of the Board has become final.

Gwinn, residents of California, acquired by equal contributions certain property, as joint tenants with the right of survivorship, which they continued to hold until her death, October 5, 1924. He is the beneficiary of the estate and in possession of its assets.\n The Revenue Act approved June 2, 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. 253, 304 (U.S. C., Title 26,  1094; 26 USCA  1094 note) provides: DP Sec. 320.

This was challenged as error. The Board of Tax Appeals upheld the Commissioner and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed its order.\n The petitioner maintains:\n That the word 'before' in subdivision (h), section 302, supra, should be construed as referring only to the period between June 2, 1924, and September 8, 1916, when the first of recent federal estate tax statutes ( 39 Stat. 777) became effective.\n That under the tenancy created in June, 1915, each party acquired immediate joint ownership in the whole property. That his interest therein then became completely vested and no change in title or transfer of interest occurred by reason of the cotenant's death. No interest ceased or passed at the death. The Commissioner is attempting, arbitrarily, capriciously, and in violation of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, to tax something created, transferred, and vested in the survivor prior to the first (1916) federal estate tax law.\n The clear language of the 1924 statute repels the notion that it has no application to joint tenancies created prior to September 8, 1916.

There the death occurred February 9, 1915. Claiming authority under the act of 1913 (St. Cal. 1913, p. 1066), the state controller sought to collect an inheritance tax upon a bank deposit credited to the joint account of the decedent and another in April, 1911. The court declared the transfer to the joint account was \n\n[287 U.S. 224, 227]\n\u00a0\n complete and the title to the fund became vested in the joint tenants when the deposit was made; also 'the rule on the subject is that the question of liability to inheritance taxes must be determined by the law in force at the time the title vests in virtue of the transfer.' And the conclusion was that the law in force in 1911 (St. Cal. 1911, p. 713) 'did not undertake to impose a tax on the right accruing to a surviving joint tenant upon the death of his cotenant.' The claim of the state controller was accordingly rejected and the fund declared not liable to taxation under the Act of 1913\n\n\n This opinion recognizes that some rights accrue 'to a surviving joint tenant upon the death of his cotenant,' and the possibility of taxation by reason of this fact. But it apparently affirms that under the rule approved in California liability for such taxation must be determined according to law in force when the cotenancy is established.\n To support its affirmation concerning this rule, the court cited only Hunt v. Wicht, 174 Cal. 205, 162 P. 639, L.R.A. 1917C, 961. That cause grew out of an effort, after the grantor's death in 1913, to impose a tax under the statute of 1911 on account of the absolute transfer made in 1905 of a present title to real property subject only to a life estate. The ruling was that a tax based on that transaction could not be laid by an after enacted statute. There was no suggestion that the doctrine there accepted could have application if the imposition had relation only to circumstances which would arise in the future. But in no view could the supposed rule limit the power of Congress in respect of federal taxation.\n In Tyler v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 497, 503\n, 504 S., 50 S.Ct. 356, 359, 69 A.L.R. 758, where the question at issue was similar to the one now presented, this court declared:\n'The question here, then, is, not whether there has been, in the strict sense of that word, a 'transfer' of the \n\n[287 U.S. 224, 228]\n\u00a0\n property by the death of the decedent, or a receipt of it by right of succession, but whether the death has brought into being or ripened for the survivor, property rights of such character as to make appropriate the imposition of a tax upon that result (which Congress may call a transfer tax, a death duty or anything else it sees fit), to be measured, in whole or in part, by the value of such rights. ...\n\n'At his (the co-tenant's) death, however, and because of it, she (the survivor), for the first time, became entitled to exclusive possession, use and enjoyment; she ceased to hold the property subject to qualifications imposed by the law relating to tenancy by the entirety, and became entitled to hold and enjoy it absolutely as her own; and then, and then only, she acquired the power, not theretofore possessed, of disposing of the property by an exercise of her sole will. Thus the death of one of the parties to the tenancy became the 'generating source' of important and definite accessions to the property rights of the other. These circumstances, together with the fact, the existence of which the statute requires, that no part of the property originally had belonged to the wife, are sufficient, in our opinion, to make valid the inclusion of the property in the gross estate which forms the primary base for the measurement of the tax.'\n\n Although the property here involved was held under a joint tenancy with the right of survivorship created by the 1915 transfer, the rights of the possible survivor were not then irrevocably fixed since under the state laws the joint estate might have been terminated through voluntary conveyance by either party, through proceedings for partition, by an involuntary alienation under an execution. Col. Code Civ. Procedure,  752; Green v. Skinner, 185 Cal. 435, 197 P. 60; Hilborn v. Soale, 44 Cal.App. 115, 185 P. 982. The right to effect these changes in the estate was not terminated until the cotenant's death. Cessation of this power after enactment of the \n\n[287 U.S. 224, 229]\n\u00a0\n Revenue Act of 1924 presented proper occasion for imposition of the tax. The death became the generating source of definite assessions to the survivor's property rights. Tyler v. United States, supra. See Saltonstall v. Saltonstall, \n276 \nU.S. 260\n, 48 S.Ct. 225; Chase National Bank v. United States, \n278 \nU.S. 327\n, 49 S.Ct. 126, 63 A.L.R. 388; Reinecke v.

UNITED STATES(1932)\nNo. 590\nArgued: March 14, 1932Decided: April 11, 1932\n\n\n\n\n\n[285 U.S. 427, 428]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William E. Leahy, William J. Hughes, Jr., and Lucien H. Van Doren, all of Washington, D. C., for petitioners.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Thomas D. Thaoher, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., for the United States. \n\n[285 U.S. 427, 429]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioners were indicted in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia under section 215 of the Criminal Code, U. S. C., title 18,  338 ( 18 USCA  338), which provides:\n'Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, ... shall, for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice or attempting so to do, place, or cause to be placed, any letter, ... in any post office, ... to be sent or delivered by the post office establishment of the United States, ... or shall knowingly cause to be delivered by mail according to the direction thereon, ... any such letter, ... shall be fined not more than $1,000, or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.'\n\n The indictment charges that petitioners devised and intended to devise a scheme and artifice to defraud the Merchants' Transfer & Storage Company out of its money and property in manner and form set forth; and that 'for the purpose of executing said scheme and artifice, on, to wit, April 19, 1927, did place and cause to be placed in the Post Office at the City of Scranton, in the State of Pennsylvania, to be sent and delivered by the Post Office establishment of the United States of America, to the addressee thereof, three certain accounts enclosed in a certain envelope addressed to Merchants' Transfer and Storage Company, 920 E Street, N. W., Washington, D. C.'\n Petitioners were arraigned, entered pleas of not guilty, and went to trial without challenging the sufficiency of the indictment or the jurisdiction of the court to hear and determine the case. They were found guilty by a jury, and thereupon moved in arrest of judgment upon the ground that the indictment failed to charge any offense within the jurisdiction of the court. The motion was overruled, and petitioners sentenced to pay a fine and \n\n[285 U.S. 427, 430]\n\u00a0\n undergo a term of imprisonment. Upon appeal the judgment was affirmed by the court below. 60 App. D. C. 335, 54 F.(2d) 446.\n The contention is that the indictment charges no offense committed in the District of Columbia, but only an offense committed in Pennsylvania; and, assuming this to be true, that the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia was without jurisdiction. Undoubtedly, the indictment is adequate to charge an offense committed in Pennsylvania; but the question first to be considered is whether, upon this record and upon a motion in arrest of judgment, the indictment may be sustained as also sufficient to charge an offense committed within the District of Columbia. The record brought here does not contain the evidence or any of the trial proceedings. We have before us only the indictment, the fact that petitioners were arraigned, entered pleas, were convicted and sentenced, the motion in arrest of judgment, and the order of the court overruling it, together with the formal docket entries relating thereto.\n The defect said to exist is that the indictment fails to allege specifically that petitioners did 'cause (the letter) to be delivered by mail according to the direction thereon.' Obviously, in this particular, the indictment does not precisely follow the terms of the statute, but it does allege that the letter was deposited in a post office so addressed as to constitute a direction for its delivery to the addressee at a particular place in the District of Columbia. The rule is well settled that proof that a letter properly directed was placed in a post office creates a presumption that it reached its destination in usual time and was actually received by the person to whom it was addressed. Rosenthal v. Walker, \n111 \nU.S. 185, 193\n, 4 S. Ct. 382. And the fact that receipt of the letter subjects the person sending it to a penalty does not alter the rule. Id., page 194 of 111 U. S., 4 S. Ct. 382. If the indictment had alleged actual delivery of the letter in \n\n[285 U.S. 427, 431]\n\u00a0\n question, the case for the government in this particular would have been made out by proof that the letter thus directed had been placed in the post office for transmission. The burden then would have been cast upon petitioners to show the contrary.\n While, therefore, the indictment does not in set terms allege delivery of the letter, a presumption to that effect results from the facts which are alleged. In Ball v. United States, \n140 \nU.S. 118, 133\n, 136 S., 11 S. Ct. 761, it was held that an indictment for murder which fails to allege the time of the death is fatally defective, since to constitute murder it is necessary that death shall occur within a year and a day from the time of the fatal stroke. But it appearing that the indictment then under consideration had been returned less than a year from the day of the assault, the court did not consider the objection fatal to the indictment in his particular, nowithstanding the absence of an allegation of the time of death.\n The rigor of old common-law rules of criminal pleading has yielded, in modern practice, to the general principle that formal defects, not prejudicial, will be disregarded. The true test of the sufficiency of an indictment is not whether it could have been made more definite and certain, but whether it contains the elements of the offense intended to be charged, 'and sufficiently apprises the defendant of what he must be prepared to meet, and, in case any other proceedings are taken against him for a similar offense, whether the record shows with accuracy to what extent he may plead a former acquittal or conviction.' Cochran and Sayre v. United States, \n157 \nU.S. 286, 290\n, 15 S. Ct. 628, 630; Rosen v. United States, \n161 \nU.S. 29, 34\n, 16 S. Ct. 434, 480.\n Section 1025, Revised Statutes (U. S. C., title 18,  556 (18 USCA  556)) provides:\n'No indictment found and presented by a grand jury in any district or other court of the United States shall be deemed insufficient, nor shall the trial, judgment, or \n\n[285 U.S. 427, 432]\n\u00a0\n other proceeding thereon be affected by reason of any defect or imperfection in matter of form only, which shall not tend to the prejudice of the defendant.'\n\n This section was enacted to the end that, while the accused must be afforded full protection, the guilty shall not escape through mere imperfections of pleading. We refer to a few of the many cases where the provision has been applied.\n In Grandi v. United States (C. C. A.) 262 F. 123, 124, the indictment charged the defendant with the receipt and possession of goods knowing they had been stolen from part of a shipment in interstate commerce, but failed to charge that the goods were in fact so stolen. A motion to quash had been denied, on the ground that the defendant could not have been misled to his prejudice. The court said: 'The charge that defendant knew the goods to have been stolen naturally implies that the goods had been in fact stolen. The verdict should not be reversed on account of a defect so obviously technical and unsubstantial.' An indictment under the Espionage Act (40 Stat. 217), which denounces certain acts when the United States is at war, has been upheld, notwithstanding a failure to allege that when the acts were committed the United States was at war, on the ground that the courts would take judicial notice of that fact. Stephens v. United States ( C. C. A.) 261 F. 590; Bouldin v. United States (C. C. A.) 261 F. 674. An indictment for seditious conspiracy under section 6 of the Criminal Code ( 18 USCA  6) must charge that the conspiracy involved an intent to use force; but where the overt act was alleged, with the intent of engaging in armed hostility against the United States by attacking with force and arms, the original intent was necessarily implied and the indictment was sustained, notwithstanding the lack of the specific allegation, since otherwise effect, fatal to the indictment, would be given to a mere imperfection in matter of form, not tending to the prejudice of the defendant. Phipps v. United States (C. C. A.) 251 \n\n[285 U.S. 427, 433]\n\u00a0\n F. 879, 880. Omission from an indictment, drawn under the section of the Criminal Code now under consideration, of a specific allegation that the letter was 'to be sent or delivered by the post office establishment,' was not considered prejudicial, where the indictment sufficiently alleged that the letter was placed in the post office properly addressed. Olsen v. United States (C. C. A.) 287 F. 85, 90. See, also, Cohen v. United States ( C. C. A.) 294 F. 488, 490; Gay v. United States (C. C. A.) 12 F.(2d) 433, 434; Musey v. United States (C. C. A.) 37 F.(2d) 673, 674.\n It, of course, is not the intent of section 1025 to dispense with the rule which requires that the essential elements of an offense must be alleged; but it authorizes the courts to disregard merely loose or inartificial forms of averment. Upon a proceeding after verdict at least, no prejudice being shown, it is enough that the necessary facts appear in any form, or by fair construction can be found within the terms of the indictment.\n In the absence of the evidence and the charge of the court, we are free to assume that every essential element of the offense was sufficiently proved, and that the question as to the delivery of the letter was submitted under appropriate instructions to the jury. The contrary of neither of these propositions is asserted. The indictment in the particular complained of is loosely and inartificially drawn and is not to be commended, but, upon the record before us, and without deciding that the indictment would not have been open to some form of challenge at an earlier stage of the case, we are of opinion that after verdict it is not vulnerable to the attack here made upon it. Dunbar v. United States, \n156 U.S. 185\n, 191 et seq., 15 S. Ct. 325. Compare Pierce v. Creecy, \n210 \nU.S. 387, 401\n, 402 S., 28 S. Ct. 714; Ex parte Pierce (C. C.) 155 F. 663, 665; United States v. Barber (D. C.) 157 F. 889, 891.\n In view of this conclusion, it becomes unnecessary to consider the further question whether the trial court had \n\n[285 U.S. 427, 434]\n\u00a0\n jurisdiction to try the indictment, if construed as charging the commission of an offense only in Pennsylvania.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","75":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHANDY v.

Following a claim for refund and its rejection, the executor brought this action to recover the amount of the tax attributable to such inclusion. The trial court found that in fact none of the transfers had been made in contemplation of death, and rendered judgment for the executor for the amount claimed, on the ground that section 302(c) 26 USCA  1094(c) violated the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, and was therefore unconstitutional.\n\n Our decision in No. 514 requires an affirmative answer to the question submitted.\n It is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","76":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHARDEMAN v.

Herold, of Shreveport, La., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought by petitioner in the District Court for western Louisiana against respondent to have the former adjudged the beneficial owner of a permit issued May 6, 1925, by the Secretary of the Interior to respondent under section 13 of the Leasing Act,1 granting the latter the right to prospect for oil and gas upon 40 acres of land in that state. That court entered a decree for petitioner. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. 51 F. (2d) 450.\n Section 13 authorizes the Secretary, under such necessary and proper rules and regulations as he may prescribe, to grant to an applicant qualified under the act a permit to prospect for oil or gas upon land wherein the deposits belong to the United States and are not within a known geological structure of a producing oil or gas field. It provides that, if one shall cause to be erected upon the land for which the permit is sought a monument and shall post a notice in specified form, he shall during the period of 30 days thereafter be entitled to a preference right over others to a permit on the land so identified. A regulation (section 5( b), 47 L. D. 441) declares that, if no application is filed within that time, the land will be subject to any other application or to other disposal. Pursuant to authority given him by section 38 (30 USCA  194), the Secretary prescribed a schedule of fees and commissions for transactions under the act: For receiving and acting on each application for a permit filed in the district land office there shall be charged a fee in no case to be less than $10, to be paid \n\n[286 U.S. 444, 446]\n\u00a0\n by the applicant and considered as earned when paid, and to be credited in equal parts on the compensation of the register and receiver. Section 31(a ), p. 461.\n On November 12, 1923, respondent, complying with the law and regulations, applied for a permit to prospect upon the land and paid the required amount. December 11, petitioner, claiming the preference right given by the act, filed an application for a permit to prospect upon the same tract. The substance of the application was that on November 11 he had erected the monument and posted a notice on the land as required by the statute. But he did not tender or pay the required fee until December 19. In the contest that followed it was finally held in an opinion promulgated by the Secretary that, petitioner having failed to pay the required amount within the time allowed, respondent was entitled to have the permit, 51 L. D. 36.\n Petitioner's application was later than respondent's, and he had no ground upon which to claim a permit in the absence of a preference right. In order to secure that right, full compliance with the law and regulations was necessary. The declaration that the fee is for 'receiving and acting' on the application and is 'to be considered as earned when paid' strongly confirms the inference, which would exist without it, that payment is essential to the completion of the application. When the 30 days expired, petitioner's preference right was at an end, and the land was subject to respondent's application for a permit.\n As the Secretary rightly held petitioner not entitled to the permit, he has no standing to maintain this suit.

Burkes agreed with the investment company, owner of certain land in Natchez, Miss., to construct a hotel thereon. The contract contains the following clauses:\n'Article 30. Guaranty Bond.-The Owner shall have the right, prior to the signing of the contract, to require the Contractor to furnish bond covering the faithful performance of the Contract and the payment of all obligations arising thereunder, in such form as the Owner may prescribe with such sureties as he may approve. If such bond is required by instructions given previous to the submission of bids, the premium shall be paid by the Contractor; if subsequent thereto it shall be paid by the Owner.'\n\n\n\n[285 U.S. 169, 175]\n\u00a0\n 'Obligations of Bondsmen.-The Contractor's bondsmen shall obligate themselves to all the terms and covenants of these specifications, and of the contracts covering the work executed hereunder, and the Owner and the Architect reserve the right to make all desired changes, alterations, and additions, under the conditions and in the manner hereinbefore described, without in any measure affecting the liability of the bondsmen or releasing them from any of their obligations hereunder.'\n October 20, 1926, the Burkes gave a bond for $316,822, payable to the investment company with appellant as surety. Among other things this provides:\n'Whereas, the Principal and the Obligee have entered into a certain written contract (hereinafter called the contract) dated October 18th, 1926, To construct 'Eola Hotel' building as per plans and specifications No. 640 as prepared by Weiss & Dreyfus, Architects, New Orleans, La., a copy of which is or may be attached hereto, and is hereby referred to and made a part hereof. Now, therefore, the condition of this obligation is such that if the principal shall indemnify the obligee against loss or damage directly caused by the failure of the principal faithfully to perform the contract, then this obligation shall be null and void; otherwise it shall remain in force; provided, however, this bond is executed by the surety, upon the following express conditions, which shall be precedent to the right of recovery hereunder.'\n\n'1. ...\n\n'11. No right or action shall accrue upon or by reason hereof, to or for the use or benefit of any one other than the obligee named herein; and the obligation of the surety is and shall be construed strictly as one of suretyship only.'\n\n Payments to the contractors were made as required by the building contract but they failed to satisfy claims for material furnished by Bunn Electric Company and others. The latter notified the investment company. There \n\n[285 U.S. 169, 176]\n\u00a0\n upon, it instituted a proceeding in the chancery court, Adams county, Miss ., against the contractors, the appellant Hartford Accident & Indemnity Company, and many unpaid materialmen. The bill prayed for a decree declaring the indemntiy bond to be one for faithful performance of the building contract and subject to the rights and liabilities provided by section 3,1 chapter 128, Mississippi Laws of 1918 (section 2598, Hemingway's Miss. Code 1927); also for judgments in favor of those who had furnished materials, etc.\n The materialmen answered. Also by cross-bill and interventions they set up their claims and asked for judgments against the contractors and appellant here, surety upon the bond. The chancellor gave judgments in favor of the cross-complainants as prayed. The indemnity company appealed. The Supreme Court approved upon the view that section 3, chapter 128, Mississippi Laws 1918, applied and controlled the obligation of the bond. Hartford Accident & Indemnity Co. v. Natchez Inv. Co., 132 So. 535. It ordered that the materialmen severally 'do have and recover of and from the appellant Hartford Accident & Indemnity Company, and of AEtna Casualty & Surety \n\n[285 U.S. 169, 177]\n\u00a0\n Company, surety in the appeal bond,' the sums found to be due them.\n Upon petition of the Hartford Accident & Indemnity Company alone, the Chief Justice of Mississippi allowed an appeal to this court July 25, 1931. The AEtna Casualty & Surety Company did not join in the appeal; there was no summons and severance nor any notice equivalent thereto.\n The assignment of errors challenges the validity, under the Federal Constitution, of section 3, chapter 128, Mississippi Laws, above cited, as construed and applied.\n December 4, 1931, the appellees entered a motion here to dismiss the appeal. They maintain that the judgments in the Mississippi Supreme Court against appellant and AEtna Casualty & Surety Company were joint; the latter company did not join in the appeal; there was no summons and severance; consequently this Court is without jurisdiction.\n December 23, 1931, appellant and the AEtna Company asked that the latter be made party to the appeal and for proper amendments to that end.\n The motion to amend must be overruled. The motion to dismiss is sustained.\n The challenged judgment became final June 15, 1931, more than six months before the AEtna Company applied here for permission to become a party to the pending appeal. If this application and the accompanying motion to amend were granted, the practical effect would be to permit an appeal by a party to a judgment after the prescribed time had expired.\n The statute (Act of Feb. 13, 1925, c. 229,  8, 43 Stat. 940, 28 USCA  350) provides: 'No writ of error, appeal, or writ of certiorari, intended to bring any judgment or decree before the Supreme Court for re- \n\n[285 U.S. 169, 178]\n\u00a0\n view shall be allowed or entertained unless application therefor be duly made within three months after the entry of such judgment or decree. ...'

In matters of this kind we may not disregard the face of the record and treat the judgment as something other than it appears to be. So to do probably would lead to much confusion and uncertainty.\n Haseltine v. Central Nat. Bank, \n183 \nU.S. 130, 131\n, 22 S. Ct. 49, 50: 'We have frequently held that a judgment reversing that of the court below, and remanding the case for further proceedings, is not one to which a writ of error will lie. ... While the judgment may dispose of the case as presented, it is impossible to anticipate its ultimate disposition. It may be voluntarily discontinued, or it may happen that the defeated party may amend his pleading by supplying some discovered defect, and go to trial upon new evidence. To determine whether, in a particular case, this may or may not be done, might involve an examination, not only of the record, but even of the evidence in the court of original jurisdiction, and lead to inquiries with regard to the actual final disposition of the case by the supreme court, which it might be difficult to answer. We have, therefore, always made the face of the judgment the test of its finality, and refused to inquire whether, in case of a new trial, the defeated party would stand in a position to make a better case. The plaintiffs in the case under consideration could have secured an immediate review by this court, if the \n\n[285 U.S. 169, 179]\n\u00a0\n court as a part of its judgment of reversal had ordered the circuit court to dismiss their petition, when, under Mower v. Fletcher (\n114 \nU.S. 127\n, 5 S. Ct. 799), they might have sued out a writ of error at once.'\n Norfolk & S. Turnpike Co. v. Virginia, \n225 \nU.S. 264, 268\n, 269 S., 32 S. Ct. 828, 830. The question was: To which state court should the writ of error run? This Court said: 'The difference between the cases, however, is not one of principle, but solely depends upon the significance to be attributed to the particular form in which the action of the court below is manifested. In other words, the apparent want of harmony between the rulings of this court has undoubtedly arisen from the varying forms in which state courts have expressed their action in refusing to entertain an appeal from or to allow a writ of error to a lower court, and the ever-present desire of this court to so shape its action as to give effect to the decisions of the courts of last resort of the several states on a subject peculiarly within their final cognizance. A like want of harmony resulted from similar conditions involved in determining what was a final judgmnet of a state court, susceptible of being reviewed here, and the confusion which arose ultimately led to the ruling that the face of the judgment would be the criterion resorted to as the only available means of obviating the great risk of confusion which would inevitably arise from departing from the face of the record and deducing the principle of finality by a consideration of questions beyond the face of the alleged judgment or decree which was sought to be reviewed. The wisdom of that rule, as applied to a question like the one before us, is, we think, apparent by the statement which we have made concerning the rule in the Crovo Case (\n220 \nU.S. 364\n, 31 S. Ct. 399), and the previous decisions.'\n See Estis v. Trabue, \n128 \nU.S. 225, 229\n, 9 S. Ct. 58; Schlosser v. Hemphill, \n198 \nU.S. 173, 175\n, 25 S. Ct. 654; Louisiana Navigation Co. v. Oyster Commission, \n226 \nU.S. 99, 101\n, 33 S. Ct. 78; Second Nat. Bank \n\n[285 U.S. 169, 180]\n\u00a0\n v. First Nat. Bank, \n242 \nU.S. 600, 602\n, 37 S. Ct. 236; Bruce v. Tobin, \n245 \nU.S. 18, 19\n, 38 S. Ct. 7; Matthews v. Huwe, \n269 \nU.S. 262, 264\n, 46 S. Ct. 108.\n Masterson v. Herndon, 10 Wall, 416, 417, held: 'It is the established doctrine of this court that in cases at law, where the judgment is joint, all the parties against whom it is rendered must join in the writ of error; and in chancery cases, all the parties against whom a joint decree is rendered must join in the appeal, or they will be dismissed. There are two reasons for this: 1. That the successful party may be at liberty to proceed in the enforcement of his judgment or decree against the parties who do not desire to have it reviewed. 2. That the appellate tribunal shall not be required to decide a second or third time the same question on the same record. ... One of the effects of this judgment of severance was to bar the party who refused to proceed, from prosecuting the same right in another action, as the defendant could not be harassed by two separate actions on a joint obligation, or on account of the same cause of action, it being joint in its nature.'\n In Estis v. Trabue, \n128 U.S. 225\n, 9  Ct. 58, 59, an attachment was levied upon certain personalty. After the return Estis, Doan & Co. claimed the property and they gave a forthcoming bond with two sureties. The challenged judgment ruled 'that the plaintiffs recover of the claimants and C. F. Robinson and John W. Dillard, their sureties in their forthcoming bond, the sum of six thousand and three hundred dollars, together with the costs, etc.' This Court held: 'The judgment is distinctly one against 'the claimants, and C. F. Robinson and John W. Dillard, their sureties in their forthcoming bond,' jointly, for a definite sum of money. There is nothing distributive in the judgment, so that it can be regarded as containing a separate judgment against the claimants and another separate judgment against the sureties, or as containing a judgment against the sureties payable and en- \n\n[285 U.S. 169, 181]\n\u00a0\n forceable only on a failure to recover the amount from the claimants; and execution is awarded against all of the parties jointly. In such a case the sureties have the right to a writ of error. Ex parte Sawyer, 21 Wall. 235, 240 (22 L. Ed. 617). It is well settled that all the parties against whom a judgment of this kind is entered must join in a writ of error, if any one of them takes out such writ; or else there must be a proper summons and severance, in order to allow of the prosecution of the writ by any less than the whole number of the defendants against whom the judgment is entered.'\n Mason v. United States, \n136 \nU.S. 581\n, 10 S. Ct. 1062. A postmaster and the sureties on his official bond were sued jointly. He and some of the sureties appeared and defended. The suit was abated as to two of the sureties, who had died. The others defaulted, and judgment of default went against them. On the trial there was a verdict for the plaintiff, whereupon, July 14, 1886, judgment was entered against the principal and all the sureties. The sureties who had appeared sued out a writ of error to this judgment, without joining the principal or the sureties who had made default and the record came here. May 5, 1890, and after expiration of the two years within which the statute then permitted the suing out of such writs, the plaintiff in error moved to amend the writ by adding the omitted parties as complainants, or for a severance of the parties, and it was held that the motion must be denied and the writ of error be dismissed.\n Hardee v. Wilson, \n146 \nU.S. 179, 180\n, 13 S. Ct. 39, cited earlier cases and declared: 'Undoubtedly the general rule is that all the parties defendant, where the decree is a joint one, must join in the appeal.' See also Davis v. Mercantile Trust Co., \n152 \nU.S. 590\n, 14 S. Ct. 693; Garcia v. Vela, \n216 \nU.S. 598, 601\n, 30 S. Ct. 439; Hughes' Federal Practice,  6153\n\n\n The New York, 104 F. 561, 562 (Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit, October 13, 1900), is said to support the view that in the circumstances here presented summons and sever- \n\n[285 U.S. 169, 182]\n\u00a0\n ance was unnecessary. The proceeding was a cause in admiralty. The surety upon a stipulation for release of the vessel did not join in the appeal. Upon motion to dismiss, the court said: 'It is well settled that all parties against whom a joint judgmnet or decree is rendered must join in proceedings for review in an appellate court, or that it must appear that those who have not joined had notice of the application for the appeal or writ of error, and refused or neglected to join therein.' But it ruled that, though joint in form, the decree was separable in law and fact and, therefore, the surety was not a necessary party to the appeal.\n Considering former opinions of this Court and the long-established practice, we cannot accept as applicable to appeals here the doctrine approved in The New York. It is out of harmony with Estis v. Trabue, supra, and other cases cited above. We cannot undertake to explore the record to ascertain what issues were relied upon in courts below. So to do would lead to uncertainty and unfortunate confusion. We must accept the terms of the judgment as entered. As pointed out above, this is the approved practice when it becomes necessary to determine whether a judgment is final or to what court a writ of error should run. Like reasons apply and control here.\n The appeal must be dismissed.\n Dismissed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Chapter 128, Mississippi Laws of 1918. 'Sec. 3.

DONNAN(1932)\nNo. 514\nArgued: February 26, 1932Decided: March 21, 1932\n\n\n\n\n[285 U.S. 312, 313]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. G. A. Youngquist, Asst. Atty. Gen., for heiner.\n\n\n[285 U.S. 312, 317]\n\u00a0\n Mr. William G. Heiner, of Pittsburgh, Pa., for Donnan and others.\n\n\n[285 U.S. 312, 320]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case is here on a certificate from the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. On March 1, 1927, John W. Donnan, by complete and irrevocable gift inter vivos, transferred without consideration certain securities to trustees for his four children, and also, without consideration, advanced a sum of money to his son. He died on December 23, 1928, less than two years after the gifts and advancement were made. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue included in the gross estate of decedent the value of the property transferred, and imposed a death transfer tax accordingly, on authority of the clause in section 302(c) of the Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, 70 (U. S. C., Supp. V, Title 26,  1094 ( 26 USCA  1094(c))), which, without regard to the fact, provides that such a transfer made within two years prior to the death of the decedent shall 'be deemed and held to have been made in contemplation of death within the meaning of this title.' \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[285 U.S. 312, 321]\n\u00a0\n\n'1. Does the second sentence of section 302(c) of the revenue act of 1926 violate the due process clause of the fifth amendment to the Constitution of the United States?\n\n'2. If the answer to the first question be in the negative, is the second sentence of section 302(c) of the revenue act of 1926 void because repugnant to sections 1111, 1113(a), 1117, and 1122(c) of the same act?' \n\n[285 U.S. 312, 322]\n\u00a0\n A negative answer to the first question, if made, must rest either upon the ground that Congress has the constitutional power to deny to the representatives of the estate of a decedent the right to show by competent evidence that a gift made within two years prior to the death of the decedent was in fact not made in contemplation of death, or upon the theory that, although the tax in question is imposed as a death transfer tax, it nevertheless may be sustained as a gift tax.\n\n First. Section 301(a) of the Revenue Act of 1926 (26 USCA  1092) imposes a tax 'upon the transfer of the net estate of every decedent,' etc. There can be no doubt as to the meaning of this language. The thing taxed is the transmission of property from the dead to the living. It does not include pure gifts inter vivos. The tax rests, in essence, 'upon the principle that death is the generating source from which the particular taxing power takes its being, and that it is the power to transmit, or the transmission from the dead to the living, on which such taxes are more immediately rested. ... It is the power to transmit or the transmission or receipt of property by death which is the subject levied upon by all death duties.' Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 \nU.S. 41, 56\n, 57 S., 20 S. Ct. 747, 753. The value of property transferred without consideration and in contemplation of death is included in the value of the gross estate of the decedent for the purposes of a death tax, because the transfer is considered to be testamentary in effect. Milliken v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 15, 23\n, 51 S. Ct. 324. But such a transfer, not so made, embodies a transaction begun and completed wholly by and between the living, taxable as a gift (Bromley v. McCaughn, \n280 \nU.S. 124\n, 50 S. Ct. 46), but obviously not subject to any form of death duty, since it bears no relation whatever to death. The 'generating source' of such a gift is to be found in the facts of life and not in the circumstance of death. And the death afterward of the donor in no way changes the situation; that is to say, the \n\n[285 U.S. 312, 323]\n\u00a0\n death does not result in a shifting, or in the completion of a shifting, to the donee of any economic benefit of property, which is the subject of a death tax, Chase Nat. Bank v. United States, \n278 \nU.S. 327, 338\n, 49 S. Ct. 126, 63 A. L. R. 388; Reinecke v. Trust Co., \n278 \nU.S. 339, 346\n, 49 S. Ct. 123, 66 A. L. R. 397; Saltonstall v. Saltonstall, \n276 \nU.S. 260, 271\n, 48 S. Ct. 225; nor does the death in such case bring into being, or ripen for the donee or any one else, so far as the gift is concerned, any property right or interest which can be the subject of any form of death tax. Compare Tyler v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 497, 503\n, 50 S. Ct. 356, 69 A. L. R. 758. Complete ownership of the gift, together with all its incidents, has passed during the life of both donor and donee, and no interest of any kind remains to pass to one or cease in the other in consequence of the death which happens afterward.\n The phrase 'in contemplation of or intended to take effect ... at or after his death,' found in the provisions of section 302(c) of the act of 1926 and prior acts, as applied to fully executed gifts inter vivos, puts them in the same category for purpose of taxation with gifts causa mortis. In this light, the meaning and purpose of the provision were considered, in a recent decision of this court dealing with the Revenue Act of 1918 (40 Stat. 1057). United States v. Wells, \n283 \nU.S. 102, 116\n, 117 S., 118, 51 S. Ct. 446, 451.\n'The dominant purpose is to reach substitutes for testamentary dispositions and thus to prevent the evasion of the estate tax. Nichols v. Coolidge, \n274 \nU.S. 531, 542\n, 47 S. Ct. 710, 52 A. L. R. 1081; Milliken v. United States, 28o U. S. 15, 51 S. Ct. 324. As the transfer may otherwise have all the indicia of a valid gift inter vivos, the differentiating factor must be found in the transferor's motive. Death must be 'contemplated,' that is, the motive which induces the transfer must be of the sort which leads to testamentary disposition. As a condition of body and mind that naturally gives rise to the feeling that death is near, that the donor is about to reach the moment of inevitable surrender of ownership, \n\n[285 U.S. 312, 324]\n\u00a0\n is most likely to prompt such a disposition to those who are deemed to be the proper objects of his bounty, the evidence of the existence or nonexistence of such a condition at the time of the gift is obviously of great importance in determining whether it is made in contemplation of death. The natural and reasonable inference which may be drawn from the fact that but a short period intervenes between the transfer and death is recognized by the statutory provision creating a presumption in the case of gifts within two years prior to death. But this presumption, by the statute before us (Act of 1918), is expressly stated to be a rebuttable one, and the mere fact that death ensues even shortly after the gift does not determine absolutely that it is in contemplation of death. The question, necessarily, is as to the state of mind of the donor. ...\n\n'If it is the thought of death, as a controlling motive prompting the disposition of property, that affords the test, it follows that the statute does not embrace gifts inter vivos which spring from a different motive. Such transfers were made the subject of a distinct gift tax, since repealed.'\n\n There is no doubt of the power of Congress to provide for including in the gross estate of a decedent, for purposes of the death tax, the value of gifts made in contemplation of death; and likewise no doubt of the power of that body to create a rebuttable presumption that gifts made within a period of two years prior to death are made in contemplation thereof. But the presumption here created is not of that kind. It is made definitely conclusive-incapable of being overcome by proof of the most positive character. Thus stated, the first question submitted is answered in the affirmative by Schlesinger v. Wisconsin, \n270 \nU.S. 230\n, 46 S. Ct. 260, 43 A. L. R. 1224, and Hoeper v. Tax Commission, \n284 \nU.S. 206\n, 52 S. Ct. 120. The only difference between the present \n\n[285 U.S. 312, 325]\n\u00a0\n case and the Schlesinger Case is that there the statute fixed a period of six years as limiting the application of the presumption, while here it is fixed at two; and there the Fourteenth Amendment was involved, while here it is the Fifth Amendment. The length of time was not a factor in the case. The presumption was held invalid upon the ground that the statute made it conclusive without regard to actualities, while like gifts at other times were not thus treated; and that there was no adequate basis for such a distinction. 'The presumption and consequent taxation,' the court said ( page 240 of 270 U. S., 46 S. Ct. 260, 261), 'are defended upon the theory that, exercising judgment and discretion, the Legislature found them necessary in order to prevent evasion of inheritance taxes. That is to say, A. may be required to submit to an exactment forbidden by the Constitution if this seems necessary in order to enable the state readily to collect lawful charges against B. Rights guaranteed by the federal Constitution are not to be so lightly treated; they are superior to this supposed necessity. The state is forbidden to deny due process of law or the equal protection of the laws for any purpose whatsoever.'\n The Schlesinger Case has since been applied many times by the lower federal courts, by the Board of Tax Appeals, and by state courts;2 and none of them seem to have been at any loss to understand the basis of the decision, namely, that a statute which imposes a tax upon an assumption of fact which the taxpayer is forbidden to controvert is so arbitrary and unreasonable that it cannot stand under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n\n[285 U.S. 312, 326]\n\u00a0\n Nor is it material that the Fourteenth Amendment was involved in the Schlesinger Case, instead of the Fifth Amendment, as here. The restraint imposed upon legislation by the due process clauses of the two amendments is the same. Coolidge v. Long, \n282 \nU.S. 582, 596\n, 51 S. Ct. 306, 75 L. Ed ., 562. That a federal statute passed under the taxing power may be so arbitrary, and capricious as to cause it to fall before the due process of law clause of the Fifth Amendment is settled. Nichols v. Coolidge, \n274 \nU.S. 531, 542\n, 47 S. Ct. 710, 52 A. L. R. 1081; Brushaber v. Union Pac. R. R. Co., \n240 U.S. 1\n, 24-25, 36 S. Ct. 236, L. R. A. 1917D, 414, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 713; Tyler v. United States, supra, \n281 \nU.S. 504\n, 50 S. Ct. 356, 69 A. L. R. 758.\n In Hoeper v. Tax Commission, supra, this court had before it for consideration a statute of Wisconsin which provided that, in computing the amount of income taxes payable by persons residing together as members of a family, the income of the wife should be added to that of the husband and assessed to and payable by him. We held that, since in law and in fact the wife's income was her separate property, the state was without power to measure his tax in part by the income of his wife. At page 215 of 284 U. S., 52 S. Ct. 120, 122, we said: 'We have no doubt that, because of the fundamental conceptions which underlie our system, any attempt by a state to measure the tax on one person's property or income by reference to the property or income of another is contrary to due process of law as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. That which is not in fact the taxpayer's income cannot be made such by calling it income. Compare Nichols v. Coolidge, \n274 \nU.S. 531, 540\n, 47 S. Ct. 710, 52 A. L. R. 1081.'\n The suggestion of the state court that the provision was valid as necessary to prevent frauds and evasions of the tax by married persons was definitely rejected on the ground that such claimed necessity could not justify an otherwise unconstitutional exaction.\n In substance and effect, the situation presented in the Hoeper Case is the same as that presented here. In the \n\n[285 U.S. 312, 327]\n\u00a0\n first place, the tax, in part, is laid in respect of property shown not to have been transferred in contemplation of death and the complete title to which had passed to the donee during the lifetime of the donor; and, secondly, the tax is not laid upon the transfer of the gift or in respect of its value. It is laid upon the transfer, and calculated upon the value, of the estate of the decedent, such value being enhanced by the fictitious inclusion of the gift, and the estate made liable for a tax computed upon that value. Moreover, under the statute the value of the gift when made is to be ignored, and its value arbitrarily fixed as of the date of the donor's death. The result is that upon those who succeed to the decedent's estate there is imposed the burden of a tax, measured in part by property which comprises no portion of the estate, to which the estate is in no way related, and from which the estate derives no benefit of any description. Plainly, this is to measure the tax on A's property by imputing to it in part the value of the property of B, a result which both the Schlesinger and Hoeper Cases condemn as arbitrary and a denial of due process of law. Such an exaction is not taxation but spoliation. 'It is not taxation that government should take from one the profits and gains of another. That is taxation which compels one to pay for the support of the government from his own gains and of his own property.' United States v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 17 Wall. 322, 326.\n The presumption here excludes consideration of every fact and circumstance tending to show the real motive of the donor. The young man in abounding health, bereft of life by a stroke of lightning within two years after making a gift, is conclusively presumed to have acted under the inducement of the thought of death, equally with the old and ailing who already stands in the shadow of the inevitable end. And, although the tax explicitly is based upon the circumstance that the thought of death must be in impelling cause of the transfer (United \n\n[285 U.S. 312, 328]\n\u00a0\n States v. Wells, supra, \n283 \nU.S. 118\n, 51 S. Ct. 446), the presumption, nevertheless, precludes the ascertainment of the truth in respect of that requisite upon which the liability is made to rest, with the result, in the present case and in many others, of putting upon an estate the burden of a tax measured in part by the value of property never owned by the estate of in the remotest degree connected with the death which brought it into existence. Such a statute is more arbitrary and less defensible against attack than one imposing arbitrarily retroactive taxes, which this court has decided to be in clear violation of the Fifth Amendment. As said by Judge Learned Hand in Frew v. Bowers (C. C. A.) 12 F.( 2d) 625, 630: 'Such a law is far more capricious than merely retroactive taxes. Those do indeed impose unexpected burdens, but at least they distribute them in accordance with the taxpayer's wealth. But this section distributes them in accordance with another's wealth; that is a far more grievous injustice.'\n To sustain the validity of this irrebuttable presumption, it is argued, with apparent conviction, that under the prima facie presumption originally in force there had been a loss of revenue, and decisions holding that particular gifts were not made in contemplation of death are cited. This is very near to saying that the individual, innocent of evasion, may be stripped of his constitutional rights in order to further a more thorough enforcement of the tax against the guilty, a new and startling doctrine, condemned by its mere statement, and distinctly repudiated by this court in the Schlesinger (\n270 \nU.S. 240\n, 46 S. Ct. 260, 43 A. L. R. 1224) and Hoeper (\n284 \nU.S. 217\n, 52 S. Ct. 120) Cases involving similar situations. Both emphatically declared that such rights were superior to this supposed necessity.\n The government makes the point that the conclusive presumption created by the statute is a rule of substantive law, and, regarded as such, should be upheld; and decisions tending to support that view are cited. The \n\n[285 U.S. 312, 329]\n\u00a0\n earlier revenue acts created a prima facie presumption, which was made irrebuttable by the later act of 1926. A rebuttable presumption clearly is a rule of evidence which has the effect of shifting the burden of proof, Mobile, J. & K. C. R. Co. v. Turnipseed, \n219 \nU.S. 35, 43\n, 31 S. Ct. 136, 32 L. R. A. (N. S.) 226, Ann. Cas. 1912A, 463; and it is hard to seen how a statutory rebuttable presumptions is turned from a rule of evidence into a rule of substantive law as the result of a later statute making it conclusive. In both cases it is a substitute for proof; in the one open to challenge and disproof, and in the other conclusive. However, whether the latter presumption be treated as a rule of evidence or of substantive law, it constitutes an attempt, by legislative fiat, to enact into existence a fact which here does not, and cannot be made to, exist in actuality, and the result is the same, unless we are ready to overrule the Schlesinger Case, as we are not; for that case dealt with a conclusive presumption, and the court held it invalid without regard to the question of its technical characterization. This court has held more than once that a statute creating a presumption which operates to deny a fair opportunity to rebut it violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. For example, Bailey v. Alabama, \n219 U.S. 219\n, 238, et seq., 31 S. Ct. 145; Manley v. Georgia, \n279 U.S. 1\n, 5-6, 49 S. Ct. 215. 'It is apparent,' this court said in the Bailey Case (\n219 \nU.S. 239\n, 31 S. Ct. 145, 151) 'that a constitutional prohibition cannot be transgressed indirectly by the creation of a statutory presumption any more than it can be violated by direct enactment. The power to create presumptions is not a means of escape from constitutional restrictions.'\n If a legislative body is without power to enact as a rule of evidence a statute denying a litigant the right to prove the facts of his case, certainly the power cannot be made to emerge by putting the enactment in the guise of a rule of substantive law.\n\n\n[285 U.S. 312, 330]\n\u00a0\n Second. The provision in question cannot be sustained as imposing a gift tax, (1) because the intent of Congress to enact the provision as an incident of the death tax and not as a gift tax is unmistakable; and (2) because, if construed as imposing a gift tax, it is in that aspect still so arbitrary and capricious as to cause it to fall within the ban of the due process caluse of the Fifth Amendment.\n\n 1. \nThe intent of Congress to include gifts made in contemplation of death as integral parts of the decedent's estate for the purposes of the death tax only is so clear as, reasonably, to preclude argument to the contrary. In United States v. Wells, supra, this court held, as already shown, that, since it is the thought of death, as a controlling motive prompting the gift, that affords the test whether it is made in contemplation of death, 'it follows that the statute does not embrace gifts inter vivos which spring from a different motive. Such transfers were made the subject of a distinct gift tax, since repealed.' And see Reinecke v. Trust Co., supra, at page 347 of 278 U. S., 49 S. Ct. 123. It is significant that the repeal of the gift tax referred to was made by the same act (c. 27,  1200(a), 44 Stat. 9, 125 (26 USCA  1a note)), which contains the provision here in question. The tax is imposed upon the transfer of the net estate, but it is first necessary to ascertain the value of the gross estate, and the statute provides that this is to be determined by including, among other things, the value of any interest in property of which the decedent has at any time made a transfer in contemplation of his death. The statute requires that this value shall be determined as of the time of the decedent's death, without regard to the value of the gift when received. The event upon which the tax is made to depend is not the transfer of the gift, but the transfer of the estate of the decedent. The tax falls upon the estate and not upon the gift, and is computed, not upon the value of the gift, but, by progressively \n\n[285 U.S. 312, 331]\n\u00a0\n graduated percentages, upon the value of the entire estate. It is so apparent from a consideration of these features of the statute that Congress could not have had, even remotely, in mind the imposition of a gift tax, that to construe the provision in question as imposing such a tax is to disregard the plain language and the plain intent of the act. For this court to do so would be to enact a law under the pretense of construing one, and thus pronounce itself guilty of a flagrant perversion of the judicial power.\n\n 2. \nBut if we assume, contrary to what is reasonsable, that a gift tax is imposed by providing that the value of property transferred without consideration by a decedent within two years prior to his death shall be included in the value of the gross estate, the case for the government is not better. In the Schlesinger Case, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin had expressly held that the tax could not be supported as one on gifts inter vivos only, saying: 'Under such taxation the classifiction is wholly arbitrary and void. We perceive no more reason why such gifts inter vivos should be taxed than gifts made within six years of marriage or any other event. It is because only one class of gifts closely connected with and a part of the inheritance tax law is created that the law becomes valid.' Estate of Schlesinger, 184 Wis. 1, 10, 199 N. W. 951. This court accepted that view in these words (page 239 of 270 U. S., 46 S. Ct. 260, 261): 'The court below declared that a tax on gifts inter vivos only could not be so laid as to hit those made within six years of the donor's death and exempt all others-this would be 'wholly arbitrary.' We agree with this view and are of opinion that such a classification would be in plain conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment.' And it follows that the present provision, written in almost identical terms, is in plain conflict with the Fifth Amendment. The provisions of the statute referred to in the preceding paragraph of this opinion necessarily condition the tax, however it be char- \n\n[285 U.S. 312, 332]\n\u00a0\n acterized. If it be a gift tax, it, nevertheless, is based, not upon the transfer of the gift, but upon the transfer of the estate; and upon the value of the estate, and not that of the gift. Obviously these are bases having no relation whatever to the gift. Moreover, the value of the gift is not to be determined as of the time when made, but, considered as a part of the estate, is to be fixed as of the date of the decedent's death- a condition so obviously arbitrary and capricious as, by itself, to condemn the tax, viewed as a gift tax, as violative of due process. It is to be paid by the beneficiaries of the decedent, although it is impossible for them to share in the gift which has passed beyond recall. It is therefore a contribution to the government exacted of one person, based pro tanto upon the wealth of another.\n Considered as a gift tax, these conditions demonstrate the entire lack of relation between the taxpayer and the transfer which is the subject of the tax. They disclose that there is no rational ground for measuring the tax, considered as a gift tax and not as a death tax, by the value of an estate coming into being after the gift has become complete and irrevocable, and of which the gift comprises no part. And they show that to impose liability for the tax, as a gift tax, upon the estate, as they in terms require, is, in effect, to exact tribute from the gains or property of one measured by the gains or property of another.\n The first question must be answered in the affirmative, and this makes it unnecessary to answer the second.\n It is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE.\n I think the tax involved in this and its companion case, No. 546, Handy, Collector, v. Delaware Trust Company, \n285 \nU.S. 352\n, 52 S. Ct. 371, 76 L. Ed. -, is in all respects \n\n[285 U.S. 312, 333]\n\u00a0\n valid, and that the certified questions in both cases should be answered in the negative.\n The present federal estate tax, enacted in 1916, Title 2 of the Revenue Act of 1916, c. 463, 39 Stat. 777, has been continued in each successive Revenue Act. Although levied upon the privilege of transferring property passing at death and imposed on the estates of decedents, the prescribed tax was not limited to such transfers. By section 202(b) and (c) of the 1916 act, it was extended to gifts inter vivos, made in contemplation of death, and to gifts or property upon joint tenancy or tenancy by the entirety, the benefit of which inured to the surviving tenant upon the death of the donor. Both classes of gifts were taxed as a part of the decedent's estate at the rates prescribed by the estate tax. The obvious purpose of these provisions was to prevent or compensate for the withdrawal of property by gifts inter vivos from the operation of the estate tax. The 1918 Revenue Act, section 402(c) and (f), c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1097, included in the donor's estate, subject to the estate tax, all gifts effected by any trust taking effect in possession or enjoyment at the time of the donor's death, and the proceeds in excess of $40,000 of life insurance purchased by the decedent in his lifetime and payable to named beneficiaries at his death.\n As a further measure for preventing avoidance of the tax by gifts inter vivos, Congress, in 1924, adopted the gift tax, sections 319-324 of the Revenue Act of that year, chapter 234, 43 Stat. 253, 313-316 (26 USCA  1131-1133, 1135 notes and  1134). That it was adopted as a measure to prevent avoidance of the estate tax sufficiently appears from the fact that the graduated rates and exemptions of the tax were the same as in the case of testamentary transfers, sections 301(a), 319, 303(a)(4), 321(a)(1) ( 29 USCA  1092, 1131, 1095, 1133 notes),1 and from the fact that in the Revenue Act of 1926\n\n\n\n\n[285 U.S. 312, 334]\n\u00a0\n the retroactive reductions in rates of the estate tax were extended to the rates of the gift tax. Sections 301, 324, Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, 69, 86 (26 USCA  1092,  1131 note). Provisions were also made for crediting the gift tax against the estate tax where the amount of the gift was later required to be included in the decedent's gross estate. Section 322, Revenue Act of 1924, 43 Stat. 316 (26 USCA  1134); section 404, Revenue Act of 1928, c. 852, 45 Stat. 791, 863 (26 USCA  1134).\n Because of inequalities and inconvenience, expense and other difficulties in its operation and administration, the gift tax was repealed by section 1200(a) of the Revenue Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 125 (26 USCA  1a note);2 and, as a result of ten years' experience in the administration of the estate tax, and particularly of the provision taxing gifts in contemplation of death, the present provision of section 302(c) of the Revenue Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 70, 26 USCA  1094(c), was added, which operates to impose the tax on all gifts made within two years of death, regardless of the purpose or motive of the donor. The Ways and Means Committee of the House of Representatives, in its report recommending this legislation (House Report No. 1, 69th Congress, 1st Sess ., p. 15), pointed out that the tax on gifts in contemplation of death had been ineffective in its practical administration, with a great loss of revenue to the government in consequence, and that 'the difficulty of enforcement will be even more serious in view of the repeal of the gift tax.' It stated, without qualification, that the amendment was one imposing the tax on all gifts made within two years of death, and said that 'the inclusion of this provision will prevent most of the evasion and is the only way in which it can be prevented.' 3 \n\n[285 U.S. 312, 335]\n\u00a0\n As we are concerned here only with the power of Congress to tax such gifts, I shall take no time in discussing the particular form of language by which Congress has sought to accomplish its purpose. In this statute taxing gifts inter vivos, as though they were legacies, it can be of no consequence whether the enactment says that all gifts within two years of death of the donor are inrebuttably presumed to be in contemplation of death or whether more directly it imposes the tax on all gifts made within two years of the donor's death. In either case, we are concerned only with the power which, here, the legislative body has indisputably sought to exert, and not with the particular choice of words by which it has expressed that purpose.\n The question, reduced to its simplest terms, is whether Congress possesses the power to supplement an estate tax, and protect the revenue derived from it, as was its declared purpose, by a tax on all gifts inter vivos, made within two years of the death of the donor at the same rate and in the same manner as though the gift were made at death. I think it has.\n At the outset it is to be borne in mind that gifts inter vivos are not immune from federal taxation. Whatever doubts may formerly have been entertained, it is now settled that the national government may tax all gifts \n\n[285 U.S. 312, 336]\n\u00a0\n inter vivos and at rates comparable to those which may be imposed on gifts at death. Bromley v. McCaughn, \n280 \nU.S. 124\n, 50 S. Ct. 46. That the present gifts were inter vivos, made in the lifetime of the donors, and effected as are any other dispositions of property passing from the donors independently of death, is not in dispute. The question then is, not whether they may be taxed, but, more narrowly, whether the congressional selection of some such gifts-those made within two years of death-and their taxation as though made at death, as an adjunct to the estate tax, is so arbitrary and unreasonable as to amount to a taking of property without due process of law, prohibited by the Fifth Amendment.\n That question was not answered by Schlesinger v. Wisconsin, \n270 \nU.S. 230\n, 46 S. Ct. 260, 43 A. L. R. 1224. If it had been, this case could and doubtless would be disposed of per curiam on the authority of that one. This case comes to us after ten years of experience in the administration of the estate tax, an experience which was not available, or at least not presented, in the Schlesinger Case. There, all gifts made within six years of death were taxed. Here, only those within two years of death are within the statute. There, the tax was a succession tax, and so was a burden on the right to receive, Leach v. Nichols, \n285 \nU.S. 165\n, 52 S. Ct. 338, 76 L. Ed. -, decided March 14, 1932, and necessarily payable by the donee, but at rates and valuations prevailing at the time of the donor's death. Here, the tax was upon the transfer effected by the donor's gift after the enactment of the statute, and is payable from the donor's estate at the same rates and values as though it had passed at his death. It burdens the estate of the donor before distribution, exactly as does the estate tax. New York Trust Co. v. Eisner, \n256 \nU.S. 345\n, 41 S. Ct. 506, 16 A. L. R. 660; Leach v. Nichols, supra. In the Schlesinger Case, the Court declared (page 240 of 270 U. S., 46 S. Ct. 260, 261) that the gifts were 'subjected to graduated taxes which could not properly be laid on all gifts or, indeed, upon any gift without testamentary character.' \n\n[285 U.S. 312, 337]\n\u00a0\n And, in stating the argument presented and rejected there, the Court said ( page 240 of 270 U. S., 46 S. Ct. 260, 261):\n'The presumption and consequent taxation are defended upon the theory that, exercising judgment and discretion, the Legislature found them necessary in order to prevent evasion of inheritance taxes. That is to say, A. may be required to submit to an exactment forbidden by the Constitution if this seems necessary in order to enable the state readily to collect lawful charges against B.'\n\n Here, a graduated tax imposed by Congress on gifts inter vivos is not forbidden, Bromley v. McCaughn, supra, and the case is not one where A.'s property is taxed to enable the government to collect lawful charges against B. Here A.'s gift, which may be lawfully taxed, is, in this instance, taxed because it removes property from the operation of another tax, which, but for the gift, would be applied to the property at A.'s death. Concededly there is nothing in the Federal Constitution or laws which necessarily precludes taxation of gifts at the same rate and value as if they had passed at the donor's death, rather than at the rate and value prevailing at the time of the gift. The tax upheld in Bromley v. McCaughn, supra, taxed all gifts inter vivos at the same rates and with the same exemptions as in the case of testamentary transfers. In Milliken v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 15, 20\n, 51 S. Ct. 324, a selected class of gifts inter vivos, which were not testamentary, although made in contemplation of death, were so taxed as a part of the donor's estate. See Phillips v. Dime Trust & Safe Deposit Co., \n284 \nU.S. 160\n, 52 S. Ct. 46. In Tyler v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 497\n, 50 S. Ct. 356, 69 A. L. R. 758, we upheld taxation, as a part of the donor's estate, of another selected class of gifts inter vivos, estates by the entirety donated by one spouse for the benefit of both, although the gift was not testamentary, and neither title, possession, nor enjoyment passed at death. Similar taxation of gifts made inter \n\n[285 U.S. 312, 338]\n\u00a0\n vivos, but finally effective only at death, was sustained in Reinecke v. Northern Trust Co., \n278 \nU.S. 339\n, 49 S. Ct. 123, 66 A. L. R. 397; and Chase National Bank v. United States, \n278 \nU.S. 327\n, 49 S. Ct. 126, 63 A. L. R. 388; see Taft v. Bowers, \n278 \nU.S. 470, 482\n, 49 S. Ct. 199, 64 A. L. R. 362.\n In the Schlesinger Case the classification of the gifts selected for taxation under the state statute was deemed to be so arbitrary as to violate the Fourteenth Amendment, which forbids state legislation denying equal protection of the laws. Here, we are concerned only with the Fifth Amendment. As was said by this Court in La Belle Iron Works v. United States, \n256 \nU.S. 377, 392\n, 41 S. Ct. 528, 532:\n'The Fifth Amendment has no equal protection clause; and the only rule of uniformity prescribed with respect to duties, imposts, and excises laid by Congress is the territorial uniformity required by article 1,  8. ... The difficulty of adjusting any system of taxation so as to render it precisely equal in its bearing is proverbial, and such nicety is not even required of the states under the equal protection clause, must less of Congress under the more general requirement of due process of law in taxation.' See Treat v. White, \n181 \nU.S. 264, 269\n, 21 S. Ct. 611; Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., \n220 \nU.S. 107, 158\n, 31 S. Ct. 342, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 1312; Barclay & Co. v. Edwards, \n267 \nU.S. 442, 450\n, 45 S. Ct. 135, 348.\n\n No tax has been held invalid under the Fifth Amendment because based on an improper classification, and it is significant that in the entire one hundred and forth years of its history the only taxes held condemned by the Fifth Amendment were those deemed to be arbitrarily retroactive. See Nichols v. Coolidge, \n274 \nU.S. 531\n, 47 S. Ct. 710, 52 A. L. R. 1081; Untermeyer v. Anderson, \n276 \nU.S. 440\n, 48 S. Ct. 353; Coolidge v. Long, \n282 \nU.S. 582\n, 51 S. Ct. 306.\n It is, I think, plain, then, that this tax cannot rightly be held unconstitutional on its face. These gifts inter vivos, not being immune from taxation, and the obvious and permissible purpose of the present and related sections being to protect the revenue derived from the tax- \n\n[285 U.S. 312, 339]\n\u00a0\n ation of estates, 4 want of due process in taxing them can arise only because the selection of this class of gifts within two years of death, for taxation at the prescribed rates, is so remote from the permissible policy of taxing transfers at death or so unrelated to it as to be palpably arbitrary and unreasonable.\n It is evident that the practice of disposing of property by gift inter vivos, if generally adopted, would, regardless of the age or motive of the donor, defeat or seriously impair the operation of the estate tax, and that the practice would be encouraged if such gifts, made shortly before the death of the donor, were left free of any form of taxation. That in itself would be a legitimate ground for taxing all gifts at the same rates as legacies, as was done by the gift tax; but, since the object is to protect the revenue to be derived from the estate tax, the government is not bound to tax every gift without regard to its relation to the end sought or the convenience and expense of the government in levying and collecting it. It may aim at the evil where it exists and select for taxation that class of gifts which experience has shown tends most to defeat the estate tax. This Court has held explicitly that the Fourteenth Amendment does not forbid the selection of subjects for one form of taxation for the very reason that they may not be readily or effectively reached by another tax which it is the legislative policy to maintain. Watson v. State Comptroller, \n254 \nU.S. 122, 124\n, 125 S., 41 S. Ct. 43. And, since the imposition of the one tax is induced by the purpose to compensate for the loss of the other, the effect in accomplishing this result may itself be the basis of the selection of subjects of taxation. St. John v. New York, \n201 \nU.S. 633\n, 26 S. Ct. 554, 5 Ann. Cas. 909; District of Columbia \n\n[285 U.S. 312, 340]\n\u00a0\n v. Brooke, \n214 \nU.S. 138, 150\n, 29 S. Ct. 560; Shevlin- Carpenter Co. v. Minnesota, \n218 \nU.S. 57, 69\n, 30 S. Ct. 663.\n That being the object here, it is not imperative that the motive of the donor be made the exclusive basis of the selection of these gifts for taxation, as in the case of gifts made in contemplation of death. The fact that such gifts, made shortly before death, regardless of motive, chiefly contribute to the withdrawal of property from operation of the estate tax, is enough to support the selection, even though they are not conscious evasions of the estate tax, and opprobrious epithets cannot certainly be applied to them. The opinion of the Court does not deny that Congress has power to select, on this basis, certain gifts to be taxed as estates are taxed. In fact, this Court has recently held that Congress does possess that power, and has said so in language completely applicable to the present tax. In Tyler v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 497, 505\n, 50 S. Ct. 356, 359, 69 A. L. R. 758, the tax on estates by the entirety, as a part of the decedent's estate passing to the surviving spouse, was upheld regardless of the motive which inspired it, and the decision was rested on the sole and only possible ground that 'the evidence and legitimate aim of Congress was to prevent an avoidance, in whole or in part, of any of the estate tax by this method of disposition during the lifetime of the spouse who owned the property, or whose separate funds had been used to procure it; and the provision under review is an adjunct of the general scheme of taxation of which it is a part, entirely appropriate as a means to that end.' See, also, Reinecke v. Northern Trust Co., \n278 \nU.S. 339\n, 49 S. Ct. 123, 66 A. L. R. 397; Taft v. Bowers, \n278 \nU.S. 470\n, 49 S. Ct. 199, 64 A. L. R. 362.\n The gifts taxed may, in some instances, as the present opinion states, bear no relation whatever to death, except that all are near death. But that all do have an intimate and vital relation to the policy of taxing the estates of decedents at death cannot be gainsaid, for what would \n\n[285 U.S. 312, 341]\n\u00a0\n otherwise be taxed is by the gift, withdrawn from the operation of the taxing act, and the revenue derived from the taxation of estates necessarily impaired, unless the act which impairs it, the giving away of property inter vivos, is itself taxed. It cannot be said generally that gifts made near the time of death do not have a greater tendency to defeat the estate tax than gifts made at periods remote from it, both because of the greater number and amounts of the former and because such gifts more certainly withdraw the property from the operation of the estate tax than do the earlier and relatively infrequent gifts of property which may be lost or destroyed before the donor's death. Gifts of amounts in excess of $ 5,000 to one donee in any one year, which alone are taxed, are usually made from substantial fortunes which, in the generality of cases, are accumulated relatively late in life, and the great bulk of which, if not given away in life, would pass at death. Nor can it be denied that the cost and inconvenience of collecting the tax on earlier, generally smaller, and less frequent gifts, which led to the repeal of the gift tax, may not themselves require or justify a distinction between them and gifts made nearer to the time of death.\n Since Congress has power to make the selection if the facts warrant, we cannot say a priori that such facts do not exist or that in making the selection which it did Congress acted arbitrarily or without the exercise of the judgment or discretion which rightfully belong to it. Stebbins v. Riley, \n268 \nU.S. 137, 143\n, 45 S. Ct. 424, 44 A. L. R. 1454. As was said in Ogden v. Saunders, 12 Wheat. 213, 270, it is but a proper '... respect due to the wisdom, the integrity and the patriotism of the legislative body, by which any law is passed, to presume in favor of its validity, until its violation of the constitution is proved beyond all reasonable doubt.' \n\n[285 U.S. 312, 342]\n\u00a0\n The existence of facts underlying constitutionality is always to be presumed, and the burden is always on him who assails the selection of a class for taxation to establish that there could be no reasonable basis for the legislative judgment in making it. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n But, even if that presumption is not to be indulged, in passing on the power of Congress to impose this tax, we cannot rightly disregard the nature of the difficulties involved in the effective administration of a scheme for taxing transfers at death, and we cannot close our eyes to those perhaps less apparent, which have been disclosed by the experience with this form of taxation in the United States, which led to the enactment of the present statute.\n It is evident that the estate tax, if not supplemented by an effective provision taxing gifts tending to defeat it, would, to a considerable extent, fail of its purpose. The tax on gifts made in contemplation of death, devised for this purpose, has been upheld by this Court, Milliken v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 15\n, 51 S. Ct. 324, but the difficulties of its successful administration have become apparent. The donor of property which would otherwise be subject to heavy taxes at his death does not usually disclose his purpose in making the gift, even if he does not conceal it. He may not, and often does not, analyze his motives or determine for himself whether his dominating purpose is to substitute the gift for a testamentary disposition which would subject it to the tax, see Milliken v. United States, supra, \n283 \nU.S. 23\n, 51 S. Ct. 324; United States v. Wells, \n283 \nU.S. 102\n, 51 S. Ct. 446, or \n\n[285 U.S. 312, 343]\n\u00a0\n whether it is so combined with other motives as to preclude its taxation, even though in making it the donor cannot be unaware that he, like others, must die and that his donation will, in the natural course of events, escape the tax which will be imposed on his other property passing at death. See United States v. Wells, supra. The difficulty of searching the motives and purposes of one who is dead, the proofs of which, so far as they survive, are in the control of his personal representatives, need not be elaborated. As the event has proved, the difficulties of establishing the requisite mental state of the deceased donor has rendered the tax on gifts in contemplation of death a weak and ineffective means of compensating for the drain on the revenue by the withdrawal of vest amounts of property from the operation of the estate tax.\n The government has been involved in 102 cases arising under  202(b) of the 1916 Revenue Act and its successors. \n6\n This number does not include any of the cases arising under section 302(c) of the Revenue Act of 1926, 26 USCA  1094(c), the statute under present consideration. And it includes only those cases, decision of which was determined by the answer made to the question of fact, whether a gift had been made in contemplation of death.\n In 20 cases involving gifts of approximately $4,250,000, the government was successful. \n7\n In 3 it was partially \n\n[285 U.S. 312, 344]\n\u00a0\n successful;8 and in 78 involving gifts largely in excess of $120,000,000, it was unsuccessful. In another the jury disagreed. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n In 56 of the total of 78 cases decided against the government, the gifts were made within two years of death. In this group of 56 donors, two were more than ninety years of age at the time of death; ten were between eighty and ninety; twenty-seven were between seventy and eighty; six were between sixty and seventy; six were between fifty and sixty; and only one was younger than fifty. 10 There was one gift of $46,000,000, made within two months of death by a donor seventy-one years of age at death;11 one of $ 36,790,000, made by a donor over eighty, who consulted a tax expert before making the \n\n[285 U.S. 312, 345]\n\u00a0\n gift;12 one of over $10,400,000, made by a donor aged seventy-six, six months before death; 13 and one by a donor aged seventy-five at death, in which the tax assessed was over $1,000,000.14 There was one other in excess of $2,000,000;15 5 others largely in excess of $1,000,000;16 4 others in excess of $500,000; 17 18 in excess of $250,000;18 and 14 in excess of $100,000.19 The value of the gifts was not shown definitely in 3 cases:20 12 involved gifts total- \n\n[285 U.S. 312, 346]\n\u00a0\n ling less than $100,000.21 In the remaining 22 cases the gifts were made more than two years before the death of the donor. \n22\n\u00a0\n\n The judgment of the Ways and Means Committee that the provision of section 302(c) of the 1926 act was required to stop the drain on the revenues from the estate tax is strikingly confirmed by these 56 cases. The value of the gifts in those cases alone was $113,401,157, a total that does not include realty and personalty of undetermined value or the very large gifts on which the government, in the case already noted, sought to collect a tax of more than $1,000,000.\n In many of the cases, notably those in which large amounts were involved, the gift was substantially all the donor's estate. In the others, the addition of the amount \n\n[285 U.S. 312, 347]\n\u00a0\n of the gifts to the estate of the donor would place the tax on the gifts in the higher brackets, so that the total amount of the tax that might have been collected is much larger than the tax that would have been payable on the gifts considered separately from the estates of which they had been part. It is also fairly inferable that the cases actually litigated constitute only a small portion of the instances in which large gifts were made within two years of the donor's death.\n These are but a few of the many details of the administration of the act supporting the conclusion of congressional committees that large amounts of money and property were being withdrawn from the operation of the estate tax by gifts inter vivos under circumstances which clearly indicated that but for the gifts all would have been taxed as a part of the donors' estates, and that by far the greater number and amount of such gifts had been made within two years of death by persons of advanced age.\n The present tax, if objectionable, is not so because motive or intention of the donor is not made the basis of the classification. It is not so because it does not tend to prevent or compensate for the evil aimed at. It is not so because the revenue leak will not be effectively stopped by including in the estate tax all gifts made within two years of death. Legislation to accomplish that end, and reasonably adapted to it, cannot be summarily dismissed as being arbitrary and capricious. Nor can it be deemed invalid on the assumption that Congress has acted arbitrarily in drawing the line between all gifts made within two years of death and those made before. Congress cannot be held rigidly to a choice between taxing all gifts or taxing none, regardless of the practical necessities of preventing tax avoidance, and regardless of experience and practical convenience and expense in administering the tax. Even the equal protection clause of the Four- \n\n[285 U.S. 312, 348]\n\u00a0\n teenth Amendment has not been deemed to impose any such inflexible rule of taxation.\n The very power to classify involves the power to recognize and distinguish differences in degree between those things which are near and those which are remote from the object aimed at. Citizens' Telephone Co. v. Fuller, \n229 \nU.S. 322\n, 33 S. Ct. 833; see Miller v. Wilson, \n236 \nU.S. 373, 384\n, 35 S. Ct. 342, L. R. A. 1915F, 829. It has never occurred to any one to suggest that a state could not, by statute, fix the age of consent, or the age of competence to make a will or conveyance, although some included within the class selected as competent might be less competent than some who are excluded. In the exercise of the police power, classification may be based on mere numbers or amounts where the distinction between the class appropriately subject to classification and that not chosen for regulation is one of degree. \n23\n\u00a0\n\n As all taxes must be levied by general rules, there is a still larger scope for legislative action in framing revenue laws, even under the Fourteenth Amendment, with its guaranty of equal protection of the laws. The Legislature may grant exemptions. Magoun v. Illinois Trust & Savings Bank, \n170 \nU.S. 283, 300\n, 18 S. Ct. 594; Hope Natural Gas Co. v. Hall, \n274 \nU.S. 284, 289\n, 47 S. Ct. 639; Missouri v. Dockery, \n191 \nU.S. 165\n, 24 S. Ct. 53, 63 L. R. A. 571. It may impose graduated taxes on gifts, inheritances, or on income. Bromley v. McCaughn, \n280 \nU.S. 124\n, 50 S. Ct. 46; Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 \nU.S. 41, 109\n, 20 S. Ct. 747; Brushaber v. Union Pacific R. Co., \n240 \nU.S. 1, 25\n, 36 S. Ct. 236, L. R. A. 1917D, 414, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 713. See, also, \n\n[285 U.S. 312, 349]\n\u00a0\n Stebbins v. Riley, \n268 \nU.S. 137\n, 45 S. Ct. 424, 44 A. L. R. 1454.24 It may impose a tax that falls more heavily on ownership of chain stores than on ownership of a smaller number. State Board of Tax Commissioners v. Jackson, \n283 \nU.S. 527\n, 51 S. Ct. 540, 73 A. L. R. 1464; Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. v. Maxwell, \n284 \nU.S. 575\n, 52 S. Ct. 26, 76 L. Ed.-, decided October 26, 1931. And generally it may create classes for taxation wherever there is basis for the legislative judgment that differences in degree produce differences in kind. \n25\n\u00a0\n\n The purpose here being admittedly to impose a tax on a privilege-that of making gifts inter vivos-to the extent that its exercise substantially impairs the operation of the tax on estates, it was for Congress to say how far that impairment extends and how far it is necessary to go in the taxation of gifts either to prevent or to compensate for it. Unless the line it draws is so wide of the mark as palpably to have no relation to the end sought, it is not for the judicial power to reject it and substitute another, or to say that no line may be drawn. \n\n[285 U.S. 312, 350]\n\u00a0\n The objection that the gifts are taxed as a part of the donor's estate, and at the same rates and on values as of the donor's death, has no more force than that made to the selection for taxation of gifts made within two years of death. Since the basis of the tax is that it compensates for the drain on the estate tax, and since it is paid by the donor's estate, which would otherwise be compelled to pay the estate tax on transmission at death, the whole object of the tax on the gifts would be defeated, if levied on another basis. In determining the reasonableness of a tax which, like this one, is levied in lieu of another, it is of course necessary to consider all the statutes affecting the subject-matter. Interstate Busses Corporation v. Blodgett, \n276 \nU.S. 245\n, 48 S. Ct. 230; Farmers' & Mechanics' Savings Bank v. Minnesota, \n232 \nU.S. 516, 529\n, 34 S. Ct. 354. Where the very purpose and justification of the one tax is that it is compensatory for the loss of the other, it is no objection that the one is made the exact equivalent of the other, thus avoiding inequality which, under some circumstances, might be objectionable. See General American Tank Car Co. v. Day, \n270 \nU.S. 367\n, 46 S. Ct. 234. No one has yet indicated precisely in what way this method of measuring the tax works any greater injustice or hardship than the tax on estates. It is certainly not greater where, as here, the tax is paid from the estate of the donor who, regardless of his age, in giving away his property after the statute was in force, took his chances that death within two years would bring it into his estate for taxation where it would have been if the gift had not been made. See Milliken v. United States, supra, \n283 \nU.S. 23, 24\n, 51 S. Ct. 324. A very different case would be presented if the taxed gift were made before the enactment of the taxing statute and many years before the death, as in Frew v. Bowers (C. C. A.) 12 F.(2d) 625, 630. 26 See Nichols \n\n[285 U.S. 312, 351]\n\u00a0\n v. Coolidge, supra. The application of the estate tax to the other types of gift inter vivos mentioned in the Act has uniformly been upheld, even though the gift was made more than two years before death. Milliken v. United States, supra; Phillips v. Dime Trust & Safe Deposit Co.; Tyler v. United States, supra; Reinecke v. Northern Trust Co., supra; Chase National Bank v. United States, supra.\n I cannot say that the tax on all gifts made in contemplation of death, supplemented by that imposed on all others made within two years of death, is not adapted to a legitimate legislative object. The history of the litigation over gifts made in contemplation of death, to which reference has been made, and the reports of Congressional Committees prepared after extensive investigation and with expert aid, plainly indicate that it is. I can find no adequate reason for saying that the tax is invalid. The denial of its validity seems to me to rest on no substantial ground and to be itself an arbitrary and unreasonable restriction of the sovereign power of the federal government to tax, for which neither the words of the Fifth Amendment nor any judicial interpretation of it affords justification.\n The questions should be answered in the negative.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS joins in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Sec. 302. The value of the gross estate of the decedent shall be determined by including the value at the time of his death of all property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, wherever situated-...\n'(c) To the extent of any interest therein of which the decedent has at any time made a transfer, by trust or otherwise, in contemplation of or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death, except in case of a bona fide sale for an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth. Where within two years prior to his death but after the enactment of this act and without such a consideration the decedent has made a transfer or transfers, by trust or otherwise, of any of his property, or an interest therein, not admitted or shown to have been made in contemplation of or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death, and the value or aggregate value, at the time of such death, of the property or interest so transferred to any one person is in excess of $5,000, then, to the extent of such excess, such transfer or transfers shall be deemed and held to have been made in contemplation of death within the meaning of this title. Any transfer of a material part of his property in the nature of a final disposition or distribution thereof, made by the decedent within two years prior to his death but prior to the enactment of this act, without such consideration, shall, unless shown to the contrary, be deemed to have been made in contemplation of death within the meaning of this title.' appeal was taken, and the Circuit Court of Appeals has certified to this court two questions of law upon which instruction is desired:\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See, for example, Hall v.

In 1881 England adopted a statute, 44 Vict. c. 12,  38(2)(a), which included gifts inter vivos, made within three months of the death, in the donor's estate, subject to death duties. The three months was increased to one year, in 1889, 52 Vict. c. 7,  11(1), and to three years in 1910, 10 Edw. VII, c. 8,  59(1), the last provision remaining in force, except in some particular circumstances not now necessary to mention, until the present time.\n The brief for the government in No. 514, Appendix B, lists fourteen states which, prior to the enactment of the present statute in 1926, had found it necessary or expedient to adopt similar legislation; the state statutes subjected to inheritance taxation gifts made within periods ranging from one to six years of the donor's death.

CO.(1932)\nNo. 387\nArgued: January 21, 1932Decided: February 15, 1932\n\n\n\n Messrs. Everett Sanders, of Chicago, Ill., and Frederick M. Miner, of Minneapolis, Minn., for Henkel, administratrix.\n Mr. William T. Faricy, of St. Paul, Minn., for Chicago, St. P., M. & O. Ry. Co.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This action was brought in the federal District Court for the District of Minnesota under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (45 USCA  51-59) to recover damages for the death of the plaintiff's intestate. Upon obtaining a verdict, the plaintiff asked for an order allowing fees for expert witnesses who had testified at the trial. The application was made under the following provision of the Minnesota statutes (Mason's Minn. St. 1927,  7009): 'Expert witnesses-The judge of any court of record, before whom any witness is summoned or sworn and \n\n[284 U.S. 444, 445]\n\u00a0\n examined as an expert in any profession or calling, may, in his discretion, allow such fees or compensation as in his judgment may be just and reasonable.'\n Under this statute it appears to be the practice of the state courts of Minnesota to allow reasonable fees of expert witnesses, which are included in the taxable costs and become part of the judgment. The allowance is in the discretion of the trial court. Farmer v. Stillwater Water Company, 86 Minn. 59, 90 N. W. 10; Melander v. County of Freeborn, 170 Minn. 378, 381, 212 N. W. 590, 591.\n The District Court denied the application for want of power under the federal statutes. The Circuit Court of Appeals, having the judgment before it on appeal, has certified to this court the following question: 'Has a United States District Court power and authority to allow expert witness fees, and to include the same as part of the taxable costs in a law case, said United States District Court being for and sitting in a State the Courts of which are by a state statute authorized, in their discretion, to allow expert witness fees, and the practice and usage in said state courts being to make such allowances and to include the same in the taxable costs, but there being no such usage and practice in said United States District Court?'\n The Judiciary Act of September 24, 1789, c. 20, 1 Stat. 73, contained references to costs, but no fee bill. By the Process Act of September 29, 1789, c. 21, 1 Stat. 93, it was provided that the 'rates of fees ... in the circuit and district courts, in suits at common law,' should be the same as were 'used or allowed' in state courts. This was a temporary act ( Act May 26, 1790, 1 Stat. 123, Act Feb. 18, 1791, 1 Stat. 191) but, under it and later legislation of a similar sort, the federal system was put in operation. It thus became 'the practical usage by the courts of the United States to conform to the state laws as to costs, when no express provision has been made and \n\n[284 U.S. 444, 446]\n\u00a0\n is in force by any act of congress in relation to any particular item, or when no general rule of court exists on this subject.' Mr. Justice Woodbury in Hathaway v. Roach, 2 Woodb. & M. 63, 67, Fed. Cas. No. 6,213; Mr. Justice Nelson in Costs in Civil Cases, 1 Blatchf. 652, Fed. Cas.

But when the Congress has prescribed the amount to be allowed as costs, its enactment controls. The Baltimore, supra.\n Specific provision as to the amounts payable and taxable as witness fees was made by the Congress as early as the Act of February 28, 1799, c. 19,  6, 1 Stat. 624, 626. See, also, Act of February 26, 1853, c. 80,  3, 10 Stat. 161, 167, Rev. St.  848 (28 USCA  601). The statute now applicable is the Act of April 26, 1926, c. 183, 44 Stat. 323. U. S. Code tit. 28,  600a to 600d (28 USCA  600a to 600d).1 Under these provisions, additional amounts paid as compensation, or fees, to expert witnesses cannot be allowed or taxed as costs in cases in the federal courts. The William Branfoot (C. C. A.) 52 F. 390, 395; In re Carolina Cooperage Company (D. C.) 96 F. 604, 605; Bone v. Walsh Construction Company (D. C.) 235 F. 901, 903, 904; Cheatham Electric Company v. Transit Development Company (C. C. A.) 261 F. 792, 796.\n The appellant, seeking the application of the statute of Minnesota, invokes the rule that 'the laws of the sev- \n\n[284 U.S. 444, 447]\n\u00a0\n eral states, except where the Constitution, treaties, or statutes of the United States otherwise require or provide, shall be regarded as rules of decision in trials at common law, in the courts of the United States, in cases where they apply.' U. S. Code tit. 28,  725 (28 USCA  725). But this provision, by its terms, is inapplicable, as the Congress has definitely prescribed its own requirement with respect to the fees of witnesses. The Congress has dealt with the subject comprehensively, and has made no exception of the fees of expert witnesses. Its legislation must be deemed controlling, and excludes the application in the federal courts of any different state practice. Sanborn v. United States, \n135 \nU.S. 271, 282\n, 283 S., 10 S.

Ct. 207.\n In Ex parte Peterson, supra, the question related to the fees of an auditor appointed by the court, and as the court had power to appoint him, and there was no statute or rule of court on the subject, the court had authority to allow the expense in the items taxable as costs. Id., pages 314, 317 of 253 U. S., 40 S. Ct. 543. The case of People of Sioux County, Neb., v. National Surety Company, \n276 \nU.S. 238\n, 48 S. Ct. 239, was an action upon a surety bond. A Nebraska statute (Comp. St. Neb. 1929,  44-346) provided that in specified classes of cases, including that before the court, \n\n[284 U.S. 444, 448]\n\u00a0\n the plaintiff on obtaining judgment should be allowed a reasonable sum as an attorney's fee. The requirement was mandatory. This court held that in such a case the attorney's fee was recoverable in the federal court, but was careful to point out that the amount was 'not costs in the ordinary sense' and hence was 'not within the field of costs legislation' covered by the federal statutes. In this view, the fact that the amount could not be taxed as costs in the federal courts did not preclude the recovery. 'Since the right exists,' said the court, 'the federal courts may follow their own appropriate procedure for its enforcement by including the amount of the fee in the judgment.' Id., page 244 of 276 U. S., 48 S. Ct. 239, 241.\n The present case is simply one of the amount to be allowed as witness fees, to be included in the taxable costs, and the federal statute governs.\n The question certified is answered 'No.'\n It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 600a and 600c are as follows:\n'600a.

CITY OF CINCINNATI(1932)\nNo. 63\nArgued: November 30, 1931Decided: January 4, 1932\n\n\n\n Mr. Julius R. Samuels, of Cincinnati, Ohio, for appellants.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellants sued the city, its mayor and other officers, in the court of common pleas of Hamilton County to enjoin the enforcement of Ordinance No. 50-1929 on the ground of repugnancy to the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. After a trial at which evidence was taken, that court found the provisions invalid and granted permanent injunction. The court of appeals tried the case de novo and sustained the ordinance; its judgment was affirmed in the highest court of the state. 123 Ohio St. 284, 175 N. E. 196. \n\n[284 U.S. 335, 336]\n\u00a0\n The ordinance1 classifies 'driverless automobiles for hire' as public vehicles, imposes license fees for their use upon the streets and requires persons engaged in the business of leasing such automobiles to deposit with the city treasurer insurance policies or bonds in specified sums for the protection of persons injured or whose property may be damaged as a result of lessees' negligent operation, maintenance or use of such vehicles.\n Each appellant owns automobiles and is carrying on the business of leasing them, for compensation based on mileage, to be driven by the lessees on the city streets and elsewhere. Many insurance companies which formerly carried the risks specified in the ordinance decline to issue such policies; but some are offering rates, at the option of the insured, of $232.50 per vehicle per year or 10 per cent. of the gross earnings which on the average amount to approximately $1,800 per year.\n Appellants maintain that the measure constitutes an unreasonable interference with a purely private business and is not one for the regulation of the use of streets; that it attempts to convert appellants into public utilities and impose upon them liability without fault; and that it is discriminatory and oppressive. \n\n[284 U.S. 335, 337]\n\u00a0\n Unquestionably appellants contemplate that those hiring their cars will operate them upon the streets. In fact, such use of the streets is essential to appellants' business. It is a special and extraordinary use materially differing from operation of automobiles or trucks by owners or their chauffeurs in the usual way for private ends. The running of automobiles necessarily is attended by danger to persons and property in the vicinity; and, when they are negligently driven upon city streets, the peril is great. The court below found that the operation of automobiles by such hirers is extra-hazardous to the public. The state has power for the safety of the public to regulate the use of its public highways. Hendrick v. Maryland, \n235 \nU.S. 610, 622\n, 35 S. Ct. 140; Kane v. New Jersey, \n242 \nU.S. 160, 167\n, 37 S. Ct. 30; Sprout v. South Bend, \n277 \nU.S. 163, 168\n, 48 S. Ct. 502, 62 A. L. R. 45. It may prohibit or condition as it deems proper the use of city streets as a place for the carrying on of private business. This Court has sustained a state law requiring reasonable security for the protection of persons in respect of injuries and losses caused by the negligent operation of motor vehicles engaged in carrying persons for hire.

Harnett, 127 Misc. Rep. 221, 215 N. Y. S. 540.\n This ordinance is not an interference with or regulation of a business that has no relation to matters of public concern; it rests upon the power of the city to prescribe the terms upon which it will permit the use of its streets to carry on business for gain. It does not attempt to impose any burden or duty that is peculiar to public utilities. Our decisions in Michigan Public Utilities Commission v. Duke, \n266 \nU.S. 570\n, 45 S. Ct. 191, 36 A. L.

Nor does the ordinance attempt to make hirers the agents or employees of the owners or to make the latter liable for the negligence of the former. It merely requires the giving of security that lessees shall 'respond in damage for their own tortious acts.' 123 Ohio St. 284, 175 N. E. 196, 199. There is no showing that the conditions imposed are arbitrarily burdensome or that the measure in any way operates to deprive appellants of property without due process of law.\n There is nothing on the face of the ordinance or in the evidence or findings below to warrant the conclusion that the classification,  65-1 b, is capricious, arbitrary, or so lacking in foundation as to contravene the equal protection clause. Truax v. Corrigan, \n257 \nU.S. 312, 333\n, 42 S. Ct. 124, 27 A. L. R. 375; Power Mfg. Co. v. Saunders, \n274 \nU.S. 490, 493\n, 47 S. Ct. 678; Quaker City Cab Co. v.

KINCAID(1932)\nNo. 457\nArgued: Decided: February 23, 1932\n\n\n\n\n\n[285 U.S. 95, 96]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Thomas D. Thacher, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., for petitioners.\n\n\n[285 U.S. 95, 97]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. H. H. Russell and William C. Dufour, both of Monroe, La., for respondent.\n\n\n[285 U.S. 95, 99]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On June 15, 1929, Kincaid brought this suit in the federal court for Western Louisiana against the United States, the Secretary of War, the Chief of Engineers, the Mississippi River Commission and its members, to enjoin the carrying out of any work in the Boeuf floodway under the Mississippi River Flood Control Act, May 15, 1928, c. 569, 45 Stat. 534 ( 33 USCA  702a et seq.), and specifically to enjoin the receiving of bids and awarding of contracts for the construction of certain guide levees bounding the floodway.\n The Mississippi River Flood Control Act adopted the Jadwin Plan for protection against floods. The act provides for raising the levees generally 3 feet; for improving the carrying capacity of the main channel of the river by revetment work; and for limiting the flood waters in this channel to its safe capacity through the provision of specified diversion channels. Among these is the Boeuf floodway, which will carry excess flood waters from a point below the mouth of the Arkansas through the Boeuf basin west of the Mississippi into the backwater area at the mouth of the Red river. Such diversion has taken place to some extent in the past, when flood waters have passed over, or through crevasses in, the 20-mile section of the levee at the head of the basin, known as the Cypress Creek levee. Before \n\n[285 U.S. 95, 100]\n\u00a0\n this section was completed, in 1921, the Boeuf basin and the parallel Tensas basin, lying between it and the main channel, served as natural overflow areas of the Mississippi in flood periods. The plan leaves the Cypress Creek section at its present height. But, as the levees elsewhere are to be raised 3 feet and materially strengthened, preventing overflow at other points, the volume of water passing into the diversion channel may be greatly increased. Moreover, guide, or protection, levees running in a southerly direction are to be built on either side of the floodway, which will direct the waters into a specified channel of a width varying from ten to 20 miles; and new levees are to be constructed which will cause this floodway to carry waters formerly overflowing into the Tensas basin. The maximum previous flow of water into the Boeuf basin occurred in 1927, and is estimated at 450,000 cubic feet per second. Under the new plan, the flow may reach 1,250,000 feet per second in times of extraordinary flood. The War Department advertised for bids for the construction of guide levees for the Boeuf floodway, to be received June 17, 1929. To complete the project will probably require ten years.\n Kincaid owns a 160-acre farm in the Boeuf basin at a point 125 miles below the point of diversion. No part of the guide levees is to be built on his land; but the land lies within the proposed channel of the floodway. He alleges that the project will expose his property to additional destructive floods, and thus subject it to a new servitude; that the mere 'setting apart (of) this property as a flood way and diversion channel and ... advertising for and receiving bids for ... construction of the guide levees' casts a cloud upon his title; 1 and that the government is proposing to com- \n\n[285 U.S. 95, 101]\n\u00a0\n mence the work without having instituted condemnation proceedings. He charges that the acts of the defendants in advertising for bids for the construction of the guide levees, to be followed by the letting of contracts, without having taken proceedings to condemn his land, 'will mean the taking by the United States Government of complainant's lands and properties without due process of law and without just compensation.'\n All the defendants moved to dismiss the bill on the grounds, among others, that the United States had not consented to be sued, and that the bill disclosed no ground for equitable relief. The District Court held that the United States could not to made a party, since it had not consented to be sued; but overruled the motion to dismiss the suit on the ground that the United States was not an indispensable party; that section 4 of the act (33 USCA  702d) declares that 'the United States shall provide flowage rights for additional destructive flood waters that will \n\n[285 U.S. 95, 102]\n\u00a0\n pass by reason of diversions from the main channel of the Mississippi River';2 that, on the allegations of the bill, the creation of the Boeuf floodway would subject Kincaid's land to additional destructive flood waters; that the act required the government to condemn, or otherwise to acquire flowage rights over, the property before proceeding with the flood control project in the Boeuf basin; and that, by starting work before acquiring such rights, the defendants were proceeding in violation of both the act and the Constitution. 35 F.(2d) 235.\n Thereupon an answer was filed and the case was heard on evidence on final hearing. The defendants showed \n\n[285 U.S. 95, 103]\n\u00a0\n that, in the opinion of the Secretary of War and the Chief of Engineers, it was unnecessary to acquire any flowage rights over complainant's lands; insisted that these lands would be better protected under the plan than heretofore; and claimed that section 4 of the act was not applicable, because the plan would not subject the property to 'additional destructive flood waters.' The District Court found on these issues against the government; held that upon the evidence the plan involved a taking of rights in respect to Kincaid's land; and that, although the physical occupancy of it would not occur until the land had been overflowed in time of flood, 'the process of subjecting it to that service and the taking possession, in so far as is either necessary or contemplated by the act, will begin with the construction of the first levee or works which are intended to direct the water upon the land.' It enjoined the defendants, other than the United States, 'from proceeding with the construction authorized by or carrying out the plan adopted by ... the Mississippi River flood-control act in the Boeuf Basin flood way, ... until the property of the said complainant has been acquired by the United States government or the flowage rights over the same acquired either by purchase or condemnation for such purpose.' 37 F.(2d) 602. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the District Court. 49 F. (2d) 768. This Court granted a writ of certiorari. \n284 \nU.S. 610\n, 52 S. Ct. 127, 76 L. Ed . -.\n We have no occasion to determine any of the controverted issues of fact or any of the propositions of substantive law which have been argued. Kincaid concedes that the act is valid, and that it authorizes those intrusted with its execution to take his lands or an easement therein. We may assume that, as charged, the mere adoption by Congress of a plan of flood control which involves an intentional, additional, occasional flooding of complainant's land constitutes a taking of it-as soon as the government \n\n[285 U.S. 95, 104]\n\u00a0\n begins to carry out the project authorized. Compare United States v. Lynah, \n188 \nU.S. 445, 469\n, 23 S. Ct. 349; United States v. Cress, \n243 \nU.S. 316, 328\n, 37 S. Ct. 380; Peabody v. United States, \n231 \nU.S. 530, 538\n, 34 S.

If that which has been done, or is contemplated, does constitute such a taking, the complainant can recover just compensation under the Tucker Act (24 Stat. 505) in an action at law as upon an implied contract, since the validity of the act and the authority of the defendants are conceded. United States v. Great Falls Manufacturing Co., \n112 \nU.S. 645, 658\n, 5 S. Ct. 306; Great Falls Mamufacturing Co. v. Attorney General, \n124 \nU.S. 581, 600\n, 8 S. Ct. 631; Tempel v.

The compensation which he may obtain in such a proceeding will be the same as that which he might have been awarded had the defendants instituted the condemnation proceedings which it is contended the statute requires. Nor is it material to inquire now whether the statute does so require. For even if the defendants are acting illegally, under the act, in threatening to proceed without first acquiring flowage rights over the complainant's lands, the illegality, on complainant's own contention, is confined to the failure to compensate him for the taking, and affords no basis for an injunction if such compensation may be procured in an action at law. \n3\n The Fifth Amendment does not entitle him to be paid in advance of the taking.

That, the result of setting apart this area as a floodway or diversion channel and the publication by defendants of said advertisements for bids for the construction of the guide levees, this property has not only deteriorated in value but complainant's title to same has been seriously clouded, his use of same has been seriously affected, and complainant would be unable to borrow money on said lands, sell or dispose of same, or interest persons in operating said lands for farms or for any other purposes, owing to the fact that the Government has indicated that it has taken possession or intends to take immediate possession of this property for a diversion channel or a floodway. That, as a result of making this area, in which complainant's lands and those of others are situated, a floodway or diversion channel, these lands will be rendered unfit for agricultural or any other purpose. That the title to complainant's lands is seriously clouded by said acts, and his ability to use said properties or obtain credit thereon is seriously affected, and, as stated above, this property is well worth the sum of $9,000.00.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The following are the provisions of the act relevant to the payment of damages and of compensation for the taking of land.\n'Sec. 3. ...

L. 701, c. 92, as amended, 49 U.S.C.,  19a (49 USCA  19a). The Supreme Court of the District dismissed the petition. Its judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeals (60 App.D.C. 403, 55 F.(2d) 1028), and a writ of certiorari brings the case here (52 S. Ct. 496).\n The carrier operates lines of railroad in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New York. Its tracks enter the state of New York at or near Portchester, and at Woodlawn connect with the tracks of the New York & Harlem Railroad Company, now operated under lease by the New York Central System. From Woodlawn south to the Grand Central Station, a distance of about twelve miles, the carrier's passenger trains run over the Harlem tracks, and the carrier and the Central use the station in common. At Boston, Mass., the carrier's tracks connect with those of the Boston Terminal Company, the owner of the South Station in Boston; and \n\n[287 U.S. 178, 185]\n\u00a0\n the carrier has the use of that station in common with other lines. The facts bearing upon its interest in the Harlem tracks and the Grand Central Terminal will be considered first, and afterwards those bearing upon its interest in the terminal at Boston.\n On March 17, 1848, an 'agreement and contract of transportation' was entered into between the New York & Harlem Railroad Company and the New York & New Haven, a predecessor of the carrier. By this contract, the Harlem granted to the New Haven the right 'to run their trains, engines and cars for the transportation of passengers, mails, expresses, freight, etc., over the track or tracks of the road of the New York and Harlaem Railroad Company from the point of junction aforesaid to and into the city of New York.' The New Haven was to furnish its own haulage and to pay the Harlem 'as full compensation for the use and occupation of their track or tracks as aforesaid, a certain sum for each passenger transported,' and a portion of the tariff rates received for the transportation of express matter and the mails. Compensation was to be adjusted every five years by agreement, or in the event of failure to agree, by arbitration. Following the execution of this contract, and on March 29, 1948, the Legislature of New York (Laws N.Y. 1848, c. 143) passed an act to amend the charter of the New York and Harlem Railroad Company. In section 6 of that act, it confirmed the validity of the contract with the carrier's predecessor. 'The New York and New Haven Railroad Company is hereby authorized to enter upon and run their cars and engines for passengers, freights, mails, expresses and other business, over the road of the New York and Harlem Railroad Company, from the point of junction of the roads of said companies at or near William's Bridge, in the County of Westchester, to the City of New York, and as far into the said city as the said Harlem Railroad may extend, upon such terms, and to such point as has been or may \n\n[287 U.S. 178, 186]\n\u00a0\n hereafter be agreed upon by and between said companies, a copy of such agreement or agreements to be duly authenticated and filed in the office of the Secretary of State of this state.' Promptly upon the enactment of this statute, the New Haven connected its line with the tracks of the Harlem, and ever since that time has run its trains over them into the city of New York. The Harlem on April 1, 1872, leased its road to the New York Central for a term of 401 years, the lease reciting that it was subject to the contract between the Harlem and the New Haven.\n From a statement of the facts as to the carrier's interest in the tracks south of Woodlawn we pass to a consideration of its interest in the Grand Central Terminal. An agreement described as a 'tripartite lease' was entered into on November 1, 1872, between the Harlem, the Central, and the New Haven whereby the Harlem leased to the other roads the use of certain parts of the Grand Central Depot (a building since then destroyed) and the adjacent yards. On July 24, 1907, this agreement was superseded by another tripartite lease between the same parties. The Central agreed at its sole expense to acquire the lands and make all the changes necessary for the construction of a new station, the present Grand Central Terminal. Acting for itself and the Harlem, it leased to the New Haven during the term of the New Haven's Charter (i.e., in perpetuity) the 'use, in common with the Central Company, subject to all the provisions of this agreement, of the said Railroad Terminal for the accommodation of the traffic on the New Haven Company, other than freight traffic,' with the proviso that the New Haven's right to the use of the terminal should in no event exceed 50 per cent. of the maximum capacity. As 'compensation for the premises hereby demised,' the New Haven was to pay to the Central that proportion of 4 1\/4 per cent. interest on the cost of construction and of the annual expenses for \n\n[287 U.S. 178, 187]\n\u00a0\n maintenance and operation 'which the use of the Railroad Terminal by the New Haven Company bears to the entire use thereof.' The terminal was to be under the direction of a terminal manager appointed by the presidents of the Central and New Haven Companies and removable by either.\n Next in order is a statement of the interest of the carrier in the terminal at Boston. By an act of the Massachusetts Legislature, approved June 9, 1896 (St. 1896, c. 516), the Boston Terminal Company was incorporated with power to construct and maintain a union passenger station in the southerly part of the city of Boston, and to provide and operate adequate terminal facilities for the five railroad companies entering the city and for the accommodation of the public. Section 1. These railroad companies, including the New Haven, were severally authorized to subscribe for the capital stock in equal amounts. Upon the completion of the proposed improvements, the five railroads were to use the station and its terminal facilities for all their terminal passenger business in Boston, and were to pay to the Terminal Company the amounts necessary to satisfy the expenses of the corporate administration and of the maintenance and operation of the station and other facilities, together with interest on the bonds and a dividend not to exceed 4 per cent. on the capital stock. The payments by the several roads were to be proportioned to the use, and were to be deemed to be a part of their operating expenses. At the time of the trial, the New Haven, having succeeded to the interests of some of the other roads, held in its ownership or subject to its control 80 per cent. of the Terminal stock, the remaining 20 per cent. being controlled by the Central.\n With this statement of the facts as to the carrier's interests in the tracks and terminals, we reach the question whether the Commission was under a clear duty, enforce- \n\n[287 U.S. 178, 188]\n\u00a0\n able by mandamus, to include those interests with a specific valuation in the statutory inventory.\n By section 19a of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 U.S. Code,  19a, Act March 1, 1913, c. 92, 37 Stat. 401, as amended (49 USCA  19a)), there is laid upon the Commission the colossal task of preparing an inventory and valuation of the property of the railroads of the United States. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Subdivision a of the section is sweeping in its extension.\n'The commission shall ... investigate, ascertain, and report the value of all the property owned or used by every common carrier subject to the provisions of this chapter.' It 'shall make an inventory which shall list the property ... in detail, and show the value thereof as hereinafter provided, and shall classify the physical property, as nearly as practicable, in conformity with the classification of expenditures for road and equipment, as prescribed by the Interstate Commerce Commission.'\n\n Subdivision b contains directions as to the method of showing values and thus fulfills the promise of subdivision a that such directions as to form will be 'hereinafter provided.'\n The provisions are distributed into five classes.\n Under the heading 'first,' there is a command to the Commission to 'ascertain and report in detail as to each piece of property, other than land, owned or used by said common carrier for its purposes as a common carrier, the original cost to date, the cost of reproduction new, the cost of reproduction less depreciation, and an analysis of the methods by which these several costs are obtained, and the reason for their differences, if any.'\n For convenience of reference this part of the directions that are grouped under the heading 'first' will be described as number one. \n\n[287 U.S. 178, 189]\n\u00a0\n Under the same heading there is, however, another part which will be identified as number two.\n'The commission shall in like manner ascertain and report separately other values, and elements of value, if any, of the property of such common carrier, and an analysis of the methods of valuation employed, and of the reasons for any differences between any such value and each of the foregoing cost values.'\n\n The division described as 'second' contains directions for a report of the original cost and present value of lands, rights of way and terminals separately from improvements.\n The 'third' division deals with the valuation of property held for purposes other than those of a common carrier; the 'fourth' with the financial history and corporate structure of the carriers; and the 'fifth' with the ascertainment and valuation of governmental aids or gifts.\n By subdivision c the Commission is empowered, except as otherwise provided, 'to prescribe the method of procedure to be followed in the conduct of the investigation, the form in which the results of the valuation shall be submitted, and the classification of the elements that constitute the ascertained value.'\n The Commission at an early stage in its labors was confronted with the problem as to the proper method of valuation where there was a division of interest between the ownership and the use. The first exposition of its views upon that subject will be found in a decision made July 31, 1918, in the matter of the valuation of the Texas Midland Railroad, 75 I.C.C. 1, 20, 121, 122. The substance of its ruling there was that where property is jointly used by two owners, the details will appear in the inventory of each; that where property is owned by one carrier, and exclusively used by another, the details will appear in the inventory of the owner, but in addition \n\n[287 U.S. 178, 190]\n\u00a0\n the value will be shown in the inventory of the user; that where a carrier owns and uses property but gives to some other carrier not the exclusive use but only a qualified use in common with itself, such as the right to use its tracks, the fact and nature of the use will be described in the inventory of both the owner and the user, but the value of the property will be reported in the inventory of the owner solely. 'The physical property,' said the Commission (page 124 of 75 I.C.C.), 'is not changed by this dual use.' 'The law requires the ascertainment of values for property owned or used, but not the value of the use.' 75 I.C.C. 24. Despite the comprehensive command to report the value of all the property owned or used by any common carrier subject to the act, there is still, so the Commission held, some latitude of judgment as to the extent to which the component elements of worth are to be separated, and a specific valuation allocated to each.\n The Commission has steadfastly adhered to these principles in the fulfillment of its task. Along the lines there charted, a thousand inventories and reports have been made, it is said, during the nineteen years that have gone by since the valuation act was passed. Cf. Report of the I.C.C. for 1931, p. 68. In only one instance, except this, has the method, so far as we are informed, been challenged in the courts as a departure from the statute, and there mandamus was refused. U.S. ex rel. Kansas City Southern R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, 55 App.D.C. 389, 6 F.(2d) 692. Cf. Matter of Kansas City Southern Ry. Co., 75 I.C.C. 223, 234. What was done in this inventory has at least that sanction of validity which is born of long administrative practice. United States v. Moore, \n95 U.S. 760\n, 763; Logan v. Davis, \n233 \nU.S. 613, 627\n, 34 S.Ct. 685; Brewster v. Gage, \n280 \nU.S. 327, 336\n, 50 S.Ct. 115; Fawcus Machine Co. v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 375, 378\n, 51 S.Ct. 144. In conformity with that practice the Commission overruled the protest of the \n\n[287 U.S. 178, 191]\n\u00a0\n carrier, and held that the trackage rights over the Harlem roadbed and the rights of user in the New York and Boston terminals would be reported in the inventory as valuable rights or interests belonging to the carrier, but without assigning to them a specific value separate from the value given to the system as a whole. Like 'going concern value' and that of many other intangibles, the value of these qualified privileges of user, falling short of ownership or full possession of the physical thing, was not excluded altogether as an element to be reflected in the ultimate appraisal. Cf. Texas Midland R.R. Case, 75 I.C.C. 1, 69. What was held was no more than this, that the contribution of such factors was not a separate thing of value to be segregated from all the other values inhering in a unified system of railroad operation, and ticketed by itself. 'We report all the costs which are specifically named in the valuation act, on which we can obtain tangible data, and we find a single sum value after a consideration of those tangible costs and the intangible elements of value which inhere in a fully organized and operating property.' Cf. Des Moines Gas Co. v. Des Moines, \n238 \nU.S. 153, 165\n, 35 S.Ct. 811; McCardle v. Indianapolis Water Co., \n272 \nU.S. 400, 414\n, 47 S.Ct. 144. These are the words of the Commission in answering the carrier's objection that the going concern value had not been separately stated. Its answer might have been the same if it had been meeting the objection that privileges of user, incapable of appraisal in terms of the cost of the thing used, had been described in the inventory without specific appraisal of the value of the use.\n We are thus remitted to the question whether this method of classification, accredited to us, as it is, with all the authority springing from administrative practice, is a departure from any duty created by the statute, or, more accurately, from any duty so peremptory and unmistakable as to be enforceable by mandamus. True indeed it \n\n[287 U.S. 178, 192]\n\u00a0\n is that by the express direction of the statute there is to be a valuation of all the property owned or used by any carrier subject to the act. We do not travel very far upon the road to a solution of our problem by repeating that command. A valuation there is to be, for so it is commanded in section 19a, subd. a, but only 'as hereinafter provided,' and to discover what is 'hereinafter provided,' we must look to subdivision b. If there is nothing in subdivision b calling for the separate classification and appraisal of the value of a right to use, then the duty so to classify and appraise is not created by the statute, and certainly not created in any clear and peremptory way.\n We must distinguish between the ultimate result to be attained by the preparation of the inventory and the details of form and method prescribed for its attainment. To admit that there must be a valuation of the whole is not equivalent to admitting that a separate and specific valuation must be allocated to every kind of property interest embraced within the whole. To what extent a group of interests shall be resolved into its elements is thus a question of degree. If a barren literalism were to guide us, subdivision could be carried down to the dimensions of an atom. We are not to push the mandate to 'a drily logical extreme.' Noble State Bank v. Haskell, \n219 \nU.S. 104, 110\n, 31 S.Ct. 186, 187, 32 L.R.A.(N.S .) 1062, Ann. Cas. 1912A, 487. A roadbed and a terminal are property, but so are license privileges, and contracts for supplies, and rights in personam as well as those attaching to a res. Was it the meaning of the lawmakers that rights and interests such as these were to have a value specifically assigned to them apart from their relation to the 'going value' of the business? Not even counsel for the carrier would have us go so far. By concession there are forms of property which are to be considered by the Commission as contributions to a larger whole, and not as things apart. We were told upon the argument that the interests in the Harlem tracks might have been omitted from the inven- \n\n[287 U.S. 178, 193]\n\u00a0\n tory if they had been licenses, and nothing more. Specific valuation became necessary because, in the view of counsel, the interests had their basis in a franchise or an easement. A like distinction was drawn in respect of the interests in the terminals. They might have been omitted from the inventory, however great their value, if the privilege of use had been derived from a contract giving rise to a mere license. The omission of a specific valuation became wrongful, it was argued, if the interests amounted to a title or estate. The Commission declined to go into these niceties. 'It is ... not necessary for us to determine whether the right of use in the carrier is best defined by reference to it as a license to use, an easement or a trackage right.' We shall practice a like restraint, observing only in passing that the proper classification is obscure (Union Pacific Railway Co. v. Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railway Co., \n163 \nU.S. 564, 582\n, 583 S., 16 S.Ct. 1173; Union Pacific Railway Co. v. Mason City Railroad Co., \n222 \nU.S. 237, 247\n, 248 S., 32 S.Ct. 86 ), and that the carrier by its own conduct has admitted the obscurity. In its annual reports to the Commission, starting in 1888 and including the year preceding the beginning of this suit, its interests in the Harlem tracks and in the New York and Boston terminals are reported under 'class 5,' which is described in the report as including 'all tracks operated and maintained by others, but over which the respondent has the right to operate some or all of its trains. In roads of this class, the respondent has no proprietary rights, but only the rights of a licensee.' What concerns us at the moment, however, is not the fitness or the unfitness of one classification or another. What matters for present purposes is the carrier's concession that the command to prepare an inventory in which all the property shall be valued does not mean that every property interest shall be separately valued. Something, then, is to be abated from the dictates of an implacable literalism allowing no exceptions. \n\n[287 U.S. 178, 194]\n\u00a0\n At one point or another a line of division has to be drawn between the property to go in and the property a stay out. The location of the line will involve considerations of legislative intention and administrative judgment. Division being necessary, did the members of the Commission ignore a plain and certain duty in making it where they did?\n In our summary of the statute, the provisions under the heading 'first' of subdivision b,  19a, were separated into two parts, described as numbers one and two. Part number one was intended to procure the valuation of a railroad considered as a physical thing. Every 'piece of property' is to be inventoried, and with reference to every 'piece' so inventoried the Commission is to ascertain the investment in the thing, and the cost of producing it anew. The factors have been made familiar by historic litigations. Smyth v. Ames, \n169 \nU.S. 466\n, 18 S.Ct. 418; St. Louis & O'Fallon Railway Co. v. United States, \n279 \nU.S. 461\n, 49 S. Ct. 384. But the statute does not mean that there shall be a duty to appraise in terms of cost if the interest to be appraised is such that the cost of the thing is without relevance as a criterion of the value of the interest. There can be no plain and certain duty, enforceable by mandamus, to proceed to a valuation that will be a snare or a deception. Here the New Haven has not invested anything in the roadbed or the terminals. It is not affected for good or ill by fluctuations in the cost of building them anew. Whatever the legal category in which its interests are to be placed, the value is independent of the cost of the thing in which those interests inhere. Plainly untenable is its contention that the amount to be allowed to it is the proportion of the cost value of the property that would result from a division of such value between itself and the Central in the ratio of use. Matter of New York, New Haven & Hartford R. Co., 30 I.C.C.Val.Rep. 1, at pages 31, 33. Such a method of appraisal ignores the millions of dollars payable year by year in perpetuity to keep \n\n[287 U.S. 178, 195]\n\u00a0\n the privilege alive. It treats as an investment what is merely a contingent debt. The value of the trackage rights, whether one views them as amounting to a license or an easement, is not the cost of the roadbed, but the difference between the value of the use and the rent to be paid therefor. The value of the interests in the terminals, whatever the proper name for them, must be measured in the same way. Today, under the Transportation Act of 1920, the Commission may compel a carrier owning terminal facilities to grant to other carriers the use of such facilities, including main line tracks for a reasonable distance, in return for a compensation prescribed as just and reasonable. 49 U.S. Code,  3(4), 49 USCA  3(4). For all that appears the rights now in controversy might continue to be enjoyed though the agreements set forth in the record were to be rescinded or annulled, and enjoyed at a smaller cost, if a rental lower than the existing one were to be fixed by the Commission. Be that as it may, the value for the New Haven is not the value of the thing or piece of property owned or used, or of any fractional interest therein. The value for the New Haven is the value of the use, which is measured by the difference between the rent payable under the lease and the fair and reasonable rent that would be the compensation payable to the owner in the absence of agreement. There is nothing to indicate that the carrier laid testimony before the Commission as to what this difference would be. Cf. Texas Midland Railroad Case, 75 I.C.C. 1, 24. It took its stand upon the position that pro tanto, in proportion to its use, it was the owner of the fee.\n The argument will be made, however, that the Commission is inconsistent. Appraisal on the basis of cost has been thought to be suitable where the lessee has a possession exclusive of the owner. Why, then, is it not suitable also where the interest of the lessee is in common with the owner, and this though the interest fluctuates from \n\n[287 U.S. 178, 196]\n\u00a0\n day to day with the measure of the use? No doubt the practice of the Commission has been what the argument assumes. The practice has been, as we have already pointed out, when the possession of a lessee is exclusive of the possession of the owner, to inventory leased property in the name of each of them, setting down for each the original and the reproduction cost of the subject matter of the lease, setting down the fact of use, and making allowance thereafter for any increase or deduction due by reason of such use when costs are readjusted and corrected to express the final values. \n2\n Never upon the face of the inventory has there been a specific valuation of the interest of the lessor and that of the lessee considered as estates in the land and structures and apart from the valuation of the property demised. The Commission has been unfaltering in its adherence to the principle that the value to be reported is the value of the thing, and not of every interest connected with the thing. Whenever the nature of a lease is such that the cost of what is leased may appropriately be taken as an index of the value of the leasehold, the inventory and the valuation have been made upon that basis. Whenever the interest has been such that cost is not an index, the test of cost has been rejected. In the application of these methods there has been no discrimination between this carrier and others. In the inventory now in controversy there are properties owned by the New Haven, and wholly leased to other lines, and properties owned by other lines, and wholly leased to the New Haven. For all these properties the reproduction cost is set forth in the inventory of the New Haven System without specific appraisal of the value of the reversion as an interest subject to the lease, or the value of the lease as an interest distinct from the rever- \n\n[287 U.S. 178, 197]\n\u00a0\n sion. The New Haven itself is thus the beneficiary of the principle that the inventory is to set forth the value of the thing, and not of every interest touching the enjoyment of the thing.\n We recur, then, to the question why the method of appraisal that has been thought to be appropriate where a lessee has the sole use may not be followed here also where in common with the owner the lessee has an undivided interest in the use of tracks and terminals in return for yearly payments. Perhaps a sufficient answer is that it is never mandatory on the Commission to value the interest of any lessee on the basis of the cost, though such a method may in certain circumstances be appropriate as an exercise of discretion. But other answer are available, if this be thought inadequate. There can be no doubt that even in its application to a sole lessee, the method of valuing a lease on the basis of the cost of the property demised is at best a rough and ready approximation. Even so, the formation of a rate base by treating a lessee as owner and measuring a fair return of income as a percentage of the cost may yield a reasonable average of accuracy where the interest of the lessee is constant and the rentals that it pays are excluded from the computation of its operating expenses. Such exclusion is required by the accounting rules of the Commission where the lessee has the sole use. The practice is different, however, where a carrier has the benefit of joint-facilities. There the rentals paid for the use of the facilities are part of the operating expenses, and were so treated in the case at hand. This treatment of them has the support of statute (Transportation Act 1920; 49 U.S. Code,  15a(1 ), 49 USCA  15a(1)3 as well as of administrative practice. A car- \n\n[287 U.S. 178, 198]\n\u00a0\n rier receives a duplication of benefits if it is permitted to include its rentals as an operating expense while earning a return upon the value of an unincumbered fee. 4 Aside from this objection, a lease which gives to the lessee, not exclusive possession of the property demised, nor even a fixed share, but a share fluctuating from time to time with the variations of the business, is too uncertain and inconstant to be valued with even approximate correctness by the test of the cost of the property subjected to the use. The Commission was satisfied to adopt the formula of cost where the lease was such as to lead it to believe that the margin of error would not be inordinately large. \n5\n Nothing in the statute makes it mandatory to apply the same formula, inaccurate at best, to leases of a different nature if the margin of error would thereby be increased. \n6\n Nor is there anything in the objection that by force of section 15a of the Transportation Act 1920, a form of inventory permissible under section 19a of the valuation act of 1913 is permissible no longer. The act of 1920\n\n\n\n\n[287 U.S. 178, 199]\n\u00a0\n authorizes the Commission to 'utilize the results of its investigation under section 19a' of the Interstate Commerce Act for certain additional purposes 'in so far as deemed by it available.' 49 U.S. Code,  15a(4), 49 USCA  15a(4). There is nothing in the new statute to suggest that earlier inventories are to be revised, or that forms of valuation lawful in the past are to be unlawful in the future.\n What has been written serves, we think, to show that the interests in controversy are not affected by that part of subdivision b,  19a, of the statute which we have identified as number one. The question remains whether a specific valuation is made mandatory by the provisions of the part identified as number two. 'The commission shall in like manner ascertain and report separately other values, and elements of value, if any, of the property of such common carrier, and an analysis of the methods ... employed, and of the reasons for any differences between any such value and each of the foregoing cost values.' The carrier did not build its case on that command in making proof to the Commission. It took the position, on the contrary, that it was an owner of the roadbed and the terminals in proportion to its use and made its proof accordingly. See Matter of New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad Company, 30 I.C.C.Val. Rep. 1, 31, 32, 33. There can surely have been no breach by the Commission of an inflexible and certain duty in omitting from an inventory a separate and specific estimate of the difference between the value of the use and the rents reserved to the lessors when the protest of the carrier was silent as to what the valuation ought to be. The result will be the same, however, though this defect be overlooked. The command to report other elements of value does not impose a duty, inflexible and certain, to appraise the value of a use which is unrelated to the value of what is subject to the use. The ends to be attained are differ- \n\n[287 U.S. 178, 200]\n\u00a0\n ent. They can be gathered from a report of the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce submitted to the Senate in February, 1913. 62nd Congress, 3rd Session, No. 1290, p. 8. The report begins with a consideration of the three criteria of value that are stated in part one of subdivision b: first, original cost; second, cost of reproduction new; third, cost of reproduction, less depreciation. From these it passes to a consideration of the effect and purpose of part two, prefacing the discussion with the title 'other values and elements of value; that is, intangible values.' 'This classification,' the report continues, 'provides for going value, good will value, and franchise value. Whether any or all of these values will be considered by the Commission or the courts in determining the fair value of the property, and if so, what importance shall attach to them is a matter for the Commission and the courts. Especially as to intangible values, the Commission and the courts are in a transition period. The elements of value which will finally constitute fair value for rate-making purposes are steadily narrowing. They are not expanding. No decision by Commission or court will stand which is ultimately found to be unfair to the public or to the common carrier. The committee has, it is believed, provided for ascertaining every element of value which, upon recognized authority, should be considered.' Congress had no thought to tie the hands of the Commission by imposing a peremptory duty to classify in any particular way the factors supplementing or modifying the significance of cost, and to allocate to each a specific value. The report makes it clear that Congress did not know what those factors were, and that the Commission, guided by the courts, was to work out in its own way a practical and fair result. Whatever duty was imposed had its basis in a general admonition which left a wide and indefinite margin of judgment as to the method of obedience. \n\n[287 U.S. 178, 201]\n\u00a0\n In the light of these considerations, the aim of the statute in bidding heed to be given to other elements of value than those of cost alone, is readily discerned. Its aim is to afford play for the correction of the errors certain to result where the value of a railroad is identified with the cost of its component parts without reference to the values generated or extinguished by the union of the parts into a single and organic whole. Effects that are the resultant of two or more forces working in combination may be capable of appraisal when it would be difficult, if not impossible, to estimate the consequences of any one of the forces operating singly. For an illustration of this truth we have only to bear in mind the obscure and varied factors, psychical as well as physical, that enter into the creation of the 'going value' of a business. Not infrequently the value of these intangibles will be an aggregate made up of elements too deeply interpenetrated for any specific figure to be set opposite to one of them dissevered from the others. What is true of 'going value' is true of roadbeds and stations, of trackage rights and rights in terminals. As soon as one passes beyond an appraisal of the cost, the increments or the deductions involve estimates of relation, the parts being worthless or nearly so unless adapted to the whole. Not a mile of track would be worth the cost of reproducing it, nor a trackage right the rental, if there were not stations at either end. Not a station would be worth the cost of building it anew if there were not roadbeds or tracks or trackage rights beyond. The final value set down in the report of the Commission shows that over and above the cost of reproduction less depreciation, something has been added, in appraising the property of the carrier, to express the value of the whole as distinguished from the total of the parts. Not even the depreciated reproduction cost, let alone something in addition, would \n\n[287 U.S. 178, 202]\n\u00a0\n have been reported as the final value if the road had been viewed as a congeries of fragments. To argue that the Commission ignored these intangibles altogether because it failed to value them specifically is to miss the significance of the whole process of appraisal. Every trackage contract and every terminal use, in so far as it contributes to the unity of the system, is reflected in the final value ascribed to the physical things that are listed in the inventory. The Harlem trackage contract is there reflected, for the reproduction cost would cease to be a measure of the value if the trains stopped short at Woodlawn. The rights in the New York and Boston terminals are there, for again the reproduction cost would be of no avail as a criterion if there were no terminal facilities for passengers at Boston or New York. The question is not whether trackage rights and rights in terminals are interests that the Commission is at liberty to treat as non-existent. The question is whether they are interests of such a kind that they must be specifically valued instead of being viewed as factors that enter by infusion into the lifeblood of the organism. If there is anything in the statute requiring values of that order to be separately stated, the carrier has not pointed to it. In the absence of such a duty, nothing in the report of valuation justifies a holding that any property interest was excluded altogether. 'We have given careful consideration,' said the Commission, 'to all facts of record and pertaining to the value of the common-carrier property of the carrier as an organized, developed, well-maintained, seasoned property in operation as a going concern.' Many diverse elements, reacting one upon another, have been fused in an act of judgment drawing its sustenance from all.\n A word may yet be due with reference to those provisions of subdivision b of the statute which are set forth \n\n[287 U.S. 178, 203]\n\u00a0\n under the heading 'second.' 'Such investigation and report,' it is there said, 'shall state in detail and separately from improvements the original cost of all lands, rights of way, and terminals owned or used for the purpose of a common carrier, and ascertained as of the time of dedication to public use, and the present value of the same.' The rights of way there in view are those that involve an investment of the moneys of the carrier, and result in the possession of the land itself, the roadbed on which the tracks are laid. State of Georgia v. Trustees of Cincinnati Southern Railway Co., \n248 \nU.S. 26, 28\n, 39 S.Ct. 14. They do not include the privilege of hauling cars for a rental over the roadbed of another. What is true of rights of way is true also of terminals. If the New Haven has no interest in the improvements constituting the roadbed and the terminal stations sufficient to require a specific valuation of its interests under parts one and two of subdivision 'first,' it has none sufficient to require such valuation under subdivision 'second.'\n We do not go beyond the necessities of the case before us in shaping our decision. Whether an inventory such as this one, omitting a specific valuation of important rights and interests, gives full or adequate effect to the intention of the lawmakers, we are not required to determine. In later or collateral controversies that question may be pertinent. For the purpose of this case, it is enough to hold, as we do, that the duty of specific valuation, if it exists, has been imposed upon the Commission too vaguely and obscurely to be enforced by a mandamus. United States ex rel. Redfield v. Windom, \n137 \nU.S. 636\n, 11 S.Ct. 197; Wilbur v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 206\n, 50 S.Ct. 320, 324. One cannot rise from a study of the statute in the setting of its history and of the administrative practice under it and hold at the end an assured belief that the Commission has been commanded by the Congress to do the act omit- \n\n[287 U.S. 178, 204]\n\u00a0\n ted. Where a duty is not plainly prescribed, but is to be gathered by doubtful inference from statutes of uncertain meaning, 'it is regarded as involving the character of judgment or discretion' (Wilbur v. United States, supra), and mandamus is thereby excluded. The case at hand differs in essentials from Kansas City Southern Railway Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n252 \nU.S. 178\n, 40 S.Ct. 187, where a specific, unequivocal command, removed after the decision by an amendment of the statute,7 was laid upon the Commission to value a particular thing, and the Commission ignored the command to the extent of refusing to hear any evidence whatever. The ruling in that suit has been explained in later cases, and confined to its peculiar facts. Interstate Commerce Commission v. U.S. ex rel. Members of Waste Merchants' Association, \n260 \nU.S. 32, 35\n, 43 S.Ct. 6; United States v. Los Angeles S.L. Railroad Co., \n273 \nU.S. 299, 311\n, 47 S.Ct. 413.\n Public policy forbids that the work of the Commission in the fulfilment of the stupendous task of valuation shall be hampered by writs of mandamus except where the departure from the statute is clear beyond debate. The report is not a stage in a judicial proceeding affecting this carrier or others. 'It is the exercise solely of the function of investigation.' United States v. Los Angeles Railroad Co., supra, page 310 of 273 U.S., 47 S.Ct. 413, 414. The final valuations made in it will indeed be prima facie evidence against the carrier in proceedings under the Commerce Act. 49 U.S. Code,  19a, subd. b(1), 49 USCA  19a, subd. b( 1). Even so, the opportunity to contest them, if at any time they are introduced in evidence, is 'fully preserved to the carrier, and any error therein may be corrected at the trial.' United States v. Los Angeles Railroad Co., supra, page 313 of 273 U.S., 47 S.Ct. 413, 415. The valuation of the railroads of the country has been ordered by the Congress in \n\n[287 U.S. 178, 205]\n\u00a0\n the belief that this new 'Domesday Book' will promote an important public purpose. Nearly twenty years have passed since that belief found expression in the enactment of the statute, and the work is still unfinished. Report of the I.C.C. for 1931, p. 68. In the meantime the enactment of section 15a of the Interstate Commerce Act, as added by Transportation Act of 1920  422, has made the need for valuation more imperative than ever. 49 U.S. Code,  15a, 49 USCA  15a. In any work so vast and intricate, what is to be looked for is not absolute accuracy, but an accuracy that will mark an advance upon previous uncertainty. If every doubt as to the extent and form of valuation is to be dispelled by mandamus, the achievement of the ends of Congress, already long deferred, will be put off till the Greek Kalends.\n The judgment of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia is reversed, and the judgment of the Supreme Court dismissing the petition affirmed.\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, and Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND are unable to concur in this decision. But, as the decision is put distinctly on the ground that the specific duty sought to be enforced by mandamus is not so definitely and plainly described by the statute as to justify the application of that remedy, and the question whether the inventory in controversy, omitting a specific valuation of important rights and interests, gives full or adequate effect to the intent of the statute, is not determined but distinctly reserved for future contestations, they deem it sufficient to say at this time that they regard the reasons assigned by the Court of Appeals for its judgment as sound and requiring an affirmance of its judgment.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice BUTLER took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The events leading up to the adoption of the act and the public policy it was designed to further will be found clearly stated in Sharfman, The Interstate Commerce Commission, vol. 1, pp. 117 to 137. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The practice is explained by Mr. Esch, formerly Valuation Analyst of the Commission, in an article 'Valuation of Leased Railroad Property.' 33 Yale L.J. 272, 276, 277. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 'The term 'net railway operating income' means railway operating income, including in the computation thereof debits and credits arising from equipment rents and joint facility rents.'\n There is a like direction in the act incorporating the Boston terminal. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Esch, Leased Railroad Property, supra, at page 274. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] 'Not only is the matter of proportion of use at any particular moment largely speculative, but it varies from time to time.'

The answer was in substance that such a case might be taken care of in either one of two ways, by valuing the property as if it were owned by the lessee or by making allowance for the rent as an operating expense, and that it would be the function of the Commission to determine the preferable method in any given situation. The members of the Committee apparently acquiesced. Senator La Follette adverted to the possibility of a double valuation if one railroad had the privilege of running its trains over the tracks of another, and added that, of course, only one valuation would be proper.

Thacher, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The material facts as found by the Court of Claims are these: In December, 1918, fire broke out on the United States Army Transport Logan bound from San Francisco to Manila with a general cargo belonging to various owners. The Logan was under the operation, management, and control of the United States. The cargo consisted in part of military supplies for American troops in Siberia and the Philippine Islands, supplies belonging to the government of the Philippine Islands, supplies belonging to the American Red Cross, and a small amount of personal property of officers of the United States Army, all of which was being transported free of charge. In extinguishing the fire, some of the cargo was damaged by water, and some or all of the cargo was covered by insurance against general average losses. \n\n[287 U.S. 459, 461]\n\u00a0\n In August, 1922, the general superintendent and administrative officer of the Army Transport Service of the Quartermaster Corps requested the petitioner, a corporation doing business as average adjuster and insurance broker, to prepare 'a statement of general average in order that the responsibility of the various parties concerned may be determined.' Attached to this request was a communication from the Acting Judge Advocate General of the United States to the Quartermaster General which referred to the claim of the marine underwriters for contribution in general average, and stated: 'The claim being a valid one, it is therefore recommended that prompt steps be taken to ascertain the amount due the insurance company by way of contribution in general average. For this purpose, it is recommended that the matter be referred to a general average adjuster.' Petitioner accordingly made its investigation, and prepared and submitted to the general superintendent of the Army Transport Service at San Francisco the usual general average statement. For this service and incidental disbursements, petitioner made the 'usual, customary and reasonable charge,' and, upon disallowance of the claim by the Comptroller General, petitioner brought this suit.\n The Court of Claims held that the government was not liable to contribute in general average and that, in consequence, none of its officers had authority to contract for the preparation of a general average statement. The Court of Claims dismissed the petition, and this Court granted certiorari. \n287 \nU.S. 583\n, 53 S.Ct. 18, 77 L.Ed. --.\n The Solicitor General, while not formally confessing error, and while reserving the question whether the government was liable to contribute in general average, is in accord with petitioner's contention that the proper officer of the government was authorized to employ petitioner for the purpose stated. We are of the opinion that this view is correct. In the circumstances, petitioner's right \n\n[287 U.S. 459, 462]\n\u00a0\n did not depend upon the determination of the liability of the government to contribute in general average. The question of that liability could not be regarded as free from doubt. The cargo underwriters had made claim for contribution, and the Judge Advocate General of the Army had advised that the claim was valid. On receiving this information, it was the duty of the officer responsible for the operation of the vessel to prepare the general average statement in order that the basis for adjustment might be available. Ralli v. Troop, \n157 \nU.S. 386, 400\n, 15 S.Ct. 657. That duty, in this instance, apart from the question of the liability of the government for general average as to which it is not now necessary to express an opinion, lay with the general superintendent and administrative officer of the Army Transport Service, and, in order that he might properly perform it, he was entitled to avail himself of the assistance of general average adjusters.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","84":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKOENIG v.

The secretary of state, invoking the provisions of article 1,  4, of the Constitution of the United States, and those of the Act of Congress of August 8, 1911, c. 5, 37 Stat. 13 (2 USCA  2 and note, 3-5), and also the requirements of the Constitution of the state in relation to the enactment of laws, alleged that the concurrent resolution in question was ineffective, as it had not been submitted to the Governor for approval and had not been approved by him. The Court of Appeals of the state, construing the federal constitutional provision as contemplating the exercise of the lawmaking power, sustained the respondent's defense and affirmed the decision of the lower courts refusing the writ. 258 N. Y. 292, 179 N. E. 705. This court granted a writ of certiorari. \n285 \nU.S. 532\n, 52 S.

The Court of Appeals decided that, in the absence of a new districting statute dividing the state into forty-five congressional districts, forty-three representatives are to be elected in the existing districts as defined by the state law, and the two additional representatives by the state at large.\n For the reasons stated in the opinion in No. 617, Smiley v.

Ct. 43, 76 L. Ed. -, to review a judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, 48 F.(2d) 537, reversing a decree of the District Court for Northern Mississippi, which quashed citation issued on respondent's petition to punish Lamb for contempt, and which dismissed the petition.\n The petition was ancillary to a suit brought to set aside conveyances of land and other dispositions of money and personal property by the defendant Holland to other defendants, as in fraud of judgment creditors. The petition set up that pending the suit Holland had transferred to Lamb, who was acting as her attorney, a substantial part of the property involved in the suit, said to have been in payment of attorney's fees. It prayed citation against Lamb, the petitioner here, to show cause why he should not be held in contempt of court, and for other relief, including an injunction restraining further transfers of the property, and the cancellation of those already made.\n Lamb appeared and answered the petition as one to punish for contempt. Pending disposition of that proceeding, final decree, in the main cause, was entered on consent, declaring that the judgments of the plaintiffs in that suit were a lien on the property described in the bill from the date of its filing, and appointing a receiver to take possession of the property and liquidate the lien. The decree as entered was stated to be without prejudice to the rights of Lamb, who was not a party to it, and \n\n[285 U.S. 217, 219]\n\u00a0\n reserved to the court jurisdiction of the cause to make further orders for the preservation of the rights of the parties. The petition in the contempt proceeding then pending was later dismissed by the District Court on the motion of Lamb, setting up want of jurisdiction of the subject- matter and of his person.\n The court below rightly held that, upon the facts presented by the petition, proceedings might be had against Lamb, either by bill in equity, as was done by the supplemental bill filed by the receiver in Lamb v. Schmitt, \n285 \nU.S. 222\n, 52 S. Ct. 317, 76 L. Ed. -, decided this day, or by contempt proceedings, as in the present case, or by both, to compel restoration of the diverted property to the custody of the court. The petitioner, as counsel in the principal suit, had notice of the equities alleged in the bill. So far as he acquired, pendente lite, any interest in the property involved in the suit, he was not only subject to those equities, but bound by any decree which the court might make with respect to it, to the extent that it might adjudicate the rights of the plaintiffs against the defendants. State of Utah et al. v. United States, \n284 \nU.S. 534\n, 52 S. Ct. 232, decided February 15, 1932; Mellen v. Moline Malleable Iron Works, \n131 \nU.S. 352, 371\n, 9 S. Ct. 781; Tilton v. Cofield, \n93 U.S. 163\n; Warren v. Marcy, \n97 U.S. 96\n, 105; cf. Terrell v. Allison, 21 Wall. 289. The provision in the decree that it should be without prejudice to the rights of Lamb postponed until further order of the court the adjudication of his rights, but did not forestall it. His receipt and diversion of the property, which was then in gremio legis, see Metcalf v. Barker, \n187 U.S. 165\n, 173 et seq., 23 S. Ct. 67; Pierce v. United States, \n255 \nU.S. 398\n, 41 S. Ct. 365, tended to defeat any decree which the court might ultimately make in the cause. That and his retention of the property after the decree was entered were in fraud of the rights of the plaintiffs to prosecute the suit to its conclusion, and an obstruction of justice constituting a contempt of court which might be proceeded against civilly. Merrimack \n\n[285 U.S. 217, 220]\n\u00a0\n River Savings Bank v. Clay Center, \n219 \nU.S. 527, 535\n, 536 S., 31 S. Ct. 295, Ann. Cas. 1912A, 513; Clay v. Waters (C. C. A.) 178 F. 385, 390, 391, 21 Ann. Cas. 897. Cf. In re Swan, \n150 \nU.S. 637\n, 14 S. Ct. 225\n\n\n The objections chiefly urged by petitioner are that the present proceeding was criminal in its nature, to punish for criminal contempt, and hence the order dismissing the petition was not appealable, United States v. Sanges, \n144 \nU.S. 310, 323\n, 12 S. Ct. 609; Toledo Newspaper Company v. United States, \n247 \nU.S. 402, 410\n, 38 S. Ct. 560; and that, if the proceeding be regarded as civil, still no appeal would lie from the order of dismissal, because no appeal was taken from the final decree in the principal suit.\n We think it plain that the petition, although inartistically drawn, invoked the power of the court to punish for contempt in aid of the adjudication sought in the principal suit. Hence, the proceeding is to be deemed a civil one, and, as the order of the District Court finally denied the relief sought, it could be appealed. The petition charged the contumacious acts of Lamb in diverting the property, which was the subject- matter of the principal suit. The prayer of the petition for relief, which is determinative of the nature of the proceeding, see Gompers v. Buck's Stove & Range Co., \n221 \nU.S. 418, 448\n, 31 S. Ct. 492, 34 L. R. A. (N. S.) 874, declared that its purpose was to secure restoration of the diverted property in order to carry out the decree in the principal suit. The court cited Lamb to show cause why he should not be punished for contempt and why he should not be adjudged to hold the property subject to the jurisdiction of the court.\n To the extent that this purpose might be effected by process against Lamb for contempt, the proceeding was remedial, to aid in giving to the plaintiffs the property which, as against the defendants in the principal suit, they were entitled to receive. It is the purpose of the punishment, rather than the character of the act punished, which determines whether the proceeding is for \n\n[285 U.S. 217, 221]\n\u00a0\n civil or criminal contempt.

Even though the particular acts of the petitioner may take the characteristics of both a civil and a criminal contempt, and so may not be classified as exclusively one or the other, see Bessette v. W. B. Conkey Co., \n194 \nU.S. 324, 329\n, 24 S. Ct. 665, still, under the allegations and prayer of the petition, it would have been competent for the District Court to punish the contempt by its coercive order until Lamb made restitution of the property or to impose a fine, payable to the receiver, compensation for its taking. A proceeding to secure such relief is civil in its nature. See Gompers v. Buck's Stove & Range Co., supra, page 449 of 221 U. S., 31 S. Ct. 492; Bessette v. W. B.

It is true that the assignments erroneously described the order of the District Court as one sustaining a motion to quash the service of process, a mistake which may well have been induced by the inept use of language in the \n\n[285 U.S. 217, 222]\n\u00a0\n motion. But the assignments, despite their lack of clarity, are not incapable of being construed as asserting the grounds for reversal adopted by the court below and stated in this opinion. In any case, the court below was not precluded from reversing for errors appearing on the face of the record, even though unassigned. McBride v. Neal (C. C. A.) 214 F. 966, 969; United States v.

Cook, both of Clarksdale, Miss., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case is here on certiorari, \n284 \nU.S. 609\n, 52 S. Ct. 43, 76 L. Ed. -, to review a decree of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, 48 F.(2d) 533, reversing an order of the District Court for Northern Mississippi, which quashed service of process upon the petitioner, Lamb. The suit is a companion to Lamb v. Cramer, \n285 \nU.S. 217\n, 52 S. Ct. 315, 76 L. Ed. -, decided this day, and, like it, is ancillary to the principal suit referred to in that case, which was brought to set aside conveyances of land and dispositions of money and personal property as in fraud of judgment creditors.\n The present suit was brought by the respondent here, the receiver appointed by the decree in the first one. In seeks the recovery of a part of the funds involved in the first suit, paid, pendente lite, as fees to Lamb, who acted as attorney of one of the defendants in that suit. The petitioner, a resident of Illinois, was served with process while he was in the Northern District of Mississippi in attendance on the court as an attorney in the principal suit. The sole question presented is whether the court below rightly held that the petitioner, in the circumstances stated, was not immune from service of process.\n\n\n[285 U.S. 222, 225]\n\u00a0\n The general rule that witnesses, suitors, and their attorneys, while in attendance in connection with the conduct of one suit, are immune from service of process in another, is founded, not upon the convenience of the individuals, but of the court itself. Page Co. v. Macdonald, \n261 \nU.S. 446\n, 43 S. Ct. 416; Stewart v. Ramsay, \n242 \nU.S. 128, 130\n, 37 S. Ct. 44; Hale v. Wharton (C. C.) 73 F. 739; Diamond v. Earle, 217 Mass. 499, 501, 105 N.

As commonly stated and applied, it proceeds upon the ground that the due administration of justice requires that a court shall not permit interference with the progress of a cause pending before it, by the service of process in other suits, which would prevent, or the fear of which might tend to discourage, the voluntary attendance of those whose presence is necessary or convenient to the judicial administration in the pending litigation. See Bridges v. Sheldon (C. C.) 7 F. 17, 43 et seq. In Stewart v. Ramsay, the court said at page 130, of 242 U. S., 37 S. Ct. 44, 46, quoting from Parker v. Hotchkiss, Fed. Cas. No. 10,739: 'The privilege which is asserted here is the privilege of the court, rather than of the defendant. It is founded in the necessities of the judicial administration, which would be often embarrassed, and sometimes interrupted, if the suitor might be vexed with process while attending upon the court for the protection of his rights, or the witness while attending to testify.'\n It follows that the privilege should not be enlarged beyond the reason upon which it is founded, and that it should be extended or withheld only as judicial necessities require. See Brooks v. State, 3 Boyce (Del.) 1, 79 A. 790, 51 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1126, Ann. Cas. 1915A, 1133; Netograph Co. v. Scrugham, 197 N. Y. 377, 90 N. E. 962, 27 L. R. A. (N. S.) 333, 134 Am. St. Rep. 886; Nichols v. Horton ( C. C.) 14 F. 327; Iron Dyke Copper Min. Co. v. Iron Dyke R. Co. (C. C.) 132 F. 208. Limitations of it on this basis have been not infrequently made because the attendance upon the trial of a \n\n[285 U.S. 222, 226]\n\u00a0\n cause, however vital to the personal interests of those concerned, was not for the purpose of facilitating the progress of the cause, see Brooks v. State, supra; Vaughn v. Boyd, 142 Ga. 230, 82 S. E. 576, L. R. A. 1915A, 694; Sampson v. Graves, 208 App. Div. 522, 526, 203 N. Y. S. 729; or because the service was made on one whose attendance was not voluntary, and hence had no tendency to interfere with judicial administration, Netograph Mfg. Co. v. Scrugham, supra.\n The question presented here is of a somewhat different character: Whether, despite any effect of the immunity in encouraging voluntary attendance at the trial, it should be withheld from one who, while in attendance, is served with process commanding his continued presence and aid to facilitate the pending litigation, and to carry it to its final conclusion?\n It has never been doubted that witnesses, parties, and their counsel are amenable to the process or order of the court for contempt of court, committed while in attendance upon the trial, or that any of them, while there, are subject to the process and orders of the court to compel the production of documents or their testimony in the cause. Nor can it be doubted that the petitioner here, notwithstanding his presence as an attorney and officer of the court in the conduct of the principal cause, was not immune from the service of process in a summary proceeding to compel restoration of the subject-matter of the suit wrongfully removed from the custody of the court. See Lamb v. Cramer, supra. The deterrent effect, if any, upon attendance at the trial, of the possibility that these procedures may be resorted to, is outweighed by the fact that the immunity, if allowed, might paralyze the arm of the court and defeat the ends of justice in the very cause for the protection of which the immunity is invoked. \n\n[285 U.S. 222, 227]\n\u00a0\n These considerations have in special circumstances led to a denial of the immunity, even though the service was made in an independent suit in no sense ancillary to the pending litigation. See Livengood v. Ball, 63 Okl. 93, 162 P. 768, L. R. A. 1917C, 905; Rizo v. Burruel, 23 Ariz. 137, 202 P. 234, 19 A. L. R. 823. But it is not necessary to go so far in the present case. Here the two suits, pending in the same court, are not independent of each other or unrelated. The second was brought in aid of the first, on which the petitioner, when served with process, was in attendance, charged with the duty of counsel in the case to assist the court. It was brought to secure rights asserted in the first suit which, but for the acts charged against the petitioner in the second, would have been secured in the first. Cf. Page Co. v. Macdonald, supra. The later suit was so much a part and continuation of the earlier one that the jurisdiction of the court over the first extended to the second without regard to citizenship of the parties or the satisfaction of any other jurisdictional requirements. Pacific Railroad of Missouri v. Missouri Pacific Railway Co., \n111 \nU.S. 505, 522\n, 4 S. Ct. 583.\n From the viewpoint of the due administration of justice in the first suit, the second was as much a part of it as if it had been an interlocutory motion to compel the production in court of documents or of property involved in the suit. The case is, therefore, not one where the cause pending before the court is subjected to possible hindrance or delay by service of process in some unrelated suit. The aid of the petitioner already in attendance upon the litigation was demanded in order that the relief prayed might be secured and the cause brought to a final and successful termination. Neither that demand nor compliance with it could prevent his attendance upon the principal cause, as service of process in another court might. Even if we make the assumption that the nonrecognition of such immunity might have discouraged \n\n[285 U.S. 222, 228]\n\u00a0\n petitioner's participation as counsel, still it would defeat, not aid, the administration of justice in the principal cause to encourage petitioner's voluntary presence by the grant of an immunity which would relieve him from any compulsion either to continue his presence or to answer for his acts affecting the progress of the cause. Judicial necessities require that such immunity should be withheld, and it was rightly denied by the court below.\n It is said that the service of process in this case cannot be deemed an exception to the general rule without assuming the truth of the allegations in the bill of complaint, and that the truth or falsity of the pleadings cannot be assumed. See Page v. Macdonald, supra, pages 448, 449 of 261 U. S., 43 S. Ct. 416. But the test of the privilege is not the probable success or failure of the suit or proceeding in which the process was served. If it were, the immunity could never be denied. The test is whether the immunity itself, if allowed, would so obstruct judicial administration in the very cause for the protection of which it is invoked as to justify withholding it. That, as we have said, depends here upon the nature of the proceeding in which the service is made and its relation to the principal suit, both of which are disclosed by the pleadings.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","87":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLAWRENCE v. STATE TAX COMMISSION OF STATE OF MISSISSIPPI(1932)\nNo. 580\nArgued: April 18, 1932Decided: May 16, 1932\n\n\n\n\n[286 U.S. 276, 277]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Wm. H. Watkins, of Jackson, Miss., for appellants.\n\n\n\n[286 U.S. 276, 278]\n\u00a0\n Mr. J. A. Lauderdale, of Jackson, Miss., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal under section 237 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  344), from a decree of the Supreme Court of Mississippi, 137 So. 503, upholding the Mississippi income tax law (chapter 132, Miss. Laws of 1924, as amended in 1928, chapter 124, 2 Miss. Code Ann. 1930, p. 2136), which, as applied \n\n[286 U.S. 276, 279]\n\u00a0\n to appellant, is assailed as infringing the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution. Sections 5027 and 5033 of the statute impose an annual tax on the net income of corporations and individuals. But paragraph (b) of section 5033, added by the act of 1928 (Laws Miss. 1928, Ex. Sess., c. 32), provides: 'The term gross income, does not include ... (11) Income of a domestic corporation, when earned from sources without this state. ...'\n Appellant, a citizen and resident of Mississippi, brought the present suit to set aside the assessment of a tax upon so much of his net income for 1929 as arose from the construction by him of public highways in the state of Tennessee. The taxing statute was challenged on the ground that in so far as it imposes a tax on income derived wholly from activities carried on outside the state, it deprived appellant of property without due process of law, and that in exempting corporations, which were his competitors, from a tas on income derived from like activities carried on outside the state, it denied to him the equal protection of the laws.\n The obligation of one domiciled within a state to pay taxes there, arises from the unilateral action of the state government in the exercise of the most plenary of sovereign powers, that to raise revenue to defray the expenses of government and to distribute its burdens equably among those who enjoy its benefits. Hence, domicile in itself establishes a basis for taxation. Enjoyment of the privileges of residence within the state, and the attendant right to invoke the protection of its laws, are inseparable from the responsibility for sharing the costs of government. See Fidelity & Columbia Trust Co. v. Louisville, \n245 \nU.S. 54, 58\n, 38 S. Ct. 40, L. R. A. 1918C, 124; Maguire v. Trefry, \n253 \nU.S. 12, 14\n, 17 S., 40 S. Ct. 417; Kirtland v. Hotchkiss, \n100 U.S. 491\n, 498; Shaffer v. Carter, \n252 \nU.S. 37, 50\n, 40 S. Ct. 221. The Federal Constitution imposes on the states no particular modes of taxation, and apart from the specific grant to the federal government of the exclusive \n\n[286 U.S. 276, 280]\n\u00a0\n power to levy certain limited classes of taxes and to regulate interstate and foreign commerce, it leaves the states unrestricted in their power to tax those domiciled within them, so long as the tax imposed is upon property within the state or on privileges enjoyed there, and is not so palpably arbitrary or unreasonable as to infringe the Fourteenth Amendment. Kirtland v. Hotchkiss, supra.\n Taxation at the place of domicile of tangibles located elsewhere has been thought to be beyond the jurisdiction of the state, Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky, \n199 \nU.S. 194\n, 26 S. Ct. 36, 4 Ann. Cas. 493; Frick v. Pennsylvania, \n268 U.S. 473\n, 488-489, 45 S. Ct. 603, 42 A. L. R. 316; but considerations applicable to ownership of physical objects located outside the taxing jurisdiction, which have led to that conclusion, are obviously inapplicable to the taxation of intangibles at the place of domicile or of privileges which may be enjoyed there. See State Tax on Foreignheld bonds, 15 Wall. 300, 319; Frick v. Pennsylvania, supra, page 494 of 268 U. S., 45 S. Ct. 603. And the taxation of both by the state of the domicile has been uniformly upheld. Kirtland v. Hotchkiss, supra; Fidelity & Columbia Trust Co. v. Louisville, supra; Blodgett v. Silberman, \n277 \nU.S. 1\n, 48 S. Ct. 410; Maguire v. Trefry, supra; compare Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. v. Minnesota, \n280 \nU.S. 204\n, 50 S. Ct. 98, 65 A. L. R. 1000; First National Bank of Boston v. Maine, \n284 \nU.S. 312\n, 52 S. Ct. 174.\n The present tax has been defined by the Supreme Court of Mississippi as an excise and not a property tax, Hattiesburg Grocery Co. v. Robertson, 126 Miss. 34, 88 So. 4, 25 A. L. R. 748; Knox v. Gulf, M. & N. R. Co., 138 Miss. 70, 104 So. 689; but in passing on its constitutionality we are concerned only with its practical operation, not its definition or the precise form of descriptive words which may be applied to it. See Educational Films Corp. v. Ward, \n282 \nU.S. 379, 387\n, 51 S. Ct. 170; Pacific Co., Ltd., v. Johnson, \n285 \nU.S. 480\n, 52 S. Ct. 424, 76 L. Ed. -, decided April 11, 1932; Shaffer v. Carter, supra, pages 54, 55 of 252 U. S., 40 S. Ct. 221.\n It is enough, so far as the constitutional power of the state to levy it is concerned, that the tax is imposed \n\n[286 U.S. 276, 281]\n\u00a0\n by Mississippi on its own citizens with reference to the receipt and enjoyment of income derived from the conduct of business, regardless of the place where it is carried on. The tax, which is apportioned to the ability of the taxpayer to bear it, is founded upon the protection afforded to the recipient of the income by the state, in his person, in his right to receive the income, and in his enjoyment of it when received. These are rights and privileges incident to his domicile in the state and to them the economic interest realized by the receipt of income or represented by the power to control it, bears a direct legal relationship. It would be anomalous to say that although Mississippi may tax the obligation to pay appellant for his services rendered in Tennessee, see Fidelity & Columbia Trust Co. v. Louisville, supra,; Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. v. Minnesota, supra, still, it could not tax the receipt of income upon payment of that same obligation. We can find no basis for holding that taxation of the income at the domicile of the recipient is either within the purview of the rule now established that tangibles located outside the state of the owner are not subject to taxation within it, or is in any respect so arbitrary or unreasonable as to place it outside the constitutional power of taxation reserved to the state. Maguire v. Trefry, supra; see Fidelity & Columbia Trust Co. v. Louisville, supra.\n The Supreme Court of Mississippi found it unnecessary to pass upon the validity of so much of the statute, added by the amendment of 1928, as exempted domestic corporations from the tax on income derived from activities outside the state. It said that if the amendment were valid, appellant could not complain; if invalid, he would still be subject to the tax, since the act which it amended, section 11, c. 132, Laws of 1924, would then remain in full force, and under it individuals and domestic corporations are taxed alike. Knox v. Gulf, M. & N. R. Co., supra. \n\n[286 U.S. 276, 282]\n\u00a0\n But the Constitution, which guarantees rights and immunities to the citizen, likewise insures to him the privilege of having those rights and immunities judicially declared and protected when such judicial action is properly invoked. Even though the claimed constitutional protection be denied on nonfederal grounds, it is the province of this Court to inquire whether the decision of the state court rests upon a fair or substantial basis. If unsubstantial, constitutional obligations may not be thus avoided. See Ward v. Love County, \n253 \nU.S. 17, 22\n, 40 S. Ct. 419; Enterprise Irrigation District v. Canal Company, \n243 \nU.S. 157, 164\n, 37 S. Ct. 318; Fox River Paper Co. v. Railroad Commission, \n274 \nU.S. 651, 655\n, 47 S. Ct. 669. Upon one of the alternative assumptions made by the court, that the amendment is discriminatory, appellant's constitutional rights were infringed when the tax was levied upon him, and state officers acting under the amendment refrained from assessing the like tax upon his corporate competitors. See Iowa-Des Moines National Bank v. Bennett, \n284 \nU.S. 239, 246\n, 52 S. Ct. 133. If the Constitution exacts a uniform application of this tax on appellant and his competitors, his constitutional rights are denied as well by the refusal of the state court to decide the question, as by an erroneous decision of it, see Greene v. Louisville & Interurban R. R. Co., \n244 \nU.S. 499, 508\n, 512 S. et seq., 37 S. Ct. 673, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 88; Smith v. Cahoon, \n283 \nU.S. 553, 564\n, 51 S. Ct. 582, for in either case the inequality complained of is left undisturbed by the state court whose jurisdiction to remove it was rightly invoked. The burden does not rest on him to test again the validity of the amendment by some procedure to compel his competitors to pay the tax under the earlier statute. Iowa-Des Moines National Bank v. Bennett, supra, page 247 of 284 U. S., 52 S. Ct. 133. See Cumberland Coal Co. v. Board of Revision, \n284 \nU.S. 23\n, 52 S. Ct. 48. We therefore conclude that the purported nonfederal ground put forward by the state court for its refusal to decide the constitutional question was unsubstantial and \n\n[286 U.S. 276, 283]\n\u00a0\n illusory, and that the appellant may invoke the jurisdiction of this Court to decide the question.\n The statute relieves domestic corporations from the tax only in so far as their income is derived from activities carried on outside the state. The appellant is thus compelled to pay a tax from which his competitors, if domestic corporations, are relieved, and this, it is urged, is so plainly arbitrary as to infringe the equal protection clause.\n But, as there is no constitutional requirement that a system of taxation should be uniform as applied to individuals and corporations, regardless of the circumstances in which it operates, acceptance of this contention would relieve the appellant from the burden which rests on him to overcome the presumption of facts supporting constitutionality, which attaches to all legislative acts, and would require as to assume that there is no state of facts reasonably to be conceived which could afford a rational basis for distinguishing, for taxation purposes, between income of individuals and that of domestic corporations, derived from business carried on without the state. Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., \n220 U.S. 61\n, 78-79, 31 S. Ct. 337, Ann. Cas. 1912C, 160; Rast v. Van Deman & Lewis Co., \n240 \nU.S. 342, 357\n, 36 S. Ct. 370, L. R. A. 1917A, 421, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 455; O'Gorman & Young, Inc., v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., \n282 U.S. 251\n, 257-258, 51 S. Ct. 130.\n What the local conditions are in Mississippi and its neighboring states with respect to businesses like the present, carried on across state lines by individuals and corporations, does not appear. How the statutory provisions now in question are related to others by which a permissible divergence in state policy with respect to the taxation of corporations and of individuals may be effected, is not shown. See General American Tank Car Corp. v. Day, \n270 \nU.S. 367, 373\n, 46 S. Ct. 234; Interstate Busses Corporation v. Blodgett, \n276 \nU.S. 245, 251\n, 48 S. Ct. 230; Farmers' & Mechanics' Savings Bank v. Minnesota, \n232 U.S. 516\n, 529 et seq., 34 S. Ct. 354. We cannot say that investigation in these fields would not dis- \n\n[286 U.S. 276, 284]\n\u00a0\n close a basis for the legislation which would lead reasonable men to conclude that there is just ground for the difference here made. The existence, unchallenged, of differences between the taxation of incomes of individuals and of corporations in every federal revenue act since the adoption of the Sixteenth Amendment, demonstrates that there may be.\n Apart from other considerations which may have led to the present legislation as an integral part of the state system of taxation of the income of corporations, one which affords a rational basis for the distinction made, is the fact that the state has adopted generally a policy of avoiding double taxation of the same economic interest in corporate income, by taxing either the income of the corporation or the dividends of its stockholders, but not both. See sections 5033(a), 5033(b)( 11), 5033(b)(8). In the case of corporate income and dividends attributable to business done outside the state and received by stockholders of domestic corporations, the stockholders are taxed, and not the corporation. That was held in Franklin v. Carter (C. C. A.) 51 F. (2d) 345, to be a sufficient ground for upholding a statute of Oklahoma, assailed as denying the equal protection of the laws, which had substantially the same features as the present statute. See, also, Conner v. States, 82 N. H. 126, 132, 130 A. 357. The question presented thus differs from any raised in Quaker City Cab Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n277 \nU.S. 389\n, 48 S. Ct. 553, and Royster Guano Co. v. Virginia, \n253 \nU.S. 412\n, 40 S. Ct. 560. Compare White River Lumber Co. v. Arkansas, \n279 \nU.S. 692\n, 49 S. Ct. 457.\n The equal protection clause does not require the state to maintain a rigid rule of equal taxation, to resort to close distinctions, or to maintain a precise scientific uniformity; and possible differences in tax burdens not shown to be substantial or which are based on discriminations not shown to be arbitrary or capricious, do not fall within constitutional prohibitions.

Petitioner, as executor of the \n\n[285 U.S. 165, 166]\n\u00a0\n estate, paid the taxes imposed by the state in respect to the property which passed from the decedent. He also paid to respondent the federal estate taxes prescribed by the Revenue Act 1916, 39 Stat. 756, 778, which the Commissiner reckoned without deducting from the gross estate the taxes exacted by the state. The Circuit Court of Appeals denied his right to recover the alleged overpayment-the difference between the sum demanded and what would have been due if the claimed deduction had been allowed. 50 F.(2d) 787. The District Court had held otherwise. 42 F.(2d) 918.\n Here the insistence is that to ascertain the net estate under section 203, Revenue Act September 8, 1916, it was necessary to deduct from the gross estate the tax paid to Massachusetts as required by chapter 65 of her General Laws. Also, that in the circumstances the Circuit Court of Appeals should not have decided this question of law.\n The record shows that the court below properly considered and ruled upon the point of law. The District Court-where the cause was tried without a jury-had said of the state tax, 'There can be no question that it was legally deductible.' The amended declaration alleges that the Commissioner wrongfully refused to allow the deduction. The answer contains a general denial. The agreed statement of facts points out 'that in arriving at the value of the net estate upon which the said total tax was computed the Commissioner did not make any deduction or allowance for the amount required to pay the Massachusetts inheritance tax, which the estate was required to pay and did pay to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.' And the defendant asked the court to find as matter of law, 'Plaintiff is not entitled to recover anything of the defendant and his declaration must be dismissed with judgment for the defendant for his costs.' The trial court misconstrued the federal statute. \n\n[285 U.S. 165, 167]\n\u00a0\n With his petition for appeal from its judgment, the defendant presented, among others, the following assignment of error: The District Court erred in holding: 'It is obvious that the United States had demanded and received a tax levied upon the estate of the plaintiff's testator in excess of the amount lawfully due. It is not the correct tax measured by the net estate in view of decisions of the court.'\n The Revenue Act of 1916 (amended as to rates March 3, 1917, 39 Stat. 1000, 1002, and October 3, 1917, 40 Stat. 300, 324) imposed a graduated tax upon the transfer of the net estate, ascertained as directed by section 203, of every person dying thereafter.\n'Sec. 203. That for the purpose of the tax the value of the net estate shall be determined-\n\n'(a) In the case of a resident, by deducting from the value of the gross estate-\n\n'(1) Such amounts for funeral expenses, administration expenses, claims against the estate, unpaid mortgages, losses incurred during the settlement of the estate arising from fires, storms, shipwreck, or other casualty, and from theft, when such losses are not compensated for by insurance or otherwise, support during the settlement of the estate of those dependent upon the decedent, and such other charges against the estate, as are allowed by the laws of the jurisdiction, whether within or without the United States, under which the estate is being administered. ...'\n\n The General Laws of Massachusetts (1921) volume 1, chap. 65, provide:\n'Section 1. All property within the jurisdiction of the commonwealth, corporeal or incorporeal, and any interest therein, whether belonging to inhabitants of the commonwealth or not, which shall pass by will, or by laws regulating intestate succession ... shall be subject to a \n\n[285 U.S. 165, 168]\n\u00a0\n tax at the precentage rates fixed by the following table: ...\n\n'Section 6. Administrators, executors and trustees, grantees or donees under conveyances or gifts made during the life of the grantor or donor, and persons to whom beneficial interests shall accrue by survivorship, shall be liable for the taxes imposed by this chapter, with interest, until the same have been paid.\n\n'Section 7. Taxes imposed by this chapter upon property or interests therein, passing by will or by laws regulating intestate succession, shall be payable to the state treasurer by the executors, administrators or trustees at the expiration of one year from the date of the giving of bond by the executors, administrators or trustees first appointed. ...\n\n'Section 9. Property of which a decedent dies seized or possessed, subject to taxes as aforesaid, in whatever form of investment it may happen to be, and all property acquired in substitution therefor, shall be charged with a lien for all taxes and interest thereon which are or may become due on such property. ...\n\n'Section 17. An executor, administrator or trustee holding property subject to the taximposed by this chapter shall deduct the tax therefrom or collect it from the legatee or person entitled to said property; and he shall not deliver property or a specific legacy subject to said tax until he has collected the tax thereon. An executor or administrator shall collect taxes due upon land passing by inheritance or will which is subject to said tax from the heirs or devisees entitled thereto, and he may be authorized to sell said land, in the manner prescribed by section twenty-one, if they refuse or neglect to pay said tax.'\n\n Manifestly, the state taxes paid by the executor were not permissible deductions, unless they were such 'charges against the estate, as are allowed by the laws of the juris \n\n[285 U.S. 165, 169]\n\u00a0\n diction, ... under which the estate is being administered.' Charges against an estate are only such as affect it as a whole. They do not include taxes on the rights of individual beneficiaries. New York Trust Co. v. Eisner, \n256 \nU.S. 345, 350\n, 41 S. Ct. 506, 16 A. L. R. 660.\n The Massachusetts statute by plain words places the real burden of the tax upon the legatee or other person who receives a decedent's property. Payments required of an executor are only preliminary; ultimately they must be met by the beneficiaries.\n Decisions of the Massachusetts Supreme Court show with adequate certainty that the right of succession is the real object of the charge laid because of property which passes by will or under the laws relative to intestacy. The thing burdened is the right to receive. Attorney General v. Stone, 209 Mass. 186, 190, 95 N. E. 395; Magee v. Commissioner, 256 Mass. 512, 153 N. E. 1; Boston Safe Deposit & Trust Co. v. Commissioner, 267 Mass. 240, 166 N. E. 729; Coolidge v. Commissioner, 268 Mass. 443, 447, 167 N. E. 757. See Saltonstall v. Saltonstall, \n276 \nU.S. 260\n, 48 S. Ct. 225.\n It is unnecessary for us to consider whether the petitioner filed a proper claim for refund within the period prescribed by the statute.\n The challenged judgment is affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","89":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLEMAN v. KRENTLER-ARNOLD HINGE LAST CO.(1932)\nNo. 332\nArgued: Decided: February 15, 1932\n\n\n\n\n[284 U.S. 448, 449]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Ellis Spear, Jr., of Boston, Mass., for petitioners.\n Mr. Robert Cushman, of Boston, Mass., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a contempt proceeding against the respondent, Krentler-Arnold Hinge Last Company, for violation of a permanent injunction granted in an infringement suit.\n In that suit, which was brought by the respondent, a Michigan corporation, in the Federal District Court for \n\n[284 U.S. 448, 450]\n\u00a0\n the District of Massachusetts, the bill of complaint for the infringement of the respondent's patents was dismissed and the counterclaim of the present petitioners for the infringement of their patent (Peterson patent, No. 1,195,266, for hinged lasts for shoes) was sustained. 300 F. 834. The decree, as modified, was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 13 F.( 2d) 796. The decree perpetually enjoined the respondent from making, using or selling lasts containing the invention covered by designated claims of the petitioners' patent and 'any substantial or material part thereof, or any substantial equivalent or colorable imitation thereof.' Final decree, after accounting, was entered on March 1, 1928. 24 F. (2d) 423. Thereafter the respondent placed upon the market a 'sliding link' hinge which was claimed to be a new invention. The petitioners then (June 4, 1929) brought the present proceeding for contempt in the court which had entered the decree.\n The order to show cause, with the supporting affidavits, was served upon the respondent by the delivery of copies to its attorney of record in the infringement suit and by the mailing of copies to the respondent at its office in Michigan. On June 10, 1929, the attorney of record for the respondent in the infringement suit filed with the clerk of the court a withdrawal of appearance. The respondent then appeared specially in the contempt proceeding and moved to dismiss the petition 'for lack of jurisdiction over the respondent.' In support of the motion, affidavits were presented to the effect that the authority of the attorney of record in the infringement suit was terminated on the entry of the final decree, and that the respondent had no office or place of business in Massachusetts and had not manufactured, sold, or used within that state the device of which the petitioners complained. The motion was denied. Upon hearing, the District Court held the respondent to be guilty of 'civil contempt' \n\n[284 U.S. 448, 451]\n\u00a0\n for deliberate violation of the injunction and ordered a reference to a master to take an account of the profits made by the respondent through such violation and to ascertain the petitioners' costs and expenses in the contempt proceeding. On the master's report, the District Court entered a decree for the recovery by the petitioners of $39,576.26 as profits, together with counsel fees, expenses, and interest, making a total of $49, 292.89. On appeal, the Circuit Court of Appeals deemed it to be clear that the respondent's new device answered in every respect the claims of the petitioners' patent and that 'the question of infringement is not doubtful or even merely colorable, but certain.' The Circuit Court of Appeals sustained the jurisdiction of the District Court but held that profits could not be recovered. Certain expenses were also disallowed, and the decree of the District Court, with respect to the amount of the recovery, was vacated. 50 F. (2d) 699, on rehearing 50 F.(2d) 707. This Court granted a writ of certiorari. \n284 \nU.S. 605\n, 52 S. Ct. 33, 76 L. Ed. -.\n First. The question of jurisdiction turns upon the nature and effect of the decree in the infringement suit and the relation to that suit of the contempt proceeding. When the respondent brought the suit in the Federal District Court for the District of Massachusetts, it submitted itself to the jurisdiction of the court with respect to all the issues embraced in the suit, including those pertaining to the counterclaim of the defendants, petitioners here. Equity Rule 30 (28 USCA  723). See Langdell's Eq. Pleading, ch. 5,  119; Frank L. Young Co. v. McNeal- Edwards Co., \n283 \nU.S. 398, 400\n, 51 S. C.t. 538. The decree upon the counterclaim bound the respondent personally. It was a decree which operated continuously and perpetually upon the respondent in relation to the prohibited conduct. The decree was binding upon the respondent, not simply within the District of Massachusetts, but throughout the United States. Macaulay v. White Sewing Machine Company (C. C.) 9 F. 698; Kessler v. \n\n[284 U.S. 448, 452]\n\u00a0\n Eldred, \n206 \nU.S. 285, 288\n, 27 S. Ct. 611; Rubber Tire Company v. Goodyear Company, \n232 \nU.S. 413, 417\n, 34 S. Ct. 403; Hart Steel Company v. Railroad Supply Company, \n244 \nU.S. 294, 298\n, 299 S., 37 S. Ct. 506; Louisville & Nashville Railroad Company v. Western Union Telegraph Company, \n250 \nU.S. 363, 368\n, 39 S. Ct. 513; Toledo Company v. Computing Company, \n261 \nU.S. 399, 426\n, 43 S. Ct. 458. The respondent could not escape the decree by removing from, or staying without, the District of Massachusetts. Wherever it might conduct its affairs, it would carry with it the prohibition. Disobedience constituted contempt of the court which rendered the decree, and was none the less contempt because the act was committed outside the district, as the contempt lay in the fact, not in the place, of the disobedience to the requirement.\n In view of the nature and effect of the decree in the infringement suit, it cannot be said that the suit was terminated in the sense that the court had no further relation to the party subject to its permanent injunction. The terms of the injunction continued the relation. The question is not one of an attempted rehearing of the merits of the controversy which was determined by the final decree, or of the modification of that decree, after the expiration of the term in which an application for that purpose could properly be made. Equity Rule 69 (28 USCA  723); Roemer v. Simon, \n91 U.S. 149\n; Brooks v. Railroad Company, \n101 U.S. 443\n, rehearing denied \n102 U.S. 107\n, 26, L. Ed. 91; Bronson v. Schulten, \n104 U.S. 410\n, 415. This proceeding was for the enforcement of the decree, and not to review or alter it. It was heard and determined as a proceeding for civil, not criminal, contempt. 50 F.(2d) at page 701. The question of the relation of such a proceeding to the main suit was fully considered in the case of Gompers v. Buck Stove & Range Company, \n221 \nU.S. 418\n, 31 S. Ct. 492, 34 L. R. A. (N. S.) 874, and it was determined that the proceeding was not to be regarded as an independent one, but as a part of the original cause. The court said: 'Proceedings for civil contempt are between the original parties, and are instituted and tried as a part of the main cause.' Id., at \n\n[284 U.S. 448, 453]\n\u00a0\n pages 444, 445 of 221 U. S., 31 S. Ct. 492, 499. The distinction was made in this respect between such proceedings and those at law for criminal contempt which 'are between the public and the defendant, and are not a part of the original cause.' In the Gompers Case, the contempt proceeding had been instituted after the entry of the final decree awarding the permanent injunction and pending an appeal from that decree. Id., pages 421, 422 of 221 U. S., 31 S. Ct. 492. This Court held that the proceeding had been improperly treated as one for criminal contempt, and, as there had been a complete settlement of all matters involved in the equity suit, the contempt proceeding was necessarily ended. The conclusion of the Court was thus stated (Id., pages 451, 452 of 221 U. S., 31 S. Ct., 492, 502): 'When the main case was settled, every proceeding which was dependent on it, or a part of it, was also necessarily settled,-of course, without prejudice to the power and right of the court to punish for contempt by proper proceedings, punish for contempt by proper proceedings. 30 L. Ed. 853. If this had been a separate and independent proceeding at law for criminal contempt, to vindicate the authority of the court, with the public on one side and the defendants on the other, it could not, in any way, have been affected by any settlement which the parties to the equity cause made in their private litigation. But, as we have shown, this was a proceeding in equity for civil contempt, where the only remedial relief possible was a fine, payable to the complainant. The company prayed 'for such relief as the nature of its case may require,' and when the main cause was terminated by a settlement of all differences between the parties, the complainant did not require, and was not entitled to any compensation or relief of any other character. The present proceeding necessarily ended with the settlement of the main cause of which it is a part.' See Michaelson v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 42, 64\n, 65 S., 45 S. Ct. 18, 35 A. L. R. 451; Oriel v. Russell, \n278 \nU.S. 358, 363\n, 49 S. Ct. 173. \n\n[284 U.S. 448, 454]\n\u00a0\n As the proceeding for civil contempt for violation of the injunction should be treated as a part of the main cause, it follows that service of process for the purpose of bringing the respondent within the jurisdiction of the District Court of Massachusetts was not necessary. The respondent was already subject to the jurisdiction of the court for the purposes of all proceedings that were part of the equity suit and could not escape it, so as successfully to defy the injunction, by absenting itself from the district. In Milwaukee & Minnesota R. Co. v. St. Paul Company, 2 Wall. 609, 633, this court said that it had decided 'many times' that when a bill is filed in the federal court to enjoin a judgment of that court, it was 'not to be considered as an original bill, but as a continuation of the proceeding at law; so much so, that the court will proceed in the injunction suit without actual service of subpoena on the defendant, and though he be a citizen of another State, if he were a party to the judgment at law.' See Dunn v. Clarke, 8 Pet. 1, 3; Krippendorf v. Hyde, \n110 \nU.S. 276, 285\n, 4 S. Ct. 27; Carey v. Houston & Texas Railway Co., \n161 \nU.S. 115, 128\n, 16 S. Ct. 537; Merriam v. Saalfield, \n241 \nU.S. 22, 30\n, 31 S., 36 S. Ct. 447. For similar reasons, after a final decree a party cannot defeat the jurisdiction of the appellate tribunal by removing from the jurisdiction, as the proceedings on appeal are part of the cause. Nations v. Johnson, 24 How. 195, 203, 204. As this Court said in Michigan Trust Company v. Ferry, \n228 \nU.S. 346, 353\n, 33 S. Ct. 550, 552, where there is 'service at the beginning of a cause, or if the party submits to the jurisdiction in whatever form may be required, we dispense with the necessity of maintaining the physical power, and attribute the same force to the judgment or decree whether the party remain within the jurisdiction or not. This is one of the decencies of civilization that no one would dispute.' And so, with respect to the application of Article 4, section 1, of the Constitution, 'if a judicial proceeding is begun with jurisdiction over the person of the party concerned, it is \n\n[284 U.S. 448, 455]\n\u00a0\n within the power of a state to bind him by every subsequent order in the cause.' Id. \n228 \nU.S. 353\n, 33 S. Ct. 550, 552.\n In this view, nothing more was required in the present case than appropriate notice of the contempt proceeding, and that notice the respondent received. We do not need to consider the effect of the service of the order to show cause with supporting affidavits upon the attorney who still appeared of record as the attorney for the respondent in the equity suit, but whose authority was alleged to have been terminated, or any question of the sufficiency of constructive notice, as the respondent had actual notice. While the respondent appeared specially for the purpose of objecting to the jurisdiction of the court, this objection was not upon the ground that the respondent did not have notice, which manifestly it did have, but that it had not been brought into the proceeding by service of process in that proceeding, which in view of its relation to the cause was unnecessary. Its objection on that ground being overruled, the respondent contested its liability.\n We are of the opinion that the District Court had jurisdiction of the contempt proceeding and of the respondent.\n Second. The Circuit Court of Appeals refused recovery of profits upon the ground that in a proceeding for civil contempt the relief should be based upon the 'pecuniary injury or damage' which the act of disobedience caused the complaining party, including such reasonable expenses as were incurred in the bringing of the proceeding. There is no question here that the respondent had made profits through the infringing sales in violation of the injunction, and the amount of the profits was ascertained, but the appellate court held that the petitioners were limited to the damages caused by such sales and that no damages had been shown. We think that the court erred in imposing this limitation. The fact that a proceeding for civil contempt is for the purpose of compensating \n\n[284 U.S. 448, 456]\n\u00a0\n the injured party, and not, as in criminal contempt, to redress the public wrong, does not require so narrow a view of what should be embraced in an adequate remedial award.\n While the distinction is clear between damages, in the sense of actual pecuniary loss, and profits, the latter may none the less be included in the concept of compensatory relief. In a suit in equity against an infringer, profits are recoverable not by way of punishment but to insure full compensation to the party injured. As this Court said in Mowry v. Whitney, 14 Wall. 620, 653: 'The profits which are recoverable against an infringer of a patent are in fact a compensation for the injury the patentee has sustained from the invasion of his right.' The court of equity in such cases applies familiar principle in 'converting the infringer into a trustee for the patentee as regards the profits thus made.' Washington, A. & G. Steam Packet Company v. Sickles, 19 Wall. 611, 617. This is not to say that there is an actual fiduciary relation which would give the right to an accounting for profits regardless of the existence of a basic claim to equitable relief. Root v. Railway Company, \n105 \nU.S. 189, 214\n, 215 S.. Referring to the case last cited, this Court succinctly stated the controlling principle in its opinion in Tilghman v. Proctor, \n125 \nU.S. 136, 148\n, 8 S. Ct. 894, 900, as follows: 'But, as has been recently declared by this court, upon an elaborate review of the cases in this country and in England, it is more strictly accurate to say that a court of equity, which has acquired, upon some equitable ground, jurisdiction of a suit for the infringement of a patent, will not send the plaintiff to a court of law to recover damages, but will itself administer full relief, by awarding, as an equivalent or a substitute for legal damages, a compensation computed and measured by the same rule that courts of equity apply to the case of a trustee who has wrongfully used the trust property for his own advantage.' Profits are thus allowed 'as an equitable measure of com- \n\n[284 U.S. 448, 457]\n\u00a0\n pensation.' Hamilton-Brown Shoe Company v. Wolf Brothers & Co., \n240 \nU.S. 251, 259\n, 36 S. Ct. 269, 272. See, also, Dowagiac Manufacturing Company v. Minnesota Plow Company, \n235 \nU.S. 641, 647\n, 35 S. Ct. 221. In view of the principles governing the broader relief obtainable in equity, as contrasted with those applicable in courts of law, it is apparent that there is no necessary exclusion of profits from the idea of compensation in a remedial proceeding.\n The respondent insists that this contempt proceeding is not a suit in equity, but, as we have seen, the proceeding is a part of the main cause in equity and is for the enforcement of the decree, and there is no reason why in such a proceeding equitable principles should not control the measure of relief to be accorded to the injured party. It is also urged that an award of profits involves a discovery and accounting from a party charged with a penal liability. This argument is also based on a misconception of the nature of the proceeding which is not penal, but remedial, and the remedy should be complete. Accordingly it has been repeatedly assumed that, in a proceeding for civil contempt for disobedience to an injunction granted in an infringement suit, the profits derived from the violation of the injunction are recoverable. Worden v. Searls, \n121 \nU.S. 14, 25\n, 7 S. Ct. 814; Matter of Christensen Engineering Company, \n194 \nU.S. 458, 460\n, 24 S. Ct. 729; Gordon v. Turco-Halvah Company (C. C. A.) 247 F. 487, 490, 492; McKee Glass Company v. H. C. Fry Glass Company (C. C. A.) 248 F. 125, 127.\n We are of the opinion that the District Court properly allowed the profits in question, and, in this respect, the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals modifying the decree of the District Court is reversed and that of the District Court affirmed.\n It is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS is of the opinion that the proceedings should have been dismissed for lack of jurisdiction over the respondent. \n\n\n\n","90":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLEWIS v.

Young-quist, Asst. Atty. Gen., for respondent. \n\n[284 U.S. 281, 282]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioners sued the respondent Collector in the United States District Court for Wyoming, September 20, 1929, to recover $7,297.16 alleged to have been wrongfully exacted as income tax upon the estate of Cooper.\n February 18, 1921, the administrator filed a return for the period January 1 to December 12, 1920, the day of final settlement. Among others, he reported deductions for attorney's fees, $20,750, and inheritance taxes paid to the State, $16,870. The amount of tax as indicated by the return was paid.\n November 24, 1925, the Commissioner, having audited the return, disallowed all deductions except the one for attorney's fees and assessed a deficiency of $7,297.16. This sum was paid March 21, 1926; and on July 27, 1926, petitioners asked that it be refunded.\n A letter from the Commissioner to petitioners, dated May 18, 1929, and introduced in evidence by them, stated that the deduction of $20,750 for attorney's fees had been improperly allowed. He also set out a revised computation wherein he deducted the state inheritance taxes. This showed liability greater than the total sums theretofore exacted. The Commissioner further said: 'Since the correct computation results in an additional tax as indicated above which is barred from assessment by the statute of limitations your claim will be rejected on the next schedule to be approved by the commissioner.'\n The trial court upheld the Commissioner's action and its judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n Counsel for petitioners relies upon the five-year statute of limitations (Revenue Act 1926,  277 (26 USCA  1057)).1 He maintains \n\n[284 U.S. 281, 283]\n\u00a0\n that the Commissioner lacked authority to redetermine and reassess the tax after the statute had run.\n After referring to section 284, Revenue Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 66 (26 USCA  1065) and section 322, Revenue Act of 1928, 45 Stat. 861 (26 USCA  2322), the Circuit Court of Appeals said: 'The above quoted provisions clearly limit refunds to overpayments. It follows that the ultimate question presented for decision, upon a claim for refund, is whether the taxpayer has overpaid his tax. This involves a redetermination of the entire tax liability. While no new assessment can be made, after the bar of the statute has fallen, the taxpayer, nevertheless, is not entitled to a refund unless he has overpaid his tax. The action to recover on a claim for refund is in the nature of an action for money had and received and it is incumbent upon the claimant to show that the United States has money which belongs to him.'\n We agree with the conclusion reached by the courts below.\n While the statutes authorizing refunds do not specifically empower the Commissioner to reaudit a return whenever repayment is claimed, authority therefor is necessarily implied. An overpayment must appear before refund is authorized. Although the statute of limitations may have barred the assessment and collection of any additional sum, it does not obliterate the right of the United States to retain payments already received when they do not exceed the amount which might have been properly assessed and demanded. \n\n[284 U.S. 281, 284]\n\u00a0\n Bonwit Teller & Co. v.

Tibbetts, of New York City, for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Charles B. Rugg, Asst. Atty. Gen., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner, a steamship transportation company, brought suit in the District Court for Southern New York to recover from the collector of customs certain fines \n\n[287 U.S. 329, 331]\n\u00a0\n alleged to have been illegally exacted by the Secretary of Labor under section 9 of the Immigration Act of 1917, c. 29, 39 Stat. 874, 880, or its amendment by section 26 of the Immigration Act of 1924, c. 190, 43 Stat. 153, 166, 8 U.S.C.  145 (8 USCA  145). The complaint stated fifteen causes of action, one for each fine involved. The trial court directed a verdict for the petitioner on three causes of action, the ninth, eleventh, and fifteenth, and for the respondent on all the others, and gave judgment accordingly. 45 F.(2d) 405. See, also (D.C.) 46 F.(2d) 315. Upon appeal by both parties the judgment of the District Court was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, 55 F.(2d) 1048, except as to the fifteenth cause of action, with respect to which it was reversed. As certiorari was granted, \n286 \nU.S. 539\n, 52 S.Ct. 641, on petition of the steamship company alone, only so much of the judgment below as decided in favor of the collector is brought before us for review. Federal Trade Commission v. Pacific Paper Ass'n, \n273 \nU.S. 52, 66\n, 47 S.Ct. 255; The Malcolm Baxter, Jr., \n277 \nU.S. 323\n, 48 S.Ct. 516.\n Section 9 of the Immigration Act, as amended, provides that:\n'It shall be unlawful for any person, including any transportation company, ... to bring to the United States ... from a foreign country ... any alien afflicted with idiocy, insanity, imbecility, feeblemindedness, epilepsy, constitutional psychopathic inferiority, chronic alcoholism, tuberculosis in any form, or a loathsome or dangerous contagious disease, and if it shall appear to the satisfaction of the Secretary of Labor that any alien so brought to the United States was afflicted with any of the said disease or disabilities at the time of foreign embarkation, and that the existence of such disease or disability might have been detected by means of a competent medical examination at such time, such person or transportation company ... shall pay to the collector of customs of the customs district in which the port of arrival is located the sum of \n\n[287 U.S. 329, 332]\n\u00a0\n $1,000, and in addition a sum equal to that paid by such alien for his transportation ... for each and every violation of the provisions of this section, such latter sum to be delivered by the collector of customs to the alien on whose account assessed. ...'\n\n The same section also makes it unlawful 'to bring to any port of the United States any alien afflicted with any mental defect other than those above specifically named, or physical defect of a nature which may affect his ability to earn a living, as contemplated in section 136(3) of this title, and if it shall appear to the satisfaction of the Secretary of Labor that any alien so brought to the United States was so afflicted at the time of foreign embarkation, and that the existence of such mental or physical defect might have been detected by means of a competent medical examination at such time, such person shall pay to the collector of customs of the customs district in which the port of arrival is located, the sum of $250, and, in addition a sum equal to that paid by such alien for his transportation. ...'\n Between the years 1923 and 1927 the petitioner brought to the United States in its vessels the thirteen aliens with respect to whose transportation the fines now in question were imposed. All were found, upon arrival, to be inadmissible because they were afflicted either with one of the diseases specified in section 9, or with a physical defect which might affect the alien's ability to earn a living. In each case in the proceedings before the Board of Special Inquiry to pass on the admissibility of the alien, the examining physicians of the Health Department certified to his diseased condition or disability on arrival, adding: 'In our opinion the condition herein certified might have been detected by competent medical examination at the port of embarkation.' In each instance the petitioner was notified of the certificate of the medical examiners, advised that such findings indicated its liability to fine \n\n[287 U.S. 329, 333]\n\u00a0\n under section 9 of the Act of 1917 or its amendment of 1924, and given thirty or sixty days in which to have a hearing. In each case the petitioner responded to the notice by depositing the amount of the possible fine, in order to secure clearance of the vessel,1 and transmitting an unverified letter of protest against the imposition of the fine, stating generally that it was the regular practice of the petitioner to have each immigrant carefully examined by competent doctors before embarkation, and that, therefore, the disease or disability either did not exist at the time of embarkation or could not then have been discovered by means of competent medical examination, or was of such a nature as could not affect the alien's ability to earn a living. In one case, that of Fusco, stated in the tenth cause of action, the letter of protest was accompanied by affidavits, tending to confirm the statements contained in the protests. In all thirteen cases fines were imposed by the Secretary and the funds deposited by petitioner were retained by the government.\n The 'files' or 'records' upon which the Secretary of Labor based his decisions that the fines should be imposed consisted in general of the transcript of the hearing and examination before the Board of Special Inquiry at Ellis Island, in which the admissibility of the alien was passed upon, which included a reference to the medical certificate, the petitioner's letter of protest and any accompanying documents, and various communications of an interdepartmental character relating to the disposition of the alien by the Secretary.\n At the trial in the District Court, the petitioner introduced evidence which had not been presented to the Department of Labor tending to show that a competent med- \n\n[287 U.S. 329, 334]\n\u00a0\n ical examination had been made of the aliens at the port of embarkation, and that the diseases or disabilities, on the basis of which the fines had been imposed, had not in fact been discovered, and were not discoverable at that time by such an examination. Although the trial judge thought that this evidence tended to show in detail the thoroughness of the examinations and the competence of the physicians, he struck out this class of testimony, and held, on the basis of the record made before the Secretary, that there was evidence supporting his action.\n The petitioner contends here, as it did before the courts below, that the evidence offered at the trial was erroneously excluded; that, if section 9 is construed to preclude a judicial trial of the issues before the Secretary, it denies to petitioner due process of law, and, finally, that in any case the fines were not validly imposed because the Secretary of Labor abused the discretion reposed in him by the statute.\n The first two objections are untenable. By the words of the statute, the Secretary's is the only voice authorized to express the will of the United States with respect to the imposition of the fines; the judgment of a court may not be substituted for the discretion which, under the statute, he alone may exercise. In conferring that authority upon an administrative officer, Congress did not transcend constitutional limitations. Under the Constitution and laws of the United States, control of the admission of aliens is committed exclusively to Congress, and, in the exercise of that control, it may lawfully impose appropriate obligations, sanction their enforcement by reasonable money penalties, and invest in administrative officials the power to impose and enforce them.

United States, \n276 \nU.S. 394, 406\n, 48 S.Ct. 348; Navigazione Libera Triestina v. United States (C.C.A.) 36 F.(2d) 631; Zakonaite v. Wolf, \n226 \nU.S. 272, 275\n, 33 S.Ct. 31. \n\n[287 U.S. 329, 335]\n\u00a0\n In Oceanic Steam Navigation Co. v. Stranahan, supra, this Court upheld the constitutionality of section 9 of the Immigration Act of 1903, c. 1012, 32 Stat. 1213, 1215, which is substantially the same as the present section, except that it imposed smaller penalties. Petitioner contends that, as the fines have been increased tenfold, the issue of liability has become so grave that the Stranahan Case is no longer controlling, and the imposition of the fines by administrative action is a denial of due process, unless opportunity is afforded at some stage to test their validity in court by a trial of the facts de novo.\n As was pointed out in the Stranahan Case, the statute imposing the fines must be regarded as an incident to the exercise by Congress of its plenary power to control the admission of aliens, and due process of law does not require that the courts, rather than administrative officers, be charged, in any case, which determining the facts upon which the imposition of such a fine depends. It follows that, as the fines are not invalid, however imposed, because unreasonable or confiscatory in amount, which is conceded, Congress may choose the administrative rather than the judicial method of imposing them. Indeed, the Court rested its decision in Oceanic Steam Navigation Co. v. Stranahan, supra, on the authority of cases arising under the revenue laws, authorizing the administrative imposition of civil penalties frequently much greater than those imposed here. Bartlett v. Kane, 16 How. 263, 274; Passavant v. United States, supra; Origet v. Hedden, \n155 \nU.S. 228\n, 15 S.Ct. 92; see Den ex dem. Murray v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co., 18 How. 272.\n The action of the Secretary is, nevertheless, subject to some judicial review, as the courts below held. The courts may determine whether his action is within his statutory authority, compare Gonzales v. Williams, \n192 \nU.S. 1\n, 24 S.Ct. 177; Gegiow v. Uhl, \n239 \nU.S. 3\n, 36 S.Ct. 2, whether there was any evidence before him to support his determination, \n\n[287 U.S. 329, 336]\n\u00a0\n compare Vajtauer v. Commissioner of Immigration, \n273 \nU.S. 103\n, 47 S.Ct. 302, and whether the procedure which he adopted in making it satisfies elementary standards of fairness and reasonableness, essential to the due administration of the summary proceeding which Congress has authorized. Compare Kwock Jan Fat v. White, \n253 \nU.S. 454\n, 40 S.Ct. 566; Tang Tun v. Edsell, \n223 \nU.S. 673\n, 32 S.Ct. 359; Chin Yow v. United States, \n208 \nU.S. 8, 12\n, 28 S.Ct. 201; The Japanese Immigrant Case, \n189 \nU.S. 86, 100\n, 101 S., 23 S.Ct. 611; see United States ex rel. Iorio v. Day (C.C.A.) 34 F.(2d) 920; Whitfield v. Hanges (C.C.A.) 222 F. 745.\n The statute plainly authorizes the imposition of the fine only if it shall appear, to the satisfaction of the Secretary, that the existence of the disease or disability for which the alien was excluded 'might have been detected by means of a competent medical examination' at the time of sailing. That section 9 imposed upon the Secretary the official duty and responsibility of making such a determination was held by both courts below, and is not questioned by the government. Accordingly, his action in particular cases is subject to judicial review, within the limits mentioned. Whether, as was suggested in the Stranahan Case, supra, pages 332, 342, of 214 U.S., 29 S.Ct. 671, 673, 677, Congress, while adhering to the statutory declaration that the fine is incurred only when the alien's disease or disability could have been detected by competent medical examination at the point of embarkation, might constitutionally provide that the certificate of the examining physician at the port of entry should be conclusive as to that fact, we need not determine. We think it clear, despite language in the Stranahan Case intimating a different view, that the statute, as it has been consistently construed administratively, 2 con- \n\n[287 U.S. 329, 337]\n\u00a0\n templates that the Secretary should fairly determine, after a hearing and upon the evidence, the facts establishing its violation.\n Hence we pass to the petitioner's remaining contention, that the action of the Secretary here in determining liability was arbitrary and unfair. In all of the cases before us, the secretary's decision was supported by at least one item of evidence. It was the certified opinion of the examining physicians of the Health Department, based upon a physical examination of the alien in the proceeding in which his admissibility was determined, that at an earlier date, that of embarkation, the existence of the disease with which he was afflicted upon arrival might have been detected by competent medical examination. This opinion as to the physical condition of the alien at the time and place of embarkation was not accompanied by a statement of the facts observed. Nevertheless, it was some evidence tending to establish the discoverability of the disease at the time of embarkation.\n In all the cases but that of Fusco the evidence presented to the Secretary, in support of the petitioner's contention that the disease or disability could not have been discovered by competent medical examination at the point of embarkation, consisted of the general statement in the protests that it was the practice of the company to conduct such an examination, and, in a few instances, that the alien had received a consular visa. Petitioner argues \n\n[287 U.S. 329, 338]\n\u00a0\n that the alien must have received a medical examination in order to secure the visa. But the protest did not assert that such was the fact, or invite the Secretary to consider it. No details were presented showing the nature or results of any medical examination claimed to have been made before sailing.\n As the protests were not rejected by the Secretary, the facts they disclosed were properly before him and were evidence which, in an administrative proceeding, must be considered and acted upon by the administrative officer. Vajtauer v. Com'r of Immigration, supra; Tang Tun v. Edsell, supra. But we cannot say, on the records before us, that the Secretary did not consider them, as such, for what they were worth, regarding the official medical certificates as conflicting evidence entitled to greater weight. No ground exists, therefore, for setting aside his determination in these cases. The only question is the weight of the evidence, as to which the Secretary's conclusion is final. Compare Zakonaite v. Wolf, supra.\n In the case of Fusco, affidavits were submitted along with the protest, and the two together tended to show with some certainty that the alien had been subjected to three medical examinations shortly before embarkation, once by the Royal Italian Immigration Service in Naples, once by a physician there enjoying the confidence of the American consul, whose certificate was available to the Secretary, and once by petitioner's own ship physician, all of whom found the immigrant in good health.\n The letter imposing the fine in the Fusco case does not show definitely whether the Secretary considered the evidence submitted by petitioner. It recites in one place, 'The alien gave no history of the disease. Indeed, he was not questioned with regard thereto, and the only evidence in the record is the official certificate itself,' and in another, 'It is believed that the evidence placed in the record by the company is not sufficient to call into ques- \n\n[287 U.S. 329, 339]\n\u00a0\n tion the accuracy of the opinion expressed in the official medical certificate.' We need not inquire whether this ambiguity in the record of itself requires the administrative determination to be set aside. Cf. Tod v. Waldman, \n266 \nU.S. 113, 119\n, 120 S., 45 S.Ct. 85; Mahler v. Eby, \n264 \nU.S. 32, 43\n, 44 S.Ct. 283; Kwock Jan Fat v. White, supra, page 464 of 253 U.S., 40 S.Ct. 566, 570. For the same result must follow if the record is considered, whichever way the doubt is resolved. If the Secretary failed to consider evidence before him, he exceeded his authority. If he treated the protest and affidavits as evidence relevant to the issue of the discoverability of the immigrant's disease at the time of sailing, but, nevertheless, chose to rely upon the certified opinion of the examining physicians at Ellis Island, we think that more is involved than the weighing of the evidence, and that his determination cannot stand. For the medical opinions did not reveal the facts upon which they were based, and they were formulated by physicians who, so far as appears, were not apprised of the fact that three previous examinations of the nature described had been made. The detailed information as to those examinations which petitioner submitted to the Secretary in this case might reasonably have affected the expert judgment of the physicians at Ellis Island. In relying upon their opinion alone, without putting these additional facts before them, we think the Secretary acted arbitrarily and unfairly.\n The act of Congress confers on the Secretary great power, but it is not wholly uncontrolled. It is a power which must be exercised fairly, to the end that he may consider all evidence relevant to the determination which he is required to make, that he may arrive justly at his conclusion, and preserve such record of his action that it may be known that he has performed the duty which the law commands. Suppression of evidence of its concealment from a party whose rights are being determined by the administrative tribunal has been held to be so unfair \n\n[287 U.S. 329, 340]\n\u00a0\n as to invalidate the administrative proceeding. Kwock Jan Fat v. White, supra; Lewis ex rel. Lai Thuey Lem v. Johnson (C.C.A.) 16 F.(2d) 180. It is equally offensive to conceal from the experts, whose judgment is accepted as controlling, facts which might properly have influenced their opinion.\n Petitioner makes contentions, with respect to several of the cases, which require special consideration. They embrace the cases of aliens with physical defects affecting their ability to earn a living, aliens who came to the United States with a transit visa for the purpose of passing through the United States to their ultimate destination, Canada, and the case of an alien who came to the United States to enroll as a member of the crew of a vessel to be taken back to Italy. All entered or sought to enter the United States, and all were afflicted with a disease or disability specified in the statute. That their admissibility could not be determined in advance of their reaching the United States, that they were not seeking to remain permanently within the United States, are immaterial in the face of the express language of the statute, which imposes the penalty for bringing them here. See Elting v. North German Lloyd, \n287 \nU.S. 324\n, 53 S.Ct. 164, decided this day.\n Crimi, who was blind, a disability which might affect his ability to earn a living, came to the United States as a student. He had a consular visa under section 4(e) of the Act of 1924, c. 190, 43 Stat. 155, 8 U.S.C .  204(e) (8 USCA  204(e), which exempts from the quota students coming to the United States to attend an accredited school. To exempt the alien from the quota under section 4(e), the school which he comes to attend must have been approved by the Department of Labor, and a list of such accredited schools is supplied to all American consuls. The alien was excluded because he did not come for the purpose of study at an accredited school. The petitioner insists that it was entitled, on the basis of the consular visa, to assume that the alien was admissible. But section 16 of the applicable Im- \n\n[287 U.S. 329, 341]\n\u00a0\n migration Act of 1924, c. 190, 43 Stat. 163, 8 U.S.C.  216 (8 USCA  216), imposes the fine for bringing any quota immigrant, which Crimi was found to be, having a nonquota visa. It provides that the fine shall not be remitted or refunded unless it appears to the satisfaction of the Secretary of Labor that the vessel or transportation company 'could not have ascertained by the exercise of reasonable diligence' that the individual transported was a quota immigrant. The consular visa did not make Crimi a nonquota immigrant entitled to enter. Immigration Act of 1924 ,  2(g), 8 U.S.C.  202(g), 8 USCA  202(g). To secure remission of the fine, the statute placed upon petitioner the burden of establishing, to the satisfaction of the Secretary, that it could not have been ascertained by the exercise of reasonable diligence that the alien was a quota immigrant. Compare Elting v. North German Lloyd, supra. We cannot say that the Secretary did not have ground for holding that reasonable inquiry of the alien or the Consul issuing the visa would have disclosed to petitioner that the alien was not coming to the United States for the purpose of studying in an accredited school.\n The judgment will be reversed as to the tenth cause of action and affirmed as to all the others.\n Reversed in part. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The statute provides that no vessel shall be granted clearance pending a determination of the question whether the fine should be imposed, except upon deposit of the amount of the possible fine or of a bond to secure its payment. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Ever since the promulgation by the Department of Commerce and Labor, in January, 1905, of Department Circular No. 58, the administrative regulations have provided for a hearing. See Immigration Regulations of July 1, 1907, Rule 28, amended December, 1910; Immigration Rules of November 15, 1911, Rule 28, amended October, 1915; Immigration Rules of May 1, 1917, Rule 28, amended August, 1922; Immigration Rules of February 1, 1924, Rule 22; Immigration Rules of July 1, 1925, Rule 22; Immigration Rules of March 1, 1927, Rule 22; Immigration Rules of January 1, 1930, Rule 23.\n During this time the general provisions of section 9 of the Act of 1903, 32 Stat. 1213, 1215, have been re-enacted three times.

PLYMOUTH COUNTY TRUST CO.(1932)\nNo. 714\nArgued: April 26, 1932Decided: May 16, 1932\n\n\n\n\n[286 U.S. 263, 264]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Robert A. B. Cook, of Boston, Mass., for petitioner.\n Mr. Joseph B. Jacobs, of Boston, Mass., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In a bankruptcy proceeding pending in the District Court for Massachusetts, the trustee in bankruptcy, the petitioner here, filed a petition with the referee to set aside certain alleged transfers of property by the bankrupt to the respondent as voidable preferences within the \n\n[286 U.S. 263, 265]\n\u00a0\n provisions of section 60b of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 USCA  96(b). The respondent appeared in the proceeding, denied the material allegations of the petition, but consented in open court that the trial of the issues proceed before the referee. The referee made an order, based on findings, granting in part the relief prayed. The District Court, on cross-petitions to review the determination of the referee, modified his order in respects not now material. In re Craig, Reed & Emerson, 46 F.(2d) 811. On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed the order of the District Court, holding that as the issues before the referee were determinable only in a plenary suit, the referee, notwithstanding the consent of the parties, was without jurisdiction to decide them. 53 F.(2d) 827. This court granted certiorari, \n285 \nU.S. 533\n, 52 S. Ct. 407, 76 L. Ed . -, to resolve a conflict of the decision below with that in In re Hopkins (C. C. A. 2d) 229 F. 378.\n See, also, Page v. Arkansas Natural Gas Corp. (C. C. A.) 53 F.(2d) 27; American Finance Co. v. Coppard (C. C. A. 5th) 45 F.(2d) 154; Board of Education v. Leary (C. C. A. 8th) 236 F. 521; Gamble v. Daniel (C. C. A. 8th) 39 F.(2d) 447, appeal dismissed, \n281 \nU.S. 705\n, 50 S. Ct. 464\n\n\n The only question, presented by the petition, which need be considered here, is whether, the issues raised being such as were triable in a plenary suit, the referee, the parties consenting, had jurisdiction to determine them. Under the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Act, the District Court below had jurisdiction to hear and determine the present suit. Section 60b of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 USCA  96(b) confers on trustees in bankruptcy authority to maintain plenary suits to set aside voidable preferences as defined in that section. Section 23b, 11 USCA  46( b) as originally enacted, provided: 'Suits by the trustee shall only be brought or prosecuted in the courts where the bankrupt, whose estate is being administered by such trustee, might have brought or prosecuted them if proceedings in bankruptcy had not been instituted, unless by consent of the \n\n[286 U.S. 263, 266]\n\u00a0\n proposed defendant.' An amendment of this section in 1903 removed its restrictions on suits brought under section 60b by adding the words 'except suits for the recovery of property under section 60, subdivision b . ...' At the same time section 60b was amended (11 USCA  96(b) note) so as to confer jurisdiction over suits by the trustee to set aside voidable preferences in 'any court of bankruptcy.' By section 1(8), 11 USCA  1(8), 'courts of bankruptcy' includes District Courts.\n Jurisdiction over the present suit being thus vested in the District Court as a court of bankruptcy, the question with which we are immediately concerned is whether the referee appointed by the District Court, where the bankrupt's estate is being administered, is a court within the meaning of section 23b, and is included in the phrase 'any court of bankruptcy' in section 60b, and hence is vested with such jurisdiction that, the defendant consenting, he may try and determine the issues in the suit.\n That he may not try such issues without the consent of the defendant has been often and uniformly held. Louisville Trust Co. v. Comingor, \n184 \nU.S. 18, 26\n, 22 S. Ct. 293; Babbitt v. Dutcher, \n216 \nU.S. 102, 113\n, 30 S. Ct. 372, 17 Ann. Cas. 969; Weidhorn v. Levy, \n253 \nU.S. 268, 273\n, 40 S. Ct. 534; Harrison v. Chamberlin, \n271 \nU.S. 191, 193\n, 46 S. Ct. 467; see, also, Daniel v. Guaranty Trust Co., \n285 \nU.S. 154\n, 52 S. Ct. 326, 76 L. Ed. -, decided March 14, 1932. In cases where the defendant made timely objection to a determination by the referee, it has been said that the referee is without power to hear the issues involved in a plenary suit, and that such a suit, if brought before him, must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction. See Weidhorn v. Levy, supra.\n But a distinction is to be noted between the power of the referee to decide the issues in such a suit brought before him without objection, and his power to compel the litigation of them before him, over the objection of the proposed defendant. Where a suit by the trustee is plenary in character, as are those authorized by section 60b, both parties to it are entitled to claim the benefits of the \n\n[286 U.S. 263, 267]\n\u00a0\n procedure in a penary suit, not available in the summary method of procedure which, under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act, is employed by the referee. A denial of those benefits would be in effect a denial of the right to a plenary suit, to which both parties are entitled under section 60b. But it does not follow that this privilege, extended for the benefit of a suitor, may not, like the right to trial by jury, be waived ( see Harrison v. Chamberlin, supra; cf. Patton v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 276\n, 50 S. Ct. 253, 70 A. L. R. 263), and, being waived, that the referee is without the power given to courts of bankruptcy to decide the issues.\n This court has intimated, although it has never decided, that the referee may, if the parties consent, try the issues which must otherwise be tried in a plenary suit brought by the trustee. See Taubel-Scott- Kitzmiller Co. v. Fox, \n264 \nU.S. 426, 431\n, 433 S., 434, 44 S. Ct. 396; Harrison v. Chamberlin, supra. See, also, Foster v. Manufacturers' Finance Co. (C. C. A.) 22 F.(2d) 609. And we can perceive no reason why the privilege of claiming the benefits of the procedure in a plenary suit, secured to suitors under section 60b and section 23b, may not be waived by consent, as any other procedural privilege of the suitor may be waived, and a more summary procedure substituted. Cf. Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Willard, \n220 U.S. 413\n, 419-421, 31 S. Ct. 460.\n But the question remains, whether, the privilege of trial by plenary suit being waived, the referee possesses the power which courts of bankruptcy possess to hear and determine the issues presented. Section 23b, before its amendment, contemplated that the restrictions upon the choice of a court for the maintenance of suits by the trustee should be removed by consent of the proposed defendant. That is still its effect with respect to suits not enumerated in the amendment. Section 1(7), 11 USCA  1(7) provides that \"court' shall mean the court of bankruptcy in which the proceedings are pending, and may include the referee.' By the two sections read together, the District \n\n[286 U.S. 263, 268]\n\u00a0\n Court in which the proceeding is pending is designated as a court where the trustee may bring the suit if consented to, and that court 'may include the referee,' to whom it has referred the proceeding.\n Whether 'courts' in section 23b, should be taken to include the referee, as section 1(7) permits, is to be determined in view of the fact that under section 23b, as originally enacted, and in many instances since its amendment, the jurisdiction, either of court or referee, may be invoked only on consent, and that in any case plenary suits may not be summarily tried by the referee without consent. Section 38a(4), 11 USCA s 66(4) contemplates that referees within their districts may be invested with the powers of courts of bankruptcy except as to questions relating to the discharge of the bankrupt, and General Order XII (11 USCA  53) directs that after the appointment of the referee all proceedings shall be had before him, except such as are specifically required to be had before the judge. These provisions, read in the light of the object sought to be attained by the Bankruptcy Act, and more particularly by section 23b and section 60b as amended, lead to the conclusion that the word 'courts' as used in section 23b and the words 'any court of bankruptcy' in section 60b must be taken to include the referee, and vest in him the power possessed by courts of bankruptcy under sections 23b and 60b, to decide the issues in a suit brought under section 60b, where the parties join in presenting them to him for determination. While under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act the exercise of his jurisdiction by the referee is ordinarily restricted to those matters which may be dealt with summarily by the method of procedure available to referees in bankruptcy, the restriction may be removed, as it was here, by the consent of the parties to a summary trial of the issue presented. The referee therefore had power to decide the issues, and the Court of Appeals below should have considered the appeal on its merits. \n\n[286 U.S. 263, 269]\n\u00a0\n The decree is reversed, and the cause remanded to the Circuit Court of Appeals for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] For conforming opinion in Circuit Court of Appeals, see 60 F.(2d) 94. \n\n\n\n\n","94":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMACLAUGHLIN v. ALLIANCE INS. CO. OF PHILADELPHIA(1932)\nNo. 547\nArgued: Decided: May 16, 1932\n\n\n\n\n[286 U.S. 244, 245]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Robert T. McCracken, of Philadelphia, Pa., for insurance companies.\n\n\n\n[286 U.S. 244, 246]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Thomas D.Thacher, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., for MacLaughlin.\n\n\n\n[286 U.S. 244, 247]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellee in No. 548, a Pennsylvania stock fire and marine insurance corporation, brought the present suit in the District Court of Eastern Pennsylvania, to recover income tax for the year 1928, alleged to have been illegally exacted. Under the Revenue Acts of 1913, 1916, 1917, and 1918, stock fire insurance companies were taxed upon their income, including gains realized from the sale or other disposition of property, accruing subsequent to March 1, 1913; but, by the Revenue Acts of 1921, 1924, and 1926, gains of such companies, from the sale or other disposition of property, were not subject to tax, and losses similarly incurred were not deductible from gross income.\n Supplement G of the Revenue Act of May 29, 1928, 45 Stat. 791, 844, c. 852,  204(a)(1), 26 USCA  2204(a)(1), effective as of January 1st of the year, taxed the income of insurance \n\n[286 U.S. 244, 248]\n\u00a0\n companies, and by section 204(b)(1), applicable to insurance companies other than life or mutual, gross income was defined as including 'gain during the taxable year from the sale or other disposition of property.' In 1928 appellant received a profit from the sale of property acquired before that year, upon which the Commissioner assessed a tax computed, on the basis prescribed by section 113 of the act (26 USCA  2113), by including in the taxable income all the gain attributable to increase in value after March 1, 1913, and realized in 1928. The District Court held that only the accretion of gain after January 1, 1928, was taxed, and gave judgment in the company's favor for the tax collected in excess of the amount so computed. 49 F.(2d) 361. On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit certified a question to this Court under section 239 of the Judicial Code, as amended by the Act of February 13, 1925 (28 USCA  346), as follows:\n'Under the Revenue Act of 1928, is the basis to be used by an insurance company (other than a life or mutual insurance company) in computing 'gain during the taxable year from the sale or other disposition of property,' acquired before and disposed of after January 1, 1928, its fair market value as of January 1, 1928, the effective date of the Act?'\n\n The company contends that so much of the gain as accrued before the effective date of the taxing act was capital, which could not constitutionally be taxed under the Sixteenth Amendment, and that in any case the constitutionality of a tax upon the previously accrued gain is so doubtful as to require the taxing act to be construed as not authorizing such a levy.\n In No. 547, decided by the same District Court, and involving similar facts and the same taxing statutes, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit certified the following question:\n\n\n[286 U.S. 244, 249]\n\u00a0\n 'If the basis to be used by an insurance company (other than a life or mutual insurance company) in computing 'gain during the taxable year from the sale or other disposition of property', acquired before and disposed of after January 1, 1928, the effective date of the Revenue Act of 1928, be the fair market value of such property as of March 1, 1913, or other basis provided by section 113 of the Act, is the quoted provision (Section 204(b)(1), clause (B) unconstitutional because it taxes capital?'\n The tax under this and earlier revenue acts was imposed upon net income for stated accounting periods, here the calendar year 1928, see Burnet v. Sanford & Brooks Co., \n282 \nU.S. 359, 363\n, 51 S. Ct. 150, and it is only gain realized from the sale or other disposition of property, which is included in the taxable income. Realization of the gain is the event which calls into operation the taxing act, although part of the profit realized in one accounting period may have been due to increase of value in an earlier one. While increase in value of property, not realized as gain by its sale or other disposition, may, in an economic or bookkeeping sense, be deemed an addition to capital in a later period, see Merchants' Loan & Trust Co. v. Smietanka, \n255 \nU.S. 509\n, 41 S. Ct. 386, 15 A. L. R. 1305, it is nevertheless a gain from capital investment which, when realized, by conversion into money or other property, constitutes profit which has consistently been regarded as income within the meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment and taxable as such in the period when realized, see Lynch v. Hornby, \n247 \nU.S. 339\n, 38 S. Ct. 543; Merchants' Loan & Trust Co. v. Smietanka, supra; Eldorado Coal & Mining Co. v. Mager, \n255 \nU.S. 522\n, 41 S. Ct. 390; Goodrich v. Edwards, \n255 \nU.S. 527\n, 41 S. Ct. 390; Walsh v. Brewster, \n255 \nU.S. 536\n, 41 S. Ct. 392; Taft v. Bowers, \n278 \nU.S. 470\n, 49 S. Ct. 199, 64 A. L. R. 362; Lucas v. Alexander, \n279 \nU.S. 573\n, 49 S. Ct. 426, 61 A. L. R. 906; Willcuts v. Bunn, \n282 \nU.S. 216\n, 51 S. Ct. 125. \n\n[286 U.S. 244, 250]\n\u00a0\n Here there is no question of a tax on enhancement of value occurring before March 1, 1913, the effective date of the income tax act of that year, for the collector asserts no right to tax such increase in value. The fact that a part of the taxed gain represented increase in value after that date, but before the present taxing act, is without significance. Congress, having constitutional power to tax the gain, and having established a policy of taxing it, see Milliken v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 15, 22\n, 23 S., 51 S. Ct. 324, may choose the moment of its realization and the amount realized, for the incidence and the measurement of the tax. Its failure to impose a tax upon the increase in value in the earlier years, assuming without deciding that it had the power, cannot preclude it from taxing the gain in the year when realized, any more than in any other case, where the tax imposed in upon realized, as distinguished from accrued, gain. If the gain became capital by virtue of the increase in value in the years before 1928, and so could not be taxed as income, the same would be true of the enhancement of value in any one year after the adoption of the taxing act, which was realized and taxed in another. But the constitutionality of a tax so applied has been repeatedly affirmed and never questioned. The tax being upon realized gain, it may constitutionally be imposed upon the entire amount of the gain realized within the taxable period, even though some of it represents enhanced value in an earlier period before the adoption of the taxing act. Cooper v. United States, \n280 \nU.S. 409\n, 50 S. Ct. 164; compare Taft v. Bowers, \n278 \nU.S. 470\n, 49 S. Ct. 199, 64 A. L. R. 362. See, also, Glenn v. Doyal, \n285 \nU.S. 526\n, 52 S. Ct. 404, 76 L. Ed. - (March 21, 1932) dismissing per curiam, for want of a substantial federal question, an appeal from a decision of the Georgia Supreme Court (reported sub nom. Norman v. Bradley, 173 Ga. 482, 160 S. E. 413), that a state income tax on the profits realized from a sale of corporate stocks, after the passage of \n\n[286 U.S. 244, 251]\n\u00a0\n the act, was constitutional, though the gains had accrued prior to its enactment.\n Doyle v. Mitchell Brothers Co., \n247 \nU.S. 179\n, 38 S. Ct. 467, and Hays v. Gauley Mountain Coal Co., \n247 \nU.S. 189\n, 38 S. Ct. 470, on which the the constitutionality, of the Corporation Excise kthe constitutionality, of the Corporation Excise Tax Act of 1909 (36 Stat. 112), and considerations which, in Lynch v. Turrish, \n247 \nU.S. 221\n, 38 S. Ct. 537, and Southern Pacific Co. v. Lowe, \n247 \nU.S. 330\n, 38 S. Ct. 540, led to the construction of the income tax act of 1913 as not embracing gains accrued before the effective date of that act, are not present here.\n We think it clear that the Revenue Act of 1928 imposed the tax on the entire gain realized within the taxable year. Section 204(b)(1) of Supplement G, 26 USCA  2204(b)(1), which includes gain from the sale of property in the gross income of insurance companies (other than life or mutual), states no method of computing the gain. But the 1928 act, like its predecessors, prescribed in other sections,  111-113 (26 USCA  2111-2113), that taxable gains from the sale of property should be determined by deducting from the net sales price the cost or the fair market value on March 1, 1913, if acquired before that date. There provisions are general in their terms, without any stated exception, and on their face are applicable alike to all gains from the sale of property taxed by the act. They either control the computation of the gain referred to in section 204(b)(1), or the word 'gain' in that section, construed without their aid, must be taken in its ordinary sense as embracing the difference between net cost and net selling price, and so upon established principles would include in the taxable realized gain all which had accrued since the effective date of the Income Tax Act of 1913, the first enactment adopted under the Sixteenth Amendment. See Eisner v. Macomber, \n252 \nU.S. 189, 207\n, 40 S. Ct. 189, 9 A. L. R. 1570; Merchants' L. & T. Co. v. Smietanka, supra, pages 519, 520 of 255 U. S., 41 S. Ct. 386. For present purposes, the Revenue \n\n[286 U.S. 244, 252]\n\u00a0\n Act of 1928 must be regarded as substantially an amendment and continuation of the act of 1913\n\n\n The taxpayers insist that the omission from section 204(b)(1) of any reference to sections 111-113, in contrast to the inclusion in section 204( c), 26 USCA  2204(c), of cross references to the general provisions of the act defining deductions, evidences an intention to exclude the method of computing gains prescribed by sections 111-113, and to adopt a different method with respect to gains taxed by Supplement G. But this argument disregards the function of the general provisions of the act, including sections 111-113, as complementing the provisions of Supplement G, and ignores the obvious necessity of defining the deductions authorized by section 204(c), either by cross-references made in that section to the general provisions of the act or by other appropriate means, which did not obtain with respect to the definition of gains in 204(b) (1).1\n This becomes evident upon an examination of the structure of the 1928 act (26 USCA  2001 et seq.), which differed from that of any earlier revenue measure. 'Title 1-Income Tax,' with which we are now concerned, is divided into three subtitles designated:\n'Subtitle A-Introductory provisions.'\n\n'Subtitle B-General provisions.'\n\n'Subtitle C-Supplemental provisions.' \n\n[286 U.S. 244, 253]\n\u00a0\n Section 4 of subtitle A (26 USCA  2004) provides in part: 'The application of the General Provisions and of Supplements A to D, inclusive, to each of the following special classes of taxpayers, shall be subject to the exceptions and additional provisions found in the Supplement applicable to such class, as follows: ... (c) Insurance companies,- Supplement G. ...' The act, by this section and by operations of its structural arrangement, thus provided that all of the general provisions of subtitle B, and all the general provisions of Supplements A to D, including Supplement B, in which sections 111-113 occur, were to apply to the special classes of taxpayers referred to in Supplements E to K, unless the provisions relating to a special class restrict the operation of the general provisions or are necessarily inconsistent with them. That such was the purpose to be accomplished by the rearrangement of the taxing provisions in the 1928 act sufficiently appears from its legislative history. 2\n\n Section 204 is not, as the District Court thought, 'a scheme or code of taxation, complete in itself, ... without reference to the general provisions of the act,' unless specifically referred to and included by cross-reference to such general provisions. An inspection of the act discloses that Supplement G, dealing with insurance companies as a special class of taxpayers, would be unwork- \n\n[286 U.S. 244, 254]\n\u00a0\n able without resort to the general provisions of the act not specifically referred to in the Supplement. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n It would be going very far in the circumstances to say that the mere omission from section 204 of a cross-reference to the definition of gain in sections 111-113, made applicable by the general provisions of the act, not only excluded that definition from section 204, but substituted a different one not specifically mentioned in that or any other section. The gain taxed by section 204(b)(1) is therefore that defined by sections 111- 113, which may constitutionally be taxed.\n Both questions as answered, No.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] It is true that sections 204(c), 205, and 206 (26 USCA  2204(c), 2205, 2206), relating to allowed deductions from gross income, define the deductions by specific cross references to like deductions defined in the general provisions of other sections, but as the listed deductions were intended to be exclusive, and as those allowed to insurance companies differ in many respects from those allowed to other corporations, it was an appropriate, if not necessary precaution, in enumerating them, to describe those which were allowed, either by repeating the appropriate language contained in the general sections or to incorporate it by reference. No such precaution was necessary with respect to  204(b). The 'gain' included in gross income by that section was adequately defined by sections 111-113 (26 USCA  2111-2113), made applicable, by section 4 of subtitle A (26 USCA  2004), to the provisions of Supplement G. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See Report of the Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation, December 22, 1927, Document No. 139, 70th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 2, appendix p. 7; Report of the Committee on Ways and Means, December 17, 1927, H. R. No. 2, 70th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 1, 2, 11, 12; Report of Committee on Finance, Sen. Rep. No. 960, May 1, 1928, 70th Cong., 1st Sess. pp. 17, 18. Although the bill, as originally introduced, did not contain the provision for taxing gains of stock fire insurance companies, the bill was amended by the addition of section 204(b)(1)(B) to Supplement G, for the declared purpose of placing such insurance companies on the same basis as mutual companies, which were already taxed upon gains from the sale or other disposition of property. Cong. Rec., May 21, 1928, vol. 69, part 9, p. 9337; Conference Report No. 1882, p. 18. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Neither section 204, which deals with the taxation of insurance companies other than life or mutual, nor the other provisions of Supplement G, contain any directions concerning such essential parts of a system of taxation as the filing of returns, time of payment, or penalties for nonpayment; and no express reference is made to the obviously applicable general provisions touching upon these matters. Sections 52, 56, 146 (26 USCA  2052, 2056, 2146). Other important and necessarily applicable general provisions, not included or referred to in Supplement G, may be found in sections 105, 118, 141, 142, 271-277 (26 USCA  2105, 2118, 2141, 2142, 2271-2277). The provision in section 207 of Supplement G ( 26 USCA  2207) that 'gross income shall not be determined in the manner provided in section 119' is a plain indication that the general provisions contained in section 119 (26 USCA  2119) would apply to insurance companies in the absence of the express exception. \n\n\n\n\n","95":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMARINE TRANSIT CORPORATION v. DREYFUS(1932)\nNo. 172\nArgued: December 10, 1931Decided: January 4, 1932\n\n\n\n\n[284 U.S. 263, 264]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Horace L. Cheyney, of New York City, for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[284 U.S. 263, 266]\n\u00a0\n Mr. George V. A. McCloskey, of New York City, for respondents.\n\n\n[284 U.S. 263, 268]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner, Marine Transit Corporation, entered into a written booking agreement with the respondents, Louis Dreyfus & Co., to furnish insurable canal tonnage for about 200,000 bushels of wheat, to be carried from Buffalo to New York. The contract provided that it should be 'subject to New York Produce Exchange Canal Grain Charter Party No. 1 as amended.' That charter party contained the following provision as to disputes:\n'All disputes arising under this contract to be arbitrated before the Committee on Grain of the New York Produce Exchange whose decision shall be final and binding.'\n\n Under this contract, the Marine Transit Corporation, in September, 1928, provided the barge Edward A. Ryan to carry 19,200 bushels of the above-stated amount. This was a shipment, as the bill of lading of the Marine Transit Corporation shows, to the order of the Bank of Nova Scotia, and was from Ft. William, Ontario, 'in bond, for export,' to be delivered 'on surrender of original Lake bill of lading properly endorsed.' While in tow of the petitioner's tug Gerald A. Fagan on the New York Barge Canal, and approaching the Federal lock at Troy, the Edward A. Ryan struck the guide wall and sank with its cargo. The respondents, Louis Dreyfus & Co., filed a libel in admiralty against the Marine Transit Corporation in personam, and against the tug Gerald A. Fagan in rem, to recover damages for the loss of the wheat. The libel was also against a barge John E. Enright, one of the boats in the tow, but the action as to that boat was subsequently discontinued. A claim for \n\n[284 U.S. 263, 269]\n\u00a0\n the tug Gerald A. Fagan was made by the Marine Transit Corporation, and a stipulation for value was filed by it, as claimant, in the sum of $26,000, with the usual provision that the stipulation should be void, if the claimant and the stipulator (the Continental Casualty Company) should abide by all orders of the court and pay the amount awarded by its final decree, and that otherwise the stipulation should remain in full force.\n After answer to the libel had been filed by the Marine Transit Corporation as respondent, and as claimant of the tug Gerald A. Fagan, the libelants moved for a reference of the dispute to arbitration in accordance with the provision of the booking contract. This motion was granted 'only as to the issues raised by the contract between the libellants and the Marine Transit Corporation,' and the latter was ordered to submit to arbitration as to these issues before the Committee on Grain of the New York Produce Exchange. The arbitration proceeded and resulted in an award against the Marine Transit Corporation for the sum of $23,016, with interest and the costs and expenses of the arbitration. The award was confirmed by the District Court, and an order-in substance, a final decree- was entered for the recovery by the libelants against the Marine Transit Corporation of the amount of the award, with the further provision that, if payment was not made within ten days, execution should issue against the Marine Transit Corporation and the stipulator. A motion to restrain the libelants from recovering from the claimant or its stipulator on behalf of the tug Gerald A. Fagan was denied. The decree entered upon the award was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals (49 F.(2d) 215), and the case comes here on writ of certiorari.\n There is no question that the controversy between the petitioner and the respondents was within the arbitration clause of the booking contract. That provision was valid \n\n[284 U.S. 263, 270]\n\u00a0\n (Red Cross Line v. Atlantic Fruit Company, \n264 \nU.S. 109, 122\n, 44 S. Ct. 274), and, as it related to all disputes arising under the contract, it applied to the controversy with the Marine Transit Corporation as operating owner of the tug Gerald A. Fagan which was used for the agreed transportation. The questions presented are (1) whether the action of the District Court was authorized by the United States Arbitration Act (9 USCA  1-15);1 and (2) whether that act, as thus applied, is constitutional. \n\n[284 U.S. 263, 271]\n\u00a0\n First. In construing the statute, we deal only with the questions raised by the present record. The loss occurred \n\n[284 U.S. 263, 272]\n\u00a0\n upon a waterway which was part of the navigable waters of the United States (The Robert W. Parsons, \n191 \nU.S. 17\n, 24 S. Ct. 8) and while the cargo was being transported by the petitioner under a maritime contract. The subject-matter of the controversy thus lay within the jurisdiction of admiralty. The ambiguities of the statute have been \n\n[284 U.S. 263, 273]\n\u00a0\n stressed in argument, but we think that its provisions embrace a case such as the one before us,2 and it is not necessary to discuss others. Section 4 of the act (9 USCA  4) authorizes a court, which would otherwise have jurisdiction in admiralty 'of the subject matter of a suit arising out of the contro- \n\n[284 U.S. 263, 274]\n\u00a0\n versy between the parties' to a written agreement for arbitration, to 'make an order directing the parties to proceed to arbitration in accordance with the terms of the agreement.' Section 8 (9 USCA  8) explicitly provides that, where a cause of action is 'otherwise justiciable in admiralty, then, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the party claiming to be aggrieved may begin his proceeding hereunder by libel and seizure of the vessel or other property of the other party according to the usual course of admiralty proceedings,' and the court may then 'direct the parties to proceed with the arbitration and shall retain jurisdiction to enter its decree upon the award.'\n In this instance, the libel against the vessel came directly within the provision of section 8. But the petitioner insists that the District Court 'had no power under that section to make an order for arbitration of the proceeding against the Marine Transit Corporation, in personam.' Section 8, it is said, applies 'only to proceedings in rem or proceedings in personam where there has been an attachment of the property of the respondent,' and there was no such attachment in this case. And it is contended that, aside from section 8, the act does not provide for the granting of an order for arbitration 'in a pending suit.' With respect to the last contention, it may be observed that section 3 (9 USCA  3) provides for a stay in a pending suit until arbitration has been had in accordance with the terms of the agreement, and it would be an anomaly if the court could grant such a stay and could not direct the arbitration to proceed, \n\n[284 U.S. 263, 275]\n\u00a0\n although the court, admittedly, could have made an order for the arbitration if no suit had been brought. We think that the petitioner's argument is based upon a misconception of the statute. The intent of section 8 is to provide for the enforcement of the agreement for arbitration, without depriving the aggrieved party of his right, under the admiralty practice, to proceed against 'the vessel or other property' belonging to the other party to the agreement. The statutory provision does not contemplate 'the vessel or other property,' which may be seized, as being the party to the arbitration agreement. By the express terms of section 8, the libel and seizure are authorized as an initial step in a proceeding to enforce the agreement for arbitration, and it is the parties to that agreement who may be directed to proceed with the arbitration. Here the Marine Transit Corporation was the party to the arbitration agreement. It had used the tug as a facility for the transportation of the libelants' wheat, and the dispute as to liability was within the promise to arbitrate. If there was to be an order for arbitration, it would appropriately run against the Marrine Transit Corporation to enforce that obligation. It was not necessary or proper that the order should run against the tug. Nor was it necessary that the court in directing the arbitration should attempt to split the proceeding with respect to the demand in the suit in personam against the corporation and that in rem against the tug. The Marine Transit Corporation was before the court both as respondent and as owner and claimant of the vessel seized, and the agreement to arbitrate bound the corporation in both capacities. We conclude that the order directing the arbitration of the issues arising under the contract between the libelants and the Marine Transit Corporation was authorized by the statute.\n We do not conceive it to be open to question that, where the court has authority under the statute, as we find \n\n[284 U.S. 263, 276]\n\u00a0\n that it had in this case, to make an order for arbitration, the court also has authority to confirm the award or to set it aside for irregularity, fraud, ultra vires, or other defect. \n3\n Upon the motion to confirm the award in this case, objections to the proceedings before the arbitrators were overruled by the District Court and are not pressed here. It is, however, urged against the award that it was signed by only four of the five arbitrators. The statute is silent with respect to a decision by a majority, but it does authorize action by a majority in compelling the attendance of witnesses. Section 7 (9 USCA  7). In the absence of statutory requirement, the question as to the necessity of unanimity in the decision on the merits would be determined by the arbitration agreement, and it does not appear that under the agreement in this instance unanimity was needed. Nor does the record show that specific objection upon this point was taken in the District Court upon the motion for confirmation, and the rules of the New York Produce Exchange with respect to arbitrations under its Canal Grain Charter Party No. 1 (to which the petitioner's booking agreement was made subject) are not set forth. We think that there was no error in the ruling of the Circuit Court of Appeals upon this point.\n The petitioner also insists that, under section 9 (9 USCA  9), a judgment may be entered upon the award only if the parties have so agreed in their contract for arbitration, and that the agreement here does not so provide. But the agreement for arbitration stipulated that the award should be 'final and binding.' The award was accordingly binding upon the Marine Transit Corporation both as respondent and as the owner and claimant of the tug, and the District Court entered its decree upon the award against that corporation under the authority expressly conferred by section 8. \n\n[284 U.S. 263, 277]\n\u00a0\n The Circuit Court of Appeals also upheld the decree as against the stipulator, as its stipulation conformed to Admiralty Rule 8 of the Southern District of New York4 and the decree was in accord with the stipulation and admiralty practice. The Palmyra, 12 Wheat. 1, 10; The Wanata, \n95 U.S. 600\n, 611. We express no doubt as to the correctness of this conclusion, which the petitioner contests, but we have no occasion to deal with the question, as the stipulator has taken no steps to obtain a review of the decree in this court.\n We find no ground for disturbing the decree as unauthorized by the statute.\n Second. The constitutional question raised by this application of the statute is whether it is compatible with the maintenance of the judicial power of the United States as extended to cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. Const. art. 3.\n In Red Cross Line v. Atlantic Fruit Company, supra, at pages 122, 123 of 264 U. S., 44 S. Ct. 274, 276, this Court pointed out that in admiralty 'agreements to submit controversies to arbitration are valid,' and that 'reference of maritime controversies to arbitration has long been common practice.' 'An executory agreement,' said the court, 'may be made a rule of court' and the 'substantive right created by an agreement to submit its disputes to arbitration is recognized as a perfect obligation.' The question, then, is one merely as to the power of the Congress to afford a remedy in admiralty to enforce such an obligation. It was because the question was one of remedy only, that this Court decided that a state, by virtue of the clause saving to suitors 'the right \n\n[284 U.S. 263, 278]\n\u00a0\n of a common-law remedy,'5 had the power 'to confer upon its courts the authority to compel parties within its jurisdiction to specifically perform an agreement for arbitration, which is valid by the general maritime law, as well as by the law of the state,' and is contained in a maritime contract made within the state and there to be performed. Red Cross Line v. Atlantic Fruit Company, supra, at page 124 of 264 U. S., 44, S. Ct. 274, 277. The general power of the Congress to provide remedies in matters falling within the admiralty jurisdiction of the federal courts, and to regulate their procedure, is indisputable. The petitioner contends that the Congress could not confer upon courts of admiralty the authority to grant specific performance. But it is well settled that the Congress, in providing appropriate means to enforce obligations cognizable in admiralty, may draw upon other systems. Thus the Congress may authorize a trial by jury in admiralty, as it has done in relation to certain cases arising on the Great Lakes. \n6\n Courts of admiralty may be empowered to grant injunctions, as in proceedings for limitation of liability. \n7\n Similarly, there can be no question of the power of Congress to authorize specific performance when that is an appropriate remedy in a matter within the admiralty jurisdiction. As Chief Justice Taney said in the Genesee Chief, 12 How. 443, 460: 'The Constitution declares that the judicial power of the United States shall extend to 'all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.' But it does not direct that the court shall proceed according to ancient and established forms, or shall adopt any other form or mode of practice. ... In ad- \n\n[284 U.S. 263, 279]\n\u00a0\n miralty and maritime cases there is no such limitation as to the mode of proceeding, and Congress may therefore in cases of that description, give either party right of trial by jury, or modify the practice of the court in any other respect that it deems more conducive to the administration of justice.'\n In this instance a remedy is provided to fit the agreement. The Congress has authorized the court to direct the parties to proceed to arbitration in accordance with a valid stipulation of a maritime contract and to enter a decree upon the award found to be regularand within the terms of the agreement. We think that the objection on constitutional grounds is without merit.\n Decree affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of February 12, 1925, c. 213, 43 Stat. 883 (9 USCA  1-15). The title of the act and sections 1 to 4, inclusive, and sections 6, 7, 8, a portion of section 9, and sections 13 and 14 (9 USCA  1-4, 6-9, 13, 14 ), are as follows:\n'Chap. 213.-An Act To make valid and enforceable written provisions or agreements for arbitration of disputes arising out of contracts, maritime transactions, or commerce among the States or Territories or with foreign nations.\n\n'Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That 'maritime transactions,' as herein defined, means charter parties, bills of lading of water carriers, agreements relating to wharfage, supplies furnished vessels or repairs to vessels, collisions, or any other matters in foreign commerce which, if the subject of controversy, would be embraced within admiralty jurisdiction; 'commerce,' as herein defined, means commerce among the several States or with foreign nations, or in any Territory of the United States or in the District of Columbia, or between any such Territory and another, or between any such Territory and any State or foreign nation, or between the District of Columbia and any State or Territory or foreign nation, but nothing herein contained shall apply to contracts of employment of seamen, railroad employees, or any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce.\n\n'Sec. 2. That a written provision in any maritime transaction or a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction, or the refusal to perform the whole or any part thereof, or an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration an existing controversy arising out of such a contract, transaction, or refusal, shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract. \n\n'Sec. 3. That if any suit or proceeding be brought in any of the courts of the United States upon any issue referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing for such arbitration, the court in which such suit is pending, upon being satisfied that the issue involved in such suit or proceeding is referable to arbitration under such an agreement, shall on application of one of the parties stay the trial of the action until such arbitration has been had in accordance with the terms of the agreement, providing the applicant for the stay is not in default in proceeding with such arbitration.\n\n'Sec. 4. That a party aggrieved by the alleged failure, neglect, or refusal of another to arbitrate under a written agreement for arbitration may petition any court of the United States which, save for such agreement, would have jurisdiction under the judicial code at law, in equity, or in admiralty of the subject matter of a suit arising out of the controversy between the parties, for an order directing that such arbitration proceed in the manner provided for in such agreement. Five days' notice in writing of such application shall be served upon the party in default. Service thereof shall be made in the manner provided by law for the service of summons in the jurisdiction in which the proceeding is brought. The court shall hear the parties, and upon being satisfied that the making of the agreement for arbitration or the failure to comply therewith is not in issue, the court shall make an order directing the parties to proceed to arbitration in accordance with the terms of the agreement: Provided, That the hearing and proceedings under such agreement shall be within the district in which the petition for an order directing such arbitration is filed. If the making of the arbitration agreement or the failure, neglect, or refusal to perform the same be in issue, the court shall proceed summarily to the trial thereof. If no jury trial be demanded by the party alleged to be in default, or if the matter in dispute is within admiralty jurisdiction, the court shall hear and determine such issue. Where such an issue is raised, the party alleged to be in default may, except in cases of admiralty, on or before the return day of the notice of application, demand a jury trial of such issue, and upon such demand the court shall make an order referring the issue or issues to a jury in the manner provided by law for referring to a jury issues in an equity action, or may specially call a jury for that purpose. If the jury find that no agreement in writing for arbitration \n\n was made or that there is no default in proceeding thereunder, the proceeding shall be dismissed. If the jury find that an agreement for arbitration was made in writing and that there is a default in proceeding thereunder, the court shall make an order summarily directing the parties to proceed with the arbitration in accordance with the terms thereof. ...\n'Sec. 6. That any application to the court hereunder shall be made and heard in the manner provided by law for the making and hearing of motions, except as otherwise herein expressly provided.\n\n'Sec. 7. That the arbitrators selected either as prescribed in this Act or otherwise, or a majority of them, may summon in writing any person to attend before them or any of them as a witness and in a proper case to bring with him or them any book, record, document, or paper which may be deemed material as evidence in the case. The fees for such attendance shall be the same as the fees of witnesses before masters of the United States courts. Said summons shall issue in the name of the arbitrator or arbitrators, or a majority of them, and shall be signed by the arbitrators, or a majority of them, and shall be directed to the said person and shall be served in the same manner as subpoenas to appear and testify before the court; if any person or persons so summoned to testify shall refuse or neglect to obey said summons, upon petition the United States court in and for the district in which such arbitrators, or a majority of them, are sitting may compel the attendance of such person or persons before said arbitrator or arbitrators, or punish said person or persons for contempt in the same manner now provided for securing the attendance of witnesses or their punishment for neglect or refusal to attend in the courts of the United States.\n\n'Sec. 8. That if the basis of jurisdiction be a cause of action otherwise justiciable in admiralty, then, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the party claiming to be aggrieved may begin his proceeding hereunder by libel and seizure of the vessel or other property of the other party according to the usual course of admiralty \n\n proceedings, and the court shall then have jurisdiction to direct the parties to proceed with the arbitration and shall retain jurisdiction to enter its decree upon the award.\n'Sec. 9. If the parties in their agreement have agreed that a judgment of the court shall be entered upon the award made pursuant to the arbitration, and shall specify the court, then at any time within one year after the award is made any party to the arbitration may apply to the court so specified for an order confirming the award, and thereupon the court must grant such an order unless the award is vacated, modified, or corrected as prescribed in the next two sections. If no court is specified in the agreement of the parties, then such application may be made to the United States court in and for the district within which such award was made. ...\n\n'Sec. 13. That the party moving for an order confirming, modnying, or correcting an award shall, at the time such order is filed with the clerk for the entry of judgment thereon, also file the following papers with the clerk:\n\n'(a) The agreement; the selection or appointment, if any, of an additional arbitrator or umpire; and each written extension of the time, if any, within which to make the award.\n\n'(b) The award.\n\n'(c) Each notice, affidavit, or other paper used upon an application to confirm, modify, or correct the award, and a copy of each order of the court upon such an application.\n\n'The judgment shall be docketed as if it was rendered in an action.\n\n'The judgment so entered shall have the same force and effect in all respects, as, and be subject to all the provisions of law relating to, a judgment in an action; and it may be enforced as if it had been rendered in an action in the court in which it is entered.\n\n'Sec. 14. That this Act may be referred to as 'The United States Arbitration Act.\" \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives, in its report upon the bill, which with the Senate amendment became the Act in question, said:\n'The purpose of this bill is to make valid and enforcible agreements for arbitration contained in contracts involving interstate commerce or within the jurisdiction of admiralty, or which may be the subject of litigation in the Federal courts. ...

Feely, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Claude R. Branch, of Providence, R. I., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case is here on certiorari, \n284 \nU.S. 600\n, 52 S. Ct. 11 to review a judgment of the Court of Claims dismissing the petition for want of jurisdiction. 72 Ct. Cl. 210.\n The suit was brought upon a petition which alleged facts as follows: On October 15, 1917, the United States Shipping Board, under the Urgent Deficiencies Appropri- \n\n[284 U.S. 352, 354]\n\u00a0\n ation Act of June 15, 1917, c. 29, 40 Stat. 182, 183, and an Executive Order promulgated by the President on July 11, 1917, requisitioned for use by the United States seven merchant vessels then owned and operated by petitioner. On December 29, 1917, the government, acting through the Shipping Board, entered into a contract for the operation of each ship by petitioner under a 'requisition charter,' the form of which was attached. It was agreed that petitioner 'in consideration of the compensation provided (by the requisition charter) and the other obligations assumed by the United States ... accepts this Requisition Charter in full satisfaction of any and all claims he has or may have against the United States arising out of the Requisition, and accepts the compensation herein provided for as the just compensation required by law. ...'\n The attached form contained numerous clauses dealing with matters commonly covered by time charters. It provided that the vessel should remain in the service of the United States, to be employed as it might determine, but that petitioner should operate the vessel, furnish crew and equipment, and pay for provisions, wages, shipping fees, and supplies. The United States agreed to pay to petitioner, in addition to certain enumerated expenses of maintenance and operation of the vessel, ship hire at the monthly rate established by the Shipping Board for vessels of like description, but with provision for terminating the charter by petitioner, if the rate should be less than a specified minimum. By the tenth clause of the charter, with which we are chiefly concerned, the government agreed to reimburse petitioner 'for any proper increases in wages and bonuses over the standard prevailing 1 August, 1917, for master, officers, and crew. ...'\n Acting under the charters, petitioner from time to time credited the government on its books with sums received on its account, and charged it with items due petitioner, \n\n[284 U.S. 352, 355]\n\u00a0\n including payments of increased wages and bonuses. On October 1, 1926, petitioner entered into a second agreement with the Government, accepting a specified amount in full satisfaction of all its demands except one for the sum of $49,373.11, claimed under clause tenth, for the recovery of which the present suit was brought.\n The Court of Claims made a special finding that the petitioner, after the petition was filed, had brought separate suits against the United States in the District Court of the United States for Northern California, to recover the amounts alleged to have been paid by it as increased wages and bonuses, and granted the government's motion to dismiss on the sole ground that the pendency of the suits in the District Court deprived it of jurisdiction to proceed with the cause by virtue of section 154 of the Judicial Code, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1087, 1138 (28 USCA  260). This section forbids prosecution in the Court of Claims of any claim for which suit is 'pending in any other court ... against any person who, at the time when the cause of action ... arose, was, in respect thereto, acting ... under the authority of the United States.'\n Petitioner insists that the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims is unaffected by the suits pending in the District Court, since section 154 denies jurisdiction to the Court of Claims only when an agent of the United States is sued simultaneously in another court; here, the United States is the defendant. The government does not press the contention upheld by the Court of Claims, that its jurisdiction was ousted by the pendency of the petitioner's suits in the District Court. Although they were not within the language of the section, they were nevertheless regarded as within its assumed purpose to prevent the prosecution at the same time of two suits against the government for the same cause of action. But the declared purpose of the section (originally enacted as section 8 of the Act of June 25, 1868, 15 Stat. 77, c. 71) was only \n\n[284 U.S. 352, 356]\n\u00a0\n to require an election between a suit in the Court of Claims and one brought in another court against an agent of the government, in which the judgment would not be res adjudicata in the suit pending in the Court of Claims (Statement of Senator Edmunds, Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, in reporting the bill to the Senate, Cong. Globe, 40th Cong., 2nd Sess., 1868 P. 2769). See Sage v. United States, \n250 \nU.S. 33, 37\n, 39 S. Ct. 415; and compare Southern Pacific Railroad Co. v. United States, \n168 \nU.S. 1, 48\n, 49 S., 18 S. Ct. 18, holding otherwise as to a judgment obtained in a suit brought against the United States in a District Court. As the words of the section are plain, we are not at liberty to add to or alter them to effect a purpose which does not appear on its face or from its legislative history. Corona Coal Co. v. United States, \n263 \nU.S. 537, 540\n, 44 S. Ct. 156.\n In supporting the judgment of dismissal below, the government relies on the Suits in Admiralty Act of March 9, 1920, c. 95, 41 Stat. 525-528 ( 46 USCA  741-752) by which, it is contended, jurisdiction over the asserted cause of action is vested exclusively in courts of admiralty. Section 1 of the Suits in Admiralty Act forbids the arrest or seizure of vessels owned or operated by or for the United States. Section 2 provides that, where a proceeding in admiralty could be maintained, if at the time of the commencement of the action such vessel were privately owned or operated, 'a libel in personam may be brought against the United States ... provided that such vessel is employed as a merchant vessel ...,' and that 'such suits shall be brought in the district court of the United States. ...'\n Under these sections, jurisdiction of maritime causes of action against the United States, arising out of the operation of merchant vessels for it, is vested exclusively in the District Courts. Johnson v. U. S. Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation, \n280 \nU.S. 320\n, 50 S. Ct. 118; U. S. Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation v. Rosenberg \n\n[284 U.S. 352, 357]\n\u00a0\n Bros. & Co., \n276 \nU.S. 202\n, 48 S. Ct. 256. The language of section 2 (46 USCA  742) is general, embracing suits on maritime causes of action by owners, as well as by third persons injured by the operation for the government of merchant vessels. See Eastern Transportation Co. v. United States, \n272 U.S. 675\n, 689 et seq., 47 S. Ct. 289.\n Petitioner argues that the Suits in Admiralty Act is not applicable, because the cause of action here alleged is nonmaritime in character; it contends that the so-called requisition charter is not a time charter, but a mere agreement for just compensation for the requisitioned ships, which may be recovered in the Court of Claims. But we think the cause of action is maritime, arising out of the express contract for the operation of vessels for the United States, and is not shown to be within the jurisdiction of the court below.\n It is true that, under section 145 of the Judicial Code, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1087, 1136 (28 USCA  250) the Court of Claims has jurisdiction of claims for just compensation for property requisitioned by the United States, but such is not the cause of action alleged. Subdivision (e) of the Emergency Shipping Fund provisions of the Urgent Deficiencies Appropriation Act of June 15, 1917, authorized the requisition of the title or possession of ships 'for use or operation by the United States.' It required just compensation for requisitioned ships to be fixed by the President, and provided, in case the amount was unsatisfactory to the person entitled to compensation, that 75 per cent. of it should be paid, and that suit might be brought against the United States to recover such further amount as, with that already paid, would make up just compensation.\n But, upon seizure of the petitioner's vessels, this procedure was abandoned. By the agreement with the Shipping Board, the requisition charter was substituted for petitioner's right to receive just compensation under the Constitution and the statute. The substituted contract \n\n[284 U.S. 352, 358]\n\u00a0\n conferred new and different rights upon petitioner, and subjected it to new obligations, not flowing from the requisition. The requisition of the ships imposed no duty on petitioner to operate them or to pay expenses of operation and maintenance after their seizure. That duty and petitioner's right to compensation for the performance of it and its right to be reimbursed for increased costs of operation, one of which is the subject of the present suit, arose from the contract alone. Such compensation and reimbursement are not included in just compensation for the requisition, even though waiver of the constitutional right was part consideration for the obligation to pay for the operation of the ships. The stipulated monthly payments to petitioner for ship hire were not measured by the just compensation which petitioner would otherwise have been entitled to receive and might, in fact, be either more or less. The effect of the agreement was to release petitioner's rights, growing out of the requisition, and to define the rights of the parties with respect to the use of petitioner's ships and the compensation for them, as effectively and completely and with the same consequences as though no requisition had ever been made.\n We need not examine the requisition charter with meticulous care to see whether it is in all respects identical with the usual charter party, which, as petitioner concedes, is maritime. Morewood v. Enequist, 23 How. 491. It is enough that the right asserted is upon express contract with the shipowner for its operation of the ship for the government, and stipulates compensation both for use of the ship and for service rendered and expense incurred in its operation and maintenance, all of which undertakings are characteristically within the admiralty jurisdiction. Compare New Jersey Steam Navigation Co. v. Merchants' Bank of Boston, 6 How. 344, 392; The Thomas Jefferson, 10 Wheat. 428, 429; The Eddy, 5 Wall. 481, 494; The General Smith, 4 Wheat. 438; James Shewan & Sons, Inc., v. \n\n[284 U.S. 352, 359]\n\u00a0\n United States, \n266 \nU.S. 108\n, 45 S. Ct. 45; The Arlyn Nelson (D. C.) 243 F. 415; 3 Benedict, Admiralty (5th Ed.) 82-96.\n Petitioner also asserts that the present cause of action is not maintainable under the Suits in Admiralty Act because it does not appear that it arose out of the operation of the ships as merchant vessels. The government argues that it is inferable from certain allegations in the petition, read in the light of the requisition charter, that the vessels were so used, but we do not stop to consider the argument. The burden rested upon petitioner to allege and prove a cause of action within the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims. Johnson v. United States, \n160 \nU.S. 546, 552\n, 553 S., 16 S. Ct. 377; Merritt v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 338\n, 45 S. Ct. 278; Contzen v. United States, \n179 \nU.S. 191, 192\n, 21 S. Ct. 98. As the suit is against the United States upon a maritime cause of action growing out of the operation of ships for the government, the Court of Claims is without jurisdiction if the vessels in question were operated as merchant vessels, and, as the petition does not allege that they were otherwise operated, it fails to state a cause of action within the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims. As the want of jurisdiction is of the subject-matter, it may be considered and appropriate judgment given at any stage of the proceedings, either here or below. Hilton v. Dickinson, \n108 \nU.S. 165, 168\n, 2 S. Ct. 424; Gainesville v. Brown-Crummer Co., \n277 \nU.S. 54, 59\n, 48 S. Ct. 454; See Grace v. American Central Insurance Co., \n109 \nU.S. 278, 283\n, 284 S., 3 S. C. 207; Bors. v. Preston, \n111 \nU.S. 252, 255\n, 4 S. Ct. 407.\n Section 2 of the Merchant Marine Act of June 5, 1920, c. 250, 41 Stat. 988, 989 (46 USCA  862), did not, as petitioner contends, restore to the Court of Claims the jurisdiction previously withdrawn from it by the Suits in Admiralty Act. It repealed the Emergency Shipping Fund provisions of the Act of June 15, 1917, imposed upon the Shipping Board the duty of carrying out all contracts lawfully entered into under the repealed act, and of settling 'all matters aris- \n\n[284 U.S. 352, 360]\n\u00a0\n ing out of or incident to the exercise by or through the President of any of the powers or duties conferred or imposed upon the President.' It preserved to every suitor 'the same right to sue the United States as he would have had if the decision had been made by the President of the United States under the Acts hereby repealed.' Assuming, without deciding, that the present claim is one which the Board was authorized to settle, we think it clear that the act did not purport to enlarge existing remedies or establish a new procedure for the enforcement of maritime obligations which, like the present, are embraced within the Suits in Admiralty Act.\n We have considered, but find it unnecessary to discuss, other less substantial grounds advanced for denying the applicability of the Suits in Admiralty Act. The judgment will be affirmed, but without prejudice to an application by the petitioner to the court below, if so advised, for leave to amend the petition.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","97":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMATTHEWS v.

Smith, of Clarksdale, Miss., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal, sections 238, 266 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  345, 380), from a decree of a District Court of three judges, for the Northern District of Mississippi, enjoining the collection from the several appellees of a state tax, as an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce. After argument here on \n\n[284 U.S. 521, 523]\n\u00a0\n the merits, the cause was restored to the docket 'for reargument, limited to the question of the jurisdiction of the District Court both with respect to the amount involved in the suit and the jurisdiction of the court as a court of equity'; reargument has been had accordingly.\n The bill of complaint assails the constitutionality of section 56, c. 88, 1930 Laws of Mississippi, as applied to appellees. The section imposes an annual license or 'privilege' tax of $100, payable in advance by 'every individual ... engaged in the business of buying or selling cotton for himself.' It also requires employers engaged in the business of buying or selling cotton to pay a similar 'tax of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for every employee engaged in their business as buyer or seller.' Penalties are imposed in double the amount of the tax for its nonpayment. Section 225. Failure to make application for the license, or engaging in the business without having procured the license or paid the tax, are misdemeanors, punishable by fine not exceeding $500 or imprisonment not exceeding six months, or both. Section 242.\n The bill, which is in the form of a class bill, filed by the numerous appellees for the benefit of themselves and others similarly situated, alleges that they are engaged in interstate and foreign commerce, in the course of which they purchase cotton within the state and sell and ship it in interstate or foreign commerce to purchasers outside the state; that the business of each of the several appellees and the right to conduct it is of a value of more than $3,000, the jurisdictional amount for suits brought in a District Court of the United States; that the tax imposed by the state statute is, as to them, an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce, and that appellants, state officers, charged with the duty of collecting the tax, thereaten to enforce its collection by criminal proceedings and the imposition of penalties. The bill states that resort to equity to prevent collection of the tax is either \n\n[284 U.S. 521, 524]\n\u00a0\n necessary or authorized for the following, among other, reasons:\n\n\n (1)\n That the enforcement of the unconstitutional statute would irreparably injure or destroy the business of each of the appellees.\n\n\n (2)\n That the taxes, if paid, cannot be recovered by any action or proceeding at law.\n\n\n (3)\n That section 304 of Hemingway's Annotated Mississippi Code of 1927 has conferred on the appellees the right to proceed in equity in the state courts to enjoin the collection of an unconstitutional tax, and that that remedy is available in the federal District Court.\n\n\n (4)\n That resort to equity is necessary in order to avoid a multiplicity of separate suits by the appellees and others similarly situated, three hundred in all, to enjoin collection of the tax, or otherwise necessary in order to recover it if paid or to prevent successive prosecutions for the violation of the act, in all of which suits or proceedings the issue of the constitutionality of the tax would be substantially the same.\n The right of appellees, if any, to maintain the present suit, is conferred by section 24(1) of the Judicial Code, 28 U. S. C.  41(1), 28 USCA  41(1), which, regardless of the citizenship of the parties to the suit, vests in District Courts of the United States jurisdiction over suits at law or in equity arising 'under States,' where the matter in controversy exceeds States,' where the mater in controversy exceeds $3,000. Although the present suit arises under the Constitution of the United States, see Davis v. Wallace, \n257 \nU.S. 478\n, 42 S. Ct. 164, and it be assumed, without deciding, that the jurisdictional amount is involved, it cannot be maintained if not within the equity jurisdiction of the District Court. The want of equity jurisdiction, if obvious, may and should be objected to by the court of its own motion. In other cases, this jurisdictional requirement, unlike the others men- \n\n[284 U.S. 521, 525]\n\u00a0\n tioned, may be treated as waived if the objection is not presented by the defendant in limine. Duignan v. United States, \n274 \nU.S. 195, 199\n, 47 S. Ct. 566; Singer Sewing Machine Co. v. Benedict, \n229 \nU.S. 481, 484\n, 33 S. Ct. 942; Thompson v. Central Ohio R. Co., 6 Wall. 134; compare Matson Navigation Co. v. United States ( January 4, 1932) \n284 \nU.S. 352\n, 52 S. Ct. 162; Hilton v. Dickinson, \n108 \nU.S. 165, 168\n, 2 S. Ct. 424; Grace v. American Central Insurance Co., \n109 \nU.S. 278, 283\n, 284 S., 3 S. Ct. 207; Bors v. Preston, \n111 \nU.S. 252, 255\n, 4 S. Ct. 407. Here, the objection to the equity jurisdiction of the District Court was properly raised by appellants' motion to dismiss the bill, and is preserved by their assignments of error in this Court.\n Section 16 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 82, perpetuated without material change as Rev. Stat.  723, Jud. Code  267 (28 U. S. C.  384, 28 USCA  384), declares that suits in equity shall not be sustained in the courts of the United States 'in any case where a plain, adequate, and complete remedy may be had at law.' The effect of this section, which was but declaratory of the rule in equity, established long before its adoption, is to emphasize the rule and to forbid in terms recourse to the extraordinary remedies of equity where the right asserted may be fully protected at law. See Deweese v. Reinhard, \n165 \nU.S. 386, 389\n, 17 S. Ct. 340; New York Guaranty Co. v. Memphis Water Co., \n107 \nU.S. 205, 214\n, 2 S. Ct. 279.\n The reason for this guiding principle is of peculiar force in cases where the suit, like the present one, is brought to enjoin the collection of a state tax in courts of a different, though paramount, sovereignty. The scrupulous regard for the rightful independence of state governments which should at all times actuate the federal courts, and a proper reluctance to interfere by injunction with their fiscal operations, require that such relief should be denied in every case where the asserted federal right may be preserved without it. Whenever the question has been presented, this Court has uniformly held that the mere illegality or \n\n[284 U.S. 521, 526]\n\u00a0\n unconstitutionality of a state or municipal tax is not in itself a ground for equitable relief in the courts of the United States. If the remedy at law is plain, adequate, and complete, the aggrieved party is left to that remedy in the state courts, from which the cause may be brought to this Court for review if any federal question be involved, Jud. Code  237 (28 USCA  344), or to his suit at law in the federal courts if the essential elements of federal jurisdiction are present. See Boise Artesian Hot & Cold Water Co. v. Boise City, \n213 \nU.S. 276\n, 29 S. Ct. 426; Shelton v. Platt, \n139 \nU.S. 591\n, 11 S. Ct. 646; Dows v. Chicago, 11 Wall. 108, 110, 112.\n It may be assumed that, if appellees do not pay the challenged tax, and in consequence of that omission they are subjected, as it is alleged they will be, to the civil and criminal penalties for nonpayment, the resulting injury to their business will be irreparable, and can be avoided only by resort to equity to prevent the threatened wrong. But appellants insist that the appellees are under no such constraint, either to expose themselves to the penalties for failure to pay the tax or to seek equitable relief against its collection, since each of them may pay the tax to the collecting officer under protest, and, under the laws of Mississippi, may maintain a suit at law for its recovery on the ground that it was exacted in violation of the Constitution of the United States. That such a procedure saves to the taxpayer his federal right, and, if available, will defeat the jurisdiction of federal courts to enjoin the collection of the tax, has long been the settled rule in this Court. Henrietta Mills v. Rutherford County, North Carolina, \n281 \nU.S. 121\n, 50 S. Ct. 270; Arkansas Building & Loan Association v. Madden, \n175 \nU.S. 269\n, 20 S. Ct. 119; Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. v. O'Connor, \n223 \nU.S. 280\n, 32 S. Ct. 216, Ann., Cas. 1913C, 1050; Shelton v. Platt, supra; Singer Sewing Machine Co. v. Benedict, supra; Allen v. Pullman's Palace Car Co., \n139 \nU.S. 658\n, 11 S. Ct. 682; Indiana Manufacturing Co. v. Koehne, \n188 \nU.S. 681\n, 23 S. Ct. 452.\n From an examination of the decisions of the highest court of the state, we conclude, as the Attorney General \n\n[284 U.S. 521, 527]\n\u00a0\n of the State insists, that that procedure is open to the appellees in Mississippi, if the tax is paid under protest, to avoid penalties or criminal proceedings. In Coulson v. Harris, 43 Miss. 728, the Supreme Court of Mississippi denied the jurisdiction of equity to enjoin the collection of an illegally assessed tax on the sole ground that the taxpayer might pay the tax to the collecting officer and sue at law for its recovery. In Tuttle v. Everett, 51 Miss. 27, 24 Am. Rep. 622, recovery was allowed of a tax thus paid, in a suit at law brought against the collector before he had paid over the tax to the proper treasury. In City of Vicksburg v. Butler, 56 Miss. 72, and Pearl River County v. Lacey Lumber Co., 124 Miss. 85, 86 So. 755, suits at law for recovery of a tax, were maintained against the city, in the first case, and the county, in the second, to which the collector had paid the taxes. But in the former the court was at pains to point out, at pages 75, 76 of 56 Miss.:\n'Some of the cases refer to a notice to the collector that suit will be brought to recover the money back. That notice is necessary, if the payer intends to sue the collector. After its receipt, if he pays it over to the proper treasury, he does so at his risk, and does not relieve himself from responsibility. If, however, he pays over the money without such notice, suit can only be brought against his principal,-in this case, the City of Vicksburg.'\n\n In Pearl River County v. Lacey Lumber Co., supra, the court said at page 109 of 124 Miss., 86 So. 755, 757:\n'We do not think that the county can shield itself from repayment of money collected under an unconstitutional law, paid under protest on the ground that the county had disbursed the money so collected into various taxing districts, or has expended the money which it wrongfully collected. The fact that the county might not be able to recover from the taxing districts the amount of money paid to such districts would not exempt it from liability to the taxpayer from whom it wrongfully collected it.' \n\n[284 U.S. 521, 528]\n\u00a0\n Such a suit, although against the collecting officer rather than the state or municipality, affords an adequate legal remedy, in the absence of allegations in the bill, which are wanting here, of special circumstances showing inability of the taxpayer to pay the tax or of the collecting officer to respond to the judgment. See Arkansas Building & Loan Association v. Madden, supra, \n175 \nU.S. 274\n, 20 S. Ct. 119; Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. v. O'Connor, supra, \n223 \nU.S. 285\n, 32 S. Ct. 216, Ann. Cas. 1913C, 1050; Singer Sewing Machine Co. v. Benedict, supra, \n229 \nU.S. 487\n, 33 S. Ct. 942; and is the rule in Mississippi: Coulson v. Harris, supra, 43 Miss. 752; Richardson v. Scott, 47 Miss. 236.\n\n Collection of the money by the collector in the name of the state, if wrongful, would not protect him. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. v. O'Connor, supra. The statutes, sections 3289, 3290, Mississippi Code of 1930, which require payment over by the collector of taxes to the appropriate treasury, allow the penalties for nonpayment to be remitted on certificated of the Governor or Attorney General, if 'they are satisfied that the delay has not been wilful or avoidable by the collector,' and section 3278 makes provision for the repayment to any sheriff or tax collector of taxes, 'by mistake or oversight, erroneously paid' to the state treasurer. See Taylor v. Guy, 119 Miss. 357, 80 So. 786. These provisions would seem to contemplate suits against the collector for the recovery of the tax and to afford him some protection in the event of a judgment against him. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. v. O'Connor, supra, \n223 \nU.S. 287\n, 32 S. Ct. 216, Ann. Cas. 1913C, 1050. But, as no facts are presented to show that the suit against the collector in the present case will not be adequate, it is unnecessary to consider their precise scope and effect.\n The suit in equity to enjoin an illegal tax, authorized by section 304 of Hemingway's Code for 1927 (section 420, Mississippi Code of 1930), appears not to be available when there is any other adequate remedy. See Anderson v. Ingersoll, 62 Miss. 73; Noxubee County Board of Supervisors v. Ames (Miss.) \n\n[284 U.S. 521, 529]\n\u00a0\n 3 So. 37. In any case, the section cannot affect the jurisdiction of federal courts of equity. The equity jurisdiction conferred on inferior courts of the United States by section 11 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 78, and continued by section 24 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  41), is that of the English court of chancery at the time of the separation of the two countries. Payne v. Hook, 7 Wall. 425, 430; In re Sawyer, \n124 \nU.S. 200, 209\n, 210 S., 8 S. Ct. 482. While local statutes may create new rights, for the protection of which recourse may be had to the remedies afforded by federal courts of equity, if the remedy at law is inadequate and the other jurisdictional requirements are present, state legislation cannot enlarge their jurisdiction by the creation of new equitable remedies, nor can it avoid or dispense with the prohibition against the maintenance of any suit in equity in the federal courts, where the legal remedy is adequate. Henrietta Mills v. Rutherford County, North Carolina, supra, \n281 \nU.S. 127, 128\n, 50 S. Ct. 270; Pusey & Jones Co. v. Hanssen, \n261 \nU.S. 491, 500\n, 43 S. Ct. 454.\n Appellees' bill of complaint does not state a case within the jurisdiction of equity to avoid multiplicity of suits. As to each appellee a single suit at law brought to recover the tax will determine its constitutionality, and no facts are alleged showing that more than one suit will be necessary for that purpose. See Boise Artesian Hot & Cold Water Co. v. Boise City, \n213 \nU.S. 276, 285\n, 286 S., 29 S. Ct. 426; Dalton Adding Machine Co. v. State Corporation Commission, \n236 \nU.S. 698, 700\n, 701 S., 35 S. Ct. 480.\n But it is said that, since each appellee must pay the tax to avoid penalties and criminal prosecution, all must maintain suits for the recovery of the tax unconstitutionally exacted, in order to protect their federal rights, and that, to avoid the necessity of the many suits, equity may draw to itself the determination of the issue necessarily involved in all the suits at law.\n In general, the jurisdiction of equity to avoid multiplicity of suits at law is restricted to cases where there would otherwise be some necessity for the maintenance of \n\n[284 U.S. 521, 530]\n\u00a0\n numerous suits between the same parties, involving the same issues of law or fact. It does not extend to cases where there are numerous parties plaintiff or defendant, and the issues between them and the adverse party are not necessarily identical. St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern Ry. Co. v. McKnight, \n244 \nU.S. 368, 375\n, 37 S. Ct. 611; Kelley v. Gill, \n245 \nU.S. 116, 120\n, 38 S. Ct. 38; Francis v. Flinn, \n118 \nU.S. 385\n, 6 S. Ct. 1148; Scott v. Donald, \n165 \nU.S. 107, 115\n, 17 S. Ct. 262; Hale v. Allinson, \n188 U.S. 56\n, 77 et seq., 23 S. Ct. 244; and see Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence (4th Ed. 1918),  251, 251 1\/2, 255, 259, 268.\n While the present bill sets up that the single issue of constitutionality of the taxing statute is involved, the alleged unconstitutionality depends upon the application of the statute to each of the appellees, and its effect upon his business, which is alleged to be interstate commerce. The bill thus tenders separate issues of law and fact as to each appellee, the nature of his business, and the manner and extent to which the tax imposes a burden on interstate commerce. The determination of these issues as to any one taxpayer would not determine them as to any other. There was thus a failure of such identity of parties and issues as would support the jurisdiction in equity.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","98":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMCCORMICK & CO. v. BROWN(1932)\nNo. 599\nArgued: April 22, 1932Decided: May 16, 1932\n\n\n\n\n\n[286 U.S. 131, 133]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Philip C. Friese, of Baltimore, Md., and H. D. Rummel, of Charleston, W. Va., for appellants.\n Messrs. W. G. Brown, of Summersville, W. Va., and R. Dennis Steed, of Charleston, W. Va., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought by nonresident manufacturers and wholesale dealers to restrain state officers of West Virginia, from requiring the complainants to obtain permits from the state commissioner of phohibition, and to pay an annual license fee of $50, before shipping certain products into the state to purchasers there for resale.\n The bill alleged that, while these products contained ethyl alcohol, they were used and usable solely for medicinal, mechanical, toilet, and culinary purposes, and were not intoxicating liquors or fit for beverage purposes within the meaning of the laws of the United States; that the products were covered by permits issued to the complainants respectively under the National Prohibition Act (27 USCA); and that the shipment and sales in question were to dealers in West Virginia holding state permits. The bill charged that the requirements of the state officers, purporting to act under state legislation, constituted an interference with interstate commerce in violation of the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution, and that the complaints were without remedy at law. In their answer, defendants (appellees) denied that the products in question were used and usable solely for the purposes \n\n[286 U.S. 131, 134]\n\u00a0\n alleged, and that none of the products were 'intoxicating liquors' or that they were nonintoxicating in fact; and, while admitting that the complainants held permits under the National Prohibition Act, defendants asserted the validity of the state laws and regulations by which state permits and the payment of the license fee were required.\n The District Court, composed of three judges (Judicial Code,  266, 28 U. S. C.  380 (28 USCA  380)), heard and denied, upon the pleadings and affidavits, an application for an interlocutory injunction. Upon final hearing no further evidence was introduced, and from the final decree, dismissing the bill, this appeal has been taken.\n The Constitution of West Virginia (Art. 6,  46) prohibits 'the manufacture, sale and keeping for sale of malt, vinous or spirituous liquors, wine, porter, ale, beer or any intoxicating drink, mixture or preparation of like nature,' except 'such liquors for medicinal, pharmaceutical, mechanical, sacramental and scientific purposes' and 'denatured alcohol for industrial purposes,' dealings in which are permitted under legislative regulations. The Legislature was directed to enact such laws as might be necessary to carry these provisions into effect.\n The legislative act now in force is chapter 60 of the West Virginia Official Code (1931). The definition of 'liquors' in section 1 of article 1 embraces 'all liquids, mixtures or preparations, whether patented or not, which will produce intoxication.' \n1\n By section 4, sell- \n\n[286 U.S. 131, 135]\n\u00a0\n ing or soliciting or receiving orders for 'any liquors' is penalized, 'except as hereinafter provided'; and, 'in case of a sale in which a shipment or delivery of such liquors is made by a common or other carrier,' the sale is deemed to be made in the county of delivery. \n2\n Exceptions, found in section 53, include sales of wine for sacra- \n\n[286 U.S. 131, 136]\n\u00a0\n mental purposes or of 'any United States pharmacopoeia or national formulary preparation in conformity with the West Virginia pharmacy law, or any preparation which is exempted by the provisions of the national pure food law,' and this section contains a proviso that no one 'shall manufacture, sell, keep for sale, purchase or transport any liquors, as defined in section one of this article and as herein excepted, without first obtaining a permit from the commissioner of prohibition so to do.' Permits are to be issued for the calendar year, and fees for each permit are prescribed, being $50 in the case of manufacturers and wholesale dealers, $10 in the case of purchasers in wholesale quantities of ethyl alcohol, whether pure, medicated, or denatured, for use as provided, and $ 2 in the case of purchasers, except licensed druggists, in wholesale quantities of liquors, as defined in section 1, for sale at retail. By section 9, common carriers are forbidden to carry into the state, or within the state, intoxicating liquors, except 'pure grain alcohol and wine, and such preparations as may be sold by druggists for the special purposes and in the manner as set forth in section five.' \n4\n Section 11 makes it unlawful \n\n[286 U.S. 131, 137]\n\u00a0\n for nonresident dealers to sell to persons within the state intoxicating liquors or any of the preparations described, when they 'are intended by any person interested therein to be received, possessed, sold, or in any manner used, either in use original package or otherwise, in violation of the prohibition laws of this State'; and, in case of shipment or delivery by a carrier, the county in which the delivery is made is to be taken as the place of sale. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n Section 3 of article 2 of chapter 60 provides that the manufacture and sale of 'liquors' by wholesale druggists and other dealers shall be under the supervision of the commissioner of prohibition and governed by the regulations he may from time to time prescribe. The commissioner's regulations place nonresident manufacturers in the category of 'wholesale dealers' and define the business of such dealers as 'that of selling at wholesale ethyl alcohol in any form ... and wine as permitted and supervised by the Federal Government; or selling ... any liquid, mixture, or preparation ... which will produce intoxication, or coming within the definition of \n\n[286 U.S. 131, 138]\n\u00a0\n 'liquors' in section one' of the statute. These dealers, it is provided, upon obtaining a permit from the state commissioner, may sell such liquors at wholesale for medicinal, pharmaceutical, scientific and mechanical purposes to persons holding permits to purchase. The regulations also classify alcoholic preparations, as those regarded as beverages, the sale of which is forbidden, and those which comprise articles having a recognized legitimate use and which can be sold under permits, the latter including a large variety of preparations with a described alcoholic content, such as proprietary medicines, tonics, cordials, elixirs, lotions, extracts, and flavors, and various compounds bearing trade-names.\n Complainants' products fall within these regulations. They contain ethyl alcohol, ranging, according to the allegation of the bill as to the foodstuffs and toilet articles of one of the complainants, 'from four per cent to ninety per cent ethyl alcohol by volume.' There is no charge that applications by complainants for permits have been denied. On the contrary, the bill of complaint alleged that complainants have either procured the required permits from the state commissioner, on the payment of the prescribed fee, or 'have refused to procure such permits and refrained from shipping said products into said State.' The question is simply one of the authority of the state officers to demand that state permits be obtained.\n The District Court found that the products in question are 'liquors' within the meaning of the state statute, and we see no ground for a contrary conclusion. State v. Muncey, 28 W. Va. 494; State v. Good, 56 W. Va. 215, 49 S. E. 121; State v. Durr, 69 W. Va. 251, 71 S. E. 767, 46 L. R. A. (N. S.) 764; State v. Henry, 74 W. Va. 72, 81 S. E. 569, 4 A. L. R. 1132. Nor do we think that the regulations of the commissioner go beyond the authority which the statute confers. No state decision to that effect has been cited, and examination of the statutory provisions we have quoted gives no support to \n\n[286 U.S. 131, 139]\n\u00a0\n the contention that the commissioner has misconceived his duty. On the application for injunction the complainants presented affidavits to show that their products, as required by federal law and regulations, were unfit for beverage purposes, and that consumption of them as a beverage 'would involve serious gastric irritations or disorders, or nausea, and, in some cases, if persisted in, serious illness,' and that the products were sold strictly 'for medicinal, toilet, and culinary purposes.' Defendants denied the unfitness for beverage use, and, in support, submitted an affidavit of the chemist who had been employed by the state department to examine preparations covered by the commissioner's regulations, including products of this sort submitted by one of the complainants on its application for a state permit. This witness testified that these various preparations, falling within the above-mentioned classes of the regulations, are such as 'will produce intoxication and drunkenness,' and he based this statement on the 'alcoholic content, the potability and the physiological effect of the final product, and upon his actual experience and observation that said preparations are intoxicating in fact.'\n We may lay the controversy of fact on one side, so far as it relates to the particular products of complainants, as the question is not merely that of the normal uses and purposes of these preparations which have alcoholic content and come within the state law, but whether, in view of that content and of possible abuses, the state has the power to put the sale of such products under the prescribed administrative supervision. There is no basis for objection because of any arbitrariness in the state's requirements as they are appropriately directed to the enforcement of its prohibitory legislation. Purity Extract Company v. Lynch, \n226 \nU.S. 192, 204\n, 33 S. Ct. 44; Eberle v. Michigan, \n232 \nU.S. 700, 706\n, 34 S. Ct. 464; Vigliotti v. Pennsylvania, \n258 \nU.S. 403, 407\n, 42 S. Ct. 330. The question before us is thus the narrower one \n\n[286 U.S. 131, 140]\n\u00a0\n whether the state's authority extends to the complainants' transactions in the light of their interstate character and of the federal legislation asserted to be applicable.\n Prior to the adoption of the Eighteenth Amendment, the Congress, exerting its constitutional power of regulation, had prohibited the movement in interstate commerce into any state of intoxicating liquors for purposes prohibited by the state law. The Webb-Kenyon Act6 (March 1, 1913, c. 90, 37 Stat. 699, U. S. C. tit. 27,  122 (27 USCA  122)). See, also, the Wilson Act (Aug. 8, 1890, c. 728, 26 Stat. 313, U. S. C. tit. 27,  121 (27 USCA  121)) and the Reed Amendment (March 3, 1917, c. 162,  5, 39 Stat. 1069, U.S.C. tit. 27,  123 (27 USCA  123)). With direct application to the prohibition law of West Virginia (the predecessor of the present statute and having a similar definition of 'liquors,' West Virginia Laws, 1913, c. 13), this Court held that the purpose of the Webb- Kenyon Act 'was to prevent the immunity characteristic of interstate commerce from being used to permit the receipt of liquor through such commerce in states contrary to their laws, and thus in effect afford a means by subterfuge and indirection to set such laws at \n\n[286 U.S. 131, 141]\n\u00a0\n naught.' The act was said to operate 'so as to cause the prohibitions of the West Virginia law against shipment, receipt, and possession to be applicable and controlling.' Clark Distilling Company v. Western Maryland Railway Co., \n242 \nU.S. 311, 324\n, 37 S. Ct. 180, 184, L. R. A. 1917B, 1218, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 845. See, also, Seaboard Air Line Railway v. North Carolina, \n245 \nU.S. 298, 303\n, 304 S., 38 S. Ct. 96; United States v. Hill, \n248 \nU.S. 420, 424\n, 425 S., 39 S. Ct. 143; Williams v. United States, \n255 \nU.S. 336\n, 41 S. Ct. 364; Rainier Company v. Great Northern Company, \n259 \nU.S. 150, 152\n, 42 S. Ct. 436. The appellants do not urge, and there would be no ground for such a contention, that either the Eighteenth Amendment or the National Prohibition Act had the effect of repealing the Webb-Kenyon Act. The Congress has not expressly repealed that act, and there is no basis for an implication of repeal. The Eighteenth Amendment and the National Prohibition Act have not superseded state prohibitory laws which do not authorize or sanction what the constitutional amendment prohibits. Vigliotti v. Pennsylvania, supra. Such laws derive their force, not from that amendment, but from power originally belonging to the states and preserved to them by the Tenth Amendment. United States v.

As the prohibitory legislation of the states may thus continue to have effective operation, there is no reason for denying to the Webb-Kenyon Act its intended application to prevent the immunity of transactions in interstate commerce from being used to impede the enforcement of the states' valid prohibitions.\n The appellants contend, however, that the products in question are not 'intoxicating liquors' within the meaning of the Webb-Kenyon Act. They insist that this term, as used in that act, must be defined in the light of the terms of the subsequent National Prohibition Act. They refer to the exemptions in the later act with respect to such articles as medicinal and toilet preparations, pro- \n\n[286 U.S. 131, 142]\n\u00a0\n prietary medicines, and flavoring extracts, when manufactured and prepared for the market under required permits. U. S. C. tit. 27,  13 (27 USCA  13). But these provisions were not in contemplation at the time of the passage of in Webb-Kenyon Act and cannot operate to restrict the natural significance of the terms of that act as they were adopted by the Congress and have been left unrepealed. That act did not attempt to establish a definition of intoxicating liquors. It expressly referred to the prohibitory laws of the states, the enforcement of which in was intended to aid. The Congress undoubtedly recognized, as this court had decided, that the state could prohibit the sale of liquor absolutely or conditionally. It could prohibt sale as a beverage and permit sale for medicinal and like purposes. It could prohibit sale by merchants and permit it by licensed druggists. Eberle v. Michigan, supra; Kidd v. Pearson, \n128 \nU.S. 1, 19\n, 9 S. Ct. 6; Rippey v. Texas, \n193 \nU.S. 504, 509\n, 24 S. Ct. 516; Crane v. Campbell, \n245 \nU.S. 304, 307\n, 38 S. Ct. 98; Vigliotti v. Pennsylvania, supra. If preparations by reason of their alcoholic content would be intoxicating, and could be used for beverage purposes, unless so treated as to render them unfit for such purposes, the states were clearly at liberty to insist, within the range of their authority, upon being satisfied that such preparations had been so treated and to establish administrative control to that end. Seaboard Air Line Railway v. North Carolina, supra. When the definition of intoxicating liquors, as set forth in state legislation and as applied to such preparations, is not an arbitrary one-and it cannot be regarded as arbitrary in the instant case-the Webb-Kenyon Act must be taken as referring to the liquors which the state legislation describes, or the plain purpose of the act would be frustrated. The same reasons which lead to the conclusion that the Webb-Kenyon Act was not repealed by the National Prohibition Act compel the view that the \n\n[286 U.S. 131, 143]\n\u00a0\n scope of the application of the former was in no way limited by the latter.\n The appellants make the further point that the Webb-Kenyon Act applies only where there is an intent to violate the laws of the state into which the shipment is made. The act prohibits the shipment or transportation of intoxicating liquor into a state when it 'is intended, by any person interested therein, to be received, possessed, sold, or in any manner used ... in violation of any law of such State.' The argument is that no intent to violate the laws of West Virginia can be imputed to the appellants. It is said that they ship their products only to licensed dealers in West Virginia, that is, to those who are authorized by the state commissioner of prohibition 'to receive, store, and sell the same.' The short answer is that the state law does not make the permits issued to local dealers a substitute for the permits required of wholesale dealers. If the provisions of the state law, and the regulations under it, which expressly require state permits for sales by wholesale dealers of the products in question, are valid, it necessarily follows that sales by appellants of these products without such permits would be in violation of the state law within the meaning of the Webb-Kenyon Act. The appellants in making the sales are obviously interested persons, and the shipment of their products into the state for the purpose of their consummating their sales without the described permits would fall directly within the terms of the act.\n In determining the ultimate question of the validity, not simply of the state's prohibitory legislation in its general features, but, in particular, of its requirement of permits as to products for which federal permits have been issued, we need not only refer to the criterion established by the decisions of this Court. While state legislation cannot give validity to acts prohibited by the Eighteenth \n\n[286 U.S. 131, 144]\n\u00a0\n Amendment, that legislation may provide additional instruments to make prohibition effective. That the state may adopt appropriate means to that end was expressly provided in section 2 of the Amendment in declaring that 'the Congress and the several states shall have concurrent power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.' National Prohibition Cases, \n253 \nU.S. 350, 387\n, 40 S. Ct. 486, 488, 588. Vigliotti v. Pennsylvania, supra. The Court said in United States v. Lanza, supra: 'In effect the second section of the Eighteenth Amendment put an end to restrictions upon the state's power arising out of the federal Constitution and left her free to enact prohibition laws applying to all transactions within her limits. To be sure, the first section of the amendment took from the states all power to authorize acts falling within its prohibition, but it did not cut down or displace prior state laws not inconsistent with it. ... We have here two sovereignties, deriving power from different sources, capable of dealing with the same subject-matter within the same territcry. Each may, without interference by the other, enact laws to secure prohibition, with the limitation that no legislation can give validity to acts prohibited by the amendment. Each government in determining what shall be an offense against its peace and dignity is exercising its own sovereignty, not that of the other.' See, also, Hebert v. Louisiana, supra. The mere fact that a state statute has broader scope than a provision of the National Prohibition Act upon the same subject does not affect its validity. Van Oster v. Kansas, supra. Different and higher penalties may be provided by the state law. Edwards v. Georgia, 150 Ga. 754, 105 S. E. 363, affirmed \n258 \nU.S. 613\n, 42 S. Ct. 462; Chandler v. Texas, 89 Tex. Cr.

Ct. 231. In Idaho v. Moore, 36 Idaho, 565, 212 P. 349, affirmed \n264 \nU.S. 569\n, 44 S. Ct. 333. Moore was convicted of having intoxicating liquor in his private dwelling in violation of the state law, notwithstanding the stipulation that his possession was 'permitted by and lawful under the provisions of section 33 of the National Prohibition Act.' U. S. C. tit. 27,  50 (27 USCA  50). See, also, North Carolina v. Campbell, 182 N. C. 911, 110 S. E. 86, affirmed \n262 \nU.S. 728\n, 43 S. Ct. 519; Barnes v. New York, \n266 \nU.S. 581\n, 45 S. Ct. 89; Colonial Drug & Sales Co. v. Western Products Co. (C. C. A.) 54 F.( 2d) 216.\n Applying the principle thus repeatedly declared, we are of the opinion that the provisions of the National Prohibition Act relating to the issue of permits did not supersede the authority of West Virginia to require state permits, as in the instant case, in the appropriate enforcement of its valid legislation.\n Decree affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] ' 1.

STANDARD NUT MARGARINE CO. OF FLORIDA(1932)\nNo. 251\nArgued: January 6, 1932Decided: February 15, 1932\n\n\n\n The Attorney General and Mr. Whitney North Seymour, of Washington, D. C., for petitioners.\n\n\n[284 U.S. 498, 502]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George N. Murdock, of Chicago, Ill., and E. T. McIlvaine, of Miami, Fla., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court. \n No. 251.\n\n Respondent, a manufacturer of 'Southern Nut Product,' brought this suit in the Southern district of Florida to restrain petitioner from collecting from respondent, or from dealers selling its product, any tax purporting to be levied under the Oleomargarine Act of August 2, 1886, 24 Stat. 209, as amended by the Act of May 9, 1902, 32 Stat. 194. Petitioner answered denying the essential allegations of the complaint. Respondent applied for a temporary injunction; the court found that it would suffer irreparable injury unless petitioner be restrained pending the final disposition of the case, and granted the application. At the trial, respondent introduced oral and \n\n[284 U.S. 498, 503]\n\u00a0\n documentary evidence, together with specimens of the product sought to be taxed. The court found that the material allegations of the complaint were established by the evidence, and granted permanent injunction. The record states in condensed form the substance of the testimony, but does not contain the documents which were made exhibits and introduced in evidence. The Circuit Court of Appeals found, and it appears from the testimony brought up, that omitted exhibits constitute a material part of the evidence received, and that the record is consistent with the trial court's conclusion in respect of the facts; it held Rev. St.  3224 (26 USCA  154), does not apply and affirmed the decree. 49 F. (2d) 79; Id., 49 F.(2d) 85.\n That section declares (26 U. S. Code,  154 (26 USCA  154)): 'No suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court.' This suit was commenced December 26, 1929. The complaint, the evidence contained in the record, and documents of which judicial notice may be taken show the following facts:\n In April, 1928, respondent commenced and thereafter carried on at Jacksonville, Fla., the manufacture and sale of Southern Nut Product. It contained no animal fat, but was made exclusively of cocoanut oil, peanut oil, salt, water, and harmless coloring matter; it was sold in one pound cartons for cooking, baking, and seasoning. Respondent built up a valuable business in the sale of the product to dealers in Florida and other states.\n In January, 1922, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue issued to the Higgins Manufacturing Company a permit to manufacture and sell 'Nut-Z-All' without paying the oleomargine tax thereon. He revoked the permit in December of the same year, and purported to assess such a tax upon some of that product. The company, having paid it under protest to the collector in Rhode Island, brought an action against him in the \n\n[284 U.S. 498, 504]\n\u00a0\n United States district court for that state to recover the amount so exacted. After hearing evidence, including the testimony of chemists in the Bureau of Internal Revenue called in behalf of the collector, the court in April, 1924, found that the product was not made in imitation or semblance of butter, was not intended to be sold as or for butter, and was not oleomargarine or taxable as such. Higgins Mfg. Co. v. Page, 297 F. 644. Thereupon the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, promulgated the court's decision as Treasury Decision 3590, thus informing all concerned that the product was not subject to the tax.\n In August, 1924, the Deputy Commissioner, in answer to an inquiry made by the Institute of Margarine Manufacturers as to the taxability of 'Nut-Z-All,' sent a letter stating: 'The court, having held the product to be not taxable as oleomargarine, the fact that retailers advertise and sell it as butter, or as a substitute for butter, would not render them or the manufacturers liable under the internal revenue law.'\n April 1, 1927, the Commissioner, contrary to the court's decree, Treasury Decision 3590, and his deputy's response to the Institute's inquiry, promulgated Treasury Decision 4006 which declared products similar to 'Nut-Z-All' taxable as oleomargarine if colored to look like butter. Then the Higgins Manufacturing company brought suit in the federal court for Rhode Island to restrain the collector from enforcing the tax on its product. The court, upon the allegations of the complaint admitted by motion to dismiss, found that the facts there alleged in respect of taxability were identical with those shown in the earlier case; that the collector was threatening to enforce the tax which had been adjudged illegal; that if the tax should be collected plaintiff's business would be ruined; and July 18, 1927, granted temporary injunction, Higgins Mfg. Co. v. Page (D. C.) \n\n[284 U.S. 498, 505]\n\u00a0\n 20 F.(2d) 948, which was made permanent in December following.\n In July, 1927, the Baltimore Butterine Company brought suit in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia to enjoin the Commissioner and his deputy from enforcing the tax as declared in Treasury Decision 4006 against its product 'Nu-ine' which was identical in content and appearance with 'Nut-Z-All,' made by the Higgins Manufacturing Company, and Southern Nut Product, made by respondent in this case. The court held the product not taxable, and granted a permanent injunction.\n No appeal was taken in any of the cases above mentioned. And the petitioner, by letter, answering an inquiry made by respondent, advised respondent that its product would not be taxable as oleomargarine.\n Relying on the decision in Higgins Mfg. Co. v. Page (D. C.) 297 F. 644, Treasury Decision 3590, the Deputy Commissioner's letter to the institute and the injunctions about referred to, respondent believed the product which it proposed to manufacture and sell would not be taxable as oleomargarine, and, upon receipt of petitioner's letter, commenced manufacture and sale of the product.\n In 1928, pursuant to instructions sent him by the deputy commissioner stating that respondent's product was held taxable as colored oleomargarine, the petitioner demanded and threatened to collect a tax of ten cents a pound upon respondent's product. But petitioner made no effort to collect the tax on 'Nut-Z-All,' which at the time of the trial was being sold in Florida. Excluding the tax from cost, respondent's net profit was approximately three cents per pound. The enforcement of the Oleomargarine Act against respondent would impose a tax that respondent would be unable to pay, would subject it to heavy penalties and the forfeiture of its plant, together \n\n[284 U.S. 498, 506]\n\u00a0\n with the materials and manufactured product on hand, and would destroy its business.\n The complaint asserts that the exaction of ten cents per pound, while in the guise of a tax, is really a penalty imposed to eliminate competition with butter and is therefore in excess of the power granted to the Congress by the Constitution. But, having regard to McCray v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 27, 59\n, 24 S. Ct. 769, 1 Ann. Cas. 561, we treat the imposition laid by the act upon oleomargarine as a valid excise tax. The rule that section 3224 (26 USCA  154) does not extend to suits brought to restrain collection of penalties (Lipke v. Lederer, \n259 \nU.S. 557, 562\n, 43 S. Ct. 549, Regal Drug Corp. v. Wardell, \n260 \nU.S. 386\n, 43 S. Ct. 152) does not apply.\n Petitioner does not here assign as error the finding below that respondent's product was not oleomargarine. He seeks reversal upon the grounds that the statute forbids injunction against the collection of the tax even if erroneously assessed; that this assessment was made by the Commissioner under color of his office, was not arbitrary or capricious and that, if there is any exception to the application of section 3224, this case is not within it.\n We are of opinion that, as held below and here claimed by respondent, the product in question was not taxable as oleomargarine defined by section 2 of the Act of 1886 (26 USCA  541). It is as follows: 'That for the purposes of this act certain manufactured substances, certain extracts, and certain mixtures and compounds, including such mixtures and compounds with butter, shall be known and designated as 'oleomargarine,' namely: All substances heretofore known as oleomargarine, oleo, oleomargarine oil, butterine, lardine, suine, and neutral; all mixtures and compounds of oleomargarine, oleo, olemargarine oil, butterine, lardine, suine, and neutral; all lard extracts and tallow extracts; and all mixtures and compounds of tallow, beef fat, suet, lard, lard oil, vegetable oil, annotto, and other coloring matter, \n\n[284 U.S. 498, 507]\n\u00a0\n intestinal fat, and offal fat made in imitation or semblance of butter, or ( 2) calculated or intended to be sold as butter or for butter.'\n That definition remained in force until July 10, 1931. It was amended by the Act of July 10, 1930, 46 Stat. 1022 (26 USCA  541), effective twelve months later, the material parts of which are printed in the margin. 1 The hyphen in the phrase 'vegetable-oil' was eliminated and a comma was inserted between those words and 'annotto.' Words added are shown in italics and words deleted are within brackets.\n When the act of 1886 was passed various imitations of and substitutes for butter, the principal ingredients of which were the fats of cattle and swine, were being manufactured and sold in large quantities. Products such as respondent's which contain no animal fat were unknown and were not made in substantial quantities until much later. There is nothing in the act, or that has been brought to our attention, to suggest that Congress anticipated the development of the art later to occur. Annotto had long been used to color butter and cheese and was then being used to make oleomargarine resemble butter. It is a coloring material found in association with the oil content of the covering of certain tree seeds. \n\n[284 U.S. 498, 508]\n\u00a0\n When prepared for sale and use, the colorant is contained in a stiff oily mass that was then well known in the market. The words 'vegetable-oil annotto' appropriately describe that substance. The hyphen between 'vegetable' and 'oil' and the absence of any punctuation mark following them signify that the words so compounded qualify 'annotto' and indicate that such coloring material was meant. And that construction is strongly supported by the use in the same connection of the words 'and other coloring matter.'\n Regulations promulgated under the act omit the hyphen and add a comma thus making the phrase to read 'vegetable oil, annotto.' The Commissioner's determination that respondent's product is oleomargarine necessarily was based on that version. It is elementary that tax laws are to be interpreted liberally in favor of taxpayers, and that words defining things to be taxed may not be extended beyond their clear import. Doubts must be resolved against the government and in favor of taxpayers. United States v. Merriam, \n263 U.S. 179\n, 188 44 S. Ct. 69, 29 A. L. R. 1547; Bowers v. N. Y. & Albany Co., \n273 \nU.S. 346, 350\n, 47 S. Ct. 389. The legislative history and passage of the amendatory act of 1930 show that the Cimmissioner as well as the Congress found that an enlargement of the definition was necessary in order to cover products such as respondent's. The language used in the original act was not sufficiently clear and definite to include products containing no animal fat. The Commissioner's rendition of the governing phrase was without warrant. His determination that respondent's product was oleomargarine and taxable under the act was erroneous, and, in view of his earlier interpretations and the court decision which had become final, must be held arbitrary and capricious. It was without force. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Louis. & Nash. R. R. Co., \n227 \nU.S. 88, 91\n, 33 S. Ct. 185; Kwock Jan Fat v. White, \n253 \nU.S. 454, 457\n, 464 S., 40 S. Ct. 566: United States v. Mann, 2 Brock. 9, 11, Fed. Cas. No. 15716. \n\n[284 U.S. 498, 509]\n\u00a0\n Independently of, and in cases arising prior to, the enactment of the provision (Act of March 2, 1867, 14 Stat. 475) which became Rev. St.  3224 (26 USCA  154), this court, in harmony with the rule generally followed in courts of equity, held that a suit will not lie to restrain the collection of a tax upon the sole ground of its illegality. The principal reason is that, as courts are without authority to apportion or equalize taxes or to make assessments, such suits would enable those liable for taxes in some amount to delay payment or possibly to escape their lawful burden, and so to interfere with the thwart the collection of revenues for the support of the government. And this court likewise recognizes the rule that, in cases where complainant shows that in addition to the illegality of an exaction in the guise of a tax there exist special and extraordinary circumstances sufficient to bring the case within some acknowledged head of equity jurisprudence, a suit may be maintained to enjoin the collector. Dows v. City of Chicago, 11 Wall. 108; Hannewinkle v. Georgetown, 15 Wall. 547; State Railroad Tax Cases, \n92 U.S. 575\n, 614. Section 3224 is declaratory of the principle first mentioned and is to be construed as near as may be in harmony with it and the reasons upon which it rests. Cumberland Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Kelly (C. C. A.) 160 F. 316, 321, 15 Ann. Cas. 1210; Baker v. Baker, 13 Cal. 87, 95. Bradley v. People, 8 Colo. 599, 604, 9 P. 783; 2 Sutherland (2d Lewis Ed.)  454. The section does not refer specifically to the rule applicable to cases involving exceptional circumstances. The general words employed are not sufficient, and it would require specific language undoubtedly disclosing that purpose, to warrant the inference that Congress intended to abrogate that salutary and well-established rule. This court has given effect to section 3224 in a number of cases. Snyder v. Marks, \n109 \nU.S. 189, 191\n, 3 S. Ct. 157; Dodge v. Osborn, \n240 \nU.S. 118, 121\n, 36 S. Ct. 275; Dodge v. Brady, \n240 \nU.S. 122\n, 36 S. Ct. 277. It has never held the rule to be absolute, but has repeatedly indi- \n\n[284 U.S. 498, 510]\n\u00a0\n cated that extraordinary and exceptional circumstances render its provisions inapplicable. Hill v. Wallace, \n259 \nU.S. 44, 62\n, 42 S. Ct. 453; Dodge v. Osborn, supra, page 121 of 240 U. S., 36 S. Ct. 275; Dodge v. Brady, supra. Cf. Graham v. Du Pont, \n262 \nU.S. 234, 257\n, 43 S.

Cas. 1917B, 713.\n This is not a case in which the injunction is sought upon the mere ground of illegality because of error in the amount of the tax. The article is not covered by the act. A valid oleomargarine tax could by no legal possibility have been assessed against respondent, and therefore the reasons underlying  3224 apply, if at all, with little force. LeRoy Roy v. East Saginaw Ry. Co., 18 Mich. 233, 238-239, 100 Am. Dec. 162; Kissinger v. Bean, Fed. Cas. No. 7853. Respondent commenced business after the product it proposed to make had repeatedly been determined by the Commissioner and adjudged in courts not to be oleomargarine or taxable under the act and upon the assurance from the Bureau that its product would not be taxed. For more than a year and a half respondent sold its product relying that it was not subject to tax. If required to pay the tax, its loss would be seven cents per pound. Before the Commissioner's latest ruling, respondent had made and sold so much that the tax would have amounted to more than it could pay. Petitioner acquiesced in the injunctions granted in Rhode Island and the District of Columbia and did not assess any tax upon identical products contemporaneously being made by complainants in such suits, and directed enforcement against respondent's entire product. Such discrimination conflicts with the principle underlying the constitutional provision directing that excises laid by Congress shall be uniform throughout the United States. It requires no elaboration of the facts found to show that the enforcement of the act against respondent would be arbitrary and oppressive, would destroy its business, ruin it financially, and inflict loss for which it would have no rem- \n\n[284 U.S. 498, 511]\n\u00a0\n edy at law.

The lower courts rightly held respondent entitled to the injunction.\n No. 252.\n This case was decided in the Circuit Court of Appeals at the same time as No. 251 (49 F.(2d) 79), presents the same question, and is governed by the foregoing opinion.\n Decrees affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE (dissenting).\n In my opinion, Rev.

P. & S.S.M.R. CO. v. BORUM(1932)\nNo. 585\nArgued: Decided: May 23, 1932\n\n\n\n Messrs. Henry S. Mitchell and John E. Palmer, both of Minneapolis, Minn., for petitioner.\n Mr. Ernest A. Michel, of Minneapolis, Minn., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In October, 1921, petitioner accepted respondent's application for work as a switchman, and the latter in December, 1928, was injured while employed in interstate \n\n[286 U.S. 447, 448]\n\u00a0\n transportation. He brought this action in the district court of Hennepin county to recover damages under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (45 U. S. C.  51-59 (45 USCA  51-59)) and, after issue was joined, the parties made an agreement for arbitration under a statute of Minnesota ( Gen. St. 1923,  9513-9519) pursuant to which the company paid plaintiff $ 12,500 to be retained by him in any event. And it was agreed that, if the arbitrators found for plaintiff on the merits, the award should be $12,500 in addition to the amount so paid. The arbitrators made findings of fact, and held that plaintiff's injuries were caused by defendant's negligence, and that he was entitled to recover the stipulated amount. A motion made by defendant to vacate having been denied, the district court entered judgment for plaintiff in accordance with the award and the Supreme Court affirmed. 184 Minn. 126, 238 N. W. 4.\n Defendant's contention here is that the state court erred in sustaining the finding that plaintiff was an employee within the meaning of the act as construed in Minneapolis, etc., R. Co. v. Rock, \n279 \nU.S. 410\n, 49 S. Ct. 363.\n Plaintiff made application in writing to defendant for employment as switchman. Then, and continuously thereafter while plaintiff worked for it, defendant had a rule, No. 16, promulgated to promote safety and efficiency in the operation of its railroad, which declared that no person over 45 years should be taken into the service. Another rule, No. 22, was to the effect that applications for employment in the yard service not rejected within 30 days would be considered accepted. And there was one, No. 4(A), stating that all employees who attain the age of 65 will be retired.\n When plaintiff made his application he was 49 years old and understood that defendant had a rule against accepting men over 45 to work in its train service. He falsely stated in his application that he was 38 years old, and, \n\n[286 U.S. 447, 449]\n\u00a0\n when submitting to a physical examination required of applicants for employment, he again so misrepresented his age. This statement was relied upon by the examining surgeon and was in part the basis of his finding and report that plaintiff was in good health and acceptable physical condition. It was a general practice of men, over the age specified in the rule, when applying for such work on the railroads of defendant and other carriers in the Northwest, falsely to represent their ages to be within the specified limit, and that practice was known to the defendant. The arbitrators were unable to find whether defendant knew plaintiff was over 45 years. They did not find, nor does the evidence require a finding, that defendant was deceived by plaintiff's false statements or that it accepted his application because of or in reliance upon them. The application was not rejected within 30 days, and, under rule 22, must be deemed to have been finally accepted. Under the terms of the contract of hiring, defendant did not without more have the right to remove plaintiff from its service on account of such misrepresentation. Plaintiff worked for defendant as a switchman for about 7 years and when injured was well under the age for retirement. His work was satisfactory. Neither his age nor his physical condition contributed to cause his injury.\n In Minneapolis, etc., R. Co. v. Rock, supra, this Court held that one who obtained employment as a switchman for an interstate carrier by railroad by fraudulently evading the company's rule requiring applicants to submit to a physical examination and who suffered injury in the course of employment in interstate transportation, while the company remained unaware of the deception, was not as of right an employee within the meaning, or entitled to the protection, of the Federal Employers' Liability Act, and could not maintain an action for injury under that statute. \n\n[286 U.S. 447, 450]\n\u00a0\n Rock was an imposter. He applied for work under his true name and was rejected upon examination because his physical condition was found unacceptable under the carrier's reasonable rule and practice. Later, representing that he had not theretofore made application, he applied again, but under a different name, and procured another man to impersonate him and in his place to submit to the required physical examination. And, by means of the surgeon's report upon that man's condition, Rock deceived the company, and thereby secured the employment in which, about a year later, he suffered injury. The court said (page 414 of 279 U. S., 49 S. Ct. 363, 365): 'The deception ... set at naught the carrier's reasonable rule and practice established to promote the safety of employees and to protect commerce. It was directly opposed to the public interest, because calculated to embarrass and hinder the carrier in the performance of its duties and to defeat important purposes sought to be advanced by the act . ... (Page 415 of 279 U. S., 49 S. Ct. 363, 365.) While his physical condition was not a cause of his injuries, it did have direct relation to the propriety of admitting him to such employment. It was at all times his duty to disclose his identity and physical condition to petitioner. His failure so to do was a continuing wrong in the nature of a cheat. The misrepresentation and injury may not be regarded as unrelated contemporary facts. As a result of his concealment his status was at all times wrongful, a fraud upon the petitioner, and a peril to its patrons and its other employees. Right to recover may not justly or reasonably be rested on a foundation so abhorrent to public policy.'\n Here, defendant could not have regarded the difference between plaintiff's actual age and that stated in his application as having any material bearing upon the physical condition it required. The arbitrators did not find, and the evidence does not show, that plaintiff's false state- \n\n[286 U.S. 447, 451]\n\u00a0\n ment of his age substantially affected the examining surgeon's conclusion that he was in good health and acceptable physical condition, or that, if he had given his real age, the surgeon would have found otherwise. Indeed the surgeon's testimony shows that, save in exceptional cases, defendant, in accordance with its established rules, permits its switchmen to continue in the service until they are 65 years old without any physical examination after they are employed. Plaintiff's physical condition was not shown to be such as to make his employment inconsistent with the defendant's proper policy or its reasonable rules to insure discharge of its duty to select fit employees. The evidence indicates that, under its own interpretation of rule 22 together with the schedule constituting the agreement between defendant and its switchmen, defendant, after the final acceptance of plaintiff's application, was not free to discharge him on account of the false statement as to his age.\n It is clear that the facts found, when taken in connection with those shown by uncontradicted evidence, are not sufficient to bring this case within the rule applied in Minneapolis, etc., R. Co. v. Rock, supra, or the reasons upon which that decision rests.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","101":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMISSOURI PAC. R. CO. v.

Welch and Thomas Hackney, both of Kansas City, Mo., and Edward J., White, of St. Louis, Mo., for petitioner.\n Mr. C. A. Randolph, of Kansas City, Mo., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n While employed by petitioner railroad company and charged with the duty of protecting its trains against robbers, James Lee David was murdered in the night of May 17, 1923. His administratrix sued for damages under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (45 USCA  51-59), in the circuit court, Jackson county, Mo., and obtained a favorable verdict. Judgment thereon was affirmed by the Supreme Court. 41 S.W.(2d) 179. The cause is here upon writ of certiorari. \n284 \nU.S. 607\n, 52 S. Ct. 35, 76 L. Ed. -.\n Often during the months prior to April, 1923, the petitioner suffered losses through depredations by organized bands of robbers upon freight trains in and near Kansas City, Mo. It determined to make special efforts to frustrate further attacks by the culprits, and, if possible, cause their apprehension. To this end, on April 1, 1923, it employed David to act as a 'train rider' or guard for its cars. He had had experience in similar undertakings. \n\n[284 U.S. 460, 462]\n\u00a0\n Also he was carefully advised concerning the probable danger. He was told that the robbers were desperate men who 'would shoot him just as quick as they saw him.' He carried a pistol and sawed-off shot gun 'for the purpose of defending himself and the company's property.' When asked 'Whether you will fight these fellows or not?' he replied, 'I will fight them until I die.'\n Subsequent to David's employment, in order to strengthen its efforts towards frustration and to secure arrests, petitioner employed McCarthy, known to be associated with one of the criminal bands, who agreed, when possible, to furnish advance information of intended depredations, aid in locating stolen goods, etc. 'His instructions were that he was to get us word before the robbery was committed (through the telephone), if he could, if not, to give us information as soon as he could after the robbery had been committed.'\n The theory upon which respondent recovered below is that, while acting for petitioner, McCarthy knew of a plan to rob the train to which David was assigned on May 17th, and in violation of his duty negligently failed to notify his superior officer; that because of such negligence David received no notice of the plan, although he had the right to rely upon being supplied with such information in order to prepare to cope with the brigands on equal terms. As a consequence, he failed to take the necessary precautions, and exposed himself to being shot.\n The established rule is that in proceedings under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (45 USCA  51-59) assumption of the risk is an adequate defense.

Ct. 215. \n\n[284 U.S. 460, 463]\n\u00a0\n Under the circumstances disclosed by the record, clearly we think David assumed the risk of the default which, it is said, resulted in his death. He understood the nature of his employment and the incident dangers. He well knew that he was subjecting himself to murderous attacks by desperadoes. There was no promise to give him special warning or protection. Even if he had knowledge of McCarthy's employment (and this is far from certain), he must have appreciated the utter unreliability of the man and the probable inability of the master to obtain timely information through such a medium. He could not properly expect to be protected against criminals whom he was employed to fight through treachery by one of their associates. The common employer, notwithstanding efforts to obtain warning, actually knew nothing of the criminal plan. If we accept respondent's view of the facts, David assumed the risk of the negligent action of which complaint is now made.\n We need not consider any other point advanced in behalf of the petitioner.\n The judgment of the court below must be reversed.

The Circuit Court of Appeals, having decided in Collins v. City of Phoenix, 54 F.(2d) 770 (where jurisdiction of the federal court rested on diversity of citizenship), that the proceedings of the city were not authorized by the statutes of Arizona,1 held in the instant cases that the petitioner, having alleged that the proceedings were void under the state law, had not presented a \n\n[287 U.S. 29, 31]\n\u00a0\n substantial federal question. But petitioner did not stop with allegations as to the city's authority under state law. Petitioner also alleged in No. 6, after setting forth her title, her claim as to the width of the street in question, and the action of the city in including her property as a part of the street, and in contracting for the street improvement upon that basis, that the city was thereby 'attempting to take and appropriate the property of plaintiff without compensation, and to take and appropriate and use same and deprive the said plaintiff of the permanent use thereof without due process of law, or any process of law, ... and in violation of the rights of plaintiff as guaranteed her under the Constitution of the United States, and particularly under Amendments 5 and 14 thereof, which plaintiff here and now pleads and relies on for her protection against the wrongs and threatened wrongs of the defendant city in the proposed taking of her property as hereinbefore described.' And this appeal to the Fourteenth Amendment was reiterated as against the action of the city which was alleged to have been taken 'under the authority' of the 'ordinances, resolutions and acts' set forth in the bill of complaint; it being also alleged that there had been no dedication or deed to the city, and no proceedings for condemnation. Similar allegations of federal right, but more briefly stated, are found in the bill of complaint in No. 7.\n In this respect the instant cases are similar to that of Cuyahoga River Power Company v. Akron, \n240 \nU.S. 462\n, 36 S.Ct. 402, 403, where the plaintiff, after setting forth provisions of the statutes and Constitution of Ohio, and concluding that the city had no constitutional power to take the property and franchises of the plaintiff, and was exceeding the authority conferred by state law, further alleged that the city was attempting to take the plaintiff's property without compensation, and was going forward with the enterprise in question in violation of the contract clause and Fourteenth Amendment \n\n[287 U.S. 29, 32]\n\u00a0\n of the Constitution of the United States. This court held that 'whether the plaintiff has any rights that the city is bound to respect can be decided only by taking jurisdiction of the case,' and that it was necessary for the District Court to deal with the merits.\n See, also, Fidelity & Deposit Co. v.

BURNET(1932)\nNo. 80\nArgued: November 18, 1932Decided: December 5, 1932\n\n\n\n\n[287 U.S. 299, 300]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Thomas R. Dempsey, of Los Angeles, Cal., and Randolph E. Paul, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. G. A. Youngquist, Asst. Atty. Gen., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case is here on certiorari, \n286 \nU.S. 541\n, 52 S.Ct. 647, to review a judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, 55 F.(2d) 17, which reversed an order of the Board of Tax Appeals, 15 B.T. A. 1195, and sustained a ruling of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue fixing the amount of depletion to be allowed and deducted from royalties received by petitioner in 1919 and 1920 as the lessor of oil lands, in determining petitioner's taxable income for those years.\n In December, 1913, petitioner, the owner of two tracts of oil lands, leased them for stipulated net bonus payments, aggregating $5,173,595.18 and royalties of one-fourth of the oil produced by the lessee. All the bonus payments were made before 1919. Whether petitioner returned those payments as income or paid income tax on \n\n[287 U.S. 299, 301]\n\u00a0\n them for the years when received does not appear. During 1919 and 1920 petitioner received royalties from the leased lands. In returning its income for those years, it sought to deduct from the royalties received the entire original unit cost to it of the oil extracted during the taxable period, without any diminution by reason of the bonus payments which it had already received. Under the applicable Revenue Act of 1918, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, bonus and royalties received by the lessor of an oil lease, after deductions allowed by the taxing act, are taxable income of the lessor. See Burnet v. Harmel, \n287 \nU.S. 103\n, 53 S.Ct. 74, decided November 7, 1932. The question to be decided is whether the Commissioner correctly calculated the deduction for depletion for the years in question, by treating the bonus previously received by the petitioner, as a return of capital and by reducing pro tanto the depletion allowed on the royalties received in later taxable years.\n The court below sustained the Commissioner's treatment of the bonus payments as advanced royalties for which depletion must be allowed under section 234(a) (9), Revenue Act of 1918 (40 Stat. 1078), to the extent that they represent a return of capital, and held erroneous the conclusion of the Board of Tax Appeals that the entire bonus was taxable income. The correctness of this decision must first be determined, for, if the Board was right in ruling that the bonus was not subject to a depletion allowance, the method of computing the depletion to be allowed on the royalties received during the taxable years in question would present no problem. The taxpayer would be entitled to deduct the full capital investment per barrel in the oil extracted during those years.\n Section 234(a)(9) of the 1918 act includes in the authorized deductions from gross income:\n'(9) In the case of mines, oil and gas wells, ... a reasonable allowance for depletion and for depreciation of improvements, according to the peculiar conditions in \n\n[287 U.S. 299, 302]\n\u00a0\n each case, based upon cost including cost of development not otherwise deducted: ... Such reasonable allowance in all the above cases to be made under rules and regulations to be prescribed by the Commissioner with the approval of the Secretary. In the case of leases the deductions allowed by this paragraph shall be equitably apportioned between the lessor and lessee. ...'\n\n We think it no longer open to doubt that, when the execution of an oil and gas lease is followed by production of oil, the bonus and royalties paid to the lessor both involve at least some return of his capital investment in oil in the ground, for which a depletion allowance must be made under section 234. See Burnet v. Harmel, supra. This is obvious where royalties alone are insufficient to return the capital investment. A distinction between royalties and bonus, which would allow a depletion deduction on the former but tax the latter in full as income, when received, making no provision for a reasonably anticipated production of oil on the leased premises, would deny the 'reasonable allowance for depletion' which the statute provides. The harsh operation of such a rule with respect to taxpayers generally is apparent, and is emphasized by the opportunist character of petitioner's argument here. The rule for which it contends can operate to its advantage only if it fortuitously escapes payment of any tax on the bonus payments, which it insists shall be treated as income without the deduction of any depletion allowance.\n Doubts, if any, whether the statute authorizes depletion of bonus payments, have been definitely set at rest by the repeated reenactment, without substantial change, of the provisions of  234(a)(9)1, since the promulgation \n\n[287 U.S. 299, 303]\n\u00a0\n of treasury regulations providing for such depletion. \n2\n See Burnet v. Thompson Oil & Gas Co., \n283 \nU.S. 301, 307\n, 308 S., 51 S.Ct. 418; Brewster v. Gage, \n280 \nU.S. 327, 337\n, 50 S.Ct. 115; National Lead Co. v. United States, \n252 \nU.S. 140, 146\n, 147 S., 40 S.Ct. 237.\n The question remains whether the method followed by the Commissioner in this case in allocating depletion to bonus and royalties failed to afford that 'reasonable allowance' for depletion which the statute provides.\n Article 215, Treasury Regulations 45 (1920 Ed.) provided:\n'(a) Where a lessor receives a bonus or other sum in addition to royalties, such bonus or other sum shall be regarded as a return of capital to the lessor, but only to the extent of the capital remaining to be recovered through depletion by the lessor at the date of the lease. If the bonus exceeds the capital remaining to be recovered, the excess and all the royalties thereafter received will be income and not depletable. If the bonus is less than the capital remaining to be recovered by the lessor through depletion, the difference may be recovered through depletion deductions based on the royalties thereafter received. The bonus or other sum paid by the lessee for a lease made on or after March 1, 1913, will be his value for depletion as of date of acquisition.'\n\n This paragraph of the regulation was amended, November 13, 1926, by Treasury Decision 3938, V-2, C.B. 117, to read as follows:\n'(a) Where a lessor receives a bonus in addition to royalties, there shall be allowed as a depletion deduction \n\n[287 U.S. 299, 304]\n\u00a0\n in respect of the bonus an amount equal to that proportion of the cost or value of the property on the basic date which the amount of the bonus bears to the sum of the bonus and the royalties expected to be received. Such allowance shall be deducted from the amount remaining to be recovered by the lessor through depletion, and the remainder is recoverable through depletion deductions on the basis of royalties thereafter received.'\n\n The important difference in operation between the regulation before its amendment and after is in the case where the Commissioner properly finds that the sum of the bonus and expected royalties exceeds the lessor's capital investment in the oil in the ground. If, for example, the bonus were $1,000,000 and the estimated royalties were $2,000,000 and the capital investment of the lessor in the oil in the ground, to be depleted, were $2,000,000 the allowed depletion for return of the capital investment would be deducted, one-third from the bonus and two-thirds from the royalties as received.\n The regulation thus operates to distribute the lessor's anticipated profit or the taxable net income to be derived from the extraction of all the oil ratably between the bonus and royalties, so that the estimated profit element in each will be taxed as received, subject to such readjustments of capital account as are authorized by paragraphs (c) and ( d) of the amended regulation, in the event of termination, abandonment, or expiration of the lease before all the oil is extracted. But, if the bonus and expected royalties together are not found to exceed the capital investment of the lessor, the entire bonus received in advance of royalties must be treated, after the amended regulation as well as before, as a return of capital, since, in that case, the expected royalties added to the bonus are, by hypothesis, sufficient to return no more than the lessor's capital. \n\n[287 U.S. 299, 305]\n\u00a0\n Such was the case here. In determining petitioner's depletion allowance for the two years in question, the Commissioner made no specific determination of the 'expected royalties' from the leased lands. But such a determination was of consequence in allocating depletion to the bonus only in the event that the total of bonus and expected royalties exceeded the invested capital of the tax-payer. No facts appear which would have justified such a finding, and, without it, the requirements of the amended regulation were satisfied by treating the whole bonus as a return of capital, and deducting from the depletion allowance on each barrel of the royalty oil the proportion of the capital investment already returned by the bonus. This is what the Commissioner did.\n He determined, on the basis of engineers' reports, the total amount of oil in the ground at the date of the lease and its value as of March 1, 1913. This he treated as petitioner's capital investment, to be returned by the depletion allowance. The computation necessarily revealed the per barrel capital investment in oil in the ground at the date of the lease. By making certain necessary capital investment adjustments, reflecting oil extraction during the years before 1919, the detail of which is not now important, he arrived at the per barrel capital investment of petitioner in oil in the ground in 1919 and 1920, the figure which would represent the actual amount of depletion of the capital investment for each barrel of oil extracted during those years, if there had been no bonus payments. His method of bringing the bonus into the computation amounted, in effect, to dividing the amount of the bonus by the total number of barrels of royalty oil in the ground, as indicated by the engineers' reports. The result represented the amount to be deducted from the depletion allowance per barrel of royalty oil which would otherwise have been made for those years. Stated \n\n[287 U.S. 299, 306]\n\u00a0\n in another way, the total amount of the bonus was deducted from petitioner's total capital investment in oil in the ground returnable by depletion allowances, with a corresponding reduction in the per barrel capital investment in the oil reserve. Thus the Commissioner treated the whole of the bonus as a return, in advance of abstraction of the oil, of a part of the petitioner's capital investment in the oil in the ground, with which it would part, in a technical legal sense, only upon abstraction. In consequence, the deduction for depletion allowed on royalties received in 1919 and 1920 was reduced; it is of this reduction that petitioner complains.\n We think the Commissioner's method 'reasonable' within the meaning of the statute. The deduction for depletion from the bonus payments, which the statute requires, must either be made after the process of extracting the oil is complete, to the extent that the royalties received have been insufficient to replace invested capital, with the attendant inconvenience of indefinite postponement of the allocation of the bonus to income and return of capital, or a formula must be adopted by which the appropriate allocation may be made as the two classes of gross income, bonus and royalties, are received.\n That formula the regulation purports to furnish. Where the estimates are reasonable, the formula affords a fair and convenient method of avoiding the present taxation of the bonus, when received, as income, in the face of the probability that it will ultimately prove not to be such. It will not fail to provide, with reasonable certainty, for the restoration of capital to which the taxpayer is entitled, if the oil extracted equals or exceeds the amount originally estimated. If less than that amount, it does not preclude revision and necessary adjustments, as errors appear probable. In addition, provision is made by subdivisions (c) and (d) of the regulation, as amended, for such necessary capital readjustments as may be occa- \n\n[287 U.S. 299, 307]\n\u00a0\n sioned by the termination, abandonment or expiration of the lease before all the oil is extracted.\n The method of computation provided by the amended regulation must be taken to have received the approval of Congress, for, as already noted, the provisions of article 215(a), as amended, have been continued in the Treasury Regulations since 1926, and those of section 234(a)(9) of the Revenue Act of 1918 (40 Stat. 1078) have been reenacted without substantial change in the Revenue Acts of 1928 (26 USCA  2023, 3023) and 1932\n\n\n The problem here is different from that involved in Burnet v. Thompson Oil & Gas Co., supra. There it was held, interpreting section 234( a)(9), that the part of the depletion not allowed by the 1913 statute in the year in which it occurred could not be carried over and added to the depletable base used in computing the tax for a later year under the 1918 act, which allowed depletion in full. Here an anticipated depletion of capital is to be returned from bonus and future royalties, to the extent that the applicable statutes allow, and the problem is to allocate such anticipated depletion to a payment made in advance of its occurrence. This allocation is permitted by the statute.\n Petitioner argues, nevertheless, that the regulation is unreasonable because it requires the Commissioner to estimate probable royalties which are dependent on the frequently unforeseeable future market value of oil. But the regulation does not require him to make estimates which are unreasonable, for where none can be made with reasonable accuracy, the Commissioner cannot find that 'the sum of the bonus and royalties expected to be received' exceeds the capital investment. In that event, the whole of the bonus will be treated, as in this case, as a return of capital. We cannot say that such a result is unreasonable on its face. The exigencies which 'the peculiar conditions of each case' may present we need not now consider. It is also unnecessary to inquire under \n\n[287 U.S. 299, 308]\n\u00a0\n what circumstances the application of the regulation may fail to comply with the statute because the appraisals which are made are extravagant or impossible. In the case before us, the accuracy of every estimate of the Commissioner is unchallenged. It cannot be said that the regulation, as applied here, was unauthorized by the statute because inadequate for its purpose or inconvenient or unjust in its operation.\n Finally, petitioner urges that, as the Commissioner failed to find the expected royalties to be received under the lease, the court below should have exercised its discretion to remand the case to the Board of Tax Appeals for a rehearing. Section 1003(b), Revenue Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 9, 110 (26 USCA  1226(b). As we have said above, the record does not disclose any facts from which the expected royalties might be determined. Neither the petitioner nor the Commissioner asked opportunity to supply such facts. It does not appear whether such an estimate could be made, or that, if made, the sum of the bonus and expected royalties would exceed the petitioner's capital investment, returnable by depletion. Hence no case was made calling for the court below to exercise its discretion in petitioner's favor.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 234(a)(9), Revenue Act of 1921, 42 Stat. 227, 256; section 234(a) (8), Revenue Act of 1924, 43 Stat. 253, 284, and section 234(a)(8), Revenue Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 9, 42 (26 USCA  986); section 23(l), Revenue Act of 1928, 45 Stat. 791, 800 (26 USCA  2023(l); section 23(l), Revenue Act of 1932, 47 Stat. 173, 180 (26 USCA  3023(l). \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Article 215(a), Treasury Regulations 45 (1920 Ed.), Revenue Act of 1918, continued intact in article 215(a), Treasury Regulations 62, Revenue Act of 1921; article 216(a), Treasury Regulations 65, Revenue Act of 1924.

LIEBMANN(1932)\nNo. 463\nArgued: February 19, 1932Decided: March 21, 1932\n\n\n\n Messrs. John B. Dudley, of Oklahoma City, Okl., Guy L. Andrews, of McAlester, Okl., and J. H. Everest, of Oklahoma City, Okl., for appellant.\n\n\n[285 U.S. 262, 266]\n\u00a0\n Mr. George M. Nicholson, of Oklahoma City, Okl., for appellee.\n\n\n[285 U.S. 262, 271]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The New State Ice Company, engaged in the business of manufacturing, selling, and distributing ice under a license or permit duly issued by the Corporation Commission of Oklahoma, brought this suit against Liebmann in the federal District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma to enjoin him from manufacturing, selling, and distributing ice within Oklahoma City without first having obtained a like license or permit from the commission. The license or permit is required by an act of the Oklahoma Legislature, chapter 147, Session Laws 1925. That act declares that the manufacture, sale, and distribution of ice is a public business; that no one shall be permitted to manufacture, sell, or distribute ice within the state without first having secured a license for that purpose from the commission; that whoever shall engage in such business without obtaining the license shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by fine not to exceed $25, each day's violation constitutiong a separate offense, and that by general order of the commission, a fine not to exceed $500 may be imposed for each violation.\n Section 3 of the act provides:\n'That the Corporation Commission shall not issue license to any persons, firm or corporation for the manufacture, sale and distribution of ice, or either of them, within this State, except upon a hearing had by said Commission at which said hearing, competent testimony and proof shall be presented showing the necessity for the manufacture, sale or distribution of ice, or either of them, \n\n[285 U.S. 262, 272]\n\u00a0\n at the point, community or place desired. If the facts proved at said hearing disclose that the facilities for the manufacture, sale and distribution of ice by some person, firm or corporation already licensed by said Commission at said point, community or place, are sufficient to meet the public needs therein, the said Corporation Commission may refuse and deny the applicant (application) for said license. In addition to said authority, the said Commission shall have the right to take into consideration the responsibility, reliability, qualifications and capacity of the person, firm or corporation applying for said license and of the person, firm or corporation already licensed in said place or community, as to afford all reasonable facilities, conveniences and services to the public and shall have the power and authority to require such facilities and services to be afforded the public; provided, that nothing herein shall operate to prevent the licensing of any person, firm or corporation now engaged in the manufacture, sale and distribution of ice, or either of them, in any town, city or community of this State, whose license shall be granted and issued by said Commission upon application of such person, firm or corporation and payment of license fee.'\n\n The portion of the section immediately in question here is that which forbids the commission to issue a license to any applicant except upon proof of the necessity for a supply of ice at the place where it is sought to establish the business, and which authorizes a denial of the application where the existing licensed facilities 'are sufficient to meet the public needs therein.' The District Court dismissed the bill of complaint for want of equity, on the ground that the manufacture and sale of ice is a private business which may not be subjected to the foregoing regulation. 42 F.(2d) 913. The Court of Appeals affirmed. 52 F.(2d) 349. \n\n[285 U.S. 262, 273]\n\u00a0\n It must be conceded that all businesses are subject to some measure of public regulation. And that the business of manufacturing, selling, or distributing ice, like that of the grocer, the dairyman, the butcher, or the baker, may be subjected to appropriate regulations in the interest of the public health cannot be doubted; but the question here is whether the business is so charged with a public use as to justify the particular restriction above stated. If this legislative restriction be within the constitutional power of the state Legislature, it follows that the license or permit, issued to appellant, constitutes a franchise, to which a court of equity will afford protection against one who seeks to carry on the same business without obtaining from the commission a license or permit to do so. Frost v. Corporation Commission, \n278 U.S. 515\n, 519-521, 49 S. Ct. 235. In that view, engagement in the business is a privilege to be exercised only in virtue of a public grant, and not a common right to be exercised independently (Id.) by any competent person conformably to reasonable regulations equally applicable to all who choose to engage therein.\n The Frost Case is relied on here. That case dealt with the business of operating a cotton gin. It was conceded that this was a business clothed with a public interest, and that the statute requiring a showing of public necessity as a condition precedent to the issue of a permit was valid. But the conditions which warranted the concession there are wholly wanting here. It long has been recognized that mills for the grinding of grain or performing similar services for all comers are devoted to a public use and subject to public control, whether they be operated by direct authority of the state or entirely upon individual initiative. At a very early period a majority of the states had adopted general acts authorizing the taking and flowage, in invitum, of lands for their erection and maintenance. In passing these acts, the attention of the Legislatures no \n\n[285 U.S. 262, 274]\n\u00a0\n doubt was directed principally to grist mills; but some of the acts, either in precise terms or in their application, were extended to other kinds of mills. Head v. Amoskeag Manufacturing Co., \n113 U.S. 9\n, 16-19, 5 S. Ct. 441; State v. Edwards, 86 Me. 102, 104-106, 29 A. 947, 25 L. R. A. 504, 41 Am. St. Rep. 528. The mills were usually operated by the use of water power, but this method of operation has been said not to be essential. State v. Edwards, supra, 86 Me. at page 106, 29 A. 947, 25 L. R. A. 504, 41 Am. St. Rep. 528. It was open to the proprietor of a mill to maintain it as a private mill for grinding his own grain, and this free from legislative control; but if the proprietor assumed to serve the general public he thereby dedicated his mill to the public use and subjected it to such legislative control as was appropriate to that status. In such cases the mills were regarded as so necessary to the existence of the communities which they served as to justify the government in fostering and maintaining them, and imposing limitations upon their operation for the protection of the public. Id.\n In Chickasha Cotton Oil Co. v. Cotton County Gin Co. (C. C. A.) 40 F.( 2d) 846, 74 A. L. R. 1070, three Circuit Judges passed upon the constitutionality of the Oklahoma Cotton Ginning Act. Opinions were delivered seriatim, all to the effect, but for varying reasons, that the business of operating cotton gins in Oklahoma was clothed with a public interest. One of the judges thought that the rule in respect of grist mills should apply by analogy, on the ground of the similarity of service. The rule that mills whose services are open to all comers are clothed with a public interest was formulated in the light, and upon the basis, of historical usage, which had survived the limitations that otherwise might be imposed by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. While the cotton gin has no such background of ancient usage, and, as the opinion by Judge Phillips points out, there is always danger of our being led afield by relying overmuch upon analogies, the analogy here is not without helpful significance. \n\n[285 U.S. 262, 275]\n\u00a0\n In that connection we also may consider Clark v. Nash, \n198 \nU.S. 361\n, 25 S. Ct. 676, 4 Ann. Cas. 1171, and Strickley v. Highland Boy Gold Mining Co., \n200 \nU.S. 527\n, 26 S. Ct. 301, 4 Ann. Cas. 1174, which dealt with the cognate question of what is a public use in respect of which the right of eminent domain may be exercised. The cases involved a statute of the state of Utah, which declared:\n'The cultivation and irrigation of the soil, the production and reduction of ores, are of vital necessity to the people of the State of Utah; are pursuits in which all are interested and from which all derive a benefit; and the use and application of the unappropriated waters of the natural streams and water courses of the State to the generation of electrical force or energy to be employed in industrial pursuits are of great public benefit and utility. So irrigation of land, the mining, milling, smelting or other reduction of ores, and such use and application of such waters for the generation of electrical power to be employed as aforesaid are hereby declared to be for the public use, and the right of eminent domain may be exercised in behalf thereof.' Chapter 95,  1, Laws of Utah 1896\n\n\n\n In the Nash Case, this court, applying that statute, sustained the condemnation of a right of way across the lands of one private owner for a ditch to convey water for the purpose of irrigating the lands of another private owner. The decision was rested explicitly upon the existence of conditions peculiar to the state. These conditions are epitomized in the legislative declaration above quoted. The court said (pages 369, 370 of 198 U. S., 25 S. Ct. 676, 678) that its decision was not to be understood as approving the broad proposition that private property might be taken in all cases where the taking might promote the public interest and tend to develop the natural resources of the state, but, having reference to the conditions there appearing, 'that the use is a public one, although the taking of the right of way is for the purpose simply of thereby obtaining the water for an individual, where it is absolutely necessary to \n\n[285 U.S. 262, 276]\n\u00a0\n enable him to make any use whatever of his land, and which will be valuable and fertile only if water can be obtained.'\n This was followed in the Strickley Case, where, mining being one of the chief industries of the state and its development peculiarly important for the public welfare, the condemnation of a right of way for an aerial bucket line across private lands, for the purpose of transporting ores from a mine in private ownership, was upheld under the same statute.\n These cases, though not strictly analogous, furnish persuasive ground for upholding the declaration of the Oklahoma Legislature in respect of the public nature of cotton gins in that state. The production of cotton is the chief industry of the state of Okiahoma, and is of such paramount importance as to justify the assertion that the general welfare and prosperity of the state in a very large and real sense depend upon its maintenance. Cotton ginning is a process which must take place before the cotton is in a condition for the market. The cotton gin bears the same relation to the cotton grower that the old grist mill did to the grower of wheat. The individual grower of the raw product is generally financially unable to set up a plant for himself; but the service is a necessary one with which, ordinarily, he cannot afford to dispense. He is compelled, therefore, to resort for such service to the establishment which operates in his locality. So dependent, generally, is he upon the neighborhood cotton gin that he faces the practical danger of being placed at the mercy of the operator in respect of exorbitant charges and arbitrary control. The relation between the growers of cotton, who constitute a very large proportion of the population, and those engaged in furnishing the service, is thus seen to be a peculiarly close one in respect of an industry of vital concern to the general public. These considerations render it not unreasonable \n\n[285 U.S. 262, 277]\n\u00a0\n to conclude that the business 'has been devoted to a public use and its use thereby in effect granted to the public.' Tyson & Bro.-United Ticket Offices v. Banton, \n273 \nU.S. 418, 434\n, 47 S. Ct. 426, 429, 58 A. L. R. 1236; Wolff Co. v. Industrial Court, \n262 \nU.S. 522, 535\n, 538 S., 43 S. Ct. 630, 27 A. L. R. 1280; Id., \n267 U.S. 552\n, 563 et seq., 45 S. Ct. 441.\n We have thus, with some particularity, discussed the circumstances which, so far as the state of Oklahoma is concerned, afford ground for sustaining the legislative pronouncement that the business of operating cotton gins is charged with a public use, in order to put them in contrast with the completely unlike circumstances which attend the business of manufacturing, selling, and distributing ice. Here we are dealing with an ordinary business, not with a paramount industry, upon which the prosperity of the entire state in large measure depends. It is a business as essentially private in its nature as the business of the grocer, the dairyman, the butcher, the baker, the shoemaker, or the tailor, each of whom performs a service which, to a greater or less extent, the community is dependent upon and is interested in having maintained; but which bears no such relation to the public as to warrant its inclusion in the category of businesses charged with a public use. It may be quite true that in Oklahoma ice is, not only an article of prime necessity, but indispensable; but certainly not more so than food or clothing or the shelter of a home. And this court has definitely said that the production or sale of food or clothing cannot be subjected to legislative regulation on the basis of a public use; and that the same is true in respect of the business of renting houses and apartments, except as to temporary measures to tide over grave emergencies. See Tyson & Bro.-United Ticket Offices v. Banton, supra, \n273 \nU.S. 437, 438\n, 47 S. Ct. 426, 58 A. L. R. 1236, and cases cited.\n It has been said that the manufacture of ice requires an expensive plant beyond the means of the average citizen, and that, since the use of ice is indispensable, patronage \n\n[285 U.S. 262, 278]\n\u00a0\n of the producer by the consumer is unavoidable. The same might, however, be said in respect of other articles clearly beyond the reach of a restriction like that here under review. But, for the moment conceding the materiality of the statement, it is not now true, whatever may have been the fact in the past. We know, since it is common knowledge, that today, to say nothing of other means, wherever electricity or gas is available ( and one or the other is available in practically every part of the country ), any one for a comparatively moderate outlay may have set up in his kitchen an appliance by means of which he may manufacture ice for himself. Under such circumstances it hardly will do to say that people generally are at the mercy of the manufacturer, seller, and distributer of ice for ordinary needs. Moreover, the practical tendency of the restriction, as the trial court suggested in the present case, is to shut out new enterprises, and thus create and foster monopoly in the hands of existing establishments, against, rather than in aid of, the interest of the consuming public.\n Plainly, a regulation which has the effect of denying or unreasonably curtailing the common right to engage in a lawful private business, such as that under review, cannot be upheld consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment. Under that amendment, nothing is more clearly settled than that it is beyond the power of a state, 'under the guise of protecting the public, arbitrarily (to) interfere with private business or prohibit lawful occupations or impose unreasonable and unnecessary restrictions upon them.' Burns Baking Co. v. Bryan, \n264 \nU.S. 504, 513\n, 44 S. Ct. 412, 413, 32 A. L. R. 661, and authorities cited; Liggett Co. v. Baldridge, \n278 \nU.S. 105, 113\n, 49 S. Ct. 57.\n Stated succinctly, a private corporation here seeks to prevent a competitor from entering the business of making and selling ice. It claims to be endowed with state authority to achieve this exclusion. There is no question \n\n[285 U.S. 262, 279]\n\u00a0\n now before us of any regulation by the state to protect the consuming public either with respect to conditions of manufacture and distribution or to insure purity of product or to prevent extortion. The control here asserted does not protect against monopoly, but tends to foster it. The aim is not to encourage competition, but to prevent it; not to regulate the business, but to preclude persons from engaging in it. There is no difference in principle between this case and the attempt of the dairyman under state authority to prevent another from keeping cows and selling milk on the ground that there are enough dairymen in the business; or to prevent a shoemaker from making or selling shoes because shoemakers already in that occupation can make and sell all the shoes that are needed. We are not able to see anything peculiar in the business here in question which distinguishes it from ordinary manufacture and production. It is said to be recent; but it is the character of the business and not the date when it began that is determinative. It is not the case of a natural monopoly, or of an enterprise in its nature dependent upon the grant of public privileges. The particular requirement before us was evidently not imposed to prevent a practical monopoly of the business, since its tendency is quite to the contrary. Nor is it a case of the protection of natural resources. There is nothing in the product that we can perceive on which to rest a distinction, in respect of this attempted control, from other products in common use which enter into free competition, subject, of course, to reasonable regulations prescribed for the protection of the public and applied with appropriate impartiality.\n And it is plain that unreasonable or arbitary interference or restrictions cannot be saved from the condemnation of that amendment merely by calling them experimental. It is not necessary to challenge the authority of the states to indulge in experimental legislation; but \n\n[285 U.S. 262, 280]\n\u00a0\n it would be strange and unwarranted doctrine to hold that they may do so by enactments which transcend the limitations imposed upon them by the Federal Constitution. The principle is imbedded in our constitutional system that there are certain essentials of liberty with which the state is not entitled to dispense in the interest of experiments. This principle has been applied by this court in many cases. Dorchy v. Kansas, \n264 \nU.S. 286\n, 44 S. Ct. 323; Wolff Packing Co. v. Industrial Court, \n262 \nU.S. 522\n, 43 S. Ct. 630, 27 A. L.

In the case last cited the theory of experimentation in censorship was not permitted to interfere with the fundamental doctrine of the freedom of the press. The opportunity to apply one's labor and skill in an ordinary occupation with proper regard for all reasonable regulations is no less entitled to protection.\n Decree affirmed.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS (dissenting).\n Chapter 147 of the Session Laws of Oklahoma 1925, declares that the manufacture of ice for sale and distribution is 'a public business'; confers upon the Corporation Commission in respect to it the powers of regulation customarily exercised over public utilities; and provides specifically for securing adequate service. The statute makes is a misdemeanor to engage in the business without a license from the commission; directs that the license shall not issue except pursuant to a prescribed written application, after a formal hearing upon adequate notice \n\n[285 U.S. 262, 281]\n\u00a0\n both to the community to be served and to the general public, and a showing upon competent evidence, of the necessity 'at the place desired'; and it provides that the application may be denied, among other grounds, if 'the facts proved at said hearing disclose that the facilities for the manufacture, sale and distribution of ice by some person, firm or corporation already licensed by said commission at said point, community or place, are sufficient to meet the public needs therein.' Section 3.\n Under a license, so granted, the New State Ice Company is, and for some years has been, engaged in the manufacture, sale, and distribution of ice at Oklahoma City, and has invested in that business $500,000. While it was so engaged, Liebmann, without having obtained or applied for a license, purchased a parcel of land in that city and commenced the construction thereon of an ice plant for the purpose of entering the business in competition with the plaintiff. To enjoin him from doing so this suit was brought by the ice company. Compare Frost v. Corporation Commission, \n278 \nU.S. 515\n, 49 S. Ct. 235. Liebmann contends that the manufacture of ice for sale and distribution is not a public business; that it is a private business and, indeed, a common calling; that the right to engage in a common calling is one of the fundamental liberties guaranteed by the due process clause; and that to make his right to engage in that calling dependent upon a finding of public necessity deprives him of liberty and property in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Upon full hearing the District Court sustained that contention and dismissed the bill. 42 F.(2d) 913. Its decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 52 F.(2d) 349. The case is here on appeal. In my opinion, the judgment should be reversed.\n First. The Oklahoma statute makes entry into the business of manufacturing ice for sale and distribution dependent, in effect, upon a certificate of public convenience \n\n[285 U.S. 262, 282]\n\u00a0\n and necessity. Such a certificate was unknown to the common law. It is a creature of the machine age, in which plants have displaced tools and businesses are substituted for trades. The purpose of requring it is to promote the public interest by preventing waste. Particularly in those businesses in which interest and depreciation charges in plant constitute a large element in the cost of production, experience has taught that the financial burdens incident to unnecessary duplication of facilities are likely to bring high rates and poor service. \n1\n There, cost is usually dependent, among other things, upon volume; and division of possible patronage among competing concerns may so raise the unit cost of operation as to make it impossible to provide adequate service at reasonable rates. The introduction in the United States of the certificate of public convenience and necessity marked the growing conviction that under certain circumstances free competition might be harmful to the community, and that, when it was so, absolute freedom to enter the business of one's choice should be denied.\n Long before the enactment of the Oklahoma statute here challenged, a like requirement had become common in the United States in some lines of business. The certificate was required first for railroads; then for street railways; then for other public utilities whose operation is dependent upon the grant of some special privilege. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[285 U.S. 262, 283]\n\u00a0\n Latterly, the requirement has been widely extended to common carriers by motor vehicle which use the highways, but which, unlike street railways and electric light companies, are not dependent upon the grant of any special privilege. \n3\n In Oklahoma the certificate was required, as early as 1915, for cotton gins-a business then declared a public one, and, like the business of manufacturing ice, conducted wholly upon private property. Sess. Laws, 1915, c. 176,  3. See Frost v. Corporation Commission, \n278 \nU.S. 515, 517\n, 49 S. Ct. 235. As applied to public utilities, the validity under the Fourteenth Amendment of the requirement of the certificate has never been successfully questioned.\n Second. Oklahoma declared the business of manufacturing ice for sale and distribution a 'public business'; that is, a public utility. So far as appears, it was the first state to do so.4 Of course, a Legislature cannot by \n\n[285 U.S. 262, 284]\n\u00a0\n mere legislative fiat convert a business into a public utility. Producers' Transportation Co. v. Railroad Commission, \n251 \nU.S. 228, 230\n, 40 S. Ct. 131. But the conception of a public utility is not static. \n5\n The welfare of the community may require that the business of supplying ice be made a public utility, as well as the business of supplying water or any other necessary commodity or service. If the business is, or can be made, a public utility, it must be possible to make the issue of a certificate a prerequisite to engaging in it.\n Whether the local conditions are such as to justify converting a private business into a public one is a matter primarily for the determination of the state Legislature. Its determination is subject to judicial review; but the usual presumption of validity attends the enactment. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n[285 U.S. 262, 285]\n\u00a0\n The action of the state must be held valid unless clearly arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable. 'The legislature, being familiar with local conditions, is, primarily, the judge of the necessity of such enactments. The mere fact that a court may differ with the legislature in its views of public policy, or that judges may hold views inconsistent with the propriety of the legislation in question, affords no ground for judicial interference. ...' McLean v. Arkansas, \n211 \nU.S. 539, 547\n, 29 S. Ct. 206, 208. Whether the grievances are real of fancied, whether the remedies are wise or foolish, are not matters about which the Court may concern itself. \n7\n 'Our present duty is to pass upon the statute before us, and if it has been enacted upon a belief of evils that is not arbitrary we cannot measure their extent against the estimate of the legislature.' Tanner v. Little, \n240 \nU.S. 369, 385\n, 36 S. Ct. 379, 384. A decision that the Legislature's belief of evils was arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable may not be made without enquiry into the facts with reference to which it acted.\n Third. Liebmann challenges the statute-not an order of the Corporation Commission. If he had applied for a license and been denied one, we should have been obliged to inquire whether the evidence introduced before \n\n[285 U.S. 262, 286]\n\u00a0\n the commission justified it in refusing permission to establish an additional ice plant in Oklahoma City. As he did not apply, but challenges the statute itself, out inquiry is of an entirely different nature. Liebmann rests his defense upon the broad claim that the Federal Constitution gives him the right to enter the business of manufacturing ice for sale even if his doing so be found by the properly constituted authority to be inconsistent with the public welfare. He claims that, whatever the local conditions may demand, to confer upon the commission power to deny that right is an unreasonable, arbitrary, and capricious restraint upon his liberty.\n The function of the court is primarily to determine whether the conditions in Oklahoma are such that the Legislature could not reasonably conclude (1) that the public welfare required treating the manufacture of ice for sale and distribution as a 'public business'; and (2) that, in order to insure to the inhabitants of some communities an adequate supply of ice at reasonable rates, it was necessary to give the commission power to exclude the establishment of an additional ice plant in places where the community was already well served. Unless the Court can say that the Federal Constitution confers an absolute right to engage anywhere in the business of manufacturing ice for sale, it cannot properly decide that the legislators acted unreasonably without first ascertaining what was the experience of Oklahoma in respect to the ice business. The relevant facts appear, in part, of record. Others are matters of common knowledge to those familiar with the ice business. Compare Muller v. Oregon, \n208 \nU.S. 412, 419\n, 420 S., 28 S. Ct. 324, 13 Ann. Cas. 957. They show the actual conditions, or the beliefs, on which the legislators acted. In considering these matters, we do not, in a strict sense, take judicial notice of them as embodying statements of uncontrovertible facts. Our function is only to determine the reasonableness of the Legislature's belief in the existence of evils and in the effectiveness of the remedy \n\n[285 U.S. 262, 287]\n\u00a0\n provided. In performing this function we have no occasion to consider whether all the statements of fact which may be the basis of the prevailing belief are well-founded; and we have, of course, no right to weigh conflicting evidence.\n (A) In Oklahoma a regular supply of ice may reasonably be considered a necessary of life, comparable to that of water, gas, and electricity. The climate, which heightens the need of ice for comfortable and wholesome living, precludes resort to the natural product. \n8\n There, as elsewhere, the development of the manufactured ice industry in recent years9 has been attended by deep-seated alterations in the economic structure and by radical changes in habits of popular thought and living. Ice has come to be regarded as a household necessity, indispensable to the preservation of food and so to economical household management and the maintenance of health. \n10\n Its com- \n\n[285 U.S. 262, 288]\n\u00a0\n mercial uses are extensive. In urban communities, they absorb a large proportion of the total amount of ice manufactured for sale. \n11\n The transportation, storage, and distribution of a great part of the nation's food supply is dependent upon a continuous, and dependable supply of ice. 12 It appears from the record that in certain parts of Oklahoma a large trade in dairy and other products has \n\n[285 U.S. 262, 289]\n\u00a0\n been built up as a result of rulings of the Corporation Commission under the act of 1925, compelling licensed manufacturers to serve agricultural communities13; and that this trade would be destroyed if the supply of ice were withdrawn. \n14\n We cannot say that the Legislature of Oklahoma acted arbitrarily in declaring that ice is an article of primary necessity, in industry and agriculture as well as in the household, partaking of the fundamental character of electricity, gas, water, transportation, and communication.\n Nor can the Court properly take judicial notice that, in Oklahoma, the means of manufacturing ice for private use are within the reach of all persons who are dependent upon it. Certainly it has not been so. In 1925 domestic mechanical refrigeration had scarcely emerged from the experimental stage. 15 Since that time, the production and consumption of ice manufactured for sale, far from \n\n[285 U.S. 262, 290]\n\u00a0\n diminishing, has steadily increased. \n16\n In Oklahoma the mechanical household refrigerator is still an article of relative luxury. 17 Legislation essential to the protection of individuals of limited or no means is not invalidated by the circumstance that other individuals are financially able to protect themselves. The businesses of power companies and of common carriers by street railway, steam railroad, or motor vehicle fall within the field of public control, although it is possible, for a relatively modest outlay, to install individual power plants, or to purchase \n\n[285 U.S. 262, 291]\n\u00a0\n motor vehicles for private carriage of passengers or goods. The question whether in Oklahoma the means of securing refrigeration otherwise than by ice manufactured for sale and distribution has become so general as to destroy popular dependence upon ice plants is one peculiarly appropriate for the determination of its Legislature and peculiarly inappropriate for determination by this Court, which cannot have knowledge of all the relevant facts.\n The business of supplying ice is not only a necessity, like that of supplying food or clothing or shelter, but the Legislature could also consider that it is one which lends itself peculiarly to monopoly. \n18\n Characteristically the business is conducted in local plants with a market narrowly limited in area, 19 and this for the reason that ice \n\n[285 U.S. 262, 292]\n\u00a0\n manufactured at a distance cannot effectively compete with a plant on the ground. \n20\n In small towns and rural communities21 the duplication of plants, and in larger communities the duplication of delivery service,22 is wasteful and ultimately burdensome to consumers. At the same time the relative ease and cheapness with which an ice plant may be constructed exposes the industry to destructive and frequently ruinous competition. Competition in the industry tends to be destructive because ice plants have a determinate capacity, and inflexible fixed charges and operating costs, and because in a market of limited area the volume of sales is not readily expanded. Thus, the erection of a new plant in a locality already adequately served often causes managers to go to extremes in cutting prices in order to secure business. Trade journals and reports of association meetings of ice manufacturers bear ample witness to the hostility of the industry to such com- \n\n[285 U.S. 262, 293]\n\u00a0\n petition, and to its unremitting efforts, through trade associations, informal agreements, combination of delivery systems, and in particular through the consolidation of plants, to protect markets and prices against competition of any character. \n23\n\u00a0\n\n That these forces were operative in Oklahoma prior to the passage of the act under review is apparent from the record. Thus, it was testified that in only six or seven localities in the state containing, in the aggregate, not more than 235,000 of a total population of approximately 2, 000,000, was there 'a semblance of competition'24; and that even in those localities the prices of ice were ordinarily uniform. The balance of the population was, and still is, served by companies enjoying complete monopoly. Compare Munn v. Illinois, \n94 \nU.S. 113, 131\n, 132 S.; Sinking Fund Cases, \n99 U.S. 700\n, 747; Wabash, St. Louis & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Illinois, \n118 \nU.S. 557, 569\n, 7 S. Ct. 4; Spring Valley Waterworks v. Schottler, \n110 \nU.S. 347, 354\n, 4 S. Ct. 48; Budd v. New York, \n143 \nU.S. 517, 545\n, 12 S. Ct. 468; Wolff Packing Co. v. Court of Industrial Relations, \n262 \nU.S. 522, 528\n, 43 S. Ct. 630, 27 A. L. R. 1280. Where there was competition, it often resulted to the disadvantage rather \n\n[285 U.S. 262, 294]\n\u00a0\n than the advantage of the public, both in respect to prices and to service. Some communities were without ice altogether, and the state was without means of assuring their supply. There is abundant evidence of widespread dissatisfaction with ice service prior to the act of 1925,25 and of material improvement in the situation subsequently. It is stipulated in the record that the ice industry as a whole in Oklahoma has acquiesced in and accepted the act and the status which it creates.\n (B) The statute under review rests, not only upon the facts just detailed, but upon a long period of experience in more limited regulation dating back to the first year of Oklahoma's statehood. For 17 years prior to the passage of the act of 1925, the Corporation Commission under section 13 of the Act of June 10, 1908, had exercised jurisdiction over the rates, practices, and service of ice plants, its action in each case, however, being predicated upon a finding that the company complained of enjoyed a 'virtual monopoly' of the ice business in the community which it served. \n26\n The jurisdiction thus exer- \n\n[285 U.S. 262, 295]\n\u00a0\n cised was upheld by the Supreme Court of the state in Oklahoma Light & Power Co. v. Corporation Commission, 96 Okl. 19, 220 P. 54. The court said, at page 24 of 96 Okl., 220 P. 54, 58: 'The manufacture, sale and distribution of ice in many respects closely resembles the sale and distribution of gas as fuel, or electric current, and in many communities the same company that manufactures, sells, and distributes electric current is the only concern that manufactures, sells and distributes ice, and by reason of the nature and extent of the ice business it is impracticable in that community to interest any other concern in such business. In this situation, the distributor of such a necessity as ice should not be permitted by reason of the impracticability of any one else engaging in the same business to charge unreasonable prices, and if such an abuse is persisted in the regulatory power of the state should be invoked to protect the public.' See, also, Consumers' Light & Power Co. v. Phipps, 120 Okl. 223, 251 P. 63.\n By formal orders, the commission repeatedly fixed or approved prices to be charged in particular communities;27 required ice to be sold without discrimination28 \n\n[285 U.S. 262, 296]\n\u00a0\n and to be distributed as equitably as possible to the extent of the capacity of the plant;29 forbade short weights and ordered scales to be carried on delivery wagons and ice to be weighed upon the customer's request;30 and undertook to compel sanitary practices in the manufacture of ice31 and courteous service of patrons. \n32\n Many of these regulations, other than those fixing prices, were embodied in a general order to all ice companies, issued July 15, 1921, and are still in effect. \n33\n Informally, the Commis- \n\n[285 U.S. 262, 297]\n\u00a0\n sion adjusted a much greater volume of complaints of a similar nature. \n34\n It appears from the record that for some years prior to the act of 1925 one day of each week was reserved by the commission to hear complaints relative to the ice business.\n As early as 1911, the commission, in its annual report to the Governor, had recommended legislation more clearly delineating its powers in this field:\n'There should be a law passed putting the regulation of ice plants under the jurisdiction of the Commission. The Commission is now assuming this jurisdiction under an Act passed by the Legislature known as the antitrust law. A specific law upon this subject would obviate any question of jurisdiction.'35\n\n This recommendation was several times repeated, in terms revealing the extent and character of public complaint against the practices of ice companies. \n36\n\u00a0\n\n[285 U.S. 262, 298]\n\u00a0\n The enactment of the so-called Ice Act in 1925 enlarged the existing jurisdiction of the Corporation Commission by removing the requirement of a finding of virtual monopoly in each particular case, compare Budd v. New York, \n143 \nU.S. 517, 545\n, 12 S. Ct. 468, with Brass v. Stoeser, \n153 \nU.S. 391, 402\n, 403 S., 14 S. Ct. 857; by conferring the same authority to compel adequate service as in the case of other public utilities; and by committing to the commission the function of issuing licenses equivalent to a certificate of public convenience and necessity. With the exception of the granting and denying of such licenses and the exertion of wider control over service, the regulatory activity of the commission in respect to ice plants has not changed in character since 1925. It appears to have diminished somewhat in volume. \n37\n\u00a0\n\n[285 U.S. 262, 299]\n\u00a0\n In 1916, the commission urged, in its report to the Governor, that all public utilities under its jurisdiction be required to secure from the commission 'what is known as a 'certificate of public convenience and necessity' before the duplication of facilities.'\n'This would prevent ruinous competition resulting in the driving out of business of small though competent public service utilities by more powerful corporations, and often consequent demoralization of service, or the requiring of the public to patronize two utilities in a community where one would be adequate.'38\n\n Up to that time a certificate of public convenience and necessity to engage in the business had been applied only to cotton gins. Okla. Sess. Laws 1915, c. 176,  3. In 1917 a certificate from the commission was declared prerequisite to the construction of new telephone or telegraph lines. \n39\n In 1923 it was required for the operation of motor carriers. \n40\n In 1925, the year in which the Ice Act was passed, the requirement was extended also to power, heat, light, gas, electric, or water companies pro- \n\n[285 U.S. 262, 300]\n\u00a0\n posing to do business in any locality already possessing one such utility. \n 41\n\u00a0\n\n Fourth. Can it be said in the light of these facts that it was not an appropriate exercise of legislative discretion to authorize the commission to deny a license to enter the business in localities where necessity for another plant did not exist? The need of some remedy for the evil of destructive competition, where competition existed, had been and was widely felt. Where competition did not exist, the propriety of public regulation had been proven. Many communities were not supplied with ice at all. The particular remedy adopted was not enacted hastily. The statute was based upon a long-established state policy recognizing the public importance of the ice business, and upon 17 years' legislative and administrative experience in the regulation of it. The advisability of treating the ice business as a public utility and of applying to it the certificate of convenience and necessity had been under consideration for many years. Similar legislation had been enacted in Oklahoma under similar circumstances with respect to other public services. The measure bore a substantial relation to the evils found to exist. Under these circumstances, to hold the act void as being unreasonable would, in my opinion, involve the exercise, not of the function of judicial review, but the function of a super-Legislature. If the act is to be stricken down, it must be on the ground that the Federal Constitution guarantees to the individual the absolute right to enter the ice business, however detrimental the exercise of that right may be to the public welfare. Such, indeed, appears to be the contention made. \n\n[285 U.S. 262, 301]\n\u00a0\n Fifth. The claim is that manufacturing ice for sale and distribution is a business inherently private, and, in effect, that no state of facts can justify denial of the right to engage in it. To supply one's self with water, electricity, gas, ice, or any other article is inherently a matter of private concern. So also may be the business of supplying the same articles to others for compensation. But the business of supplying to others, for compensation, any article or service whatsoever may become a matter of public concern. Whether it is, or is not, depends upon the conditions existing in the community affected. \n42\n If it is a matter of public concern, it may be regulated, whatever the business. The public's concern may be limited to a single feature of the business, so that the needed protection can be secured by a relatively slight degree of regulation. Such is the concern over possible incompetence, which dictates the licensing of dentists, Dent v. West Virginia, \n129 \nU.S. 114, 122\n, 9 S. Ct. 231; Douglas v. Noble, \n261 \nU.S. 165, 170\n, 43 S. Ct. 303; or the concern over possible dishonesty, which led to the licensing of auctioneers or hawkers, Baccus v State of Louisiana, \n232 \nU.S. 334, 338\n, 34 S. Ct. 439. On the other hand, the public's concern about a particular business may be so pervasive and varied as to require constant detailed supervision and a very high degree of regulation. Where this is true, it is common to speak of the business as being a 'public' one, although it is privately owned. It is to such businesses that the designation 'public utility' is commonly applied; or they are spoken of as 'affected with a public interest.' German Alliance Insurance Co. v. Lewis, \n233 \nU.S. 389, 408\n, 34 S. Ct. 612, 617, L. R. A. 1915C, 1189.\n A regulation valid for one kind of business may, of course, be invalid for another; since the reasonableness \n\n[285 U.S. 262, 302]\n\u00a0\n of every regulation is dependent upon the relevant facts. But so far as concerns the power to regulate, there is no difference, in essence, between a business called private and one called a public utility or said to be 'affected with a public interest.' Whatever the nature of the business, whatever the scope or character of the regulation applied, the source of the power invoked is the same. And likewise the constitutional limitation upon that power. The source is the police power. The limitation is that set by the due process clause, which, as construed, requires that the regulation shall be not unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious; and that the means of regulation selected shall have a real or substantial relation to the object sought to be obtained. The notion of a distinct category of business 'affected with a public interest,' employing property 'devoted to a public use,' rests upon historical error. The consequences which it is sought to draw from those phrases are belied by the meaning in which they were first used centuries ago,43 and by the decision of this Court, in Munn v. Illinois, \n94 U.S. 113\n, which first introduced them into the law of the Constitution. \n44\n In my opinion, the true principle is that the \n\n[285 U.S. 262, 303]\n\u00a0\n state's power extends to every regulation of any business reasonably required and appropriate for the public protection. I find in the due process clause no other limitation upon the character or the scope of regulation permissible.\n Sixth. It is urged specifically that manufacturing ice for sale and distribution is a common calling; and that the right to engage in a common calling is one of the fundamental liberties guaranteed by the due process clause. To think of the ice-manufacturing business as a common calling is difficult; so recent is it in origin and so peculiar in character. Moreover, the Constitution does not require that every calling which has been common shall ever remain so. The liberty to engage in a common calling, like other liberties, may be limited in the exercise of the police power. The slaughtering of cattle had been a common calling in New Orleans before the monopoly sustained in Slaughter House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, was created by the Legislature. Prior to the Eighteenth Amendment selling liquor was a common calling, but this Court held it to be consistent with the due process clause for a state to abolish the calling, Bartemeyer v. Iowa, 18 Wall. 129; Mugler v. Kansas, \n123 \nU.S. 623\n, 8 S. Ct. 273, or to establish a system limiting the number of licenses, Crowley v. Christensen, \n137 \nU.S. 86\n, 11 S. Ct. 13. Every citizen has the right to navigate a river or lake, and may even carry others thereon for hire. But the ferry privilege may be made exclusive in order that the patronage may be sufficient to justify maintaining the ferry service, Conway v. Taylor's Executor, 1 Black, 603, 633, 634. \n\n[285 U.S. 262, 304]\n\u00a0\n It is settled that the police power commonly invoked in aid of health, safety, and morals extends equally to the promotion of the public welfare. 45 The cases just cited show that, while ordinarily free competition in the common callings has been encouraged, the public welfare may at other times demand that monopolies be created. Upon this principle is based our whole modern practice of public utility regulation. It is no objection to the validity of the statute here assailed that it fosters monopoly. That, indeed, is its design. The certificate of public convenience and invention is a device-a recent social-economic invention-through which the monopoly is kept under effective control by vesting in a commission the power to terminate it whenever that course is required in the public interest. To grant any monopoly to any person as a favor is forbidden, even if terminable. But where, as here, there is reasonable ground for the legislative conclusion that, in order to secure a necessary service at reasonable rates, it may be necessary to curtail the right to enter the calling, it is, in my opinion, consistent with the due process clause to do so, whatever the nature of the business. The existence of such power in the Legislature seems indispensable in our ever-changing society.\n It is settled by unanimous decisions of this Court that the due process clause does not prevent a state or city from engaging in the business of supplying its inhabitants with articles in general use, when it is believed that they \n\n[285 U.S. 262, 305]\n\u00a0\n cannot be secured at reasonable prices from the private dealers. Thus, a city may, if the local law permits, buy and sell at retail coal and wood, Jones v. City of Portland, \n245 \nU.S. 217\n, 38 S. Ct. 112, L. R. A. 1918C, 765, Ann. Cas. 1918E, 660; or gasoline, Standard Oil Co. v. City of Lincoln, \n275 \nU.S. 504\n, 48 S. Ct. 155. And a state may, if permitted by its own Constitution, build and operate warehouses, elevators, packinghouses, flourmills, or other factories, Green v. Frazier, \n253 \nU.S. 233\n, 40 S. Ct. 499. As states may engage in a business, because it is a public purpose to assure to their inhabitants an adequate supply of necessary articles, may they not achieve this public purpose, as Oklahoma has done, by exercising the lesser power of preventing single individuals from wantonly engaging in the business and thereby making impossible a dependable private source of supply? As a state so entering upon a business may exert the taxing power, all individual dealers may be driven from the calling by the unequal competition. If states are denied the power to prevent the harmful entry of a few individuals into a business, they may thus, in effect, close it altogether to private enterprise.\n Seventh. The economic emergencies of the past were incidents of scarcity. In those days it was pre-eminently the common callings that were the subjects of regulation. The danger then threatening was excessive prices. To prevent what was deemed extortion, the English Parliament fixed the prices of commodities and of services from time to time during the four centuries preceding the Declaration of Independence. \n46\n Like legislation was en- \n\n[285 U.S. 262, 306]\n\u00a0\n acted in the Colonies; and in the States, after the Revolution. \n47\n When the first due process clause was written into the Federal Constitution, the price of bread was being fixed by statute in at least two of the states, and this practice continued long thereafter. \n48\n Dwelling houses when occupied by the owner are pre-eminently private property. From the foundation of our government those who wished to lease residential property had been free to charge to tenants such rentals as they pleased. But for years after the World War had ended, the scarcity of dwellings in the city of New York was such that the state's legislative power was invoked to insure reasonable rentals. The constitutionality of the statute was sustained by this Court. Marcus Brown Holding Co. v. Feldman, \n256 \nU.S. 170\n, 41 S. Ct. 465. Similar legislation of Congress for the city of Washington was also upheld. Block v. Hirsh, \n256 \nU.S. 135\n, 41 S. Ct. 458, 16 A. L. R. 165.\n Eighth. The people of the United States are now confronted with an emergency more serious than war. Misery is widespread, in a time, not of scarcity, but of overabundance. The long-continued depression has brought unprecedented unemployment, a catastrophic fall in commodity prices, and a volume of economic losses which threatens our financial institutions. \n49\n Some people \n\n[285 U.S. 262, 307]\n\u00a0\n believe that the existing conditions threaten even the stability of the capitalistic system. \n50\n Economists are searching for the causes of this disorder and are re-examining the basis of our industrial structure. Business men are seeking possible remedies. Most of them realize that failure to distribute widely the profits of industry has been a prime cause of our present plight. But rightly or wrongly, many persons think that one of the major contributing causes has been unbridled competition. 51 Increasingly, doubt is expressed whether it is economically wise, or morally right, that men should be permitted to \n\n[285 U.S. 262, 308]\n\u00a0\n add to the producing facilities of an industry which is already suffering from overcapacity. In justification of that doubt, men point to the excess capacity of our productive facilities resulting from their vast expansion without corresponding increase in the consumptive capacity of the people. They assert that through improved methods of manufacture, made possible by advances in science and invention and vast accumulation of capital, our industries had become capable of producing from 30 to 100 per cent. more than was consumed even in days of vaunted prosperity; and that the present capacity will, for a long time, exceed the needs of business. \n52\n All agree that irregularity in employment-the greatest of our evils-cannot be overcome unless production and consumption are more nearly balanced. Many insist there must be some form of economic control. There are plans for proration. There are many proposals for stabilization. \n53\n And some thoughtful men \n\n[285 U.S. 262, 309]\n\u00a0\n of wide business experience insist that all projects for stabilization and proration must prove futile unless, in some way, the equivalent of the certificate of public convenience and necessity is made a prerequisite to embarking new capital in an industry in which the capacity already exceeds the production schedules. \n54\n\u00a0\n\n Whether that view is sound nobody knows. The objections to the proposal are obvious and grave. The remedy might bring evils worse than the present disease. The \n\n[285 U.S. 262, 310]\n\u00a0\n obstacles to success seem insuperable. \n55\n The economic and social sciences are largely uncharted seas. We have been none too successful in the modest essays in economic control already entered upon. The new proposal involves a vast extension of the area of control. Merely to acquire the knowledge essential as a basis for the exercise of this multitude of judgments would be a formidable task; and each of the thousands of these judgments would call for some measure of prophecy. Even more serious are the obstacles to success inherent in the demands which execution of the project would make upon human intelligence and upon the character of men. Man is weak and his judgment is at best fallible.\n Yet the advances in the exact sciences and the achievements in invention remind us that the seemingly impossible sometimes happens. There are many men now living who were in the habit of using the age-old expression: 'It is as impossible as flying.' The discoveries in physical science, the triumphs in invention, attest the value of the process of trial and error. In large measure, these advances have been due to experimentation. In those fields experimentation has, for two centuries, been not only free but encouraged. Some people assert that our present plight is due, in part, to the limitations set \n\n[285 U.S. 262, 311]\n\u00a0\n by courts upon experimentation in the fields of social and economic science; and to the discouragement to which proposals for betterment there have been subjected otherwise. There must be power in the states and the nation to remould, through experimentation, our economic practices and institutions to meet changing social and economic needs. I cannot believe that the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment, or the states which ratified it, intended to deprive us of the power to correct the evils of technological unemployment and excess productive capacity which have attended progress in the useful arts. \n56\n\u00a0\n\n To stay experimentation in things social and economic is a grave responsibility. Denial of the right to experiment may be fraught with serious consequences to the nation. It is one of the happy incidents of the federal system that a single courageous state may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country. This Court has the power to prevent an experiment. \n57\n We may strike down the statute which embodies it on the ground that, in our opinion, the measure is arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable. We have power to do this, because the due process clause has been held by the Court applicable to matters of substantive law as well as to matters of procedure. But, in the exercise of this high power, we must be ever on our guard, lest we erect our prejudices into legal principles. If we would guide by the light of reason, we must let our minds be bold.\n Mr. Justice STONE joins in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Compare Sumner H.

The mean normal temperature in January, the coldest month, is 38.3 degrees; in December, 39.2 degrees. Id. So far as appears, no natural ice is harvested in the state for commercial purposes. See Guy v. Andrews, 'State Regulation of Ice Industry in Oklahoma,' Refrigerating World, Sept. 1928, p. 32. \n[\nFootnote 9\n] The industry first assumed commercial importance in the United States about 1880. See Ice and Refrigeration Blue Book (10th Ed.), pp. 12- 18. Reports of the Bureau of the Census indicate that in 1869 there were only four establishments producing artificial ice; in 1879, 35; in 1889, 222; in 1899, 775. See Willard L. Thorp, 'The Integration of Industrial Operation,' United States Census Monographs, III, 1924, pp. 49, 50. In 1929, the Census of Manufactures shows 4,110 establishments making ice as their product of chief value. The Ice and Refrigeration Blue Book for 1927, p. 30, lists 7,338 plants actually producing ice for sale. It estimates the total production for that year at 52,202,160 tons, as against 4,294, 439 tons, reported by the Bureau of the Census for 1899. \n[\nFootnote 10\n] See report of Committee on Fundamental Equipment, submitted to the President's Conference on Home Building and Home Ownership, December 3, 1931, p. 107; Elsie P. Wolcott, 'Use and Cost of Ice in Families with Children,' published by the department of public welfare of the city of Chicago. Lack of ice, in hot seasons, results in constant waste and danger to health. It compels the purchase of food in small quantities at higher prices. The intimate relation of food preservation to health, and infant mortality, has long been recognized. Ordinary perishable foodstuffs, it is generally considered, cannot be safely kept at temperatures in excess of from 45 to 50 degrees. Report of Committee on Fundamental Equipment, supra, p. 110. \n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] See Walter R. sanders, 'Industrial Application of Refrigeration in the United States,' Proceedings of the Fourth International Congress of Refrigeration, London, 1924, p. 967. It was testified that in Oklahoma City, in April, 1930, 46.4 per cent. of the sales of ice were to the retail trade, 37.12 per cent. to the commercial trade, 13.81 per cent. to the wholesale trade, 2.92 per cent. for car icing, and the remainder for carload shipments out of the city. In 1922 there were loaded in Oklahoma 1, 676 cars of food products under refrigeration; in 1925, 2,940 cars; and in 1929, 3,347. The Ice and Refrigeration Blue Book (10th Ed.), pp. 22, 23, lists 198 industries using refrigeration. In a great number of these it is impracticable to install a private ice plant. \n[\nFootnote 12\n] Were it not for refrigeration, the market for perishable foodstuffs, in warm seasons, would be limited in area to a few miles and in time to a few days, or even hours. A considerable part of this refrigeration is supplied by concerns manufacturing ice for sale. Such concerns commonly supply ice used in car-icing. Mechanical refrigeration is beyond the means of many small retail dealers. Moreover, since decay in food, once begun, cannot be arrested by subsequent refrigeration, ice, or a substitute, is often essential on the farm. See M. E. Pennington and A. D. Greenlee, 'The Refrigeration of Dressed Poultry in Transit,' Bulletin No. 17, U. S. Department of Agriculture, p. 31. \n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] More than 80 per cent. of the milk and cream sold from farms in the United States is produced in sections where natural ice can be harvested. See U. S. Department of Agriculture, 'Colling Milk and Cream on the Farm,' Farmers' Bulletin No. 976, p. 1. The dairy industry in Oklahoma, however, is wholly dependent upon artificial ice, or its substitutes. Refrigeration on the farm is indispensable to the safe marketing of dairy products, at any season when the temperature exceeds 50 degrees. See John T. Bown, 'The Application of Refrigeration to the Handling of Milk,' Bulletin No. 98, U. S. Department of Agriculture, pp. 2, 65 et seq. \n[\nFootnote 14\n] The power of the commission to compel this service, of course, depends upon the status of the ice business as a public utility. The evidence shows that the distribution of ice in rural communities not themselves possessing ice plants has developed almost wholly since the passage of the act of 1925. There was testimony that such distribution would be impracticable without the protection afforded by the Act. \n[\nFootnote 15\n] The total number of household refrigerators in the entire country manufactured and sold before 1920 was approximately 10,000. In 1924, the annual production reached 30,000; in 1925, 75,000. Electrical Refrigerating News, February 17, 1932. \n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] The Secretary of the National Association of Ice Industries testified that the ice business for the last 11 years had increased upon an average of 5.35 per cent. each year; that in 1919 the per capita consumption of ice was 712 pounds; in 1929, 1,157 pounds. A great deal of the increase in consumption of ice in Oklahoma, another witness testified, was in rural communities and among urban dwellers of the poorer classes. \n[\nFootnote 17\n] The number of domestic electric meters installed in Oklahoma as of August 31, 1930, was only 222,237, according to a tabulation of the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce. The population of the state in 1930 was 2,396,000. Fifteenth Census, vol. I, p. 18. It is estimated that 965,000 household refrigerators were sold in 1931, of which only 10,146 were sold in Oklahoma. Electrical Refrigerating News, February 24, 1932. Approximately 3,578,000 such refrigerators are now in use throughout the country. Id., February 10, 1932. From these figures it may be calculated that the number of refrigerators in use in Oklahoma is between 35,000 and 40,000. The average cost of a household electric refrigerator in 1925 was $ 425; in 1931, $245. Electrical Refrigerating News, February 17, 1932. The price of ice for domestic use in Oklahoma varies from 40 to 70 cents the hundredweight. Few families use as much as three or four tons of ice in a year. In view of these facts, this Court can scarcely have judicial knowledge that in Oklahoma all families or businesses which are able to purchase ice are able to purchase a mechanical refrigerator. See Report of Committee on Fundamental Equipment, submitted to the President's Conference on Home Building and Home Ownership, pp. 111, 128-129. This committee found it impossible to recommend even an ordinary refrigerator, using ice, for families of law income, and suggested the design and marketing of a specially constructed ice-chest, \n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] It is noteworthy that the ice industry has the characteristic of uniformity of product or service common to most public utilities, and distinguishing it from other businesses in which differences in quality or style make difficult effective regulation. See S. Howard Patterson and Karl W. H. Scholz, 'Economic Problems of Modern Life' (2d Ed. 1931), p. 426.\n The tendency of the industry to be conducted as a public utility is reflected in the widespread entry into it in recent years of electrical, gas, and water utilities, and the like. Such companies in Oklahoma operate more than one-third of the ice plants. See Ice and Refrigeration Blue Book ( 10th Ed.), pp. 1268-1288. Compare Oklahoma Light & Power Co. v. Corporation Commission, 96 Okl. 19, 24, 220 P. 54.\n Municipalities have engaged extensively in the business of manufacturing and selling ice in foreign countries, and to a lessor extent in the United States. On several occasions, departments of the federal government, unable to secure ice at what were regarded as reasonable prices, have installed their own ice plants. Both in the Philippine Islands and in Panama plants have been operated which sell ice to government employees. See Carl D. Thompson, 'Public Ownership,' pp. 301- 305; Jeanie Wells Wentworth, 'A Report on Municipal and Government Ice Plants,' submitted to the Borough President of Manhattan, December 15, 1913. \n[\nFootnote 19\n] See Willard L. Thorp, 'The Integration of Industrial Operation,' United States Census Monographs, III, 1924, pp. 49, 50. Neither consolidation of ownership nor increase in production has had the effect of greatly increasing the size of plants in the ice business. Thus in Oklahoma in 1927 there were only twenty plants manufacturing ice for sale which had a capacity exceeding 200 tons a day, of which eight were in Oklahoma City and Tulsa. Ice and Refrigeration Blue Book (10th Ed.) pp. 1268-1288. \n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] Several reasons were given in the testimony for this localization of the ice business. Freight rates on ice are high in proportion to value. Handling charges are doubled if the ice is put in cold storage at the point of consignment; and, if kept in the car, the ice loses in weight and deteriorates in quality during the period of a week or more before a carload will be exhausted in a small community. Shrinkage of course varies with the weather, but is at all times considerable. \n[\nFootnote 21\n] Oklahoma is predominantly a state of rural population. Only 34.3 per cent. of its inhabitants live in towns or cities of more than 2,500. Fifteenth Census of the United States, vol. I, p. 15. It has only four cities over 25,000; 12 cities from 10,000 to 25,000; and 52 cities from 2, 500 to 10,000. There are 444 incorporated places of less than 2,500.

Ada Ice & Fuel Co., 2d & 3d Ann. Rep. Okla. Corp. Comm., p. 358. \n[\nFootnote 24\n] The Ice and Refrigeration Blue Book for 1927 shows that of 142 communities containing ice plants manufacturing ice for sale, at least 112 were served either by a single plant or by several plants of common ownership. See pp. 1268-1288, 1645 et seq. There is evidence in the record that it was common practice for manufacturing establishments of different ownership to make use of a jointly owned delivery company. Out of 217 plants listed as engaged in manufacturing ice for sale, 101 were owned by corporations owning or controlling other plants within or without the state.

Two conspicuous examples are ice plants and cotton compresses. Chapter 93, Session Laws, 1915, extends the jurisdiction of the Corporation Commission over water, heat, light, and power companies, but does not include ice plants. Numerous complaints are received by the Commission each year as to extortionate practices of ice companies and exorbitant prices charged. The same jurisdiction should be given the Corporation Commission over ice plants as it exercises over gas, electric and water companies.'\n In its Eleventh Annual Report, October 3, 1918, p. xxii, it was said: 'The business of manufacturing and distributing ice is as much a matter of public concern as is the business of rendering water, electric or gas service and should be subject to the same regulation. Complaints are continuously being made to the Commission in reference to prices of ice, practices of ice companies, or service rendered by such companies, and the Commission has frequently been called upon to exercise jurisdiction under the so-called Anti-Trust Laws. Specific legislation should be enacted in reference to these companies and the power of regulation should be made definite and certain.'\n Again, in the Twelfth Annual Report, November 18, 1919, p. 1: 'During the past summer season numerous complaints against practices and rates of ice utilities have arisen from at least a hundred towns and cities throughout the State. The same jurisdiction should be given the Corporation Commission over ice plants as it exercises over gas, electric and water companies.' \n\n[\nFootnote 37\n] Besides continuing in effect order No. 1906, supra note 33, the commission has issued further general orders pertaining particularly to accounting practices. Order No. 3843, 20th Ann. Rep. Okla. Corp. Comm., p. 562. In the following cases it has prescribed rates: In re Application of Marietta Ice & Water Co., 22d Ann.

Kaw City Ice & Power Co., 23d Ann. Rep., p. 558, the defendant's permit to distribute ice in the town of Shidler was revoked upon a showing that it distributed during the summer months only and that the plaintiff's local plant was operated throughout the year, was adequate to meet local needs, and could not be maintained in the face of the defendant's competition.

Frederick A. Henry, of Cleveland, Ohio, and Wm. J. Hughes, Jr ., and Wm. E. Leahy, both of Washington, D.C., for appellant.\n\n\n[287 U.S. 12, 19]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Daniel W.

Co. and others.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On July 2, 1929, the Interstate Commerce Commission made an order authorizing the New York Central Railroad Company to acquire control, by lease, of the railroad systems of the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago & St. Louis Railway Company (known as the 'Big Four') and of the Michigan Central Railroad Company. By order of December 2, 1929, the Commission permitted the assumption by the lessee of obligation and liability in respect of certain securities of the lessors. In this suit, a minority stockholder of each of the lessors, and of the lessee, sought to set aside these orders upon the ground that the Commission had exceeded its authority. The District Court, of three judges, upon pleadings and proofs, and having filed findings of fact and conclusions of law, denied the motion for injunction and dismissed the petition upon the merits. 54 F.(2d) 122. The petitioner appeals. U.S. Code tit. 28,  47, 345 (28 USCA  47, 345).\n The District Court, against objection, sustained its jurisdiction. The court took the view that the petitioner, \n\n[287 U.S. 12, 20]\n\u00a0\n as a minority stockholder of the lessors, alleged an injury not merely derivative, but independent, being a member of a class created by the leasing agreements. 54 F.(2d) at page 126; compare Pittsburgh & West Virginia Railway Co. v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 479, 487\n, 50 S.Ct. 378. While appellees submit that there are certain contentions which appellant may not properly raise, the correctness of the decision as to jurisdiction is conceded.\n The authority of the Commission to make the orders is rested upon section 5, subdivision 2, and section 20a of the Interstate Commerce Act. U.S. Code, tit 49.1 After full hearing, and upon consideration of the purpose of the proposals, of the physical, traffic, and intercorporate relationships, of investment, income, and dividends, of the provisions of the proposed leases, of the benefits deemed to accrue to the public, of the particular situation of certain short lines, and of the objections raised by minority stockhold- \n\n[287 U.S. 12, 21]\n\u00a0\n ers, the Commission found that the 'considerations and terms and conditions' set forth in the proposed leases were 'just and reasonable' and that the contemplated acquisition would be 'in the public interest.' The authorization was upon the express condition that before the leases became effective, the New York Central should offer to acquire specified short lines upon terms and conditions stated. Report, January 14, 1929, 150 I.C.C. 278, 321, 322. Upon proof of compliance with this condition, and upon further conditions, the acquisition was approved. Supplemental Report and Order of July 2, 1929, 154 I.C.C. 489, 494, 495. One of the conditions was that the New York Central and the 'Big Four' should not be relieved from compliance with provisions of law applicable to any assumption of obligations and liabilities by virtue of the execution of the leases. On later appli- \n\n[287 U.S. 12, 22]\n\u00a0\n cation for authority in that respect, the Commission found that the proposed assumption by the carriers was 'for a lawful object within their respective corporate purposes, and compatible with the public interest, which is necessary and appropriate for and consistent with the proper performance by them of service to the public as common carriers, and which will not impair their ability to perform that service' and was 'reasonably necessary and appropriate for such purpose.' Report and Order of December 2, 1929, 158 I.C.C. 317, 323, 328.\n Appellant contends (a) that as the New York Central had already acquired control of the 'Big Four' and Michigan Central by stock ownership, the Commission could not authorize acquisition of control by lease; (b) that the proposed acquisition involved a 'consolidation' which could not be authorized under section 5(2); (c) that the main lines of the lessors are parallel and competing with those of the lessee so that competition would be suppressed, and that the attempt to confer authority upon the Commission to approve the acquisition of control was an unconstitutional delegation of power; (d) that the proposed leases transgressed limitations imposed by state authority; and (e) that the action of the Commission was unsupported by evidence and was arbitrary and confiscatory as to the appellant. The questions presented thus relate, in part, to the construction and validity of the statute and, in part, to the present application of the statute in view of the particular terms of the leases.\n First. The Commission stated that, while the properties of the New York Central, the 'Big Four' and the Michigan Central are operated as separate units, the companies are under common control. This control has existed for many years. The Commission found that the New York Central held upwards of 99 per cent. of the stock of the Michigan Central and upwards of 91 per cent. and 84 per cent., respectively, of the common and \n\n[287 U.S. 12, 23]\n\u00a0\n preferred stocks of the 'Big Four.' The authority to lease was sought in the view that it would facilitate revision of routes, and physical improvements needed for new routes, and would make possible important economies in operation which the Commission set forth in detail. Section 5( 2) authorizes the acquisition of control 'to the extent indicated by the commission.' The question is not of the extent of the control, provided it stops short of 'consolidation,' but of the public interest in having the control maintained. The public interest is served by economy and efficiency in operation. If the expected advantages are inadequately secured by stock ownership and would be better secured by lease, the statute affords no basis for the contention that the latter may not be authorized although the former exists. The fact that one precedes the other cannot be regarded as determinative if the desired co-ordination is not otherwise obtainable. The disjunctive phrasing of the statute 'either under a lease or by the purchase of stock' must be read in the light of its obvious purpose and cannot be taken to mean that one method must be exclusive of the other.\n The statute refers to 'control' in contradistinction to 'consolidation.' Subdivision (2) itself indicates that control by purchase of stock or by lease is not regarded as a 'consolidation' as the word is there used. Its use is in the restricted sense of the formation of a 'single system for ownership' as well as for 'operation.' This distinction between control where separate ownership continues, and consolidation where a single ownership is created, is a familiar one in the law. Atlantic & G.R. Co. v. Georgia, \n98 U.S. 359\n, 363. That the Congress had this distinction in view appears from the other provisions of section 5. Thus, subdivision (6) permits carriers 'to consolidate their properties or any part thereof, into one corporation for the ownership, management, and operation of the properties theretofore in separate ownership, man- \n\n[287 U.S. 12, 24]\n\u00a0\n agement, and operation.' This may be effected under stated conditions which contemplate the ownership by one corporation of the consolidated properties and the issue of securities upon that basis. The view that the proposed acquisition does not involve a 'consolidation' contrary to the limitation in subdivision (2) is in accord with the long-continued construction of the statute by the Interstate Commerce Commission. Control of El Paso & S.W. System, 90 I.C.C. 732; Control of Alabama & Vicksburg, etc., 111 I.C.C. 161, 169; Lease of Pan Handle, 72 I.C.C. 128, 133; New York Central Leases, 72 I.C.C. 243; Control of Central Pacific, 76 I.C.C. 508; Nickel Plate Unification, 105 I.C.C. 425. And this administrative construction would be persuasive if the statute could be regarded as ambiguous. United States v. Jackson, \n280 \nU.S. 183, 193\n, 50 S.Ct. 143; Louisville & Nashville R.R. Co. v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 740, 757\n, 51 S.Ct. 297. Whether the particular authorization, in the light of the situation of these carriers, would interfere with plans of the Commission for consolidation was an administrative question with which the Commission was competent to deal.\n Appellant insists that the delegation of authority to the Commission is invalid because the stated criterion is uncertain. That criterion is the 'public interest.' It is a mistaken assumption that this is a mere general reference to public welfare without any standard to guide determinations. The purpose of the Act, the requirements it imposes, and the context of the provision in question show the contrary. Going forward from a policy mainly directed to the prevention of abuses, particularly those arising from excessive or discriminatory rates, Transportation Act 1920 (41 Stat. 456), was designed better to assure adequacy in transportation service. This Court, in New England Divisions Case, \n261 \nU.S. 184, 189\n, 190 S., 43 S.Ct. 270, 273, adverted to that purpose, which was found to be expressed in unequivocal language: 'to attain it, new rights, new \n\n[287 U.S. 12, 25]\n\u00a0\n obligations, new machinery, were created.' The Court directed attention to various provisions having this effect, and to the criteria which the statute had established in referring to 'the transportation needs of the public,' 'the necessity ... of enlarging (transportation) facilities,' and the measures which would 'best promote the service in the interest of the public and the commerce of the people.' Id. page 189 of 261 U.S., 43 S. Ct. 270, 273, note. See, also, Texas & Pacific Rwy. Co. v. Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Rwy. Co., \n270 \nU.S. 266, 277\n, 46 S.Ct. 263. The provisions now before us were among the additions made by Transportation Act, 1920, and the term 'public interest' as thus used is not a concept without ascertainable criteria, but has direct relation to adequacy of transportation service, to its essential conditions of economy and efficiency, and to appropriate provision and best use of transportation facilities, questions to which the Interstate Commerce Commission has constantly addressed itself in the exercise of the authority conferred. So far as constitutional delegation of authority is concerned, the question is not essentially different from that which is raised by provisions with respect to reasonableness of rates, to discrimination, and to the issue of certificates of public convenience and necessity. Intermountain Rate Case, \n234 \nU.S. 476, 486\n, 34 S.Ct. 986; Railroad Commission of California v. Southern Pacific Company, \n264 \nU.S. 331, 343\n, 344 S., 44 S.Ct. 376; Avent v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 127, 130\n, 45 S.Ct. 34; Colorado v. United States, \n271 \nU.S. 153, 163\n, 46 S.Ct. 452; Chesapeake & Ohio Rwy. Co. v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 35, 42\n, 51 S.Ct. 337.\n The fact that the carriers' lines are parallel and competing cannot be deemed to affect the validity of the authority conferred upon the Commission. The Congress, which had power to impose prohibitions in the regulation of interstate commerce (Northern Securities Company v. United States, \n193 \nU.S. 197\n, 24 S.Ct. 436), had equal power to foster that commerce by removing prohibitions and by permitting acquisition of control where that was found to be an aid \n\n[287 U.S. 12, 26]\n\u00a0\n in the accomplishment of the purposes in view in the enactment of Transportation Act, 1920. See New York v. United States, \n257 \nU.S. 591, 601\n, 42 S.Ct. 239; Colorado v. United States, \n271 \nU.S. 153, 165\n, 46 S.Ct. 452. Exercising this paramount power, the Congress expressly provided in subdivision (8) of section 5, which has direct reference to subdivision (2), that 'the carriers affected by any order made under the foregoing provisions of this section' are 'relieved from the operation of the 'antitrust laws,\" and 'of all other restraints or prohibitions by law, State or Federal, in so far as may be necessary to enable them to do anything authorized or required by any order made under and pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this section.' The question whether the acquisition of control in the case of competing carriers will aid in preventing an injurious waste and in securing more efficient transportation service is thus committed to the judgment of the administrative agency upon the facts developed in the particular case.\n Appellant contends that the provision of subdivision \n\n[287 U.S. 12, 8]\n\u00a0\n of section 5, referring to 'restraints or prohibitions by law, State or Federal' should be construed as limited to those restrictions which are of the same general character as the 'antitrust laws' and not as applying to specific limitations imposed by state laws upon corporate powers with respect to the making of leases. Appellant invokes the laws of the states of incorporation in relation to leases of competing lines, and especially the laws of Ohio upon that subject and with respect to minimum rentals and security for payment and the preservation of property. It is sufficient for the present purpose to say that this contention cannot, in any event, avail the appellant. The question of the right of a state of incorporation, in a direct proceeding, to challenge the leases as ultra vires is not before us. See Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago & St. Louis Rwy. Co. v. United States, \n275 \nU.S. 404, 414\n, 48 S.Ct. 189. The order of the Commission under section 5(2) is permissive, not man- \n\n[287 U.S. 12, 27]\n\u00a0\n datory. There is no warrant for concluding that the Congress intended to fetter the exercise of the Commission's authority by requiring that the Commission before making its order must determine whether the acquisition is within the corporate powers of the carrier under state laws. The Commission has given its approval in the exercise of the authority conferred and the question of corporate powers cannot properly be raised in this suit to set aside the Commission's order. Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago & St. Louis Rwy. Co. v. United States, supra; Claiborne-Annapolis Ferry Co. v. United States, \n285 \nU.S. 382, 391\n, 52 S.Ct. 440.\n Nor is there ground for a different conclusion with respect to the Commission's order under section 20a, authorizing the assumption of obligations. Appellant points to the requirement in that section that the Commission shall make such an order only if it finds that the assumption by the carrier is 'for some lawful object within its corporate purposes.' But that this provision does not refer to state limitations upon corporate powers, but rather to the general field of corporate purposes, sufficiently appears from the context and from the legislative history of the clause. In creating federal supervision of the issue of securities by interstate carriers, the Congress, so far from making it necessary for the Commission to determine whether there had been compliance with state requirements, expressly provided in subdivision (7) of section 20a that the jurisdiction of the Commission should be 'exclusive and plenary' and that approval, other than as specified in that section, should not be necessary. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[287 U.S. 12, 28]\n\u00a0\n Another objection, urged against the order under section 5(2), is that the Commission had no power to make the acquisition of certain short lines a condition of its approval of the leases. The condition is asserted to be a burdensome one, opposed by the New York Central when it made its application and involving the building up of an enlarged system. But section 5(2) expressly authorized the Commission to impose conditions, and its action in so doing was not limited to conditions proposed or favored by the carriers. The Commission stated the facts as to each of the short lines (150 I.C.C. pages 294-311) and the Commission found that those lines to which the condition relates were complementary to the New York Central System and that their preservation was 'required by public convenience and necessity and for the maintenance of an adequate transportation system.' Id., page 322 of 150 I.C.C. It cannot be said that the consideration of the situation of these short lines was not appropriate to the determination which the Commission was called upon to make or that the condition was arbitrarily imposed.\n Second. Questions as to the alleged stockholder of the Michigan Central, of its fiduciary duty to the appellant as minority stockholder, in the light of the terms of the indenture under which the voted shares had been pledged to secure bonds, are not properly raised in this suit under the Urgent- \n\n[287 U.S. 12, 29]\n\u00a0\n Deficiencies Act (U.S. Code, tit. 28,  47) and hence are not open to review on this appeal. Pittsburgh & West Virginia Railway Co. v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 479, 488\n, 50 S.Ct. 378.\n The remaining questions with respect to the adequacy of the rentals fixed, the other terms of the proposed leases, and the public interests involved, relate to the propriety of the action of the Commission in the exercise of its authority under the statute as construed. As to these matters the parties were fully heard, pertinent evidence was received and considered, and we find no basis for a contention that the order of the Commission was not adequately supported or had any confiscatory effect. Virginian Railway Co. v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 658, 663\n, 47 S.Ct. 222; Georgia Commission v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 765, 775\n, 51 S. Ct. 619\n\n\n Decree affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The pertinent provisions of these sections are as follows:\n's 5, par. (2) Acquisition of control of one carrier by another. Whenever the commission is of opinion, after hearing, upon application of any carrier or carriers engaged in the transportation of passengers or property subject to this chapter, that the acquisition, to the extent indicated by the commission, by one of such carriers of the control of any other such carrier or carriers either under a lease or by the purchase of stock or in any other manner not involving the consolidation of such carriers into a single system for ownership and operation, will be in the public interest, the commission shall have authority by order to approve and authorize such acquisition, under such rules and regulations and for such consideration and on such terms and conditions as shall be found by the commission to be just and reasonable in the premises.'\n\n's 5, par.

The commission shall make such order only if it finds that such issue or assumption: (a) is for some lawful object within its corporate purposes, and compatible with the public interest, which is necessary or appropriate for or consistent with the proper performance by the carrier of service to the public as a common carrier, and which will not impair its ability to perform that service, and (b) is reasonably necessary and appropriate for such purpose. ...' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] It appears that in the course of the consideration of the measure which ultimately became section 20a(2), the words 'corporate purposes' were substituted for 'corporate powers.' 54 F.(2d) at page 130, note. It should also be noted that, in connection with the provision which became subdivision (7) of section 20a, an amendment was offered in the House of Representatives to strike out that paragraph and to provide that no security should be issued under the Act 'except in the manner and form prescribed by the laws of the state which created such common carrier, and that this section is not to be construed as a limitation of state authority, but only as cumulative thereof.'

BEZUE(1932)\nNo. 263\nArgued: January 7, 1932Decided: January 25, 1932\n\n\n\n\n[284 U.S. 415, 416]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Edward R. Brumley and John M. Gibbons, both of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. Thomas J. O'Neill, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n\n\n[284 U.S. 415, 417]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The respondent was injured while in the employ of petitioner, an interstate carrier. He brough suit under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (45 USCA  51-59) in the Supreme Court of New York and recovered a judgment which was affirmed by the Appellate Division and the Court of Appeals. \n1\n Petitioner urges that at the time of respondent's injury his work was not in interstate commerce within the intendment of the statute.\n At Maybrook, N. Y., the westerly terminus of a branch of the railroad, petitioner maintains a roundhouse, a machine shop, a carpenter shop, and a so-called hoist building containing four tracks with two pits, a hoist of large capacity for raising engines, a lathe for repairing driving wheels, apparatus for electric welding, tool room, and electrical shop. These facilities are used largely for \n\n[284 U.S. 415, 418]\n\u00a0\n servicing and repairing locomotives engaged in interstate transportation. The respondent had been employed at this terminal for about a year, at first as an engine wiper; later, and at the time of the accident, as a member of a general unskilled labor gang. His principal work was the operation of an electric truck with which he transported materials from one portion of the plant to another. By means of this truck, and sometimes without it, he was accustomed to assist in various minor repairs to locomotives brought into the terminal, such as lifting driving rods, pumps, journal boxes, draw bars, assisting in greasing, or greasing, engines, and other work of a similar nature. On the morning of September 2, 1929, he was not using the truck, but pursuant to an order of the foreman of the gang joined other workmen in removing a pair of main driving wheels from a lathe in the hoist building and rolling them along the tracks in the yard to an engine pit where they were to be installed in a locomotive which had arrived at the terminal August 23, and had been set aside for the customary boiler wash given all engines every thirty days. Preparatory to the boiler wash, an inspection was made and orders were issued for certain work, which included the removal of the main driving wheels and shifting them to the hoist shop so that the journal might be turned, the transfer of several parts to the machine shop, the separation of the jacket from the fire box, the replacement of some four hundred seventeen leaking bolts, the renewal of bushings, and other items requiring skilled labor. The fire was dumped, the main driving wheels and other portions needing attention were removed, and the engine was left inert and incapable of locomotion.\n The boiler wash and repairs consumed twelve days. On the ninth day, the turning of the journal on the main drivers having been completed, the respondent, on orders of his foreman, joined others of the unskilled labor gang \n\n[284 U.S. 415, 419]\n\u00a0\n in removing the main driving wheels from the lathe in the hoist shop, placing them upon a track, and pushing them by hand to the turntable, which was then connected with another track into which the men pushed the wheels preparatory to moving them to a pit in the roundhouse where they could be placed under the locomotive. During this work respondent was injured, as has been found, by the negligence of the foreman in removing a block from under the wheels.\n The state court held that the terminal facilities in which respondent worked constitute a part of the railroad's system necessary to the operation of the road and to the conduct of interstate commerce; that the fact that some work is there done on locomotives engaged in intrastate commerce does not deprive the establishment of its character as an essential instrumentality of interstate commerce; that the respondent was engaged in a 'plant service,' and worked indiscriminately upon engines engaged in interstate and intrastate commerce. The conclusion was that the nature and purpose of the plant warranted characterization of all respondent's work, of whatever nature, as in interstate commerce.\n The test thus applied broader than our decisions justify. All work performed in railroad employment may, in a sense, be said to be necessary to the operation of the road. The business could not be conducted without repair shop employees, clerks, janitors, mechanics, and those who operate all manner of appliance not directly or intimately concerned with interstate transportation as such, or with facilities actually used therein. But we have held that the mere fact of employment does not bring such employees within the act. Del. Lack. & W. R. R. v. Yurkonis, \n238 \nU.S. 439\n, 35 S. Ct. 902; Chicago, B. & Q. R. R. v.

Bolle, \n284 \nU.S. 74\n, 52 S. Ct. 59 (decided November 23, 1931).\n The criterion of applicability of the statute is the employee's occupation at the time of his injury in interstate transportation or work so closely related thereto as to be practically a part of it. Shanks v. Del. Lack. & Western R. R., \n239 \nU.S. 556, 558\n, 36 S. Ct. 188, L. R. A. 1916C, 797; Chicago & E. I. R. R. Co. v. Industrial Comm., 52 S. Ct. 151 (decided January 4, 1932). Under the circumstances of this case, whether respondent is within the act must be decided, not by reference to the kind of plant in which he worked, or the charater of labor he usually performed, but by determining whether the locomotive in question was, at the time of the accident, in use in interstate transportation or had been taken out of it. The length of the period during which the locomotive was withdrawn from service and the extent of the repairs bring the case within the principle announced in Industrial Accident Comm. v. Davis, supra, and Minneapolis & St. Louis R. Co. v. Winters, \n242 \nU.S. 353\n, 37 S. Ct. 170, Ann. Cas. 1918B, 54, stamp the engine as no longer an instrumentality of or intimately connected with interstate activity, and distinguish such cases as New York Cent. R. Co. v. Marcone, \n281 \nU.S. 345\n, 50 S. Ct. 294, where the injured employee was oiling a locomotive which had shortly before entered the roundhouse after completing an interstate run.\n Respondent endeavors to support the claim that here the instrumentality had not been taken out of interstate commerce, by reference to the practice of petitioner, which is that work, sometimes greater and often less in amount than in this case, is done at Maybrook in connection with the monthly boiler wash; whereas, after a locomotive has run thirty-five thousand miles, or eighteen months, it is marked for out of service repairs, and is sent to petitioner's general repair shop at Readville, Mass. The argument is that the railroad company thus recognizes that such work as is done at Maybrook in conjunction with boiler washing is incidental and does not take the engine out of service. \n\n[284 U.S. 415, 421]\n\u00a0\n We do not think this custom warrants a disregard of the proved facts, and the adoption of an artificial classification of the locomotive as one in service at the time of respondent's injury. The judgment must be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 232 App. Div. 840, 248 N. Y.

Herndon, \n273 \nU.S. 536\n, 47 S. Ct. 446, decided at the October term, 1926, this court had before it a statute of the state of Texas (article 3093a, Revised Statutes 1911 as added by Acts 38th Leg., 2d Called Sess. (1923), c. 32,  1 afterwards numbered 3107 ( Vernon's Ann. Civ. St.)) whereby the Legislature had said that 'in no event shall a negro be eligible to participate in a Democratic party primary election (held in that State),' and that, 'should a negro vote in a Democratic primary election, such ballot shall be void,' and election officials were directed to throw it out. While that mandate was in force, the negro was shut out from a share in primary elections, not in obedience to the will of the party speaking through the party organs, but by the command of the state itself, speaking by the voice of its chosen representatives. At the suit of this petitioner, the statute was adjudged void as an infringement of his rights and liberties under the Constitution of the United States.\n Promptly after the announcement of that decision, the Legislature of Texas enacted a new statute (Acts 1927, 1st Called Sess., c. 67 (Vernon's Ann. Civ. St. art. 3107)) \n\n[286 U.S. 73, 82]\n\u00a0\n repealing the article condemned by this court; declaring that the effect of the decision was to create an emergency with a need for immediate action; and substituting for the article so repealed another bearing the same number. By the article thus substituted, 'every political party in this State through its State Executive Committee shall have the power to prescribe the qualifications of its own members and shall in its own way determine who shall be qualified to vote or otherwise participate in such political party; provided that no person shall ever be denied the right to participate in a primary in this State because of former political views or affiliations or because of membership or non-membership in organizations other than the political party.'\n Acting under the new statute, the state executive committee of the Democratic party adopted a resolution 'that all white democrats who are qualified under the constitution and laws of Texas and who subscribe to the statutory pledge provided in Article 3110, Revised Civil Statutes of Texas, and none other, be allowed to participate in the primary elections to be held July 28, 1928, and August 25, 1928,' and the chairman and secretary were directed to forward copies of the resolution to the committees in the several counties.\n On July 28, 1928, the petitioner, a citizen of the United States, and qualified to vote unless disqualified by the foregoing resolution, presented himself at the polls and requested that he be furnished with a ballot. The respondents, the judges of election, declined to furnish the ballot or to permit the vote on the ground that the petitioner was a negro, and that by force of the resolution of the executive committee only white Democrats were allowed to be voters at the Democratic primary. The refusal was followed by this action for damages. In the District Court there was a judgment of dismissal, 34 F. \n\n[286 U.S. 73, 83]\n\u00a0\n (2d) 464, 468, which was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Firth Circuit, 49 F.(2d) 1012, 1013. A writ of certiorari brings the cause here.\n Barred from voting at a primary the petitioner has been, and this for the sole reason that his color is not white. The result for him is no different from what it was when his cause was here before. The argument for the respondents is, however, that identity of result has been attained through essential diversity of method. We are reminded that the Fourteenth Amendment is a restraint upon the states and not upon private persons unconnected with a state. United States v. Cruikshank, \n92 U.S. 542\n; Strauder v. West Virginia, \n100 U.S. 303\n; Ex parte Virginia, \n100 U.S. 339\n, 346; James v. Bowman, \n190 \nU.S. 127, 136\n, 23 S. Ct. 678. This line of demarcation drawn, we are told that a political party is merely a voluntary association; that it has inherent power like voluntary associations generally to determine its own membership; that the new article of the statute, adopted in place of the mandatory article of exclusion condemned by this court, has no other effect than to restore to the members of the party the power that would have been theirs if the lawmakers had been silent; and that qualifications thus established are as far aloof from the impact of constitutional restraint as those for membership in a golf club or for admission to a Masonic lodge.\n Whether a political party in Texas has inherent power to-day without restraint by any law to determine its own membership, we are not required at this time either to affirm or to deny. The argument for the petitioner is that, quite apart from the article in controversy, there are other provisions of the Election Law whereby the privilege of unfettered choice has been withdrawn or abridged (citing, e. g., articles 2955, 2975, 3100, 3104, 3105, 3110, 3121, Revised Civil Statutes); that nomination \n\n[286 U.S. 73, 84]\n\u00a0\n at a primary is in many circumstances required by the statute if nomination is to be made at all (article 3101); that parties and their representatives have become the custodians of official power (article 3105 ); and that, if heed is to be given to the realities of political life, they are now agencies of the state, the instruments by which government becomes a living thing. In that view, so runs the argument, a party is still free to define for itself the political tenets of its members, but to those who profess its tenets there may be no denial of its privileges.\n A narrower base will serve for our judgment in the cause at hand. Whether the effect of Texas legislation has been to work so complete a transformation of the concept of a political party as a voluntary association, we do not now decide. Nothing in this opinion is to be taken as carrying with it an intimation that the court is ready or unready to follow the petitioner so far. As to that, decision must be postponed until decision becomes necessary. Whatever our conclusion might be if the statute had remitted to the party the untrammeled power to prescribe the qualifications of its members, nothing of the kind was done. Instead, the statute lodged the power in a committee, which excluded the petitioner and others of his race, not by virtue of any authority delegated by the party, but by virtue of an authority originating or supposed to originate in the mandate of the law.\n We recall at this point the wording of the statute invoked by the respondents. 'Every political party in this State through its State Executive Committee shall have the power to prescribe the qualifications of its own members and shall in its own way determine who shall be qualified to vote or otherwise participate in such political party.' Whatever inherent power a state political party has to determine the content of its membership resides in the state convention. Bryce, Modern Democracies, vol. \n\n[286 U.S. 73, 85]\n\u00a0\n 2, p. 40. There platforms of principles are announced and the tests of party allegiance made known to the world. What is true in that regard of parties generally is true more particularly in Texas, where the statute is explicit in committing to the state convention the formulation of the party faith (article 3139). The state executive committee, if it is the sovereign organ of the party, is not such by virtue of any powers inherent in its being. It is, as its name imports, a committee and nothing more, a committee to be chosen by the convention and to consist of a chairman and thirty-one members, one from each senatorial district of the state ( article 3139). To this committee the statute here in controversy has attempted to confide authority to determine of its own motion the requisites of party membership and in so doing to speak for the party as a whole. Never has the state convention made declaration of a will to bar negroes of the state from admission to the party ranks. Counsel for the respondents so conceded upon the hearing in this court. Whatever power of exclusion has been exercised by the members of the committee has come to them, therefore, not as the delegates of the party, but as the delegates of the state. Indeed, adherence to the statute leads to the conclusion that a resolution once adopted by the committee must continue to be binding upon the judges of election though the party in convention may have sought to override it, unless the committee, yielding to the moral force of numbers, shall revoke its earlier action and obey the party will. Power so intrenched is statutory, not inherent. If the state had not conferred it, there would be hardly color of right to give a basis for its exercise.\n Our conclusion in that regard is not affected by what was ruled by the Supreme Court of Texas in Love v. Wilcox, 119 Tex. 256, 28 S.W.(2d) 515, 523, or by the Court of Civil Appeals in White v. Lubbock, 30 S.W.(2d) 722. \n\n[286 U.S. 73, 86]\n\u00a0\n The ruling in the first case was directed to The ruling in the first case was directed to the party nor the committee is to be permitted to make former political affiliations the test of party regularity. There were general observations in the opinion as to the functions of parties and committees. They do not constitute the decision. The decision was merely this, that 'the committee, whether viewed as an agency of the state or as a mere agency of the party, is not authorized to take any action which is forbidden by an express and valid statute.' The ruling in the second case, which does not come from the highest court of the state, upholds the constitutionality of section 3107 as amended in 1927 (Vernon's Ann. Civ. St. art. 3107), and speaks of the exercise of the inherent powers of the party by the act of its proper officers. There is nothing to show, however, that the mind of the court was directed to the point that the members of a committee would not have been the proper officers to exercise the inherent powers of the party if the statute had not attempted to clothe them with that quality. The management of the affairs of a group already associated together as members of a party is obviously a very different function from that of determining who the members of the group shall be. If another view were to be accepted, a committee might rule out of the party a faction distasteful to itself, and exclude the very men who had helped to bring it into existence. In any event, the Supreme Court of Texas has not yet spoken on the subject with clearness or finality, and nothing in its pronouncements brings us to the belief that, in the absence of a statute or other express grant, it would recognize a mere committee as invested with all the powers of the party assembled in convention. Indeed, its latest decision dealing with any aspect of the statute here in controversy, a decision handed down on April 21, 1932 (Love v. Buckner (Tex. Sup.) 49 S. W.(2d) 425), describes the statute as constituting 'a grant of power' to the state executive com- \n\n[286 U.S. 73, 87]\n\u00a0\n mittee to determine who shall participate in the primary elections. \n1\n What was questioned in that case was the validity of a pledge exacted from the voters that it was their bona fide purpose to support the party nominees. The court in upholding the exaction found a basis for its ruling in another article of the Civil Statutes (article 3167), in an article of the Penal Code (article 240), and in the inherent power of the committee to adopt regulations reasonably designed to give effect to the obligation assumed by an elector in the very act of voting. To clinch the argument, the court then added that, if all these sources of authority were inadequate, the Legislature had made in article 3107 an express 'grant of power' to determine qualifications generally. There is no suggestion in the opinion that the inherent power of the committee was broad enough ( apart from legislation) to permit it to prescribe the extent of party membership, to say to a group of voters, ready as was the petitioner to take the statutory pledge, that one class should be eligible and another not. On the contrary, the whole opinion is instinct with the concession that pretensions so extraordinary must find their warrant in a statute. The most that can be said for the respondents is that the inherent powers of the committee are still unsettled in the local courts. Nothing in the state of the decisions requires us to hold that they have been settled in a manner that would be subversive of the fundamental postulates of party organization. The suggestion is offered that in default of in \n\n[286 U.S. 73, 88]\n\u00a0\n herent power or of statutory grant the committee may have been armed with the requisite authority by vote of the convention. Neither at our bar nor on the trial was the case presented on that theory. At every stage of the case the assumption has been made that authority, if there was any, was either the product of the statute or was inherent in the committee under the law of its creation.\n We discover no significance, and surely no significance favorable to the respondents, in earlier acts of legislation whereby the power to prescribe additional qualifications was conferred on local committees in the several counties of the state. Laws 1903, c. 101,  94. The very fact that such legislation was thought necessary is a token that the committees were without inherent power. We do not impugn the competence of the Legislature to designate the agencies whereby the party faith shall be declared and the party discipline enforced. The pith of the matter is simply this, that, when those agencies are invested with an authority independent of the will of the association in whose name they undertake to speak, they become to that extent the organs of the state itself, the repositories of official power. They are then the governmental instruments whereby parties are organized and regulated to the end that government itself may be established or continued. What they do in that relation, they must do in submission to the mandates of equality and liberty that bind officials everywhere. They are not acting in matters of merely private concern like the directors or agents of business corporations. They are acting in matters of high public interest, matters intimately connected with the capacity of government to exercise its functions unbrokenly and smoothly. Whether in given circumstances parties or their committees are agencies of government within the Fourteenth or the Fifteenth Amendment is a question which this court will determine \n\n[286 U.S. 73, 89]\n\u00a0\n for itself. It is not concluded upon such an inquiry by decisions rendered elsewhere. The test is not whether the members of the executive committee are the representatives of the state in the strict sense in which an agent is the representative of his principal. The test is whether they are to be classified as representatives of the state to such an extent and in such a sense that the great restraints of the Constitution set limits to their action.\n With the problem thus laid bare and its essentials exposed to view, the case is seen to be ruled by Nixon v. Herndon, supra. Delegates of the state's power have discharged their official functions in such a way as to discriminate invidiously between white citizens and black. Ex parte Virginia, supra; Buchanan v. Warley, \n245 \nU.S. 60, 77\n, 38 S. Ct. 16, L. R. A. 1918C, 210, Ann. Cas. 1918A, 1201. The Fourteenth Amendment, adopted as it was with special solicitude for the equal protection of members of the Negro race, lays a duty upon the court to level by its judgment these barriers of color.\n The judgment below is reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n\n Separate opinion of Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS.\n March 15, 1929, petitioner here brought suit for damages in the United States District Court, Western Division of Texas, against Condon and Kolle, theretofore judges in a Democratic primary election. He claims they wrongfully deprived him of rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, Federal Constitution, by denying him the privilege of voting therein. Upon motion the trial court dismissed the petition, holding that it failed to state a cause of action; the Circuit Court of Appeals sustained this ruling. The matter is here by certiorari.\n The original petition, or declaration, alleges:\n L. A. Nixon, a negro citizen of the United States and of Texas, duly registered and qualified to vote in precinct \n\n[286 U.S. 73, 90]\n\u00a0\n No. 9, El Paso county, at the general election, and a member of the Democratic party, was entitled to participate in the primary election held by that party July 28, 1928, for nominating candidates for state and other offices. He duly presented himself and sought to cast his ballot. Defendants, the judges, refused his request by reason of the following resolution theretofore adopted by the State Democratic Executive Committee:\n'Resolved: That all white democrats who are qualified under the Constitution and laws of Texas and who subscribe to the statutory pledge provided in Article 3110, Revised Civil Statutes of Texas, and none other, be allowed to participate in the primary elections to be held July 28, 1928, and August 25, 1928, and further, that the Chairman and secretary of the State Democratic Executive Committee be directed to forward to each Democratic County Chairman in Texas a copy of this resolution for observance.'\n\n That the quoted resolution 'was adopted by the State Democratic Executive Committee of Texas under authority of the Act of the Legislature'-chapter 67, approved June 7, 1927. Chapter 67 (Acts 1927, 1st Called Sess. (Vernon's Ann. Civ. St. art. 3107)) undertook to repeal former article 3107,2 c. 13, Rev. Civil Stat. 1925, while had been adopted in 1923, 2nd Called Sess., c. 32,  1 (article 3093a) and in lieu thereof to enact the following:\n'Article 3107 (Ch. 67, Acts 1927).-Every political party in this State through its State Executive Committee shall have the power to prescribe the qualifications of its own members and shall in its own way determine who shall be qualified to vote or otherwise participate in such political party; provided that no person shall ever be denied the right to participate in a primary in this State \n\n[286 U.S. 73, 91]\n\u00a0\n because of former political views or affiliations or because of membership or non-membership in organizations other than the political party.'\n\n That, in 1923, prior to enactment of chapter 67, the Legislature adopted article 3093a,3 Revised Civil Statutes, declaring that no negro should be eligible to participate in a Democratic party primary election. This was held invalid state action by Nixon v. Herndon, \n273 \nU.S. 536\n, 47 S. Ct. 446.\n That, when chapter 67 was adopted, only the Democratic party held primary elections in Texas, and the legislative purpose was thereby to prevent Nixon and other negroes from participating in such primaries.\n That chapter 67 and the above-quoted resolution of the executive committee are inoperative, null, and void in so far as they exclude negroes from primaries. They conflict with the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the Federal Constitution and laws of the United States.\n That there are many thousand negro Democratic voters in Texas. The state is normally overwhelmingly Democratic, and nomination by the primaries of that party is equivalent to an election. Practically there is no contest for state offices except amongst candidates for such nominations.\n That the defendants' action in denying petitioner the right to vote was unlawful, deprived him of valuable political rights, and damaged him $ 5,000. And for this sum he asks judgment. \n\n[286 U.S. 73, 92]\n\u00a0\n The trial court declared:\n'The court here holds that the state democratic executive committee of the state of Texas, at time of the passage of the resolution here complained of, was not a body corporate to which the Legislature of the state of Texas could delegate authority to legislate, and that the members of said committee were not officials of the state of Texas, holding position as officers of the state of Texas, under oath, or drawing compensation from the state, and not acting as a state governmental agency, within the meaning of the law, but only as private individuals holding such position as members of said state executive committee by virtue of action taken upon the part of members of their respective political party; and this is also true as to defendants, they acting only as representatives of such political party, viz. the Democratic party, in connection with the holding of a Democratic primary election for the nomination of candidates on the ticket of the Democratic party to be voted on at the general election, and in refusing to permit plaintiff to vote at such Democratic primary election defendants were not acting for the state of Texas, or as a governmental agency of said state.'\n\n Also, 'that the members of a voluntary association, such as a political organization, members of the Democratic party in Texas, possess inherent power to prescribe qualifications regulating membership of such organization, or political party. That this is, and was, true without reference to the passage by the Legislature of the state of Texas of said article 3107, and is not affected by the passage of said act, and such inherent power remains and exists just as if said act had never been passed.'\n The Circuit Court of Appeals said:\n'The distinction between appellant's cases, the one under the 1923 statute and the other under the 1927 statute, is that he was denied permission to vote in the former by \n\n[286 U.S. 73, 93]\n\u00a0\n state statute, and in the latter by resolution of the State Democratic Executive Committee. It is argued on behalf of appellant that this is a distinction without a difference, and that the state through its Legislature attempted by the 1927 act to do indirectly what the Supreme Court had held it was powerless to accomplish directly by the 1923 act.\n\n'We are of opinion, however, that there is a vast difference between the two statutes. The Fourteenth Amendment is expressly directed against prohibitions and restraints imposed by the states, and the Fifteenth protects the right to vote against denial or abridgment by any state or by the United States; neither operates against private individuals or voluntary associations. United States v. Cruikshank, \n92 U.S. 542\n; Virginia v. Rives, \n100 U.S. 313\n; James v. Bowman, \n190 \nU.S. 127\n, 23 S. Ct. 678.\n\n'A political party is a voluntary association, and as such has the inherent power to prescribe the qualifications of its members. The act of 1927 was not needed to confer such power; it merely recognized a power that already existed. Waples v. Marrast, 108 Tex. 5, 184 S. W. 180, L. R. A. 1917A, 253; White v. Lubbock (Tex. Civ. App.) 30 S.W.( 2d) W.(2d) 722; Grigsby v. Harris (D. C.) 27 F. 942. It did not attempt, as did the 1923 act, to exclude any voter from membership in any political party. Precinct judges of election are appointed by party executive committees, and are paid for their services out of funds that are raised by assessments upon condidates. Revised Civil Statutes of Texas, Sections 3104, 3108.'\n\n I think the judgment below is right, and should be affirmed.\n The argument for reversal is this:\n The statute-chap. 67, present article 3107-declares that every political party through its state executive committee 'shall have the power to prescribe the qualifications of its own members and shall in its own \n\n[286 U.S. 73, 94]\n\u00a0\n way determine who shall be qualified to vote or otherwise participate in such political party.' The result, it is said, is to constitute the executive committee an instrumentality of the state with power to take action, legislative in nature, concerning membership in the party. Accordingly, the attempt of the Democratic Committee to restrict voting in primaries to white people amounted to state action to that effect within the intendment of the Federal Constitution, and was void under Nixon v. Herndon, supra.\n This reasoning rests upon an erroneous view of the meaning and effect of the statute.\n In Nixon v. Herndon the Legislature in terms forbade all negroes from participating in Democratic primaries. The exclusion was the direct result of the statute, and this was declared invalid because in conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The act now challenged withholds nothing from any negro; it makes no discrimination. It recognizes power in every political party, acting through its executive committee, to prescribe qualifications for membership, provided only that none shall be excluded on account of former political views or affiliations, or membership or nonmembership in any nonpolitical organization. The difference between the two pronouncements is not difficult to discover.\n Nixon's present complaint rests upon the asserted invalidity of the resolution of the executive committee, and, in order to prevail, he must demonstrate that it amounted to direct action by the state.\n The plaintiff's petition does not attempt to show what powers the Democratic party had intrusted to its state executive committee. It says nothing of the duties of the committee as a party organ; no allegation denies that under approved rules and resolutions it may determine \n\n[286 U.S. 73, 95]\n\u00a0\n and announce qualifications for party membership. We cannot lightly suppose that it undertook to act without authority from the party. Ordinarily, between conventions party executive committees have general authority to speak and act in respect to party matters. There is no allegation that the questioned resolution failed to express the party will. For present purposes the committee's resolution must be accepted as the voice of the party.\n Petitioner insists that the committee's resolution was authorized by the state; the statute only recognizes party action, and he may not now deny that the party had spoken. The exclusion resulted from party action, and on that footing the cause must be dealt with. Petitioner has planted himself there. Whether the cause would be more substantial if differently stated we need not inquire.\n As early as 1895-chapter 34, Acts 1895-the Texas Legislature undertook through penal statutes to prevent illegal voting in political primaries, also false returns, bribery, etc. And later, many, if not all, of the general safeguards designed to secure orderly conduct of regular elections were extended to party primaries.\n By Acts of 1903 and 1905, and subsequent amendments, the Legislature directed that only official ballots should be used in all general elections. These are prepared, printed, and distributed by public officials at public expense.\n With adoption of the official ballot it became necessary to prescribe the methods for designating the candidates whose names might appear on such ballot. Three, or more, have been authorized. A party whose last candidate for Governor received 100,000 votes must select its candidate through a primary election. Where a party candidate has received less than 100,000, and more than 10,000, votes, it may designate condidates through convention or primary, as its executive committee may deter \n\n[286 U.S. 73, 96]\n\u00a0\n mine. A written petition by a specified number of voters may be used in behalf of an independent or nonpartisan candidate.\n Some of the states have undertaken to convert the direct primary into a legally regulated election. In others, Texas included, the primary is conducted largely under party rules. Expenses are borne by the party; they are met chiefly from funds obtained by assessments upon candidates. A number of states (eleven perhaps) leave the determination of one's right to participate in a primary to the party, with or without certain minimum requirements stated by statute. In 'Texas the party is free to impose and enforce the qualifications it sees fit,' subject to some definite restrictions. See Primary Elections, Merriam and Overacker, pp. 66, 72, 73.\n A 'primary election,' within the meaning of the chapter of the Texas Rev. Civil Stat. relating to nominations, 'means an election held by the members of an organized political party for the purpose of nominating the candidates of such party to be voted for at a general or special election, or to nominate the county executive officers of a party.' Article 3100; General Laws 1905 (1st Called Sess.) c. 11,  102. The statutes of the state do not and never have undertaken to define membership-who shall be regarded as a member-in a political party. They have said that membership shall not be denied to certain specified persons; otherwise, the matter has been left with the party organization.\n Since 1903 (Acts 1903, c. 101,  94,4 p. 150, 28th Leg.; Acts 1905, c. 11,  103, p. 543, 29th Leg.) the statutes of Texas have recognized the power of party executive committees to define the qualifications for membership. The Act of 1923, 2d Called Sess., c. 32,  1 (Article 3093a), and the Act \n\n[286 U.S. 73, 97]\n\u00a0\n of 1927, 1st Called Sess., c. 67,  1 (Article 3107 (Vernon's Ann. Civ. St .)), recognize the authority of the party through the executive committee, or otherwise, to specify such qualifications throughout the state. See Love v. Wilcox, 119 Tex. 256, 28 S.W.(2d) 515, 523.\n These acts and amendments also recognize the right of state and county executive committees generally to speak and act for the party concerning primaries. These committees appoint the necessary officials, provide supplies, canvass the votes, collect assessments, certify the successful candidates, pay expenses, and do whatever is required for the orderly conduct of the primaries. Their members are not state officials; they are chosen by those who compose the party; they receive nothing from the state.\n By the amendment of 1923 (2d Called Sess., c. 32), the Legislature undertook to declare that 'all qualified voters under the laws and constitution of the State of Texas who are bona fide members of the Democratic party, shall be eligible to participate in any Democratic party primary election, provided such voter complies with all laws and rules governing party primary elections; however, in no event shall a negro be eligible to participate in a Democratic party primary election held in the State of Texas.' Love v. Wilcox, supra, page 523 of 28 S.W.(2d), 119 Tex. 256. This enactment, held inoperative by Nixon v. Herndon, supra (1927), was promptly repealed.\n The courts of Texas have spoken concerning the nature of political primary elections and their relationship to the state. And, as our present concern is with parties and legislation of that state, we turn to them for enlightenment rather than to general observations by popular writers on public affairs.\n In Waples v. Marrast, 108 Tex. 5, 11, 12, 184 S. W. 180, 183, L. R. A. 1917A, 253, decided in 1916, the Supreme Court declared:\n'A political party is nothing more or less than a body of men associated for the purpose of furnishing and main- \n\n[286 U.S. 73, 98]\n\u00a0\n taining the prevalence of certain political principles or beliefs in the public policies of the government. As rivals for popular favor they strive at the general elections for the control of the agencies of the government as the means of providing a course for the government in accord with their political principles and the administration of those agencies by their own adherents. According to the soundness of their principles and the wisdom of their policies they serve a great purpose in the life of a government. But the fact remains that the objects of political organizations are intimate to those who compose them. They do not concern the general public. They directly interest, both in their conduct and in their success, only so much of the public as are comprised in their membership, and then only as members of the particular organization. They perform no governmental function. They constitute no governmental agency. The purpose of their primary elections is merely to enable them to furnish their nominees as candidates for the popular suffrage. In the interest of fair methods and a fair expression by their members of their preference in the selection of their nominees, the State may regulate such elections by proper laws, as it has done in our general primary law, and as it was competent for the Legislature to do by a proper act of the character of the one here under review. But the payment of the expenses of purely party elections is a different matter. On principle, such expenses cannot be differentiated from any other character of expense incurred in carrying out a party object, since the attainment of a party purpose-the election of its nominees at the general elections through the unified vote of the party membership, is necessarily the prime object of a party primary. ...\n\n'To provide nominees of political parties for the people to vote upon in the general elections, is not the \n\n[286 U.S. 73, 99]\n\u00a0\n business of the State. It is not the business of the State because in the conduct of the government the State knows no parties and can know none. If it is not the business of the State to see that such nominations are made, as it clearly is not, the public revenues cannot be employed in that connection. To furnish their nominees as claimants for the popular favor in the general elections is a matter which concerns alone those parties that desire to make such nominations. It is alone their concern because they alone are interested in the success of their nominees. The State, as a government, cannot afford to concern itself in the success of the nominees of any political party, or in the elective offices of the people being filled only by those who are the nominees of some political party. Political parties are political instrumentalities. They are in no sense governmental instrumentalities. The responsible duties of the State to all the people are to be performed and its high objects effected without reference to parties, and they have no part or place in the exercise by the State of its great province in governing the people.'\n\n Koy v. Schneider, 110 Tex. 369, 376, 218 S. W. 479, 480, 221 S. W. 880 (April 21, 1920): 'The act of the Legislature deals only with suffrage within the party primary or convention, which is but an instrumentality of a group of individuals for the accomplishment of party ends.' And see Id. pages 394 et seq. of 110 Tex., 218 S. W. 479, 221 S. W. 880.\n Cunningham v. McDermett, 277 S. W. 218 (Texas Court of Civil Appeals, Oct. 22, 1925): 'Appellant contends that the Legislature, by prescribing how party primaries must be conducted, turned the party into a governmental agency, and that a candidate of a primary, being the candidate of the governmental agency, should be protected from the machinations of evilly disposed persons.\n'With this proposition we cannot agree, but consider them as they were held to be by our Supreme Court in \n\n[286 U.S. 73, 100]\n\u00a0\n the case of Waples v. Marrast, 108 Tex. 5, 184 S. W. 180, L. R. A. 1917A, 253, in which Chief Justice Phillips said: 'Political parties are political instrumentalities. They are in no sense governmental instrumentalities.\"\n\n Briscoe v. Boyle, 286 S. W. 275, 276 (Texas Court of Civil Appeals, July 2, 1926): This case was decided by an inferior court while the Act of 1923, c. 32,  1, amending article 3093, was thought to be in force-before Nixon v. Herndon, supra, ruled otherwise. It must be read with that fact in mind. Among other things, the court said: 'In fine, the Legislature has in minute detail laid out the process by which political parties shall operate the statute-made machinery for making party nominations, and has so hedged this machinery with statutory regulations and restrictions as to deprive the parties and their managers of all discretion in the manipulation of that machinery.'\n Love v. Wilcox, supra, page 522 of 28 S.W.(2d), 119 Tex. 256 (Sup. Ct. May 17, 1930): 'We are not called upon to determine whether a political party has power, beyond statutory control, to prescribe what persons shall participate as voters or candidates in its conventions or primaries. We have no such state of facts before us. The respondents claim that the State Committee has this power by virtue of its general authority to manage the affairs of the party. The statute, article 3107, Complete Tex. St. 1928 (Vernon's Ann. Civ. St. art. 3107), recognizes this general authority of the State Committee, but places a limitation on the discretionary power which may be conferred on that committee by the party by declaring that, though the party through its State Executive Committee, shall have the power to prescribe the qualifications of its own members, and to determine who shall be qualified to vote and otherwise participate, yet the committee shall not exclude any one from participation in the party primaries because of former political views or affiliations, or because of member- \n\n[286 U.S. 73, 101]\n\u00a0\n ship or nonmembership in organizations other than the political party. The committee's discretionary power is further restricted by the statute directing that a single, uniform pledge be required of the primary participants. The effect of the statutes is to decline to give recognition to the lodgment of power in a State Executive Committee, to be exercised at its discretion. The statutes have recognized the right of the party to create an Executive Committee as an agency of the party, and have recognized the right of the party to confer upon that committee certain discretionary powers, but have declined to recognize the right to confer upon the committee the discretionary power to exclude from participation in the party's affairs any one because of former political views or affiliations, or because of refusal to take any other than the statutory pledge. It is obvious, we think, that the party itself never intended to confer upon its Executive Committee any such discretionary power. The party when it selected its State Committee did so with full knowledge of the statutory limitations on that committee's authority, and must be held to have selected the committee with the intent that it would act within the powers conferred, and within the limitations declared by the statute. Hence, the committee, whether viewed as an agency of the state or as a mere agency of the party, is not authorized to take any action which is forbidden by an express and valid statute.'\n Thomas B. Love, Appellant, v. Buckner and Wakefield, Appellees, 49 S. W.(2d) 425, Texas Supreme Court, April 21, 1932\n\n\n The Court of Civil Appeals certified to the Supreme Court for determination the question: 'Whether the Democratic State Executive Committee had lawful authority to require otherwise lawfully qualified and eligible Democratic voters to take the pledge specified in the resolution adopted by the Committee at its meeting in March,' 1932. \n\n[286 U.S. 73, 102]\n\u00a0\n The resolution directed that no person should be permitted to participate in any precinct or county Democratic convention held for the purpose of selecting delegates to the state convention at which delegates to the National Democratic Convention are selected, unless such person shall take a written pledge to support the nominees for President and Vice President.\n'The Court answers that the Executive Committee was authorized to require the voters to take the specified pledge.'\n\n It said:\n'The Committee's power to require a pledge is contested on the ground that the Committee possesses no authority over the conventions of its party not granted by statute, and that the statutes of Texas do not grant, but negative, the Committee's power to exact such a pledge.\n\n'We do not think it consistent with the history and usages of parties in this State nor with the course of our Legislation to regard the respective parties or the state executive committees as denied all power over the party membership, conventions, and primaries save where such power may be found to have been expressly delegated by statute. On the contrary, the statutes recognize party organizations including the state committees, as the repositories of party power, which the Legislature has sought to control or regulate only so far as was deemed necessary for important governmental ends, such as purity of the ballot and integrity in the ascertainment and fulfillment of the party will as declared by its membership.\n\n'Without either statutory sanction or prohibition, the party must have the right to adopt reasonable regulations for the enforcement of such obligations to the party from its members as necessarily arise from the nature and purpose of party government. ...\n\n\n\n[286 U.S. 73, 103]\n\u00a0\n 'We are forced to conclude that it would not be beyond the power of the party through a customary agency such as its state executive committee to adopt regulations designed merely to enforce an obligation arising from the very act of a voter in participating in party control and party action, though the statutes were silent on the subject. ...\n'The decision in Love v. Wilcox, 119 Tex. 256, 28 S.W.(2d) 515, gave effect to the legislative intent by vacating action of the State Committee violative of express and valid statutes. Our answer to the certified question likewise gives effect to the legislative intent in upholding action of the State Committee in entire accord with the governing statutes as well as with party custom.'\n\n The reasoning advanced by the court to support its conclusion indicates some inadvertence or possibly confusion. The difference between statutes which recognize and those which confer power is not always remarked; e. g., 'With regard to the state committee's power to exact this pledge the statutes are by no means silent. The statutes do not deny the power but plainly recognize and confer same.' But the decision itself is a clear affirmation of the general powers of the state executive committee under party custom to speak for the party and especially to prescribe the prerequisites for membership and for 'voters of said political party,' in the absence of statutory inhibition. The point actually ruled is inconsistent with the notion that the executive committee does not speak for the organization; also inconsistent with the view that the committee's powers derive from state statutes.\n If statutory recognition of the authority of a political party through its executive committee to determine who shall participate therein gives to the resolves of such party or committee the character and effect of action by the state, of course the same rule must apply when party \n\n[286 U.S. 73, 104]\n\u00a0\n conventions are so treated; and it would be difficult logically to deny like effect to the rules and by-laws of social or business clubs, corporations, and religious associations, etc., organized under charters or general enactments. The state acts through duly qualified officers, and not through the representatives of mere voluntary associations.\n Such authority as the state of Texas has to legislate concerning party primaries is derived in part from her duty to secure order, prevent fraud, etc., and in part from obligation to prescribe appropriate methods for selecting candidates whose names shall appear upon the official ballots used at regular elections.\n Political parties are fruits of voluntary action. Where there is no unlawful purpose, citizens may create them at will and limit their membership as seems wise. The state may not interfere. White men may organize; blacks may do likewise. A woman's party may exclude males. This much is essential to free government.\n If any political party as such desires to avail itself of the privilege of designating candidates whose names shall be placed on official ballots by the state, it must yield to reasonable conditions precedent laid down by the statutes. But its general powers are not derived from the state, and proper restrictions or recognition of powers cannot become grants.\n It must be inferred from the provisions in her statutes and from the opinions of her courts that the state of Texas has intended to leave political parties free to determine who shall be admitted to membership and privileges, provided that none shall be excluded for reasons which are definitely stated and that the prescribed rules in respect of primaries shall be observed in order to secure official recognition of nominees therein for entry upon the ballots intended for use at general elections. \n\n[286 U.S. 73, 105]\n\u00a0\n By the enactment now questioned the Legislature refrained from interference with the essential liberty of party associations and recognized their general power to define membership therein.\n The words of the statute disclose such purpose, and the circumstances attending its passage add emphasis. The act of 1923 had forbidden negroes to participate in Democratic primaries. Nixon v. Herndon (March, 1927) supra, held the inhibition invalid. Shortly thereafter (June, 1927) the Legislature repealed it and adopted the article now numbered 3107 (Rev. Stats. 1928 (Vernon's Ann. Civ. St. art. 3107)) and here under consideration. The fair conclusion is that, accepting our ruling as conclusive, the lawmakers intended expressly to recind action adjudged beyond their powers, and then clearly to announce recognition of the general right of political parties to prescribe qualifications for membership. The contrary view disregards the words that 'every political party ... shall in its own way determine who shall be qualified to vote or otherwise participate in such political party;' and really imputes to the Legislature an attempt indirectly to circumvent the judgment of this Court. We should repel this grantuitous imputation; it is vindicated by no significant fact.\n The notion that the statute converts the executive committee into an agency of the state also lacks support. The language employed clearly imports that the political party, not the state, may act through the committee. As shown above, since the act of 1903, the Texas laws have recognized the authority of executive committees to announce the party will touching membership.\n And if to the considerations already stated there be added the rule announced over and over again that, when possible statutes must be so construed as to avoid unconstitutionality, there can remain no substantial reason for upsetting the Legislature's laudable effort to retreat from \n\n[286 U.S. 73, 106]\n\u00a0\n an untenable position by repealing the earlier act, and then declare the existence of party control over membership therein to the end that there might be orderly conduct of party affairs including primary elections.\n The resolution of the executive committee was the voice of the party, and took from appellant no right guaranteed by the Federal Constitution or laws. It was incumbent upon the judges of the primary to obey valid orders from the executive committee. They inflicted no wrong upon Nixon.\n A judgment of affirmance should be entered.\n I am authorized to say that Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND, and Mr. Justice BUTLER concur in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'We are bound to give effect to a grant of power to the State Executive Committee of a party to determine who shall participate in the acts of the party otherwise than by voting in a primary, when the Legislature grants the power in language too plain to admit of controversy, and when the determination of the Committee conflicts with no other statutory requirement or prohibition, especially when the Committee's determination makes effectual the public policy of the State as revealed in its statutes.'

RY. CO. v. UNITED STATES(1932)\nNo. 18\nArgued: October 19, 1932Decided: November 7, 1932\n\n\n\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Western District of Virginia.\n Messrs. D. Lynch Younger, of Washington, D.C., F. Markoe Rivinus, of Roanoke, Va., Theodore W. Reath, of Philadelphia, Pa., and Harvey B. Apperson, of Roanoke, Va., for appellant.\n The Attorney General and Mr. John Lord O'Brian, Asst. to Atty. Gen., for appellees.\n\n\n[287 U.S. 134, 137]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Interstate Commerce Commission issued an order pursuant to section 201 of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended, requiring the Norfolk & Western Railway Company to carry certain coal mining properties in its accounts as not used in the service of transportation. The railway filed a petition in the District Court to enjoin the enforcement of the order, and, from a decree of dismissal by a District Court of three judges, this appeal was taken.\n During the period between 1917 and 1920, the railway experienced difficulty in obtaining an adequate supply of coal of satisfactory quality for use in its locomotives. In an effort to meet this situation and to reduce costs of operation, three coal mines, adjacent to the right of way, were acquired; the terms of purchase being that they should be used solely for the supply of locomotive fuel. The investment was, as of September 30, 1928, after deb- \n\n[287 U.S. 134, 138]\n\u00a0\n its for depreciation and depletion, $2,650,467.28. The estimate is that the coal in the three mines will be exhausted in seventeen years, thirty- three years, and thirty-five years, respectively. The entire output, except for a trifling amount furnished to mine employees, is consumed in carrier activities. The collieries furnish approximately 48 per cent. of the railway's requirements.\n A general order of the Commission, in force long prior to the company's purchase of the mines, required such assets to be shown under account 705, 'Miscellaneous Physical Property,' which included investments in physical property not used in transportation. Since acquisition of the first of the mines, the railway has carried the investment in this account. In 1927 the company addressed a letter to the Commission requesting permission to transfer the investment from account 705 to account 701, which comprises investment in road and equipment. Thereupon an ex parte order was made directing that, as theretofore, the cost of the collieries should appear in account 705. On petition a hearing was afforded, after which the Commission entered the order now under attack, prescribing that the investment be carried under account 705, and providing further that the charges to account 716, 'Material and Supplies,' for coal produced for consumption in appellant's transportation operations, be upon the basis of the average monthly cost per ton of producing coal, adding that, if necessity should appear, the proceeding would be reopened for the purpose of considering and further regulating the accounting under which the costs per ton are ascertained.\n First. The Commission's order is challenged as in excess of the statutory grant of power. The concession is made that section 20 of the act grants a discretion to prescribe a uniform system of accounts, the manner in which they shall be kept, and the forms thereof. The appellant, \n\n[287 U.S. 134, 139]\n\u00a0\n however, asserts that this discretion is limited by the purposes and ends for which such accounts are to be kept, as exhibited in other sections of the act. Reference is made to the valuation section (19a),2 which calls upon the Commission to report 'the value of all the property owned or used by every common carrier,' and specifies in subparagraph (b) that, as part of the investigation the Commission shall 'ascertain and report in detail as to each piece of property, other than land, owned or used by said common carrier for its purposes as a common carrier. ...' Stress in laid upon the fact that final valuations made by the Commission are to be prima facie evidence of the value of the property in all administrative and judicial proceedings under the act. So also the appellant seeks support for this contention in the fair return and recapture section (15a),3 which assures to the carrier 'a fair return upon the aggregate value of the railway property of such carriers held for and used in the service of transportation,' and for recapture of income in excess of a return of 6 per centum upon the value of such railway property. The phrases employed in these sections, 'in the service of transportation,' and 'for its purposes as a common carrier,' are said to mark the limits of the statutory power of the Commission in classifying capital assets for accounting purposes.\n In view of the uncontradicted fact that the mines in question were purchased for and dedicated to the use of fuel supply and may not be used for any other purpose, the appellant deems it necessarily to follow that these assets were acquired for carrier purposes and are used in the service of transportation, and serve no other purpose or use whatsoever. The conclusion sought to be drawn is that, although the Commission may exercise a reasonable discretion in prescribing the nature and form \n\n[287 U.S. 134, 140]\n\u00a0\n of accounts, it has in the present instance plainly exceeded that discretion, and, by classifying as nontransportation property that which was acquired to serve transportation activities and promote the purposes of carriage of persons and goods, has transgressed statutory boundaries.\n We must examine the origin, the purpose, the re-enactment of the statutory provision, and the practice of the Commission thereunder, to resolve the question thus presented. The authority to require annual reports from carriers and to prescribe a uniform system of accounts was conferred on the Commission by the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887,4 and was but slightly elaborated in statement by the Hepburn Act and the Transportation Act, 1920.5 One of the prime purposes of section 20 is and has been since the adoption of the act of 1887 that the carriers' accounts should be uniform, so as to afford the Commission and the public a basis for comparison of their respective operations. In orders issued pursuant to this legislation, the Commission, as early as 1914, drew a distinction, for purposes of accounting, between transportation and nontransportation property. The rule as to classification which appellant attacks had been in force long prior to the passage of the Transportation Act, which added to the law theretofore in effect section 15a, respecting recapture, and prior to the enactment of the Act of March 1, 1913, 6 which added section 19a, concerning valuation, to which appellant turns for the limitations it would have us read into section 20. Moreover, those sections draw the very distinction which the Commission order has long enforced. Section 15a, in referring to the fair return guaranteed the carrier, speaks not of the property as a whole, but of 'the \n\n[287 U.S. 134, 141]\n\u00a0\n railway property ... held for and used in the service of transportation.' And section 19a commands the Commission to show separately in any report 'the property held for purposes other than those of a common carrier.'\n Plainly, the Commission, under the authority conferred upon it by Congress, must draw a line between the two sorts of property owned by the railroads. Within broad limits, that body's determination is necessarily beyond revision and correction by the courts. The record shows that it is unusual for a railroad to own mines for the production of locomotive fuel; in fact we are referred to no other similar instance. Whether the Commission should make special classifications to fit exceptional cases lies within the discretion conferred, and courts ought not to be called upon to interfere with or correct alleged errors with respect to accounting practice. If we were in disagreement with the Commission as to the wisdom and propriety of the order, we are without power to usurp its discretion and substitute our own. Kansas City So. R. Co. v. United States, \n231 \nU.S. 423, 444\n, 456 S., 34 S.Ct. 125, 52 L.R.A. (N.S.) 1.\n Second. With great earnestness the appellant characterizes the order as in several aspects a denial of due process. It declares that by virtue of the Commission's mandate an unfair and improper rate base is fixed, and a capital asset properly to be taken into account for purposes of recapture is eliminated. But this is to ignore the fact that the order is one touching accounting merely; that, before any rate base can be ascertained or any basis of recapture determined, the carrier will be entitled to a full hearing as to what property shall be included; and not until the Commission excludes the assets in question from the calculation may the carrier assert the infliction of injury to its rights of property. A recapture proceeding is now pending against the appellant, wherein full opportunity will be afforded to present any claims with \n\n[287 U.S. 134, 142]\n\u00a0\n regard to the inclusion in whole or in part of the mining properties in question.\n We are not convinced by the assertion that the necessary effect of classifying the mines as noncarrier properties is to exclude them from consideration as capital in the issuance of securities. We are not, however, required now to decide this question, for the mere accounting classification can conclude neither the Commission nor the appellant upon the hearing of an application under section 20a(2).7\n Denial of due process is also predicated upon the assertion that the Commission's order is wholly unsupported by the evidence. Appellant invokes the principle that due process requires not only a hearing, but a fair consideration of the evidence, and says that no effect was given to the uncontradicted testimony. The report demonstrates that the Commission did give painstaking attention to the question of the proper classification of the asset in question by comparison of mines for fuel supply with water rights, gas and power plants, locomotive and car manufacturing plants, timber lands purchased for future supply of ties, and other kinds of property which have been heretofore classified as falling partly or wholly within or without the category of transportation property. The record demonstrates that an adequate hearing was afforded and due weight given to the evidence.\n Appellant also characterizes the Commission's action as a denial of the legal right of the railway to adopt fair and reasonable methods of accounting. We have shown that the order made does not affect the right to a fair return, or to determination of the full and fair value of the carrier's entire property and assets, and does not amount to a taking thereof. The objection now under \n\n[287 U.S. 134, 143]\n\u00a0\n consideration asserts merely that the company is lawfully entitled to maintain a reasonable system of accounting. But there is no right to a particular form of accounting as such. Doubtless a Commission order under section 20 might be so arbitrary and outrageous as to call for correction. The present is not such a case. What has been done clearly does not amount to an abuse of power. See Kansas City So. R. Co. v. United States, supra.\n The order is assailed further as an undue and unwarranted interference with managerial discretion. Much is said of the wisdom and far-sightedness of obtaining an adequate supply of a commodity necessary to the continuance of the railway's transportation system. The danger of limiting or hampering railway executives in the exercise of sound discretion and good policy is stressed. But nothing in the order prevents the exercise of such policy. The basis of the Commission's order is merely that, if a carrier determines to go into the business of manufacturing articles for use in connection with its activities as a carrier, such as are ordinarily purchased by railroads from independent manufacturers or producers, these shall not appear in the accounts as investments in railway property used in the service of transportation. No benefit derived from such activities is denied the carrier, nor does the required classification in any way take the property of the company or impair its value.\n Third. Finally, complaint is made of that portion of the Commission's order which requires the charges to account 716, 'Material and Supplies,' for coal produced from the collieries for consumption in the appellant's transportation operations, to be upon the basis of the average monthly cost for producing the coal. The objection seems to be grounded on the premise that actual cost of production is not the proper item to go into that account. The Commission, however, expressed a willingness to reopen the case and to give further consideration, \n\n[287 U.S. 134, 144]\n\u00a0\n if necessary, to the method of charging coal from these mines as a cost of transportation. The record therefore fails to show that in this aspect the appellant has suffered harm from the order.\n The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice BUTLER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] U.S. Code tit. 49,  20 (49 USCA  20). \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] U.S. Code tit. 49,  19a (49 USCA  19a). \n[\nFootnote 3\n] U.S. Code tit. 49,  15a (49 USCA  15a). \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Act of February 4, 1887, c. 104,  20, 24 Stat. 386. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] Act June 29, 1906, c. 3591,  7, 34 Stat. 593, and Act Feb. 28, 1920, c. 91,  434-438, 41 Stat. 493, 494 (49 USCA  20). \n[\nFootnote 6\n] Chapter 92, 37 Stat. 701. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] U.S. Code tit. 49,  20a(2) (49 USCA  20a(2). \n\n\n\n\n","109":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNORTH AMERICAN OIL CONSOLIDATED v.

Gen., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[286 U.S. 417, 420]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question for decision is whether the sum of $171,979.22, received by the North American Oil Consolidated in 1917, was taxable to it as income of that year.\n The money was paid to the company under the following circumstances: Among many properties operated by it in 1916 was a section of oil land, the legal title to which stood in the name of the United States. Prior to that year, the government, claiming also the beneficial \n\n[286 U.S. 417, 421]\n\u00a0\n ownership, had instituted a suit to oust the company from possession; and on February 2, 1916, it secured the appointment of a receiver to operate the property, or supervise its operations, and to hold the net income thereof. The money paid to the company in 1917 represented the net profits which had been earned from that property in 1916 during the receivership. The money was paid to the receiver as earned. After entry by the District Court in 1917 of the final decree dismissing the bill, the money was paid, in that year, by the receiver to the company. United States v. North American Oil Consolidated, 242 F. 723. The government took an appeal ( without supersedeas) to the Circuit Court of Appeals. In 1920, that court affirmed the decree. 264 F. 336. In 1922, a further appeal to this Court was dismissed by stipulation. \n258 \nU.S. 633\n, 42 S. Ct. 315.\n The income earned from the property in 1916 had been entered on the books of the company as its income. It had not been included in its original return of income for 1916; but it was included in an amended return for that year which was filed in 1918. Upon auditing the company's income and profits tax returns for 1917, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined a deficiency based on other items. The company appealed to the Board of Tax Appeals. There, in 1927, the Commissioner prayed that the deficiency already claimed should be increased so as to include a tax on the amount paid by the receiver to the company in 1917. The Board held that the profits were taxable to the receiver as income of 1916; and hence made no finding whether the company's accounts were kept on the cash receipts and disbursements basis or on the accrual basis. 12 B. T. A. 68. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that the profits were taxable to the company as income of 1917, regardless of whether the company's returns were made on the cash or on the \n\n[286 U.S. 417, 422]\n\u00a0\n accrual basis. 50 F.(2d) 752. This Court granted a writ of certiorari. \n284 \nU.S. 614\n, 52 S. Ct. 208, 76 L. Ed. -.\n It is conceded that the net profits earned by the property during the receivership constituted income. The company contends that they should have been reported by the receiver for taxation in 1916; that, if not returnable by him, they should have been returned by the company for 1916, because they constitute income of the company accrued in that year; and that, if not taxable as income of the company for 1916, they were taxable to it as income for 1922, since the litigation was not finally terminated in its favor until 1922\n\n\n First. The income earned in 1916 and impounded by the receiver in that year was not taxable to him, because he was the receiver of only a part of the properties operated by the company. Under section 13(c) of the Revenue Act of 1916,1 receivers who 'are operating the property or business of corporations' were obliged to make returns 'of net income as and for such corporations,' and 'any income tax due' was to be 'assessed and collected in the same manner as if assessed directly against the organizations of whose businesses or properties they have custody and control.' The phraseology of this section was adopted without change in the Revenue Act of 1918, 40 Stat. 1057, 1081, c. 18,  239. The regulations of the Treasury Department have consistently construed \n\n[286 U.S. 417, 423]\n\u00a0\n these statutes as applying only to receivers in charge of the entire property or business of a corporation; and in all other cases have required the corporations themselves to report their income. Treas. Regs. 33, arts. 26, 209; Treas. Regs. 45, arts. 424, 622. That construction is clearly correct. The language of the section contemplates a substitution of the receiver for the corporation; and there can be such substitution only when the receiver is in complete control of the properties and business of the corporation. Moreover, there is no provision for the consolidation of the return of a receiver of part of a corporation's property or business with the return of the corporation itself. It may not be assumed that Congress intended to require the filing of two separate returns for the same year, each covering only a part of the corporate income without making provision for consolidation so that the tax could be based upon the income as a whole.\n Second. The net profits were not taxable to the company as income of 1916. For the company was not required in 1916 to report as income an amount which it might never receive. See Burnet v. Logan, \n283 \nU.S. 404, 413\n, 51 S. Ct. 550. Compare Lucas v. American Code Co., \n280 \nU.S. 445, 452\n, 50 S. Ct. 202; Burnet v. Sanford & Brooks Co., \n282 \nU.S. 359, 363\n, 51 S. Ct. 150. There was no constructive receipt of the profits by the company in that year, because at no time during the year was there a right in the company to demand that the receiver pay over the money. Throughout 1916 it was uncertain who would be declared entitled to the profits. It was not until 1917, when the District Court entered a final decree vacating the receivership and dismissing the bill, that the company became entitled to receive the money. Nor is it material, for the purposes of this case, whether the company's return was filed on the cash receipts and disbursements basis, or on the accrual basis. In neither event was it taxable in 1916 on \n\n[286 U.S. 417, 424]\n\u00a0\n account of income which it had not yet received and which it might never receive.\n Third. The net profits earned by the property in 1916 were not income of the year 1922-the year in which the litigation with the government was finally terminated. They became income of the company in 1917, when it first became entitled to them and when it actually received them. If a taxpayer receives earnings under a claim of right and without restriction as to its disposition, he has received income which he is required to return, even though it may still be claimed that he is not entitled to retain the money, and even though he may still be adjudged liable to restore its equivalent. See Board v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue (C. C. A.) 51 F.(2d) 73, 75, 76. Compare United States v. S. S. White Dental Manufacturing Co., \n274 \nU.S. 398, 403\n, 47 S. Ct. 598. If in 1922 the government had prevailed, and the company had been obliged to refund the profits received in 1917, it would have been entitled to a deduction from the profits of 1922, not from those of any earlier year. Compare Lucas v. American Code Co., supra.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of September 8, 1916, 39 Stat. 756, 771, c. 463: 'In cases wherein receivers, trustees in bankruptcy, or assignees are operating the property or business of corporations ... subject to tax imposed by this title, such receivers, trustees, or assignees shall make returns of net income as and for such corporations ... in the same manner and form as such organizations are hereinbefore required to make returns, and any income tax due on the basis of such returns made by receivers, trustees, or assignees shall be assessed and collected in the same manner as if assessed directly against the organizations of whose businesses or properties they have custody and control.' \n\n\n\n\n","110":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nOLD COLONY R. CO. v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE(1932)\nNo. 349\nArgued: January 18, 1932Decided: February 15, 1932\n\n\n\n\n[284 U.S. 552, 553]\n\u00a0\n Mr. James S. Y. Ivins, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. G. A. Youngquist, Asst. Atty. Gen., \n\n\n\n[284 U.S. 552, 554]\n\u00a0\n for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Revenue Act of 1921 defines gross income as including gains, profits, and income derived by the taxpayer from any source whatever, and provides that in computing net income of a corporation 'all interest paid or accrued within the taxable year on its indebtedness' is deductible from such gross income. Treasury regulations promulgated under authority of the statute state that if \n\n[284 U.S. 552, 555]\n\u00a0\n bonds are issued by a corporation at a premium the net amount of such premium is gain or income which should be amortized over the life of the bonds. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n In making return for 1921, the Old Colony Railroad Company deducted from gross income the full amount paid during the year as interest to holders of its bonds. These had been issued at various dates between 1895 and 1904, and the subscribers had taken them at prices in excess of par. The total of the premiums thus paid the company was $199,528.08. At the dates of issuance of the bonds, and until 1914, the company kept its accounts on a cash basis and credited the sums so received in an account designated 'Premium on Bonds.' In the last-named year, the Interstate Commerce Commission ordered that they should be amortized over the periods of the respective lives of the bonds. The company complied under protest, extinguished by appropriate entries the ratable proportion of the premiums for the years prior to 1914, and thereafter reported to the Commission as income a yearly ratable proportion of the remainder of the premiums, but entered the same on its books in the profit and loss account (a surplus account) and not as income. The proportion of the premiums attributable to 1921 and reported to the Commission as income for that year was $6,960.64, but the company did not in its tax return include this figure in gross income or deduct it from the amount of interest paid on its bonds. \n2\n The Commis- \n\n[284 U.S. 552, 556]\n\u00a0\n sioner, in his audit of the return, made no adjustment in the item of interest paid, but added the sum of $6,960.64 to the company's gross income for 1921 and found a resulting deficiency in the amount of tax. Upon a petition for redetermination the Board of Tax Appeals held that the Commissioner erred in treating this amount as taxable income of the year in question. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n The Commissioner asked reconsideration, asserting that the mere form of the calculation by which he arrived at a redetermination of the tax was immaterial and that the result was correct since the year's proportion of amortization of bond premiums was in reality a deduction from the stipulated interest paid the bondholders. The Board adhered to its ruling. 4 The Circuit Court of Appeals adopted the Commissioner's view and reversed the Board. \n5\n The court distinguished its earlier decision in \n\n[284 U.S. 552, 557]\n\u00a0\n Commissioner v. Old Colony R. R. Co., supra, note 3, stating that its attention had not been called to the fact that the profit made in the years prior to 1913 was not being taxed, but was used only to determine the expense of the payment of interest on the bonds for the year 1921. We granted certiorari. \n284 \nU.S. 606\n, 52 S. Ct. 34, 76 L. Ed. -.\n The regulations state that the net amount of premium is gain or income. Necessarily, then, the premium is gain or income of the year in which it is received. The provisions of the Revenue Acts of 1918, 1921, 1924, and 1926 are the same as respects gross income of corporations and deductions therefrom. The regulations under the relevant sections of the acts of 1918, 1924, and 1926 employ substantially the same phraseology as that found in those issued under the 1921 act. \n6\n The repeated re-enactment of a statute without substantial change may amount to an implied legislative approval of a construction placed upon it by executive officers. National Lead Co. v. United States, \n252 \nU.S. 140\n, 40 S. Ct. 237; United States v. Farrar, \n281 \nU.S. 624\n, 50 S. Ct. 425, 68 A. L. R. 892; Poe v. Seaborn, \n282 \nU.S. 101, 116\n, 51 S. Ct. 58.\n There is no ambiguity in the language of the regulation, which defines a bond premium as income. As a corollary from this definition, it follows that the petitioner received the income represented by the premiums here involved prior to the adoption of the Sixteenth Amendment, for these premiums could not be income for any other year than that in which they were received. That income had become capital prior to the adoption of the amendment and could not be reached by a subsequent income tax act. This conclusion is not affected by the provision of the regulation which allows the proration or amortization of this item over the life of the bonds, and extends to the taxpayer the privilege of treating the premium as income \n\n[284 U.S. 552, 558]\n\u00a0\n received in installments instead of in a lump sum in the year of its receipt.\n Nor does the fact that the regulation thus ameliorates the burden of the taxpayer authorize the use of the grant to convert income of years prior to the effective date of the Sixteenth Amendment into income assumed to have been received thereafter. The amortization requirement may properly be applied to premiums paid subsequent to March 1, 1913, but cannot operate to contradict the definition of a premium as gain or income.\n The government, however, insists that, notwithstanding the regulation's designation of a premium paid by the subscriber to corporate bonds as income, it is not such to the corporation, but is in the nature of capital loaned which must be returned to the lender during the life of the bonds. Reference is made to the practice of bond buyers in determining the amount they will bid. It is said that a purchaser, in arriving at the price he is willing to pay for a bond, has regard to the current rate of interest for money, and, if the bond bears a stipulated rate in excess of the ruling rate, he will pay a premium. He does this although he knows that at maturity he can only receive the par of the bond, but considers that he will be repaid the premium by the excess of the agreed rate of interest over the rate he is content to receive. On the other hand, where the stipulated interest is less than the going rate, bond buyers will bid less than the par of the bond by such amount as is necessary to redress the difference between the agreed rate of interest and the going rate which the subscriber demands. The conclusion is that the actual return to one who pays a premium is less than the nominal interest carried by the bond, and to one who buys at a discount is greater than such nominal rate. The argument is that, although the regulations are inaptly phrased and are susceptible of the construction petitioner places upon them, their real intent was to adjust the nomi- \n\n[284 U.S. 552, 559]\n\u00a0\n nal interest paid on a corporation's indebtedness to the actual amount it is paying for the use of the money represented by the par of the bond; that is, to what accountants have called the 'effective rate' of interest. In this view the government says that each time the debtor pays an installment of stipulated interest what it in fact does is to pay interest at a lesser rate on the par of the bond and return a ratable proportion of the premium, which really constitutes a loan by the investor to the debtor. Thus that portion of the installment paid at each interest date which is a return of the loaned capital represented by the premium must be deducted from the nominal interest in order to arrive at the 'effective rate' of interest the debtor is really paying. It is said the regulation is intended to afford a method of adjusting the taxpayer's income in the light of these facts, and that it is immaterial whether, as provided, the pro rata yearly return of capital loaned in excess of the face of the bond is added to gross income or deducted from interest paid, for in either case the result in dollars will be exactly the same.\n Doubtless the premium received by the corporation is acquired capital rather than income. But if this be admitted the concession does not answer the question whether a premium paid prior to 1913 is taxable. Obviously, therefore, it is not enough for the government's purpose to disregard the regulation which designates this item as income or gain. The Commissioner must and does go farther and contend that the receipt of such a premium reduces the item of interest paid, and renders the sum nominated as such in the bond something different from the 'interest ... on its indebtedness' mentioned in section 234 of the Revenue Act of 1921 as a permissible deduction from gross income.\n In other words, the contention is that by the use of the quoted phrase the statute did not intend to allow the deduction of the amount agreed to be paid, which the con- \n\n[284 U.S. 552, 560]\n\u00a0\n tract denominates 'interest,' but of a different sum to be ascertained by a calculation which will allocate the payment between a partial and ratable return of the premium and 'effective' interest on the par of the security.\n Is this the reasonable construction of the language of the act; 'all interest ... on its indebtedness'? The rule which should be applied is established by many decisions. 'The legislature must be presumed to use words in their known and ordinary signification.' Levy's Lessee v. M'Cartee, 6 Pet. 102, 110. 'The popular or received import of words furnishes the general rule for the interpretation of public laws.' Maillard v. Lawrence, 16 How. 251, 261. And see United States v. Buffalo Gas Co., \n172 \nU.S. 339, 341\n, 19 S. Ct. 200; United States v. First Nat. Bank, \n234 \nU.S. 245, 258\n, 34 S. Ct. 846; Caminetti v. United States, \n242 \nU.S. 470, 485\n, 37 S. Ct. 192, L. R. A. 1917F, 502, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 1168. As was said in Lynch v. Alworth-Stephens Co., \n267 \nU.S. 364, 370\n, 45 S. Ct. 274, 276, 'the plain, obvious and rational meaning of a statute is always to be preferred to any curious, narrow, hidden sense that nothing but the exigency of a hard case and the ingenuity and study of an acute and powerful intellect would discover.' This rule is applied to taxing acts. De Ganay v. Lederer, \n250 \nU.S. 376, 381\n, 39 S. Ct. 524\n\n\n Applying the accepted tests to the language of the statute, we are of opinion that the construction contended for by the Commissioner is inadmissible. In common parlance, the bonded indebtedness of a corporation imports the total face of its outstanding bonds; the amount which must be paid at their maturity. The phrase is not generally used to connote par plus an unreturned proportion of premium.\n And as respects 'interest,' the usual import of the term is the amount which one has contracted to pay for the use of borrowed money. He who pays and he who receives payment of the stipulated amount conceives that the whole is interest. In the ordinary affairs of life, no one stops for refined analysis of the nature of a premium, \n\n[284 U.S. 552, 561]\n\u00a0\n or considers that the periodic payment universally called 'interest' is in part something wholly distinct; that is, a return of borrowed capital. It has remained for the theory of accounting to point out this refinement. We cannot believe that Congress used the word having in mind any concept other than the usual, ordinary, and everyday meaning of the term, or that it was acquainted with the accountants' phrase 'effective rate' of interest, and intended that as the measure of the permitted deduction.\n In the present case, as with corporate obligations generally, the bond has a par value, and each coupon stipulates that on a date therein mentioned the company will pay a named sum as interest on the bond. Until the present contention was put forward, no one supposed that the taxpayer was not entitled to deduct the entire amount specified in the coupon and actually paid during the taxable year as interest. The person who receives this sum certainly considers it interest and so, apparently, does the government, which requires him to return it all as such, and does not permit him, if he or his predecessor holder paid more than par for the bond, to treat part of the sum received as a return of capital loaned and the remainder as interest received.\n In short, we think that, in the common understanding, 'interest' means what is usually called interest by those who pay and those who receive the amount so denominated in bond and coupon, and that the words of the statute permit the deduction of that sum, and do not refer to some esoteric concept derived from subtle and theoretic analysis.\n If there were doubt as to connotation of the term, and another meaning might be adopted, the fact of its use in a tax statute would incline the scale to the construction most favorable to the taxpayer.

Ct. 262.\n A further contention is advanced that, inasmuch as by the ruling of the Interstate Commerce Commission the company was compelled to designate the annual amount of premium amortization as income, and under protest did so treat it in reporting to the Commission, the ruling of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue is in conformity with the method of bookkeeping adopted by the petitioner, and hence is justified by section 212(b) of the Revenue Act of 1921 (42 Stat. 237),7 which provides that the net income of a corporation shall be computed in accordance with the method of accounting regularly employed in keeping the books of the taxpayer, and by  213(a) of the same act (42 Stat. 237), which authorizes the accrual method of reporting income. This position is inconsistent with the other arguments advanced. If the amortized premium is to be deducted from interest paid by the taxpayer it is not income. If it is income, then by hypothesis it is income received prior to the date of the Sixteenth Amendment, and not income which accrues to the taxpayer from year to year. Moreover, the rules of accounting enforced upon a carrier by the Interstate Commerce Commission are not binding upon the Commissioner; nor may he resort to the rules of that body, made for other purposes, for the determination of tax liability under the revenue acts.

Although the bonds in question were issued after the effective date of the lease, they were the direct obligation of petitioner, and it remained liable for the payment of interest. Petitioner bases certain arguments upon the fact that in the tax year under review it charged itself with bond interest received from the lessee and took credit for the same amount as interest paid to bondholders.

Code  237 (28 USCA  344), from a judgment of the Supreme Court of California, denying \n\n[285 U.S. 480, 488]\n\u00a0\n recovery of a tax paid by appellant, a California corporation, for the privilege of doing business within the state, and exacted under a statute1 alleged to be in contravention of the contract clause, article 1,  10, of the Federal Constitution. 298 P. 489. The annual tax is, for domestic corporations, a specified percentage of the net income of the corporation for the next preceding fiscal or calendar year. By section 7 of the statute, 'net income' is defined as 'gross income' less certain allowed deductions, and section 6 provides that 'gross income ... includes ... all interest received from federal, state, municipal or other bonds. ...' Section 1 3\/4 of article 13, of the Constitution of California, adopted in 1902, provides that bonds issued by political subdivisions of the state and its municipalities 'shall be free and exempt from taxation.'\n The state franchise tax commissioner, in assessing appellant's franchise tax for the year 1928, included in its gross income interest derived from improvement district bonds, issued after the adoption of the quoted exemption provision of the Constitution, but before the constitutional amendment and the statute authorizing the tax. The present suit was brought to recover so much of the tax as results from the inclusion in the computation, of the interest received from the tax exempt bonds. Appellant insists that, under the exemption clause of the state Constitution, it acquired a contractual immunity from state taxation of the bonds or their income, and that the later statute, by authorizing the inclusion of the bond interest in the measure of the tax, in effect taxed the income and thus impaired the obligation of the contract. \n\n[285 U.S. 480, 489]\n\u00a0\n If, as appellant argues, the exemption from taxation of the bonds is contractual and extends to the income derived from them, the question still remains whether the immunity is broad enough to secure freedom from taxation of a corporate franchise, to the extent that it is measured by tax exempt income. This Court, in answering that question, will, in the absence of applicable state decisions antedating the alleged impairment, be guided by generally accepted principles of construction which have been recognized and acted upon by this Court.\n Until the article of the Constitution adopted in 1928, and the statute of 1929, there were no provisions in the Constitution and laws of California for taxing corporate franchises by the present method, and until this case no decision by any court of the state had determined whether the granted immunity extends to a tax upon corporate franchises because tax-free property or income is included in its measure. Long before the adoption of the constitutional exemption, there was a well- recognized distinction between a tax on the privilege of exercising the corporate franchise and a tax on corporate property or income, even though the former was measured by the latter, and tax immunity of the property or income was not deemed to extend to the franchise.\n The power of a state to levy a franchise tax measured by net property or income including tax exempt bonds of the United States or their income was upheld by this Court in Society for Savings v. Coite (1867) 6 Wall. 594; Provident Institution v. Massachusetts (1867) 6 Wall. 632; Home Insurance Co. v. New York (1890) \n134 \nU.S. 594\n, 10 S. Ct. 593. State laws taxing shareholders of national banks on the full net value of their shares, although the banks own tax exempt federal securities, have also been consistently upheld. Van Allen v. Assessors, 3 Wall. 573; People's National Bank v. Board of Equalization, \n260 \nU.S. 702\n, 43 S. Ct. 98; Des Moines National Bank v. Fairweather, \n263 \nU.S. 103\n, 44 S. Ct. 23. \n\n[285 U.S. 480, 490]\n\u00a0\n Similarly Congress may impose a tax on state banks measured by the average amount of their deposits, although deposits of state funds by state officers are included. Manhattan Co. v. Blake, \n148 \nU.S. 412\n, 13 S. Ct. 640. The rule that a tax upon a franchise, measured by net income, including that from tax immune property, is not an infringement of the immunity, was re-examined and affirmed in Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., \n220 \nU.S. 107\n, 31 S. Ct. 342, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 1312, which was accepted as authority in Macallen Co. v. Massachusetts, \n279 \nU.S. 620\n, 49 S. Ct. 432, 436, and followed in Educational Films Corporation v. Ward, \n282 \nU.S. 379\n, 51 S. Ct. 170.\n This distinction, so often and consistently reaffirmed, is but a recognition that the franchise, the privilege of doing business in corporate form, which is a legitimate subject of taxation, does not cease to be such because it is exercised in the acquisition and enjoyment of nontaxables. The distinction is one of substance, not of form, and has been so recently discussed in Educational Films Corporation v. Ward that it need not be elaborated here. It suffices to say that the tax immunity extended to property qua property does not embrace a special privilege, the corporate franchise, otherwise taxable, merely because the value of the corporate property or net income is included in an equable measure of the enjoyment of the privilege. The owner may enjoy his exempt property free of tax, but if he asks and receives from the state the benefit of a taxable privilege as the implement of that enjoyment, he must bear the burden of the tax which the state exacts as its price.\n Petitioner lays no foundation for the assertion that the state court erroneously construed the grant of immunity as limited to taxes imposed on the bonds and their interest, and as not embracing taxes on the franchise measured by the net income of the taxpayer without discrimination as to its source. We cannot say that this construction, with which no judicial decision of the \n\n[285 U.S. 480, 491]\n\u00a0\n state conflicts, and which is supported by an unbroken line of decisions of this Court, some of them antedating the grant, is erroneous or that the later enactment of the challenged statute, in all respects consistent with it, impairs any contractual right which could be implied from the grant. Even if the construction were doubtful, the doubt, upon familiar principles, must be resolved in favor of the state. Grants of immunity from taxation, in derogation of a sovereign power of the state, are strictly construed. Providence Bank v. Billings, 4 Pet. 514, 561; The Delaware Railroad Tax Case, 18 Wall. 206, 225-226; Jefferson Branch Bank v. Skelly, 1 Black 436, 447; Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge, 11 Pet. 420; Yazoo & Mississippi Valley Ry. v. Thomas, \n132 \nU.S. 174\n, 10 S. Ct. 68; Vicksburg, S. & P. R. Co. v. Dennis, \n116 \nU.S. 665\n, 6 S. Ct. 625.\n But appellant insists that even though the granted exemption is not broad enough to preclude, in every instance, the inclusion of tax exempt income in the measure of the tax, its inclusion by the present statute is not a casual incident to a scheme of taxation of franchises measured by all net income, such as was upheld in Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., supra, but is the result of a fully disclosed legislative purpose to subject to taxation the income of non-taxables, such as was deemed to invalidate the tax in Miller v. Milwaukee, \n272 \nU.S. 713\n, 47 S. Ct. 280, and in Macallen Co. v. Massachusetts, supra. In support of this contention, petitioner points to the language of the taxing act, specifically including the income from tax exempt bonds in the measure of the tax, and to its legislative history.\n The California Constitution was amended and the legislation taxing corporate franchises was enacted shortly after the decisions of this Court in First National Bank v. Hartford, \n273 \nU.S. 548\n, 47 S. Ct. 462, 59 A. L. R. 1, and Minnesota v. First National Bank of St. Paul, \n273 \nU.S. 561\n, 47 S. Ct. 468, which held that the requirement of Rev. St.  5219, of an approximate equality of state taxation \n\n[285 U.S. 480, 492]\n\u00a0\n of national banks and of moneyed capital competing with them, comprehends the taxation not only of moneyed capital employed by state and private banks, but also that of other corporations in substantial competition with national banks. The state of California had previously imposed a tax on shareholders in banks, based on their proportionate share of the undivided profits, capital, and surplus. Corporations other than banks, public utility, and insurance companies were taxed on the basis of their 'corporate excess,' in the computation of which non-taxable bonds were not included. In 1927 the California Legislature (St. 1927, p. 781) created a commission to prepare a scheme of taxation which would secure the requisite equality. To attain this end the report of the commission of August 10, 1928 (included in the final report of California tax commission of March 5, 1929, State Printing Office, Publication No. 63725, at page 243, et seq.), recommended the adoption of the present corporate franchise tax as comforming to subdivision 4 of Rev. St.  5219 (12 USCA  548(4), which permits the state taxation of national banks 'according to or measured by their net income.' In the course of the report, specific reference is made to the belief of the commission that in the computation of such a tax the income of non-taxable federal bonds might be included in the measure of the tax, and it sufficiently appears from the report that the commission was not unaware that income from bonds of the state would likewise be included by the proposed legislation and, indeed, that the desired equality of taxation of local corporations with that on national banks, measured by income, could not otherwise be secured. The adoption of the taxing act, as recommended by the commission, may therefore be taken, as appellant contends, to evidence a definite and specific legislative purpose to levy a new type of franchise tax, measured by corporate net income, including the tax exempt income from federal and state bonds. \n\n[285 U.S. 480, 493]\n\u00a0\n The view that a tax, although levied on a taxable subject, may be deemed invalid because purposely devised to include a non-taxable subject in its measure, receives only a limited and qualified support from Miller v. Milwaukee, supra. There a state statute taxing corporate dividends was framed in such manner as to tax them only so far as they were derived from corporate income from tax exempt bonds of the United States. The taxing act thus, on its face, did more than exhibit an intention of the one sovereignty to include in the dividends taxed, those derived from income from a non-taxable instrumentality of the other, together with income from all other sources. That admittedly would have been permissible; see Des Moines National Bank v. Fairweather, supra; Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., supra; Educational Films Corporation v. Ward, supra. But it was the exclusion from the measure of the tax of all income except from federal bonds which rendered the tax invalid.\n Thus, in our dual system of government, action of the one government in the proper exercise of its sovereign powers, regarded as innocuous and permissible notwithstanding its incidental effects on the other, may become offensive and be deemed forbidden if it discriminates against the other. State taxes which, if nondiscriminatory, would be upheld, even though they reach or affect those engaged in interstate commerce, are condemned if they discriminate against those so engaged, by placing on them heavier burdens than those imposed on others within the state. Welton v. Missouri, \n91 U.S. 275\n, with which compare Wagner v. Covington, \n251 \nU.S. 95\n, 40 S. Ct. 93, 168; Darnell & Son Co. v. Memphis, \n208 \nU.S. 113\n, 28 S. Ct. 247; Bethlehem Motors Corp. v. Flynt, \n256 \nU.S. 421\n, 41 S. Ct. 571. Cf. Reymann Brewing Co. v. Brister, \n179 \nU.S. 445\n, 21 S. Ct. 201. See General American Tank Car Corp. v. Day, \n270 \nU.S. 367, 372\n, 46 S. Ct. 234.\n But the present case is not one of discrimination. There is no attempt, as in Miller v. Milwaukee, supra, to meas- \n\n[285 U.S. 480, 494]\n\u00a0\n ure the tax by exempt income while excluding from the measure all taxable income. The state seeks to do only what its contract permits it to do, to measure the franchise tax by all the net income of the taxpayer. If the words 'net income' in the taxing statute may rightly be taken to include income from tax exempt bonds, as they were in Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., supra, then there can be no tenable ground for saying that the addition of the words 'income ... includes ... all interest received from federal, state, municipal or other bonds,' discloses any different purpose on the part of the Legislature, or can have any different effect, or can more definitely infringe the exemption than did the tax upheld in Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., supra, or that in Educational Films Corporation v. Ward, supra.\n But it is said that the ruling of this Court in Macallen Co. v. Massachusetts, supra, requires the condemnation of the present tax. There the commonwealth, which had long imposed a tax on corporate franchises measured by taxable income of the corporation, amended its statutes, so as to add the income from tax exempt bonds of the federal government to the measure of the tax. It was held that this change of taxation policy, embodied in the statute and 'adopted, as though it had been so declared in precise words, for the very purpose of subjecting these securities pro tanto to the burden of the tax,' was invalid. Thus the legislative abandonment of a policy which had previously discriminated in favor of tax exempt securities was treated as a discrimination against them, and the tax, although in fact nondiscriminatory, was condemned as analogous to the discriminatory tax held invalid in the Miller Case. See Macallen Co. v. Massachusetts, supra, pages 630, 631 of 279 U. S., 49 S. Ct. 432, 435.\n But the state of California, in its legislation, has indulged in no reversal of policy so far as the measure- \n\n[285 U.S. 480, 495]\n\u00a0\n ment of the franchise tax is concerned and in no discrimination either in favor of or against tax exempt income. The entire history of its legislation discloses only that it has sought, in good faith, to conform its scheme of taxation of corporations to a permitted method of taxing national banks, to avoid discrimination against the latter. It has effected its purpose by adopting, in a single legislative act, a new form of privilege tax on corporations measured by their net income, without any form of discrimination as to the sources of the income included in the measure, differing in this respect in no material way from the similar tax upheld in Flint v. Stone Tracy Co. and in Educational Films Corporation v. Ward, supra. We should hesitate to say that any action of the Legislature or any purpose disclosed by a state commission could restrict the power of the state by constitutional amendment to authorize a tax which admittedly it could have authorized without them. In any case, the use of words in the statute and report, indicating what would otherwise have been implied, that 'income' includes income from tax exempt bonds, could neither enlarge the exemption nor diminish the constitutional power of the state.\n But we do not rest our decision upon any narrow distinction as to the precise form of words which may be employed in taxing statutes or the particular order in which its provisions are incorporated in the statute, whether by a single legislative act or by amendment or the addition of new provisions in successive reenactments. A taxing statute, like others, must be read as a whole, as it stands on the statute books at its applicable date, and the legislative purpose in enacting it must be taken, regardless of forms of words, to envisage the obvious consequences which flow from its operation. Since the mere intent of the Legislature to do that which the Constitution permits cannot deprive legislation of its constitutional \n\n[285 U.S. 480, 496]\n\u00a0\n validity, and the purposeful choice by the state of a method of taxation which appellee's contract allows, cannot alter the terms of the contract, the present act must be judged by its operation rather than by the motives which inspired it. As it operates to measure the tax on the corporate franchise by the entire net income of the corporation, without any discrimination between income which is exempt and that which is not, there is no infringement of any constitutional immunity.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND, dissenting.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, Mr. Justice BUTLER, and I are unable to agree with the opinion and judgment just announced.\n In Miller v. Milwaukee, \n272 \nU.S. 713\n, 47 S. Ct. 280, speaking through Mr. Justice Holmes, this Court said: 'If the avowed purpose or self-evident operation of a statute is to follow the bonds of the United States and to make up for its inability to reach them directly by indirectly achieving the same result, the statute must fail even if but for its purpose or special operation it would be perfectly good. Under the laws of Wisconsin the income from the United States bonds may not be the only item exempted from the income tax on corporations, but it certainly is the most conspicuous instance of exemption at the present time. A result intelligently foreseen and offering the most obvious motive for an act that will bring it about, fairly may be taken to have been a purpose of the act. On that assumption the immunity of the national bonds is too important to allow any narrowing beyond what the Acts of Congress permit. We think it would be going too far to say that they allow an intentional interference that is only prevented from being direct by the artificial distinction between a corporation and its members. A tax very well may be upheld as against any \n\n[285 U.S. 480, 497]\n\u00a0\n casual effect it may have upon the bonds of the United States when passed with a different intent and not aimed at them, but it becomes a more serious attack upon their immunity when they are its obvious aim. In such a case the Court must consider the public welfare rather than the artifices contrived for private convenience and must look at the facts.'\n In Macallen Co. v. Massachusetts, \n279 \nU.S. 620\n, 49 S. Ct. 432, the principle thus announced was applied to an act imposing a corporate excise tax affecting the state's municipal securities in the same way as the California act affects the bonds here under consideration. These municipal securities were issued and acquired prior to the passage of the act, and when so issued and acquired were exempt from all forms of taxation by the express terms of a state statute. The situation in that respect is the same here, except that the exemption from taxation was made by the state Constitution instead of by statute. There, as here, the constitutionality of the act was challenged under the Federal Constitution as impairing the obligation of contracts. We sustained the challenge, and pointed out that while a state was at liberty to impose a franchise tax upon a corporation with respect to the doing of its business, it could not tax the income of the corporation derived from nontaxable securities. We held that the effect of the taxing act was to repeal the prior statute and impose a burden upon the securities from which, by express provision of law, they had theretofore been free. In confirmation of this conclusion the report of a special commission appointed by the Legislature to investigate the subject of taxation of banking institutions was cited and quoted. That report recommended the adoption of legislation which, by means of an excise upon the doing of business, would reach income from securities then exempt from taxation, either under federal or state law. The report received the con- \n\n[285 U.S. 480, 498]\n\u00a0\n sideration of the Legislature, and, we thought it fair to suppose, constituted the basis for adopting the challenged act. We said (page 633 of 279 U. S., 49 S. Ct. 432, 436): 'The effect of the report is that nontaxable bonds nevertheless should be subjected to the burden of the tax; and since that could not be imposed directly, the clear intimation is that it be imposed indirectly through the medium of the so-called 'excise.\"\n We therefore concluded that the act manifested a change of policy adopted with the aim and for the purpose of subjecting the tax-exempt securities, pro tanto, to the burden of the tax, and, therefore, impaired 'the obligation of the statutory contract of the state by which such bonds were made exempt from state taxation.'\n In the present case the aim and purpose of the California Legislature to reach the same illegal result by indirection is no less clear. Here, as in Massachusetts, the state tax commission investigated the subject and made a special report to the Governor for submission to the Legislature. In the course of the report the commission expressed the opinion that the only practicable method of securing a substantial revenue from the banks was to tax them 'according to or measured by net income.' This was designated its 'fourth method.' As distinguished from the 'third method' suggested, the commission said that such a tax 'is designed to include within the scope of its application certain types of income which may not legally be reached by a pure net income tax-such as interest on tax-exempt government bonds. ... The third method may be discarded in favor of the fourth, because under the fourth everything can be accomplished which may be gained by proceeding under the third, and presumably more besides, viz, the inclusion, if desired, of tax-exempt interest in the base.'\n Later in its report, under the heading 'Importance of Including Tax- exempt Interest in Base,' the commission, \n\n[285 U.S. 480, 499]\n\u00a0\n after calling attention to the Macallen Case, then pending but not decided, said: 'In the case of corporations other than banks, the point is not of vital importance. But the banks hold such large quantities of these tax- exempt bonds that the effect of a decision holding that the state may not include them in the base would be very serious indeed.'\n There is more in the report to like effect.\n In January, 1929, the two houses of the state Legislature gave public hearings on the subject. Among others, Professor Haig of Columbia University, who had served as technical advisor to the commission, appeared and made a statement, in the course of which, in explanation of bills then pending, he said: 'Now, as to the definition of net income. You will find this material presented in section 6 and following. In the first place, the definition of income is broad, in one respect, in that it does attempt to include within the scope of the base used as the measure of the tax income received from tax-exempt securities-that is, government bonds and so on. ... Interest from tax-exempt bonds is an exceedingly important item in a tax which is applied to banks. The definition is board, in that it does include this tax-exempt interest in the base which is used as a measure of the value of the franchise.'\n The act here in question, which resulted from, and evidently was based upon, the report of the commission and the statements of its advisor, provides in express terms:\n'Sec. 6. The term 'gross income,' as herein used, includes ... all interest received from federal, state, municipal or other bonds. ...\n\n'Sec. 7. The term 'net income,' as herein used, means the gross income less the deductions allowed.' (No deduction, however, is allowed for interest received from federal, state, municipal or other tax-exempt bonds.) \n\n[285 U.S. 480, 500]\n\u00a0\n The foregoing is so plain that comment or elucidation would seem unnecessary. The bare recital of the facts, in our opinion, shows how unreasonable it is to hold that the aim and purpose of the legislation was not, by indirection, to impose a tax upon income derived from tax-exempt securities which, constitutionally, could not be imposed directly. To say that the effect of the tax upon the tax-exempt bonds is 'casual,' and not its 'obvious aim' (Miller v. Milwaukee, supra), is simply to presume upon our credulity. We think there is no escape from the conclusion that if the Miller and Macallen Cases were followed the legislation here under review would be condemned. To base a distinction of these cases from the pending case upon differences so lacking in substance as to be in effect no differences at all, simply adds to the confusion already too great in this field of taxation.\n\n The California franchise tax, in its application to the bonds here under consideration, is peculiarly indefensible. When these bonds were issued and acquired they were, by express constitutional provision, made 'free and exempt from taxation.' Upon the faith of that provision the bonds were bought. The fact that they were to be free from taxation must have resulted in the receipt of a larger price than otherwise would have been the case. The difference between the sum paid and what would have been paid but for the exemption was, in a very real sense, money taken from the purchaser in exchange for the tax immunity-as though future taxes had been anticipated by an immediate payment of the amount, computed on the basis of their present worth. By every principle of fair construction, the purchaser having paid for this immunity became entitled to hold the bonds and income therefrom free from any future taxation, the burden of which, however disguised, would fall, and was meant to fall, upon them. Otherwise the contractual ob- \n\n[285 U.S. 480, 501]\n\u00a0\n ligation is a mere sham, signifying nothing. It is not denied, as we understand, that if the state had laid the tax directly upon the income derived from the bonds an unconstitutional impairment of the obligation would have resulted. And, in this respect, it is hard to see any substantial difference between a tax laid directly upon the income and one laid upon a privilege but measured by, and definitely intended to reach, such income. Undoubtedly, a state has the power to impose a franchise tax for the privilege of doing business as a corporation within the state and also to measure that tax by the amount of income received; but in every case where this court has sustained the validity of such a tax, when measured in part by nontaxable income, it has done so upon the view, implicit or express, that the latter in fact and reality was not the subject sought to be taxed, and that any burden thereby put upon it was casual and incidental.\n A tax in form laid upon A but measured by B at once suggests that B was in reality the thing aimed at; and if inquiry discloses, as it does here, that such is the fact the tax, assuming B to be nontaxable, should not be allowed to stand in the face of the settled principle that what cannot be done directly because of constitutional restriction cannot be done indirectly by legislation designed to reach the same end. Fairbank v. United States, \n181 \nU.S. 283, 294\n, 300 S., 21 S. Ct. 648.\n It is important for the states and their municipalities to obtain revenue; but, in doing so, it is also important that they shall not dishonor their promises. The moral duty of a state to keep its word, in spirit as well as in letter, is no less than that of an individual; and courts which condemn direct impairment by legislation of contractual obligations should not be over-ready to approve the adoption of circuitous and delusive means, which in form avoid but in fact accomplish the same unconstitutional result. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The California Bank and Corporation Franchise Tax Act, Cal.

Reeder, Jr., of Ogden, Utah, and Dan B. Shields, of Salt Lake City, Utah, for appellant.\n\n\n[285 U.S. 105, 107]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George P. Parker and Byron D. Anderson, both of Salt Lake City, Utah, for the State of Utah.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Section 2, of chapter 145, Laws of Utah 1921, as amended by chapter 52,  2, Laws of 1923, and chapter 92, Laws of 1929, provides:\n'It shall be a misdemeanor for any person, company, or corporation, to display on any bill board, street car sign, street car, placard, or on any other object or place of display, any advertisement of cigarettes, cigarette papers, cigars, chewing tobacco, or smoking tobacco, or any disguise or substitute of either, except that a dealer in cigarettes, cigarette papers, tobacco, or cigars or their substitutes, may have a sign on the front of his place of business stating that he is a dealer in such articles, provided that nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the advertising of cigarettes, cigarette papers, chewing tobacco, smoking tobacco, or any disguise or substitute of either in any newspaper, magazine or periodical printed or circulating in the State of Utah.'\n\n The Packer Corporation, a Delaware corporation engaged in billboard advertising and authorized to do business in Utah, was prosecuted under this statute for displaying a large poster advertising Chesterfield cigarettes on a billboard owned by it and located in Salt Lake City. The poster was displayed pursuant to a general contract for advertising Chesterfield cigarettes, made by the defendant with an advertising agency in the state of Ohio. Both the poster and the cigarettes advertised were manufactured without the state of Utah and were shipped into \n\n[285 U.S. 105, 108]\n\u00a0\n It by Liggett & Myers Tobacco Company, a foreign corporation. The defendant claimed that the statute violates several provisions of the Federal Constitution; the objections were overruled; and the defendant was convicted and sentenced. On the authority of its recent decision in State v. Packer Corporation, 297 P. 1013, the highest court of the state affirmed the judgment of the trial court. 2 P.(2d) 114. The case is here on appeal under section 237(a) of the Judicial Code as amended by the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 937, 28 USCA  344(a).\n It is not denied that the state may, under the police power, regulate the business of selling tobacco products, compare Gundling v. Chicago, \n177 \nU.S. 183, 188\n, 20 S. Ct. 633; Austin v. Tennessee, \n179 \nU.S. 343, 348\n, 21 S. Ct. 132; and the advertising connected therewith, compare Rast v. Van Deman & Lewis Co., 240 U. S. R. A. 1917A, 421, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 455; Tanner R. A. 1917A, 421, Ann.Cas. 1917B, 455; Tanner v. Little, \n240 \nU.S. 369, 384\n, 385 S., 36 S. Ct. 379. The claim is that because of its peculiar provisions the statute violates the Federal Constitution.\n First. The contention mainly urged is that the statute violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; that in discriminating between the display by appellant of tobacco advertisements upon billboards and the display by others of such advertisements in newspapers, magazines, or periodicals, it makes an arbitrary classification. The history of the legislation shows that the charge is unfounded. In Utah no one may sell cigarettes or cigarette papers without a license. \n1\n Since 1890, it has been the persistent policy, first of the territory and then of the state, to prevent the use of tobacco by minors, and to discourage its use by adults. Giving tobacco to a minor, as well as selling it, is a misdemeanor. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[285 U.S. 105, 109]\n\u00a0\n So is permitting a minor to frequent any place of business while in the act of using tobacco in any form. \n3\n Mere possession of tobacco by the minor is made a crime. \n4\n And smoking by any one in any inclosed public place ( except a public smoking room designated as such by a conspicuous sign at or near the enterance) is a misdemeanor. \n5\n In 1921, the Legislature enacted a general prohibition of the sale or giving away of cigarettes or cigarette papers to any person, and of their advertisement in any form. Laws of Utah 1921, c. 145,  1, 2. After two years, however, the plan of absolute prohibition of sale was abandoned in favor of a license system. Laws of Utah 1923, c. 52,  1. But the provision against advertisements was retained, broadened to include tobacco in most other forms. In 1926, this statute was held void under the commerce clause, as applied to an advertisement of cigarettes manufactured in another state, inserted in a Utah newspaper which circulated in other states. State v. Salt Lake Tribune Publishing Co., 68 Utah, 187, 249 P. 474, 48 A. L. R. 553. Thereupon the Legislature, unwilling to abandon altogether its declared policy, amended the law by striking out the provision which prohibited advertising in newspapers and periodicals. The classification alleged to be arbitrary was made in order to comply with the requirement of the Federal Constitution as interpreted and applied by the highest court of the state. Action by a state taken to observe one prohibition of the Constitution does not entail the violation of another. J. E. Raley & Brothers v. Richardson, \n264 \nU.S. 157, 160\n, 44 S. Ct. 256; Des Moines National Bank v. Fairweather, \n263 \nU.S. 103, 116\n, 117 S., 44 S. Ct. 23. Compare Dolley \n\n[285 U.S. 105, 110]\n\u00a0\n v. Abilene Nat. Bank (C. C. A.) 179 F. 461, 463, 464, 32 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1065. It is a reasonable ground of classification that the state has power to legislate with respect to persons in certain situations and not with respect to those in a different one. \n6\n Compare Williams v. Walsh, \n222 \nU.S. 415, 420\n, 32 S. Ct. 137.\n Moreover, as the state court has shown, there is a difference which justifies the classification between display advertising and that in periodicals or newspapers: 'Billboards, street car signs, and placards and such are in a class by themselves. They are wholly intrastate, and the restrictions apply without discrimination to all in the same class. Advertisements of this sort are constantly before the eyes of observers on the streets and in street cars to be seen without the exercise of choice or volition on their part. Other forms of advertising are ordinarily seen as a matter of choice on the part of the observer. The young people as well as the adults have the message of the billboard thrust upon them by all the arts and devices that skill can produce. In the case of newspapers and magazines, there must be some seeking by the one who is to see and read the advertisement. The radio can be turned off, but not so the billboard or street car placard. These distinctions clearly place this kind of advertisement in a position to be classified so that regulations or prohibitions may be imposed upon all within the class. This is impossible with respect to newspapers or magazines.' 297 P. 1013, 1019. The Legislature may recognize degrees of evil and adapt its legislation accordingly. \n\n[285 U.S. 105, 111]\n\u00a0\n Miller v. Wilson, \n236 \nU.S. 373, 384\n, 35 S. Ct. 342, L. R. A. 1915F, 829; Truax v. Raich, \n239 \nU.S. 33, 43\n, 36 S. Ct. 7, L. R. A. 1916D, 545.\n Second. The defendant contends that to make it illegal to carry out the contract under which the advertisement was displayed takes its property without due process of law because it arbitrarily curtails liberty of contract. The contention is without merit. The law deals confessedly with a subject within the scope of the police power. No facts are brought to our attention which establish either that the evil aimed at does not exist or that the statutory remedy is inappropriate. O'Gorman & Young v. Hartford Fire Insurance Co., \n282 \nU.S. 251, 257\n, 51 S. Ct. 130, 75 L Ed. 324; Hardware Dealers Mutual Fire Insurance Co. v. Glidden Co., \n284 \nU.S. 151\n, 52 S. Ct. 69.\n Third. The defendant contends also that the statute imposes an unreasonable restraint upon interstate commerce because it prevents the display on billboards of posters shipped from another state. It does not appear from the record that the defendant is the owner of the posters. Its interest is merely in its billboards located in the state, upon which it displays advertisements for which it is paid. So far as the posters are concerned, assuming them to be articles of commerce, compare Charles A. Ramsay Co. v. Associated Bill Posters, \n260 \nU.S. 501, 511\n, 43 S. Ct. 167, the statute is aimed, not at their imporation, but at their use when affixed to billboards permanently located in the state. Compare Browning v. City of Waycross, \n233 \nU.S. 16, 22\n, 23 S., 34 S. Ct. 578; General Railway Signal Co. v. Virginia, \n246 \nU.S. 500, 510\n, 38 S. Ct. 360. The prohibition is nondiscriminatory, applying regardless of the origin of the poster. Its operation is wholly intrastate, beginning after the interstate movement of the poster has ceased. Compare Hygrade Provision Co. v. Sherman, \n266 \nU.S. 497, 503\n, 45 S. Ct. 141; Hebe Co. v. Shaw, \n248 \nU.S. 297, 304\n, 39 S. Ct. 125. See, also, Corn Products Refining Co. v. Eddy, \n249 \nU.S. 427, 433\n, 39 S. Ct. 325. To sustain the \n\n[285 U.S. 105, 112]\n\u00a0\n defendant's contention would be to hold that the posters, because of their origin, were entitled to permanent immunity from the exercise of State regulatory power. The Federal Constitution does not so require. Compare Mutual Film Corporation v. Industrial Commission, \n236 \nU.S. 230, 240\n, 241 S., 35 S. Ct. 387, Ann. Cas. 1916C, 296. So far as the articles advertised are concerned, the solicitation of the advertisements, it may be assumed, is directed toward intrastate sales. Compare Di Santo v. Pennsylvania, \n273 \nU.S. 34\n, 47 S. Ct. 267. Whatever may be the limitations upon the power of the state to regulate solicitation and advertisement incident to an exclusively interstate business, the commerce clause interposes no barrier to its effective control of advertising essentially local. Compare Jell-O Co. v. Landes (C. C. A.) 20 F.(2d) 120, 121; International Text-Book Co. v. District of Columbia, 35 App. D.

ARKANSAS NATURAL GAS CORPORATION(1932)\nNo. 700\nArgued: Decided: May 16, 1932\n\n\n\n Messrs. Yandell Boatner and Frank J. Looney, both of Shreveport, La., for petitioner.\n Mr. John W. Davis, of New York City, for respondent. \n\n[286 U.S. 269, 270]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the court.\n Petitioner brought this suit in the Arkansas chancery court against respondent's predecessor in interest to quiet the title to an oil and gas lease. The cause was removed to the United States District Court for Western Arkansas, where a trial of the issues resulted in a judgment for respondent, which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. 53 F.(2d) 27. Both courts held that the issue with respect to the ownership of the lease was res adjudicata by reason of a proceeding before a referee in bankruptcy, sitting in the district in which the issues with respect to the title presented here, had been decided against the predecessor of petitioner and in favor of the trustee in bankruptcy, through whom respondent acquired its title to the lease.\n The receiver in the bankruptcy proceeding, later appointed trustee, had gone into possession of the lease, claiming it as property of the bankrupt. Lyvers, petitioner's predecessor, filed a petition before the referee, claiming title to the lease, asking that he be put in possession, and that the trustee be ordered not to sell the lease. The trustee answered, setting up that Lyvers was trustee of the lease for the bankrupt, and asking that Lyvers execute a deed of the property to the trustee. The matter was heard by the referee, who ordered Lyvers to execute the conveyance. The order was affirmed by the District Court and in conformity with it Lyvers then conveyed the lease to the trustee.\n The attempt made in the present suit to relitigate the issues involved in the bankruptcy proceeding is justified chiefly on the ground that the referee in bankruptcy was without jurisdiction to try the issues presented in the proceeding before him, and that, for that reason, the order was void and could not operate to adjudicate the issues tendered in the present suit. This court granted cer- \n\n[286 U.S. 269, 271]\n\u00a0\n tiorari, \n285 \nU.S. 532\n, 52 S. Ct. 407, 76 L. Ed. -, to resolve the jurisdictional question. Many and complicated questions of fact are involved and were argued here, but, as they have been found in favor of the respondent by both courts below, we do not review them (see Texas & N. O. R. Co. v. Brotherhood of Railway & Steamship Clerks, \n281 \nU.S. 548\n, 50 S. Ct. 427), and we confine ourselves to the question of the jurisdiction of the referee in bankruptcy.\n The court below held that the referee in bankruptcy had jurisdiction to decide the issues raised by the petition and answer, by virtue of the fact that the trustee had gone into possession of the lease, and that possession gave the referee as a court of bankruptcy jurisdiction to hear and determine all questions respecting the title, possession, or control of the property. Murphy v. John Hofman Co., \n211 \nU.S. 562\n, 29 S. Ct. 154. It also held that the referee had power to make the order, since Lyvers had participated in the litigation without objecting to its summary form until after the order had been made. We think that the judgment should be affirmed.\n The right asserted before the referee by the trustee in bankruptcy to compel a conveyance to the bankrupt of property adversely claimed is one which may be asserted by the trustee in a plenary suit. By section 23a of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 USCA  46(a) and section 291 of the Judicial Code ( 28 USCA  431 note), District Courts of the United States, which by section 1(8) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 USCA  1(8) are courts of bankruptcy, are given jurisdiction of all controversies in law or equity between trustees and adverse claimants concerning the property claimed by the trustee. And by section 23b, 11 USCA  46(b), 'suits by the trustee shall only be brought or prosecuted in the courts where the bankrupt, whose estate is being administered by such trustee, might have brought or prosecuted them if proceedings in bankruptcy had not been instituted, unless by consent of the proposed defendant. ...' For reasons stated at length in the opinion in MacDonald v. Plymouth County Trust Co., \n286 \nU.S. 263\n, 52 S. Ct. 505, 76 L. Ed. -, decided this day, \n\n[286 U.S. 269, 272]\n\u00a0\n we hold that the referee is a court within the meaning of section 23b and that, respondent's predecessor having consented to litigate the issues presented by the petition and answer before the referee, the latter had jurisdiction to decide the issues presented. The order of the referee, in the bankruptcy proceeding, affirmed by the District Court, therefore adjudicated those issues between the parties, and they may not be relitigated in the present suit by their successors in interest.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","114":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPEOPLE OF STATE OF MICHIGAN v.

The case is here on certiorari. \n284 \nU.S. 616\n, 52 S. Ct. 265, 76 L. Ed. -.\n At the suit of a simple contract creditor, a receiver of the property of the Worden Grocer Company, a Michigan corporation, engaged in business at its domicile, was appointed by a Federal District Court in Michigan on February 9, 1926. The bill of complaint alleged that the defendant was solvent, and that if its business was handled by a receiver free from interference by its creditors, it would be able to pay its debts in full and would have a surplus available for preferred and common stockholders. On the same day the directors of the defendant adopted a resolution consenting to the receivership; and an answer admitting the allegations of the bill of com- \n\n[286 U.S. 334, 340]\n\u00a0\n plaint and consenting to the relief prayed for was filed forthwith. Thereupon, and still on the same day, the court made an order appointing the Michigan Trust Company receiver of the defendant and of all its assets with authority 'to carry on the business now carried on by the Worden Grocer Company, and to operate and manage its property and business in such manner as will, in the judgment of said Receiver, produce the most satisfactory results.' To that end authority was granted 'to pay the current and unpaid payrolls of said defendant; to incur such obligations and indebtedness, ... the same to be prior to the present unsecured obligation' of the defendant, 'as to the Receiver may seem necessary for continuance of the business,' and in particular 'to pay all taxes and assessments levied upon the property and assets of said company,' as well as all rentals accrued or to accrue thereafter.\n The receiver so appointed carried on the business thus committed to its charge. It continued to do this till December 30, 1929, when the court made an order confirming a sale of all the mercantile assets, as a result of which sale there was paid to the common creditors a dividend of 25 per cent. Cash and unsold real estate are still in the receiver's custody.\n In February, 1930, the people of the state filed in the District Court a petition that the receiver be directed to pay the corporate taxes or privilege fees for the years 1925 to 1929 inclusive, amounting in the aggregate to $10,988.36. The liability of the receiver in respect of such fees or taxes is the subject of this controversy. The District Court held that they were charges upon the assets prior to the claims of creditors in that they were expenses necessarily incurred by the receiver in fulfilling the duty to operate the business. The Court of Appeals held that they were liabilities due to the people of the state, but liabilities not to be discharged until the claims \n\n[286 U.S. 334, 341]\n\u00a0\n of all other creditors as well as the expenses of the receivership had been satisfied in full.\n By a statute of Michigan enacted in 1923 (Act No. 233, Public Acts 1923, p. 374,  4), 'every corporation organized or doing business under the laws of this state, excepting those hereinafter expressly exempted therefrom, shall, at the time of filing its annual report with the secretary of state of this state, as required by section seven hereof, for the privilege of exercising its franchise and of transacting its business within this state, pay to the secretary of state, an annual fee of two and one-half mills upon each dollar of its paid-up capital and surplus, but such privilege fee shall in no case be less than ten dollars nor more than fifty thousand dollars.'\n There were amendments of the statute in 1927 and 1929 (Act No. 140, Public Acts 1927; Act No. 175, Public Acts 1929), but their significance in relation to this controversy is not important enough to make it necessary to quote them.\n The tax is laid upon the corporation 'for the privilege of exercising its franchise and of transacting its business within this state.' Whether a corporation does exercise its franchise or transact its business within the meaning of a statute so framed when it does business through a receiver is a subject on which much subtle argument has been expended by state and federal courts. Distinctions have been drawn between receivers appointed to carry on the business of a corporation with a view to the continuance of its corporate life, and receivers appointed in aid of the dissolution of the corporation or the liquidation of its business. See, e. g., Collector of Taxes v. Bay State St. Railway, 234 Mass. 336, 125 N. E. 614; State of Ohio v. Harris (C. C. A.) 229 F. 892, 901. Other distinctions have been drawn between taxes on a franchise to exist as a corporation and a franchise for transacting business, or, as many of the cases put it, between a franchise to 'be' and a franchise to 'do.' \n\n[286 U.S. 334, 342]\n\u00a0\n See, e. g., Cobbs & Mitchell v. Corp. Tax Appeal Board, 252 Mich. 478, 481, 233 N. W. 386. Even where the tax is on a franchise to 'do,' there is wide diversity of judgment. The wording of some statutes has been read by some courts as importing the doing of business in the usual course by agents and officers appointed in the usual way. United States v. Whitridge, \n231 \nU.S. 144, 149\n, 34 S. Ct. 24. Wording only slightly different has been thought by other courts to include the operations of a business conducted by receivers. Central Trust Co. v. New York, C., etc., R. Co., 110 N. Y. 250, 18 N. E. 92, 1 L. R. A. 260; New York Terminal Co. v. Gaus, 204 N. Y. 512, 98 N. E. 11; In re U. S. Car Co., 60 N. J. Eq. 514, 43 A. 673; Armstrong v. Emmerson, 300 Ill. 54, 132 N. E. 768, 18 A. L. R. 693; People v. Hopkins (C. C. A.) 18 F.(2d) 731. Other wording not unlike has been held to import the imposition of a burden on the mere privilege to 'do,' though no business was in fact transacted by the directors or by any one (In re G. H. Hammond Co., 246 Mich. 179, 244 N. W. 655; New York v. Jersawit, \n263 \nU.S. 493, 495\n, 44 S. Ct. 167), a construction whereby the tax on the privilege to do becomes closely assimilated, in respect of domestic corporations, to one on the privilege to be. In re G. H. Hammond Co., supra.\n We are not required to choose from these diversities the construction that would appeal to us as the most consonant with reason if choice were wholly free. Choice, as it happens, is not free, for our task is to ascertain the meaning of a Michigan statute, and as to that the courts of the state, if they have spoken, pronounce the final word. The decision of the Supreme Court of Michigan in Re Detroit Properties Corporation, 254 Mich. 523, 236 N. W. 850, 852, is a controlling adjudication as to the meaning and application of the privilege fee exacted of Michigan corporations. The court held that the tax was imposed upon the privilege to 'do'; that this privilege existed though nothing was ever done; that the order appointing \n\n[286 U.S. 334, 343]\n\u00a0\n a receiver to continue the business did not divest the privilege; that the only effect of such an order was to nominate the person who was to exercise the 'powers belonging to the corporation by legislative grant'; and hence that within the meaning of the statute the corporation retained a 'privilege of exercising its franchise and of transacting its business,' for which a tax was due.

The significance of this decision is not avoided by the suggestion that the court in determining the application of the tax was guided by general principles as to the effect of a receivership, and not by any provision expressly covering receiverships in the body of the statute. This does not detract from the quality of the judgment as an expression of the local law. Problems of statutory construction do not arise unless the meaning of a statute is obscure or uncertain in its relation to a set of facts, and obscurities or uncertainties thus arising are not susceptible of settlement unless the words of the statute are read in a setting of commonlaw implications, a background of commonlaw doctrine, giving meaning and perspective to a vague and imperfect outline.

Minn. & N. W. R. Co., 1 Black, 358, 374, 375. The Supreme Court of Michigan in deciding the Detroit Properties Case had to make answer to the question whether the Legislature of the state in imposing a tax upon the privilege of exercising a franchise intended to reach a situation where the business of the corporation was conducted through the arm of a receiver. The tax, if there was any, could have no origin independent of the provisions of the statute, and any decision upholding or annulling it is one involving inescapably a construction of the statute. Cf. New York v. \n\n[286 U.S. 334, 344]\n\u00a0\n Jersawit, \n263 \nU.S. 493, 495\n, 44 S. Ct. 167; Mason v. United States, \n260 \nU.S. 545, 555\n, 556 S., 43 S. Ct. 200; Quong Ham Wah Co. v.

Ct. 58.\n We hold, therefore, in submission to the local law, that the corporation, the Worden Grocer Company, was still subject to the tax though it was in the hands of a receiver. The decision of the court below apparently concedes as much, but maintains that the tax must be paid by the corporation and not by the receiver, with the result that the state is subordinated to all the other creditors. We find no warrant for the discrimination either in the provisions of any statute or in any principle of equity governing the distribution of a fund in the hands of a receiver. On the contrary, statute and doctrine point the other way.\n Viewing the receivership in its true light as one, not to wind up the corporation, but to foster the assets, we think the annual taxes accruing while the receiver was in charge must be deemed expenses of administration and therefore charges to be satisfied in preference to the claims of general creditors. They are so treated in the order by which the receiver was appointed. By the order the receiver is directed in continuing the business to pay taxes and rentals and any other expenses necessary to enable the business to go on, and to give such payments priority over other debts and obligations. These privilege fees were charges of the nature there described. Taxes owing to the government, whether due at the beginning of a receivership or subsequently accruing, are the price that business has to pay for protection and security. Coy v. Title Guarantee & Trust Co. (C. C. A.) 220 F. 90, 92, L. R. A. 1915E, 211. The privilege fees, being taxes, were expenses of administration within the very terms of the order, but in addition they were taxes of such an order that the corporation by failing to pay them became subject, if the state so elected, to a forfeiture of its franchise. Act No. 172, Public Acts \n\n[286 U.S. 334, 345]\n\u00a0\n 1923, p. 272,  7; cf. Turner v. Western Hydro-Electric Co., 241 Mich. 6, 216 N. W. 476. The receiver was under a duty to pay them when they accrued, and having failed to fulfill that duty then, it should be compelled to pay them now. The decisions as to this are persuasive and uniform. Coy v. Title Guarantee & Trust Co., supra; Bright v. Arkansas (C. C. A.) 249 F. 950; McFarland v. Hurley (C. C. A.) 286 F. 365; People v. Hopkins (C. C. A .) 18 F.(2d) 731, 733; cf. In re Tyler, \n149 \nU.S. 164, 182\n, 13 S. Ct. 785.\n If the receivership were to be viewed as equivalent to one for the liquidation of the business, the result would not be different, and this for the reason, without considering any other, that it was not such a receivership when the suit was instituted. It was then, as we have pointed out, a receivership for the conservation of the assets of a corporation believed to be completely solvent. If it ever lost its original quality and became a winding-up receivership, the change was not earlier than the sale of the mercantile assets in the latter part of 1929. Claims of the state for taxes then accrued, instead of being postponed to those of other creditors, are entitled to a preference by the provisions of the local law. Sections 15315 and 15362, Compiled Laws of Michigan.\n This court has had occasion to point out the abuses that can arise from friendly receiverships forestalling the normal process of administration in bankruptcy and enabling a tottering business to continue while creditors are held at bay. Harkin v. Brundage, \n276 \nU.S. 36, 52\n, 54 S., 48 S. Ct. 268; cf. Kingsport Press v. Brief English Systems ( C. C. A.) 54 F.(2d) 497, 499, 500. Receiverships for conservation have at times a legitimate function, but they are to be watched with jealous eyes lest their function be perverted. For four years the business of this corporation was carried on in Michigan by a chancery receiver in the hope that winding up and dissolution would thereby be averted. There should be no shift of the theory of the suit in these, its \n\n[286 U.S. 334, 346]\n\u00a0\n expiring moments. To protect through a receiver the enjoyment of the corporate privilege and then to use the appointment as a barrier to the collection of the tax that should accompany enjoyment would be an injustice to the state and a reproach to equity.\n A word in conclusion should be said as to United States v. Whitridge, supra. The court held in that case that a corporation operating through a receiver is not subject to a federal tax imposed as an excise on the actual doing of business and to be measured by its fruits. The tax in controversy is a state tax, and is laid not on the doing of business, but on the mere privilege to do it. The state decision as to its meaning would control in case of conflict, but conflict there is none.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be reversed, and that of the District Court affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS is of opinion that the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be affirmed. \n\n\n\n","115":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPIEDMONT & N R. CO. v. INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION(1932)\nNo. 664\nArgued: Decided: May 16, 1932\n\n\n\n\n[286 U.S. 299, 300]\n\u00a0\n Mr. W. S. O'B. Robinson, Jr., of Charlotte, N. C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Nelson Thomas, of Washington, D. C., for respondent Interstate Commerce Commission.\n\n\n\n[286 U.S. 299, 302]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Sidney S. Alderman, of Washington, D. C., for respondents Southern Ry. Co. et al.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In 1910 a charter was granted under the laws of North Carolina for Piedmont Traction Company, as a street railway corporation, authorized to construct street railways in and near Gastonia, with the limited powers of such a company. In the same year the Greenville, Spartanburg & Anderson Railway Company was chartered under the laws of South Carolina, as a street railway corporation, with power to run between fixed termini, Anderson on the south and Spartanburg on the north. A syndicate was then formed which procured a charter for petitioner as a railroad corporation under the law of South Carolina, with full power of eminent domain and author- \n\n[286 U.S. 299, 303]\n\u00a0\n ity to operate by electricity or otherwise. The Piedmont Traction Company built certain lines in North Carolina, put them into operation, acquired the street railway system of Charlotte and trackage rights over the street railway system of Gastonia. The Greenville, Spartanburg & Anderson Railway Company acquired a line from Belton to Anderson; built one from Greenwood to Greenville, and afterwards on to Spartanburg; secured trackage rights over the street railway systems in Greenville and Anderson, and put all of them into operation in April, 1914. The traction company and the railway company then conveyed their respective properties to the petitioner.\n Until the close of 1926, the petitioner owned and operated two separate and disconnected lines of railway, one in South Carolina extending from Greenwood to Spartanburg, about eighty-nine miles, with a branch from Belton to Anderson of eleven miles, and the other in North Carolina extending from Gastonia to Charlotte, about twenty-three miles, with a branch to Belmont, three miles.\n In March, 1927, pursuant to corporate action, it proceeded to construct two extensions, one from Spartanburg, the then northern terminus of the South Carolina line, to Gastonia, the southern terminus of the North Carolina line, a distance of fifty-three miles; the other an extension from Charlotte northward to a new terminus at Winston-Salem, N. C., a distance of seventy-five miles. The Interstate Commerce Commission notified the company that appropriate application should be made for a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing these extensions, and that this might be filed without prejudice to the petitioner's making a claim of exemption as an interurban electric railway under section 1, par. 22, of the Interstate Commerce Act, as added by Transportation Act  402, 49 USCA  1(22). This course was followed. The Commission overruled the claim of exemption, and denied a certificate on the merits. The company brought suit in the United States District Court under the Urgent \n\n[286 U.S. 299, 304]\n\u00a0\n Deficiencies Act1 to set aside and annul that portion of the Commission's order which denied it exemption as an interurban electric railway. A statutory court was convened, and after hearing dismissed the suit on the merits. \n2\n Upon appeal, this court held that the order of the Commission, being negative in substance as well as in form, infringed no right of the petitioner, was beyond the scope of the remedy afforded by the Urgent Deficiencies Act, and therefore the suit should have been dismissed for want of jurisdiction. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n Thereafter the board of directors by resolution reaffirmed the intention to build both extensions and authorized the construction of the connecting link between Spartanburg and Gastonia. The Commission, upon being advised that work had actually started, brought the present suit in the District Court for Western South Carolina, alleging that the construction was illegal, since no certificate had been obtained as required by the Transportation Act, of 1920,  402, par. (18).4 It sought an injunction pursuant to the terms of paragraph (20) of the section. Several interstate railroads were permitted to intervene as parties in interest. See Western Pacific California R. R. Co. v. Southern Pacific Co., \n284 \nU.S. 47\n, 52 S. Ct. 56. The petitioner defended upon the grounds that the work had been undertaken within ninety days of the adoption of the Transportation Act, and for that reason no certificate for the proposed extensions was required,5 and that petitioner was within the exception to the Com- \n\n[286 U.S. 299, 305]\n\u00a0\n mission's jurisdiction over extensions and new construction, created by paragraph (22) of section 1 of the act, as an interurban electric railway not operated as a part of a general steam railroad system of transportation. After a hearing on pleadings and proofs, the trial court overruled both defenses and entered a decree enjoining the further work of construction until a certificate of convenience and necessity should be obtained. 51 F.(2d) 766. Petitioner appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, and we granted certiorari prior to hearing by that court. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n The petitioner has abandoned its first contention and stands only on the claimed exemption.\n Section 1, par. 22 of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended by section 402 of the Transportation Act,7 provides:\n'The authority of the commission conferred by paragraphs (18) to (21), both inclusive, shall not extend to the construction or abandonment of spur, industrial, team, switching, or side tracks, located or to be located wholly within one State, or of street, suburban, or interurban electric railways, which are not operated as a part of parts of a general steam railroad system of transportation.'\n\n Paragraphs (18) to (21) authorize the Commission to grant a certificate for extensions of line or constructions of new line, or for the abandonment of lines, forbid such action without such certificate, and give the Commission or any party in interest the right to enjoin action in disregard of their provisions.\n In support of the claimed exemption, petitioner says its lines are exclusively electric, are not operated as parts of a general steam railroad system of transportation, were constructed, equipped, and are maintained and conducted as interurban electric railways, and that the proposed extensions would be of the same character and operated in \n\n[286 U.S. 299, 306]\n\u00a0\n the same manner. The concession is made that the company is engaged in the general transportation of freight and passengers in interstate commerce, that the proposed extensions would be so operated in connection with the existing lines, and that petitioner is therefore subject to the Interstate Commerce Act as amended by the Transportation Act, 1920, except those portions from the application of which interurban electric railways not operated as a part or parts of a general steam railroad system of transportation are expressly excluded. In summary, the argument is that paragraph (22) in unambiguous terms excepts petitioner's road from the effect of paragraphs (18) to (21) of section 1, needing neither construction nor interpretation in its application; but that, if there be question regarding this contention, the facts with respect to the railway bring it within the intent of the excepting clause, and, finally, that various governmental agencies have so classified it.\n Emphasis is placed upon the aptness of the words used in the paragraph as descriptive of petitioner's railway. Thus it is said the road is 'electric'; is 'interurban,' since it extends between cities; and is 'not a part of any system of steam railroads.' But this literal application is inconclusive, for it ignores the entire phraseology employed, which is, 'street, suburban, or interurban electric railways . ...' The descriptive adjectives show that Congress had in mind a class of carriers differing essentially from those long recognized as the objects of national concern and regulation. A few illustrations will demonstrate the impossibility of the proposed narrow construction. It would hardly be contended that, if an interstate steam railroad should electrify its entire system, this would place it beyond the reach of paragraphs (18) to (21). Yet the road would become both electric and interurban in the etymological sense of the words, and would \n\n[286 U.S. 299, 307]\n\u00a0\n not be operated as a part of a general system of steam railroad transportation. Should a new electric transcontinental system be projected without question, application for a certificate under those paragraphs would be required, though here again by mere verbal interpretation it would be exempt from the necessity.\n We must therefore seek further to ascertain the distinguishing features which the Legislature had in mind. No difficulty is encountered in defining a street or a suburban electric railway. These are essentially local, are fundamentally passenger carriers, are to an inconsiderable extent engaged in interstate carriage, and transact freight business only incidentally and in a small volume. The record indicates that prior to 1920 such street or suburban railways had grown in many instances so as to link distinct communities, and that, in addition, so-called interurban lines were constructed from time to time, to serve the convenience of two or more cities. But the characteristics of street or suburban railways persisted in these interurban lines. They also were chiefly devoted to passenger traffic and operated single or series self-propelled cars. Many of them carried package freight, some also transported mail, and still fewer carload freight picked up along the line or received for local delivery from connecting steam railroads. It is clear that the phrase 'interurban electric railway' was not, in 1920, commonly used to designate a carrier whose major activity was the transportation of interstate freight in trains of standard freight cars. It cannot be said, therefore, that, if a railway is operated by electricity and extends between cities paragraph (22), clearly and unequivocally exempts it from the Commission's jurisdiction.\n Petitioner, however, insists that examination of the facts with respect to its road demonstrates that it falls into the exempt class. The salient features to which reference is \n\n[286 U.S. 299, 308]\n\u00a0\n made are that the lines connect and tie in with the street railway systems in the cities and towns on the system; that of the main line trackage fifteen miles are operated jointly with street car lines; that the street railways in the cities were acquired so that the interurban tracks might be connected with them for urban terminal and trackage facilities; that the motive power is exclusively electric; that the road is not a part of any steam railway system; that a lower voltage, a lighter overhead construction and power supply, and a smaller substatioin capacity are employed than those of standard steam railroad electric lines; that the signal system would not be suitable for use on a main line steam railroad; that the locomotives are lighter than the standard engines used by steam railroads which have electrified their systems; and that the passenger cars are motivated by self-contained motor units instead of being drawn by locomotives.\n These alleged distinctions lose much of their significance when we consider other facts found by the trial court, without exception or assignment of error. These may be summarized. Only 2.9 miles of the present total trackage, or about 2.25 per cent., is located in city streets. The balance is built and operated on private right of way, and goes around, rather than through, the cities. The tracks are standard gauge and of standard railroad construction, were, at the time they were laid, of higher class than those of the Southern Railway Company in the same territory, were intended for handling substantial interchange freight traffic in connection with steam railroads, have the same ruling grades as the latter in the same territory, and are of 80-pound rail. There are 17 electric locomotives, ranging from 55 to 100 tons weight; 287 freight cars are owned, which have no electric equipment, are the same in all respects as steam railroad freight cars, are interchangeable with steam rail- \n\n[286 U.S. 299, 309]\n\u00a0\n roads, and are and have been regularly so exchanged. Foreign line freight equipment of every character flows freely over the road. As of December 31, 1929, the total investment in equipment since June, 1914, was $778,194, approximately 85 per cent. of which represented expenditures for locomotives and interchangeable freight cars used exclusively in the carriage of freight. The electric locomotives are used only for freight. The freight yards are of standard steam railroad construction and equipment, and one of them is a joint facility with the Seaboard and Georgia & Florida, steam railroads. While the locomotives are lighter than those employed on standard steam railroads, they are adequate for the petitioner's traffic. By doubling, as many as 65 freight cars may be drawn, and trains of 40 and 50 cars are usual. Through and local freight trains are operated in the same manner as on steam railroads. Methods of business solicitation, membership in traffic organization, and tariffs published and concurred in, are national in scope. The road has filed seventeen general individual tariffs under I. C. C. serial numbers, is a party as initial carrier to 184 general tariffs, and as participating carrier in 364 tariffs published under powers of attorney given to the steam railroads. These tariffs embrace the entire country and parts of Mexico and Canada. From the beginning, freight revenues have been large, while those from passenger traffic have progressively decreased. The freight revenues have increased from $496,772.39 for the year ending June 30, 1914, to $2,317,528.77 for 1929. The total passenger revenues for the year ending June 30, 1914, were $324,045.21, but were only $71,562.72 for 1929. For the latter year the freight revenues were 9j. \n5\n per cent. and the passenger revenues 2.9 per cent. of the total revenue. For 1929, 4.3 per cent. of the total freight revenues were from local freight, and 95.7 per cent. from inter- \n\n[286 U.S. 299, 310]\n\u00a0\n line interchange freight. A comparison of interstate with intrastate were 94.5 per cent. and the passenger interstate and 19.3 per cent. intrastate; the latter including freight interchanged with steam railroad connections but originating and destined to points within the same state. There is more then one loaded car of freight eacy day on petitioner's line for every plassenger carried. The average interchange of carload freight with steam railroads of the territory is approximately 6,000 cars per month.\n The petitioner now has a connection at its southern terminus with the Georgia & Florida, a steam railroad. See Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. United States, \n284 \nU.S. 288, 291\n, 52 S. Ct. 171. If the proposed extensions were built, it would have a similar connection at its northern terminus with the Norfolk & Western. Thus it would become a connecting link in a new through route and effective line of connecting carriers which would be strongly competitive with existing trunk lines, leading from Florida and the southeast to the northern gateways reached by the Norfolk & Western. If only the proposed extension to close the gap between Spartanburg, S. C., and Gastonia, N. C., should be built, the same result would follow, except that the route from Charlotte to Winston-Salem and the connection there with Norfolk & Western would not be entirely over petitioner's own lines, but over a joint route on the Norfolk Southern to Norwood, and Winston-Salem Southbound to Winston-Salem. Petitioner's own estimate contained in its application to the Commission is that the extensions would gain new business diverted from steam railroads of 82,320 cars a year, including 12,300 cars of bridge traffic carried entirely over its lines as the interior connecting link in joint through routes, resulting in a gain of revenue of $3,890,000 for the first year. The estimated loss of revenue to competing carriers is con- \n\n[286 U.S. 299, 311]\n\u00a0\n siderably greater. It thus appears that petitioner's business is pre- eminently interchange interstate freight traffic of national character, in all essential respects conducted as is the business of the steam freight carriers in the territory served. The differences in construction, equipment, operation, and handling are incidental merely to the use of electric motive power in lieu of steam. The purely local traffic in freight, passengers, baggage, and express is relatively inconsequential.\n In Texas & P. R. Co. v. Gulf, C. & S. F. R. Co., \n270 \nU.S. 266, 277\n, 278 S., 46 S. C.t. 263, the court announced the guiding principles to be followed in construing the very paragraph involved in the case at bar. As there indicated, the purpose of the statute to develop and maintain an adequate railway system for the people of the United States requires a broader and more liberal interpretation than that to be drawn from mere dictionary definitions of the words employed by Congress. Accordingly, a track seven miles in length, proposed to be constructed to reach industries in territory not theretofore served by the railroad, and which would take away from a competitor much of the traffic then enjoyed, was held not to be an 'industrial track,' as that phrase is used in paragraph (22), although by strict construction it was such.\n The petitioner's railway is of such importance in interstate commerce and renders a service so predominantly devoted to the handling of interstate freight in connection with steam railroads, is in such relation to connecting steam carriers, and competes with steam trunk lines in such manner, that, in view of the declared policy of the act, we cannot hold it an 'interurban' railway within the exemption of the same paragraph. The Transportation Act was remedial legislation, and should therefore be given a liberal interpretation; pretation; but for the same reason exemptions from its sweep should be narrowed and limited to \n\n[286 U.S. 299, 312]\n\u00a0\n effect the remedy intended. Spokane & Inland Empire R. Co. v. United States, \n241 \nU.S. 344\n, 36 S. Ct. 668. In cases where an appreciation of the facts is requisite to proper classification, it is not always easy to draw the line. Instances may be supposed where great difficulty might be experienced in determining whether an electric railway line falls within or without the exception of paragraph (22). But this is not such a case. The facts clearly require a holding that petitioner's railway is not within the true intent and purpose of the exclusion intended by the paragraph.\n Only a word need be said with respect to the contention that governmental agencies have heretofore classified the railway as an interurban electric line. It is true that, in connection with quite diverse administrative functions, the United States Labor Board, the Postmaster General, and the Interstate Commerce Commission have classified petitioner's railway as an interurban electric line in distinction to steam railroads. Neither the administrative nor the statutory classification has, however, been uniform, and in any event is not controlling in this litigation.\n Attention is drawn to the fact that the same phraseology is used in other sections of the Interstate Commerce Act. But it is so used with other purposes in view.\n We are of opinion that the District Court correctly held that petitioner falls within the terms of paragraphs (18) to (21) of section 1 of the Interstate Commerce Act, and was properly enjoined from proceeding with the construction of the proposed extensions in the absence of a certificate of convenience and necessity. The judgment of the District Court is\nAFFIRMED.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] U. S.

Two joint-stock associations, Planters' Cotton Oil Company, Waxahachie, and Planters' Cotton Oil Company, Ennis, which had been organized in earlier years, retained their separate existence. One man, H. N. Chapman, was the owner of 98 per cent. of the shares of the unincorporated associations. He caused the assets of those associations, or substantially all of them, to be transferred to the newly organized corporations, and received in return substantially all the shares of stock.\n For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1925, the three corporations and the two jointstock associations filed a consolidated income tax return wherein the corporations, which had earned a net income of $147,636.25, claimed a deduction of $78,399.25 for loss suffered by the associations during the year preceding the affiliation. The deduction was disallowed, and suit was brought by the corporation and the associations for the refund of the tax to the extent of the overpayment claimed. The District Court dismissed the petition (47 F.(2d) 659); the Court of Appeals affirmed (53 F.(2d) 825); and by certiorari the case is here (\n285 \nU.S. 533\n, 52 S. Ct. 405, 76 L.

We think it does not. Chapman was free, if he desired, to continue to do business in an unincorporated form. Preferring the \n\n[286 U.S. 332, 334]\n\u00a0\n privileges of corporate organization, he brought into being three corporations and did business through them. These corporations are not identical with the unincorporated associations to whose principal assets they have succeeded, and the losses of the associations suffered in an earlier year are not the losses of the corporations that came into existence afterwards.\n The judgment is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","117":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPORTER v.

Gunn, of Helena, Mont., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In this cause, reversing the decree of the United States District Court, we held (\n286 \nU.S. 461\n, 52 S.Ct. 617) that the appellee had failed to exhaust the administrative remedy afforded by the Montana statute, and that the federal court was therefore without jurisdiction as a court of equity to enjoin enforcement of the state auditor's order.\n The appellee has presented a petition for rehearing which concedes the correctness of our ruling that the statute gives a remedy partly administrative in character, by suit in the state district court, but contends that by this grant the act violates article 4, section 1, of the Montana constitution, which is: 'The powers of the government of this state are divided into three distinct departments: The legislative, \n\n[287 U.S. 346, 347]\n\u00a0\n executive, and judicial, and no person or collection of persons charged with the exercise of powers properly belonging to one of these departments shall exercise any powers properly belonging to either of the others, except as in this constitution expressly directed or permitted.'\n As this question was not briefed or argued when the case was first heard, we granted a reargument; and the cause has again been presented on this point.\n The statute plainly affords a remedy which, though in certain respects judicial, is in others administrative. The courts of Montana have not passed upon its constitutionality as affected by the quoted section of the fundamental law of the state. Such expressions of the Supreme Court as have been brought to our attention indicate that article 4, section 1, does not forbid the conference on the state district courts of administrative powers in connection with and ancillary to their judicial functions. O'Neill v. Yellowstone Irrigation Dist., 44 Mont. 492, 121 P. 283; State v. Johnson, 75 Mont. 240, 249, 243 P. 1073. Compare State ex rel. Kellogg v. District Court, 13 Mont. 370, 34 P. 298; State ex rel. Hillis v. Sullivan, 48 Mont. 320, 137 P. 392.\n An adjudication of the question by the state Supreme Court would bind us. Gulf, C. & S.F.R. Co. v. Dennis, \n224 \nU.S. 503\n, 32 S.Ct. 542. In the absence of such decision we are reluctant to construe a state constitution, Louisville & N.R. Co. v. Garrett, \n231 \nU.S. 298\n, 34 S.Ct. 48; but as our decision requires that the alleged conflict of state statute and state Constitution be resolved we must pass upon it. Southern R. Co. v. Watts, \n260 \nU.S. 519, 522\n, 43 S.Ct. 192.\n In view of the Montana cases to which reference has been made, we are not convinced that the statute is offensive to the Montana Constitution, and adhere to the judgment heretofore entered. \n\n\n\n","118":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPORTER v. INVESTORS' SYNDICATE(1932)\nNo. 627\nArgued: April 22, 1932Decided: May 23, 1932\n\n\n\n\n[286 U.S. 461, 462]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. T. H. MacDonald and L. A. Foot, both of Helena, Mont., and J. W. Freeman, of Great Falls, Mont., for appellant.\n\n\n\n[286 U.S. 461, 463]\n\u00a0\n Mr. M. S. Gunn, of Helena, Mont., for appellee.\n\n\n\n[286 U.S. 461, 464]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from the decree of a specially constituted district court enjoining the enforcement of an order of the state auditor, who is ex officio investment commissioner of Montana. Appellee is a Minnesota corporation engaged in the business of selling investment certificates for which the purchaser pays in installments and which entitle him at a date therein named to receive their face value. The assumption is that the installments of principal paid in will be augmented by interest thereon compounded at 5 1\/2 per cent., so that the company will be able to pay the sum named in the certificate before the holder's payments reach that total.\n Appellee was licensed in 1930 to do business in Montana pursuant to chapter 264, Revised Code of 1921, popularly known as the Blue Sky Law, which defines investment companies (section 4026), forbids their engaging in business without a permit from the state investment commissioner ( section 4032), requires them to apply for such permit and to submit certain information with the application (section 4033), directs the commissioner to examine the data furnished and to issue or refuse a permit depending upon his determination that the applicant is solvent and its proposed plan of business fair, just, and equitable (section 4036), and to supervise and from time to time examine the affairs and business of all permittees (section 4043). Sec- \n\n[286 U.S. 461, 465]\n\u00a0\n tion 4045, which authorizes the revocation of permits, and section 4038 ( as amended by chapter 194, Session Laws 1931), which gives an action against the commissioner by a party aggrieved by any finding or decision of that officer, are those which affect the present litigation. They are quoted in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Operating under permit appellee has built up a large business in Montana in the sale of its certificates. One form of these provides that in case of default in current payments during the first eighteen months, the purchaser shall forfeit all sums theretofore paid; for default after eighteen months, where payment of $148 on a thousand dollar certificate has been made, the holder is entitled to withdraw $42; after four years and payment of $370, the refund is $254; and after five years he is entitled to re- \n\n[286 U.S. 461, 466]\n\u00a0\n payment, without interest, of the whole amount theretofore paid.\n On May 7, 1931, the appellant notified the appellee and others similarly engaged to attend a hearing relative to the proposed adoption of a rule applicable to their business. Appellee appeared by an officer and counsel and stated objections. As a result of the hearing a rule made promulgated June 22, 1931, effective July 22, 1931, forbidding the issuance of certificates extending the privilege of withdrawal before maturity unless they should permit withdrawal at any time after the first year of their \n\n[286 U.S. 461, 467]\n\u00a0\n existence, on ninety days' notice in writing, and thereupon entitle the holder to receive the total amount of all installments paid in, less a penalty not exceeding 3 1\/2 per cent. of the matured or face value of the certificate, plus interest compounded annually, at the rate at which the certificate was guaranteed to mature or represented to pay at maturity; and that the certificate and the application should have printed thereon the amount to be paid in, the withdrawal or surrender value, and the loan value, as of the end of each year after the date of issuance.\n The commissioner claimed authority to promulgate this order under that portion of section 4045 which empowers him to revoke the permit of an investment company when it shall appear to him to be 'conducting its business in an unsafe, inequitable, or unauthorized manner.' He asserted his intention to revoke appellee's permit if it failed to obey the rule; whereupon the latter brought action in the District Court to enjoin the appellant from revoking or purporting or attempting to revoke its permit for failure to comply with the order. After the taking of evidence upon a motion for a temporary restraining order the case was by stipulation submitted as upon final hearing. The court granted an injunction, holding that the challenged statute was violative of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as lacking any provision for notice or hearing before the revocation of a license, and also because no rule or standard is fixed for the determination of adequate cause for revocation; and further the act constituted a delegation of legislative power contrary to the mandate of section 1, article 5, of the Constitution of Montana. The appellant assigns these rulings as error, and in addition contends that there was no jurisdiction in a federal equity court to entertain the cause. If this position is sound we need not consider the other alleged errors. \n\n[286 U.S. 461, 468]\n\u00a0\n We are of opinion that the appellee failed to exhaust its administrative remedy before applying to the District Court for injunctive relief. The granting and revocation of permits is an exercise by the appellant of delegated legislative power. Section 4038 of the Code (supra) confers on any interested person dissatisfied with a finding or decision by the commissioner, the right within thirty days to bring an action against him in a state district court to vacate his order and set it aside as unjust or unreasonable, and directs that on the hearing the judge 'may set aside, modify or confirm said ... decision as the evidence and the rules or (sic) equity may require.' The section confers the right to appeal to the state Supreme Court from the judgment of the trial court. Clearly the function of the state district court under the statutory mandate is not solely judicial, that is, to set aside a decision of the commissioner if arbitrary or unreasonable and hence violative of constitutional rights. The duty is laid on the court to examine the evidence presented and either to set aside or to modify or to affirm the commissioner's order, as the proofs may require. The legislative process remains incomplete until the action of that court shall have become final. Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Co., \n211 \nU.S. 210, 229\n, 230 S., 29 S. Ct. 67; Pacific Live Stock Co. v. Lewis, \n241 \nU.S. 440, 444\n, 450 S., 451, 36 S. Ct. 637. And the capacity in which the court acts is none the less administrative because the proceeding is designated as a suit in equity instead of by appeal. Keller v. Potomac Electric Power Co., \n261 U.S. 428\n, 438-442, 43 S. Ct. 445. When the appellee was notified on June 22, 1931, that the rule adopted by the appellant would become effective July 22d of the same year, an action could have been filed in the state court and a hearing had upon all questions of fact and law touching the propriety and legality of the order. \n\n[286 U.S. 461, 469]\n\u00a0\n But we are told that the commissioner asserted his intention to enforce the order, and that the statute forbids the state court to afford interlocutory relief. Thus, says the appellee, though trial might result in a decision vacating the commissioner's order, in the interval irreparable harm would have been done by the revocation of the company's permit, and its officers and agents rendered liable to criminal prosecution. Such a state of the law, it is insisted, amounts to a denial of due process to which one confronted with the possible loss of property is not bound to submit, but may at once, if there be the requisite diversity of citizenship and amount in controversy, apply to a federal court for relief. Conceding the correctness of the premises, the conclusion is sound. Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Kuykendall, \n265 \nU.S. 196\n, 44 S. Ct. 553. The appellant, however, denies the asserted statutory prohibition, and says that the plaintiff in an action attacking a decision by the commissioner may upon a proper showing obtain a stay of its operation.\n These opposing views require a construction of the act. Section 4038 as amended provides, so far as applicable: 'The rules of pleading and procedure in such action shall be the same as are provided by law for the trial of equitable actions in the district courts of this state. ... And pending any such action the said findings or decision of the Commissioner shall remain in full force and effect. If no action be brought to set aside said findings or decision within thirty days, the same shall become final and binding.'\n We are cited to no case, nor have we found any, in which the state courts have interpreted or applied the section. The first clause would obviously permit the issuance of an interlocutory injunction upon a proper showing, especially in view of the provisions of the Code \n\n[286 U.S. 461, 470]\n\u00a0\n of Civil Procedure. \n2\n But it is said that the succeeding clause precludes such a remedy. The argument is that the words 'pending any such action' mean that during the continuance of the action and until its final decision the commissioner's order must remain in full force and effect. We think, however, that in this phrase the word 'pending' has the significance of 'until,' or while the time is running for bringing such an action. This is one of the recognized meanings of the word, and that it is so used we think is made clear from the sentence immediately following, to the effect that if no action shall be brought to set aside the finding or decision within thirty days it shall become final and binding. When considered together we are of opinion that the two phrases mean that unless and until a person affected brings his action he may not disregard the order. We are persuaded to this view for the reason that it supports the constitutionality of the act, and we are bound if fairly possible to construe the law so as to avoid the conclusion of unconstitutionality. Bratton v. Chandler, \n260 \nU.S. 110\n, 43 S. Ct. 43. The construction thus adopted is consistent with the validity of the act, whereas that pressed upon us by the appellee would clearly render it unconstitutional.\n Where, as ancillary to the review and correction of administrative action, the state statute provides that the \n\n[286 U.S. 461, 471]\n\u00a0\n complaining party may have a stay until final decision, there is no deprivation of due process, although the statute in words attributes final and binding character to the initial decision of a board or commissioner. Pacific Live Stock Co. v. Lewis, \n241 \nU.S. 440, 454\n, 36 S. Ct. 637. But where either the plain provisions of the statute (Pacific Tel. & Telegraph Co. v. Kuykendall, \n265 \nU.S. 196, 203\n, 204 S., 44 S. Ct. 553) or the decisions of the state courts interpreting the act ( Oklahoma Nat. Gas. Co. v. Russell, \n261 \nU.S. 290\n, 43 S. Ct. 353) preclude a supersedeas or stay until the legislative process is completed by the final action of the reviewing court, due process is not afforded, and in cases where the other requisites of federal jurisdiction exist recourse to a federal court of equity is justified.\n The present case is not one in which the review of the commissioner's action is judicial in character. If it were the authorities cited by appellee which hold that one competent to invoke the jurisdiction of the federal courts is not bound to pursue a judicial review in the state courts would apply. See Bacon v. Rutland R. Co., \n232 \nU.S. 134\n, 34 S. Ct. 283; Prendergast v. New York Tel. Co., \n262 \nU.S. 43\n, 43 S. Ct. 466; Railroad & Warehouse Commission v. Duluth St. Ry. Co., \n273 \nU.S. 625\n, 47 S. Ct. 489. As we have seen, under the Montana statute the administrative proceeding is not complete until the court shall have acted in revision and correction of the commissioner's decision. It would be strange indeed if the commissioner's action thus subject to alteration were nevertheless to be made as effective to harm the parties in interest as if no further administrative procedure existed. We cannot so read the act in the absence of clear and unambiguous phraseology requiring that course, or of a decision of the state court so construing it.\n The decree is reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n So ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] '4045. Revocation of permits and appointment of receiver.

STATE OF ALA.(1932)\nNo. 98-100\nArgued: October 10, 1932Decided: November 7, 1932\n\n\n\n\n\n[287 U.S. 45, 47]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Walter H. Pollak, of New York City, for petitioners.\n Mr. Thomas E. Knight, Jr., of Montgomery, Ala., for the State of Alabama.\n\n\n[287 U.S. 45, 49]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These cases were argued together and submitted for decision as one case.\n The petitioners, hereinafter referred to as defendants, are negroes charged with the crime of rape, committed upon the persons of two white girls. The crime is said to have been committed on March 25, 1931. The indictment was returned in a state court of first instance on March 31, and the record recites that on the same day the defendants were arraigned and entered pleas of not guilty. There is a further recital to the effect that upon the arraignment they were represented by counsel. But no counsel had been employed, and aside from a statement made by the trial judge several days later during a colloquy immediately preceding the trial, the record does not disclose when, or under what circumstances, an appointment of counsel was made, or who was appointed. During the colloquy referred to, the trial judge, in response to a question, said that he had appointed all the members of the bar for the purpose of arraigning the defendants and then of course anticipated that the members of the bar would continue to help the defendants if no counsel appeared. Upon the argument here both sides accepted that as a correct statement of the facts concerning the matter.\n There was a severance upon the request of the state, and the defendants were tried in three several groups, as indicated above. As each of the three cases was called for trial, each defendant was arraigned, and, having the \n\n[287 U.S. 45, 50]\n\u00a0\n indictment read to him, entered a plea of not guilty. Whether the original arraignment and pleas were regarded as ineffective is not shown. Each of the three trials was completed within a single day. Under the Alabama statute the punishment for rape is to be fixed by the jury, and in its discretion may be from ten years imprisonment to death. The juries found defendants guilty and imposed the death penalty upon all. The trial court overruled motions for new trials and sentenced the defendants in accordance with the verdicts. The judgments were affirmed by the state supreme court. Chief Justice Anderson thought the defendants had not been accorded a fair trial and strongly dissented. Weems v. State, 224 Ala. 524, 141 So. 215; Patterson v. State, 224 Ala. 531, 141 So. 195; Powell v. State, 224 Ala. 540, 141 So. 201.\n In this court the judgments are assailed upon the grounds that the defendants, and each of them, were denied due process of law and the equal protection of the laws, in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment, specifically as follows: (1) They were not given a fair, impartial, and deliberate trial; (2) they were denied the right of counsel, with the accustomed incidents of consultation and opportunity of preparation for trial; and (3) they were tried before juries from which qualified members of their own race were systematically excluded. These questions were properly raised and saved in the courts below.\n The only one of the assignments which we shall consider is the second, in respect of the denial of counsel; and it becomes unnecessary to discuss the facts of the case or the circumstances surrounding the prosecution except in so far as they reflect light upon that question.\n The record shows that on the day when the offense is said to have been committed, these defendants, together with a number of other negroes, were upon a freight train on its way through Alabama. On the same train were seven white boys and the two white girls. A fight took \n\n[287 U.S. 45, 51]\n\u00a0\n place between the negroes and the white boys, in the course of which the white boys, with the exception of one named Gilley, were thrown off the train. A message was sent ahead, reporting the fight and asking that every negro be gotten off the train. The participants in the fight, and the two girls, were in an open gondola car. The two girls testified that each of them was assaulted by six different negroes in turn, and they identified the seven defendants as having been among the number. None of the white boys was called to testify, with the exception of Gilley, who was called in rebuttal.\n Before the train reached Scottsboro, Ala., a sheriff's posse seized the defendants and two other negroes. Both girls and the negroes then were taken to Scottsboro, the county seat. Word of their coming and of the alleged assault had preceded them, and they were met at Scottsboro by a large crowd. It does not sufficiently appear that the defendants were seriously threatened with, or that they were actually in danger of, mob violence; but it does appear that the attitude of the community was one of great hostility. The sheriff thought it necessary to call for the militia to assist in safeguarding the prisoners. Chief Justice Anderson pointed out in his opinion that every step taken from the arrest and arraignment to the sentence was accompanied by the military. Soldiers took the defendants to Gadsden for safe-keeping, brought them back to Scottsboro for arraignment, returned them to Gadsden for safe-keeping while awaiting trial, escorted them to Scottsboro for trial a few days later, and guarded the courthouse and grounds at every stage of the proceedings. It is perfectly apparent that the proceedings, from beginning to end, took place in an atmosphere of tense, hostile, and excited public sentiment. During the entire time, the defendants were closely confined or were under military guard. The record does not disclose their ages, except that one of them was nineteen; but the \n\n[287 U.S. 45, 52]\n\u00a0\n record clearly indicates that most, if not all, of them were youthful, and they are constantly referred to as 'the boys.' They were ignorant and illiterate. All of them were residents of other states, where alone members of their families or friends resided.\n However guilty defendants, upon due inquiry, might prove to have been, they were, until convicted, presumed to be innocent. It was the duty of the court having their cases in charge to see that they were denied no necessary incident of a fair trial. With any error of the state court involving alleged contravention of the state statutes or Constitution we, of course, have nothing to do. The sole inquiry which we are permitted to make is whether the federal Constitution was contravened (Rogers v. Peck, \n199 \nU.S. 425, 434\n, 26 S.Ct. 87; Hebert v. State of Louisiana, \n272 \nU.S. 312, 316\n, 47 S.Ct. 103, 48 A.L.R. 1102); and as to that, we confine ourselves, as already suggested, to the inquiry whether the defendants were in substance denied the right of counsel, and if so, whether such denial infringes the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n First. The record shows that immediately upon the return of the indictment defendants were arraigned and pleaded not guilty. Apparently they were not asked whether they had, or were able to employ, counsel, or wished to have counsel appointed; or whether they had friends or relatives who might assist in that regard if communicated with. That it would not have been an idle ceremony to have given the defendants reasonable opportunity to communicate with their families and endeavor to obtain counsel is demonstrated by the fact that very soon after conviction, able counsel appeared in their behalf. This was pointed out by Chief Justice Anderson in the course of his dissenting opinion. 'They were nonresidents,' he said, 'and had little time or opportunity to get in touch with their families and friends who were scattered throughout two other states, and time has dem- \n\n[287 U.S. 45, 53]\n\u00a0\n onstrated that they could or would have been represented by able counsel had a better opportunity been given by a reasonable delay in the trial of the cases judging from the number and activity of counsel that appeared immediately or shortly after their conviction.' Powell v. State, 224 Ala. at pages 554, 555, 141 So. 201, 214.\n It is hardly necessary to say that the right to counsel being conceded, a defendant should be afforded a fair opportunity to secure counsel of his own choice. Not only was that not done here, but such designation of counsel as was attempted was either so indefinite or so close upon the trial as to amount to a denial of effective and substantial aid in that regard. This will be amply demonstrated by a brief review of the record.\n April 6, six days after indictment, the trials began. When the first case was called, the court inquired whether the parties were ready for trial. The state's attorney replied that he was ready to proceed. No one answered for the defendants or appeared to represent or defend them. Mr. Roddy, a Tennessee lawyer not a member of the local bar, addressed the court, saying that he had not been employed, but that people who were interested had spoken to him about the case. He was asked by the court whether he intended to appear for the defendants, and answered that he would like to appear along with counsel that the court might appoint. The record then proceeds:\n'The Court: If you appear for these defendants, then I will not appoint counsel; if local counsel are willing to appear and assist you under the circumstances all right, but I will not appoint them.\n\n'Mr. Roddy: Your Honor has appointed counsel, is that correct?\n\n'The Court: I appointed all the members of the bar for the purpose of arraigning the defendants and then of course I anticipated them to continue to help them if no counsel appears. \n\n[287 U.S. 45, 54]\n\u00a0\n 'Mr. Roddy: Then I don't appear then as counsel but I do want to stay in and not be ruled out in this case.\n\n'The Court: Of course I would not do that-\n\n'Mr. Roddy: I just appear here through the courtesy of Your Honor.\n\n'The Court: Of course I give you that right ....'\n\n And then, apparently addressing all the lawyers present, the court inquired:\n'... Well are you all willing to assist?\n\n'Mr. Moody: Your Honor appointed us all and we have been proceeding along every line we know about it under Your Honor's appointment.\n\n'The Court: The only thing I am trying to do is, if counsel appears for these defendants I don't want to impose on you all, but if you feel like counsel from Chattanooga-\n\n'Mr. Moody: I see his situation of course and I have not run out of anything yet. Of course, if Your Honor purposes to appoint us, Mr. Parks, I am willing to go on with it. Most of the bar have been down and conferred with these defendants in this case; they did not know what else to do.\n\n'The Court: The thing, I did not want to impose on the members of the bar if counsel unqualifiedly appears; if you all feel like Mr. Roddy is only interested in a limited way to assist, then I don't care to appoint-\n\n'Mr. Parks: Your Honor, I don't feel like you ought to impose on any member of the local bar if the defendants are represented by counsel.\n\n'The Court: That is what I was trying to ascertain, Mr. Parks.\n\n'Mr. Parks: Of course if they have counsel, I don't see the necessity of the Court appointing anybody; if they haven't counsel, of course I think it is up to the Court to appoint counsel to represent them. \n\n[287 U.S. 45, 55]\n\u00a0\n 'The Court: I think you are right about it Mr. Parks and that is the reason I was trying to get an expression from Mr. Roddy.\n\n'Mr. Roddy: I think Mr. Parks is entirely right about it, if I was paid down here and employed, it would be a different thing, but I have not prepared this case for trial and have only been called into it by people who are interested in these boys from Chattanooga. Now, they have not given me an opportunity to prepare the case and I am not familiar with the procedure in Alabama, but I merely came down here as a friend of the people who are interested and not as paid counsel, and certainly I haven't any money to pay them and nobody I am interested in had me to come down here has put up any fund of money to come down here and pay counsel. If they should do it I would be glad to turn it over-a counsel but I am merely here at the solicitation of people who have become interested in this case without any payment of fee and without any preparation for trial and I think the boys would be better off if I step entirely out of the case according to my way of looking at it and according to my lack of preparation for it and not being familiar with the procedure in Alabama ....'\n\n Mr. Roddy later observed:\n'If there is anything I can do to be of help to them, I will be glad to do it; I am interested to that extent.\n\n'The Court: Well gentlemen, if Mr. Roddy only appears as assistant that way, I think it is proper that I appoint members of this bar to represent them, I expect that is right. If Mr. Roddy will appear, I wouldn't of course, I would not appoint anybody. I don't see, Mr. Roddy, how I can make a qualified appointment or a limited appointment. Of course, I don't mean to cut off your assistance in any way-Well gentlemen, I think you understand it. \n\n[287 U.S. 45, 56]\n\u00a0\n 'Mr. Moody: I am willing to go ahead and help Mr. Roddy in anything I can do about it, under the circumstances.\n\n'The Court: All right, all the lawyers that will; of course I would not require a lawyer to appear if-\n\n'Mr. Moody: I am willing to go ahead and help Mr. Roddy in anything I can do about it, under the circumstances.\n\n'The Court: All right, all the lawyers that will, of course, I would not require a lawyer to appear if-\n\n'Mr. Moody: I am willing to do that for him as a member of the bar; I will go ahead and help do anything I can do.\n\n'The Court: All right.'\n\n And in this casual fashion the matter of counsel in a capital case was disposed of.\n It thus will be seen that until the very morning of the trial no lawyer had been named or definitely designated to represent the defendants. Prior to that time, the trial judge had 'appointed all the members of the bar' for the limited 'purpose of arraigning the defendants.' Whether they would represent the defendants thereafter, if no counsel appeared in their behalf, was a matter of speculation only, or, as the judge indicated, of mere anticipation on the part of the court. Such a designation, even if made for all purposes, would, in our opinion, have fallen far short of meeting, in any proper sense, a requirement for the appointment of counsel. How many lawyers were members of the bar does not appear; but, in the very nature of things, whether many or few, they would not, thus collectively named, have been given that clear appreciation of responsibility or impressed with that individual sense of duty which should and naturally would accompany the appointment of a selected member of the bar, specifically named and assigned.\n That this action of the trial judge in respect of appointment of counsel was little more than an expansive gesture, imposing no substantial or definite obligation upon any one, is borne out by the fact that prior to the calling of the case for trial on April 6, a leading member of the local bar accepted employment on the side of the prosecution \n\n[287 U.S. 45, 57]\n\u00a0\n and actively participated in the trial. It is true that he said that before doing so he had understood Mr. Roddy would be employed as counsel for the defendants. This the lawyer is question, of his own accord, frankly stated to the court; and no doubt he acted with the utmost good faith. Probably other members of the bar had a like understanding. In any event, the circumstance lends emphasis to the conclusion that during perhaps the most critical period of the proceedings against these defendants, that is to say, from the time of their arraignment until the beginning of their trial, when consultation, thorough-going investigation and preparation were vitally important, the defendants did not have the aid of counsel in any real sense, although they were as much entitled to such aid during that period as at the trial itself. People ex rel. Burgess v. Riseley, 66 How.Pr.(N.Y.) 67; Batchelor v. State, 189 Ind. 69, 76, 125 N.E. 773.\n Nor do we think the situation was helped by what occurred on the morning of the trial. At that time, as appears from the colloquy printed above, Mr. Roddy stated to the court that he did not appear as counsel, but that he would like to appear along with counsel that the court might appoint; that he had not been given an opportunity to prepare the case; that he was not familiar with the procedure in Alabama, but merely came down as a friend of the people who were interested; that he thought the boys would be better off if he should step entirely out of the case. Mr. Moody, a member of the local bar, expressed a willingness to help Mr. Roddy in anything he could do under the circumstances. To this the court responded: 'All right, all the lawyers that will; of course I would not require a lawyer to appear if-.' And Mr. Moody continued: 'I am willing to do that for him as a member of the bar; I will go ahead and help do anything I can do.' With this dubious understanding, the trials immediately proceeded. The defendants, young, igno- \n\n[287 U.S. 45, 58]\n\u00a0\n rant, illiterate, surrounded by hostile sentiment, haled back and forth under guard of soldiers, charged with an atrocious crime regarded with especial horror in the community where they were to be tried, were thus put in peril of their lives within a few moments after counsel for the first time charged with any degree of responsibility began to represent them.\n It is not enough to assume that counsel thus precipitated into the case thought there was no defense, and exercised their best judgment in proceeding to trial without preparation. Neither they nor the court could say what a prompt and thorough-going investigation might disclose as to the facts. No attempt was made to investigate. No opportunity to do so was given. Defendants were immediately hurried to trial. Chief Justice Anderson, after disclaiming any intention to criticize harshly counsel who attempted to represent defendants at the trials, said: '... The record indicates that the appearance was rather pro forma than zealous and active ....' Under the circumstances disclosed, we hold that defendants were not accorded the right of counsel in any substantial sense. To decide otherwise, would simply be to ignore actualities. This conclusion finds ample support in the reasoning of an overwhelming array of state decisions, among which we cite the following: Sheppard v. State, 165 Ga. 460, 464, 141 S.E. 196; Reliford v. State, 140 Ga. 777, 79 S.E. 1128; McArver v. State, 114 Ga. 514, 40 S.E. 779; Sanchez v. State, 199 Ind. 235, 246, 157 N.E. 1; Batchelor v. State, 189 Ind. 69, 76, 125 N.E. 773; Mitchell v. Commonwealth, 225 Ky. 83, 7 S.W.(2d) 823; Jackson v. Commonwealth, 215 Ky. 800, 287 S.W. 17; State v. Collins, 104 La. 629, 29 So. 180, 81 Am.St.Rep. 150; State v. Pool, 50 La.Ann. 449, 23 So. 503; People ex rel. Burgess v. Risley, 66 How.Pr.(N.Y.) 67; State ex rel. Tucker v. Davis, 9 Okl.Cr. 94, 130 P. 962, 44 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1083; Commonwealth v. O'Keefe, 298 Pa. 169, \n\n[287 U.S. 45, 59]\n\u00a0\n 148 A. 73; Shaffer v. Territory, 14 Ariz. 329, 333, 127 P. 746.\n It is true that great and inexcusable delay in the enforcement of our criminal law is one of the grave evils of our time. Continuances are frequently granted for unnecessarily long periods of time, and delays incident to the disposition of motions for new trial and hearings upon appeal have come in many cases to be a distinct reproach to the administration of justice. The prompt disposition of criminal cases is to be commended and encouraged. But in reaching that result a defendant, charged with a serious crime, must not be stripped of his right to have sufficient time to advise with counsel and prepare his defense. To do that is not to proceed promptly in the claim spirit of regulated justice but to go forward with the haste of the mob.\n As the court said in Commonwealth v. O'Keefe, 298 Pa. 169, 173, 148 A. 73, 74:\n'It is vain to give the accused a day in court, with no opportunity to prepare for it, or to guarantee him counsel without giving the latter any opportunity to acquaint himself with the facts or law of the case. ...\n\n'A prompt and vigorous administration of the criminal law is commendable and we have no desire to clog the wheels of justice. What we here decide is that to force a defendant, charged with a serious misdemeanor, to trial within five hours of his arrest, is not due process of law, regardless of the merits of the case.'\n\n Compare Reliford v. State, 140 Ga. 777, 778, 79 S.E. 1128\n\n\n Second. The Constitution of Alabama (Const. 1901,  6) provides that in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to have the assistance of counsel; and a state statute (Code 1923,  5567) requires the court in a capital case, where the defendant \n\n[287 U.S. 45, 60]\n\u00a0\n is unable to employ counsel, to appoint counsel for him. The state Supreme Court held that these provisions had not been infringed, and with that holding we are powerless to interfere. The question, however, which it is our duty, and within our power, to decide, is whether the denial of the assistance of counsel contravenes the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution.\n If recognition of the right of a defendant charged with a felony to have the aid of counsel depended upon the existence of a similar right at common law as it existed in England when our Constitution was adopted, there would be great difficulty in maintaining it as necessary to due process. Originally, in England, a person charged with treason or felony was denied the aid of counsel, except in respect of legal questions which the accused himself might suggest. At the same time parties in civil cases and persons accused of misdemeanors were entitled to the full assistance of counsel. After the revolution of 1688, the rule was abolished as to treason, but was otherwise steadily adhered to until 1836, when by act of Parliament the full right was granted in respect of felonies generally. 1 Cooley's Constitutional Limitations (8th Ed.) 698 et seq., and notes.\n An affirmation of the right to the aid of counsel in petty offenses, and its denial in the case of crimes of the gravest character, where such aid is most needed, is so outrageous and so obviously a perversion of all sense of proportion that the rule was constantly, vigorously and sometimes passionately assailed by English statesmen and lawyers. As early as 1758, Blackstone, although recognizing that the rule was settled at common law, denounced it as not in keeping with the rest of the humane treatment of prisoners by the English law. 'For upon what face of reason,' he says 'can that assistance be denied \n\n[287 U.S. 45, 61]\n\u00a0\n to save the life of a man, which yet is allowed him in prosecutions for every petty trespass?' 4 Blackstone, 355. One of the grounds upon which Lord Coke defended the rule was that in felonies the court itself was counsel for the prisoner. 1 Cooley's Constitutional Limitations, supra. But how can a judge, whose functions are purely judicial, effectively discharge the obligations of counsel for the accused? He can and should see to it that in the proceedings before the court the accused shall be dealt with justly and fairly. He cannot investigate the facts, advise and direct the defense, or participate in those necessary conferences between counsel and accused which sometimes partake of the inviolable character of the confessional.\n The rule was rejected by the colonies. Before the adoption of the Federal Constitution, the Constitution of Maryland had declared 'That, in all criminal prosecutions, every man hath a right ... to be allowed counsel. ...' Article 19, Constitution of 1776. The Constitution of Massachusetts, adopted in 1780 (part the first, art. 12), the Constitution of New Hampshire, adopted in 1784 (part 1, art. 15), the Constitution of New York of 1777 (article 34), and the Constitution of Pennsylvania of 1776 (Declaration of Rights, art. 9), had also declared to the same effect. And in the case of Pennsylvania, as early as 1701, the Penn Charter ( article 5) declared that 'all Criminals shall have the same Privileges of Witnesses and Council as their Prosecutors'; and there was also a provision in the Pennsylvania statute of May 31, 1718 (Dallas, Laws of Pennsylvania, 1700-1781, vol. 1, p. 134), that in capital cases learned counsel should be assigned to the prisoners.\n In Delaware, the Constitution of 1776 (article 25) adopted the common law of England, but expressly excepted such parts as were repugnant to the rights and privileges contained in the Declaration of Rights; and the Declaration of Rights, which was adopted on September \n\n[287 U.S. 45, 62]\n\u00a0\n 11, 1776, provided (article 14) 'That in all Prosecutions for criminal Offences, every Man hath a Right ... to be allowed Counsel ....' In addition, Penn's Charter, already referred to, was applicable in Delaware. The original Constitution of New Jersey of 1776 (article 16) contained a provision like that of the Penn Charter, to the effect that all criminals should be admitted to the same privileges of counsel as their prosecutors. The original Constitution of North Carolina (1776) did not contain the guaranty, but chapter 115,  85, Sess. Laws, N. Car., 1777 (N. Car. Rev. Laws, 1715-1796, vol. 1, 316) provided: '... That every person accused of any crime or misdemeanor whatsoever, shall be entitled to council in all matters which may be necessary for his defence, as well to facts as to law ....' Similarly, in South Carolina the original Constitution of 1776 did not contain the provision as to counsel, but it was provided as early as 1731 (Act of August 20, 1731,  XLIII, Grimke, S. Car. Pub. Laws, 1682- 1790, p. 130) that every person charged with treason, murder, felony, or other capital offense, should be admitted to make full defense by counsel learned in the law. In Virginia there was no constitutional provision on the subject, but as early as August, 1734 (chapter 7,  3, Laws of Va., 8th Geo. II, Hening's Stat. at Large, vol. 4, p. 404), there was an act declaring that in all trials for capital offenses the prisoner, upon his petition to the court, should be allowed counsel.\n The original Constitution of Connecticut (article 1,  9) contained a provision that 'in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall have a right to be heard by himself and by counsel'; but this Constitution was not adopted until 1818. However, it appears that the English common-law rule had been rejected in practice long prior to 1796. See Zephaniah Swift's 'A System of the Laws of the State of Connecticut,' printed at Windham by John \n\n[287 U.S. 45, 63]\n\u00a0\n Byrne, 1795-1796, vol. II, Bk. 5, 'Of Crimes and Punishments,' c. XXIV, 'Of Trials,' pp. 398-399.1\n The original Constitution of Georgia (1777) did not contain a guarantee in respect of counsel, but the Constitution of 1798 (article 3,  8) provided that '... no person shall be debarred from advocating or defending his cause before any court or tribunal, either by himself or counsel, or both.' What the practice was prior to 1798 we are unable to discover. The first Constitution adopted by Rhode Island was in 1842, and this Constitution contained the usual guaranty in respect of the assistance of counsel in criminal prosecutions. As early as 1798 it was provided by statute, in the very language of the Sixth Amendment to the federal Constitution, that 'in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to have the assistance of counsel for his defence \n\n[287 U.S. 45, 64]\n\u00a0\n ....' An Act Declaratory of certain Rights of the People of this State, section 6, Rev. Pub. Laws, Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, 1798. Furthermore, while the statute itself is not available, it is recorded as a matter of history that in 1668 or 1669 the colonial assembly enacted that any person who was indicted might employ an attorney to plead in his behalf. 1 Arnold, History of Rhode Island, 336.\n It thus appears that in at least twelve of the thirteen colonies the rule of the English common law, in the respect now under consideration, had been definitely rejected and the right to counsel fully recognized in all \n\n[287 U.S. 45, 65]\n\u00a0\n criminal prosecutions, save that in one or two instances the right was limited to capital offenses or to the more serious crimes; and this court seems to have been of the opinion that this was true in all the colonies. In Holden v. Hardy, \n169 \nU.S. 366, 386\n, 18 S.Ct. 383, 386, Mr. Justice Brown, writing for the court, said:\n'The earlier practice of the common law, which denied the benefit of witnesses to a person accused of felony, had been abolished by statute, though, so far as it deprived him of the assistance of counsel and compulsory process for the attendance of his witnesses, it had not been changed in England. But to the credit of her American colonies, let it be said that so oppressive a doctrine had never obtained a foothold there.'\n\n One test which has been applied to determine whether due process of law has been accorded in given instances is to ascertain what were the settled usages and modes of proceeding under the common and statute law of England before the Declaration of Independence, subject, however, to the qualification that they be shown not to have been unsuited to the civil and political conditions of our ancestors by having been followed in this country after it became a nation. Lowe v. Kansas, \n163 \nU.S. 81, 85\n, 16 S.Ct. 1031. Compare Den ex. dem. Murray v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co., 18 How. 272, 276, 277; Twining v. New Jersey, \n211 \nU.S. 78, 100\n, 101 S., 29 S.Ct. 14. Plainly, as appears from the foregoing, this test, as thus qualified, has not been met in the present case.\n We do not overlook the case of Hurtado v. California, \n110 \nU.S. 516\n, 4 S.Ct. 111, 292, where this court determined that due process of law does not require an indictment by a grand jury as a prerequisite to prosecution by a state for murder. In support of that conclusion the court ( pages 534, 535 of 110 U.S., 4 S.Ct. 111) referred to the fact that the Fifth Amendment, in addition to containing the due process of law clause, pro- \n\n[287 U.S. 45, 66]\n\u00a0\n vides in explicit terms that 'no person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, ...' and said that since no part of this important amendment could be regarded as superfluous, the obvious inference is that in the sense of the Constitution due process of law was not intended to include, ex vi termini, the institution and procedure of a grand jury in any case; and that the same phrase, employed in the Fourteenth Amendment to restrain the action of the states, was to be interpreted as having been used in the same sense and with no greater extent; and that if it had been the purpose of that Amendment to perpetuate the institution of the grand jury in the states, it would have embodied, as did the Fifth Amendment, an express declaration to that effect.\n The Sixth Amendment, in terms, provides that in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right 'to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.' In the face of the reasoning of the Hurtado Case, if it stood alone, it would be difficult to justify the conclusion that the right to counsel, being thus specifically granted by the Sixth Amendment, was also within the intendement of the due process of law clause. But the Hurtado Case does not stand alone. In the later case of Chicago, Burlington & Q.R. Co. v. Chicago, \n166 \nU.S. 226, 241\n, 17 S.Ct. 581, this court held that a judgment of a state court, even though authorized by statute, by which private property was taken for public use without just compensation, was in violation of the due process of law required by the Fourteenth Amendment, notwithstanding that the Fifth Amendment explicitly declares that private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation. This holding was followed in Norwood v. Baker, \n172 \nU.S. 269, 277\n, 19 S.Ct. 187; Smyth v. Ames, \n169 \nU.S. 466, 524\n, 18 S.Ct. 418, and San Diego Land & Town Company v. National City, \n174 \nU.S. 739, 754\n, 19 S.Ct. 804. \n\n[287 U.S. 45, 67]\n\u00a0\n Likewise, this court has considered that freedom of speech and of the press are rights protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, although in the First Amendment, Congress is prohibited in specific terms from abridging the right. Gitlow v. People of State of New York, \n268 \nU.S. 652, 666\n, 45 S.Ct. 625; Stromberg v. California, \n283 \nU.S. 359, 368\n, 51 S.Ct. 532, 73 A.L.R. 1484; Near v. Minnesota, \n283 \nU.S. 697, 707\n, 51 S.Ct. 625.\n These later cases establish that notwithstanding the sweeping character of the language in the Hurtado Case, the rule laid down is not without exceptions. The rule is an aid to construction, and in some instances may be conclusive; but it must yield to more compelling considerations whenever such considerations exist. The fact that the right involved is of such a character that it cannot be denied without violating those 'fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all our civil and political institutions' (Hebert v. State of Louisiana, \n272 \nU.S. 312, 316\n, 47 S.Ct. 103, 104, 48 A.L.R. 1102), is obviously one of those compelling considerations which must prevail in determining whether it is embraced within the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, although it be specifically dealt with in another part of the Federal Constitution. Evidently this court, in the later cases enumerated, regarded the rights there under consideration as of this fundamental character. That some such distinction must be observed is foreshadowed in Twining v. New Jersey, \n211 \nU.S. 78, 99\n, 29 S.Ct. 14, 19, where Mr. Justice Moody, speaking for the court, said that: ' ... It is possible that some of the personal rights safeguarded by the first eight Amendments against national action may also be safeguarded against state action, because a denial of them would be a denial of due process of law. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad v. Chicago, \n166 \nU.S. 226\n, 17 S.Ct. 581. If this is so, it is not because those rights are enumerated in the first eight Amendments, but because they are of such a nature that they are included in \n\n[287 U.S. 45, 68]\n\u00a0\n the conception of due process of law.' While the question has never been categorically determined by this court, a consideration of the nature of the right and a review of the expressions of this and other courts makes it clear that the right to the aid of counsel is of this fundamental character.\n It never has been doubted by this court, or any other so far as we know, that notice and hearing are preliminary steps essential to the passing of an enforceable judgment, and that they, together with a legally competent tribunal having jurisdiction of the case, constitute basic elements of the constitutional requirement of due process of law. The words of Webster, so often quoted, that by 'the law of the land' is intended 'a law which hears before it condemns,' have been repeated in varying forms of expression in a multitude of decisions. In Holden v. Hardy, \n169 \nU.S. 366, 389\n, 18 S.Ct. 383, 387, the necessity of due notice and an opportunity of being heard is described as among the 'immutable principles of justice which inhere in the very idea of free government which no member of the Union may disregard.' And Mr. Justice Field, in an earlier case, Galpin v. Page, 18 Wall. 350, 368, 369, said that the rule that no one shall be personally bound until he has had his day in court was as old as the law, and it meant that he must be cited to appear and afforded an opportunity to be heard. 'Judgment without such citation and opportunity wants all the attributes of a judicial determination; it is judicial usurpation and oppression, and never can be upheld where justice is justly administered.' Citations to the same effect might be indefinitely multiplied, but there is no occasion for doing so.\n What, then, does a hearing include? Historically and in practice, in our own country at least, it has always included the right to the aid of counsel when desired and provided by the party asserting the right. The right \n\n[287 U.S. 45, 69]\n\u00a0\n to be heard would be, in many cases, of little avail if it did not comprehend the right to be heard by counsel. Even the intelligent and educated layman has small and sometimes no skill in the science of law. If charged with crime, he is incapable, generally, of determining for himself whether the indictment is good or bad. He is unfamiliar with the rules of evidence. Left without the aid of counsel he may be put on trial without a proper charge, and convicted upon incompetent evidence, or evidence irrelevant to the issue or otherwise inadmissible. He lacks both the skill and knowledge adequately to prepare his defense, even though he have a perfect one. He requires the guiding hand of counsel at every step in the proceedings against him. Without it, though he be not guilty, he faces the danger of conviction because he does not know how to establish his innocence. If that be true of men of intelligence, how much more true is it of the ignorant and illiterate, or those of feeble intellect. If in any case, civil of criminal, a state or federal court were arbitrarily to refuse to hear a party by counsel, employed by and appearing for him, it reasonably may not be doubted that such a refusal would be a denial of a hearing, and, therefore, of due process in the constitutional sense.\n The decisions all point to that conclusion. In Cooke v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 517, 537\n, 45 S.Ct. 390, 395, it was held that where a contempt was not in open court, due process of law required charges and a reasonable opportunity to defend or explain. The court added, 'We think this includes the assistance of counsel, if requested. ...' In numerous other cases the court, in determining that due process was accorded, has frequently stressed the fact that the defendant had the aid of counsel. See, for example, Felts v. Murphy, \n201 \nU.S. 123, 129\n, 26 S.Ct. 366; Frank v. Mangum, \n237 \nU.S. 309, 344\n, 35 S.Ct. 582; Kelley v. State of Oregon, \n273 \nU.S. 589, 591\n, 47 S.Ct. 504. In Ex parte Hidekuni Iwata (D.C.) 219 F. 610, 611, the federal dis- \n\n[287 U.S. 45, 70]\n\u00a0\n trict judge enumerated among the elements necessary to due process of law in a deportation case the opportunity at some stage of the hearing to secure and have the advice and assistance of counsel. In Ex parte Chin Loy You (D.C.) 223 F. 833, 838, also a deportation case, the district judge held that under the particular circumstances of the case the prisoner, having seasonably made demand, was entitled to confer with and have the aid of counsel. Pointing to the fact that the right to counsel as secured by the Sixth Amendment relates only to criminal prosecutions, judge said, ' ... but it is equally true that that provision was inserted in the Constitution because the assistance of counsel was recognized as essential to any fair trial of a case against a prisoner.' In Ex parte Riggins (C.C. A.) 134 F. 404, 418, a case involving the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the court said, by way of illustration, that if the state should deprive a person of the benefit of counsel, it would not be due process of law. Judge Cooley refers to the right of a person accused of crime to have counsel as perhaps his most important privilege, and after discussing the development of the English law upon that subject, says: 'With us it is a universal principle of constitutional law, that the prisoner shall be allowed a defense by counsel.' 1 Cooley's Constitutional Limitations (8th Ed.) 700. The same author, as appears from a chapter which he added to his edition of Story on the Constitution, regarded the right of the accused to the presence, advice and assistance of counsel as necessarily included in due process of law. 2 Story on the Constitution ( 4th Ed.)  1949, p. 668. The state decisions which refer to the matter, invariably recognize the right to the aid of counsel as fundamental in character. E.g., People v. Napthaly, 105 Cal. 641, 644, 39 P. 29; Cutts v. State, 54 Fla. 21, 23, 45 So. 491; Martin v. State, 51 Ga. 567, 568; Sheppard v. State, 165 Ga. 460, 464, 141 S.E. 196; State v. Moore, 61 Kan. 732, 734, 60 P. 748; \n\n[287 U.S. 45, 71]\n\u00a0\n State v. Ferris, 16 La.Ann. 414; State v. Simpson, 38 La.Ann. 23, 24; State v. Briggs, 58 W.Va. 291, 292, 52 S.E. 218.\n In the light of the facts outlined in the forepart of this opinion- the ignorance and illiteracy of the defendants, their youth, the circumstances of public hostility, the imprisonment and the close surveillance of the defendants by the military forces, the fact that their friends and families were all in other states and communication with them necessarily difficult, and above all that they stood in deadly peril of their lives-we think the failure of the trial court to give them reasonable time and opportunity to secure counsel was a clear denial of due process.\n But passing that, and assuming their inability, even if opportunity had been given, to employ counsel, as the trial court evidently did assume, we are of opinion that, under the circumstances just stated, the necessity of counsel was so vital and imperative that the failure of the trial court to make an effective appointment of counsel was likewise a denial of due process within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. Whether this would be so in other criminal prosecutions, or under other circumstances, we need not determine. All that it is necessary now to decide, as we do decide, is that in a capital case, where the defendant is unable to employ counsel, and is incapable adequately of making his own defense because of ignorance, feeble-mindedness, illiteracy, or the like, it is the duty of the court, whether requested or not, to assign counsel for him as a necessary requisite of due process of law; and that duty is not discharged by an assignment at such a time or under such circumstances as to preclude the giving of effective aid in the preparation and trial of the case. To hold otherwise would be to ignore the fundamental postulate, already adverted to, 'that there are certain immutable principles of justice which inhere in the very idea of free government which \n\n[287 U.S. 45, 72]\n\u00a0\n no member of the Union may disregard.' Holden v. Hardy, supra. In a case such as this, whatever may be the rule in other cases, the right to have counsel appointed, when necessary, is a logical corollary from the constitutional right to be heard by counsel. Compare Carpenter & Sprague v. Dane County, 9 Wis. 274; Dane County v. Smith, 13 Wis. 585, 586, 80 Am.Dec. 754; Hendryx v. State, 130 Ind. 265, 268, 269, 29 N.E. 1131; Cutts v. State, 54 Fla. 21, 23, 45 So. 491; People v. Goldenson, 76 Cal. 328, 344, 19 P. 161; Delk v. State, 99 Ga. 667, 669, 670, 26 S.E. 752.\n In Hendryx v. State, supra, there was no statute authorizing the assignment of an attorney to defend an indigent person accused of crime, but the court held that such an assignment was necessary to accomplish the ends of public justice, and that the court possessed the inherent power to make it. 'Where a prisoner,' the court said (page 269 of 130 Ind., 29 N.E. 1131, 1132), 'without legal knowledge is confined in jail, absent from his friends, without the aid of legal advice or the means of investigating the charge against him, it is impossible to conceive of a fair trial where he is compelled to conduct his cause in court, without the aid of counsel . ... Such a trial is not far removed from an exparte proceeding.'\n Let us suppose the extreme case of a prisoner charged with a capital offense, who is deaf and dumb, illiterate, and feeble-minded, unable to employ counsel, with the whole power of the state arrayed against him, prosecuted by counsel for the state without assignment of counsel for his defense, tried, convicted, and sentenced to death. Such a result, which, if carried into execution, would be little short of judicial murder, it cannot be doubted would be a gross violation of the guarantee of due process of law; and we venture to think that no appellate court, state or federal, would hesitate so to decide. See Stephenson v. State, 4 Ohio App. 128; Williams v. State, 163 Ark. 623, \n\n[287 U.S. 45, 73]\n\u00a0\n 628, 260 S.W. 721; Grogan v. Commonwealth, 222 Ky. 484, 485, 1 S.W.(2d) 779; Mullen v. State, 28 Okl.Cr. 218, 230, 230 P. 285; Williams v. Commonwealth (Ky.) 110 S.W. 339, 340. The duty of the trial court to appoint counsel under such circumstances is clear, as it is clear under circumstances such as are disclosed by the record here; and its power to do so, even in the absence of a statute, can not be questioned. Attorneys are officers of the court, and are bound to render service when required by such an appointment. See Cooley, Constitutional Limitations, supra, 700 and note.\n The United States by statute and every state in the Union by express provision of law, or by the determination of its courts, make it the duty of the trial judge, where the accused is unable to employ counsel, to appoint counsel for him. In most states the rule applies broadly to all criminal prosecutions, in others it is limited to the more serious crimes, and in a very limited number, to capital cases. A rule adopted with such unanimous accord reflects, if it does not establish the inherent right to have counsel appointed at least in cases like the present, and lends convincing support to the conclusion we have reached as to the fundamental nature of that right.\n The judgments must be reversed and the causes remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Judgments reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice BULTER, dissenting.\n The Court putting aside-they are utterly without merit-all other claims that the constitutional rights of petitioners were infringed, grounds its opinion and judgment upon a single assertion of fact. It is that petitioners 'were denied the right of counsel, with the accustomed incidents of consultation and opportunity of preparation for trial.' If that is true, they were denied due process \n\n[287 U.S. 45, 74]\n\u00a0\n of law and are entitled to have the judgments against them reversed.\n But no such denial is shown by the record.\n Nine defendants including Patterson were accused in one indictment, and he was also separately indicted. Instead of trying them en masse, the State gave four trials and so lessened the danger of mistake and injustice that inevitably attends an attempt in a single trial to ascertain the guilt or innocence of many accused. Weems and Norris were tried first. Patterson was tried next on the separate indictment. Then five were tried. These eight were found guilty. The other defendant, Roy Wright, was tried last and not convicted. The convicted defendants took the three cases to the state Supreme Court, where the judgment as to Williams was reversed and those against the seven petitioners were affirmed.\n There were three painstaking opinions, a different justice writing for the court in each case. Weems v. State, 224 Ala. 524, 141 So. 215; Patterson v. State, 224 Ala. 532, 141 So. 195; Powell v. State, 224 Ala. 540, 141 So. 201. Many of the numerous questions decided were raised at the trial and reflect upon defendant's counsel much credit for zeal and diligence on behalf of their clients. Seven justices heard the cases. The chief justice, alone dissenting, did not find any contention for the accused sufficient in itself to warrant a reversal but alluded to a number of considerations which he deemed sufficient when taken together to warrant the conclusion that the defendants did not have a fair trial. The court said (page 553 of 224 Ala., 141 So. 201, 213): 'We think it a bit inaccurate to say Mr. Roddy appeared only as amicus curiae. (This refers to a remark in the dissenting opinion.) He expressly announced he was there from the beginning at the instance of friends of the accused; but not being paid counsel asked to appear not as employed counsel, but to aid local counsel appointed by the court, and was permitted so to appear. The defendants were represented as shown by the record and pursuant to appointment of the \n\n[287 U.S. 45, 75]\n\u00a0\n court by Hon. Milo Moody, an able member of the local of long and successful experience in the trial of criminal as well as civil cases. We do not regard the representation of the accused by counsel as pro forma. A very rigorous and rigid cross-examination was made of the state's witnesses, the alleged victims of rape, especially in the cases first tried. A reading of the records discloses why experienced counsel would not travel over all the same ground in each case.'\n The informality disclosed by the colloquy between court and counsel, which is quoted in the opinion of this Court and so heavily leaned on, is not entitled to any weight. It must be inferred from the record that Mr. Roddy at all times was in touch with the defendants and the people who procured him to act for them. Mr. Moody and others of the local bar also acted for defendants at the time of the first arraignment and, as appears from the part of the record that is quoted in the opinion, thereafter proceeded in the discharge of their duty including conferences with the defendants. There is not the slightest ground to suppose that Roddy or Moody were by fear or in any manner restrained from full performance of their duties. Indeed, it clearly appears that the State, by proper and adequate show of its purpose and power to preserve order, furnished adequate protection to them and the defendants.\n When the first case was called for trial defendants' attorneys had already prepared and then submitted a motion for change of venue together with supporting papers. They were ready to and did at once introduce testimony of witnesses to sustain that demand. They had procured and were ready to offer evidence to show that the defendants Roy Wright and Eugene Williams were under age. The record shows that the State's evidence was ample to warrant a conviction. And three defendants each, while asserting his own innocence, testified that he \n\n[287 U.S. 45, 76]\n\u00a0\n saw others accused commit the crime charged. When regard is had to these and other disclosures that may have been and probably were made by petitioners to Roddy and Moody before the trial it would be difficult to think of anything that counsel erroneously did or omitted for their defense.\n If there had been any lack of opportunity for preparation, trial counsel would have applied to the court for postponement. No such application was made. There was no suggestion, at the trial or in the motion for a new trial which they made, that Mr. Roddy or Mr. Moody was denied such opportunity or that they were not in fact fully prepared. The amended motion for new trial, by counsel who succeeded them, contains the first suggestion that defendants were denied counsel or opportunity to prepare for trial. But neither Mr. Roddy nor Mr. Moody has given any support to that claim. Their silence requires a finding that the claim is groundless for if it had any merit they would be bound to support it. And no one has come to suggest any lack of zeal or good faith on their part.\n If correct, the ruling that the failure of the trial court to give petitioners time and opportunity to secure counsel was denied of due process is enough, and with this the opinion should end. But the Court goes on to declare that 'the failure of the trial court to make an effective appointment of counsel was likewise a denial of due process within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.' This is an extension of federal authority into a field hitherto occupied exclusively by the several States. Nothing before the Court calls for a consideration of the point. It was not suggested below and petitioners do not ask for its decision here. The Court, without being called upon to consider it, adjudges without a hearing an important constitutional question concerning criminal procedure in state courts. \n\n[287 U.S. 45, 77]\n\u00a0\n It is a wise rule firmly established by a long course of decisions here that constitutional questions-even when properly raised and argued- are to be decided only when necessary for a determination of the rights of the parties in controversy before it. Thus, in the Charles River Bridge Case, 11 Pet. 420, page 553, the Court said: 'Many other questions, of the deepest importance, have been raised and elaborately discussed in the argument. It is not necessary, for the decision of this case, to express our opinion upon them; and the Court deem it proper to avoid volunteering an opinion on any question involving the construction of the constitution where the case itself does not bring the question directly before them, and make it their duty to decide upon it.' And see Davidson v. New Orleans, \n96 U.S. 97\n, 103 et seq.; Hauenstein v. Lynham, \n100 U.S. 483\n, 490; Blair v. United States, \n250 \nU.S. 273, 279\n, 39 S.Ct. 468; Adkins v. Children's Hospital, \n261 \nU.S. 525, 544\n, 43 S.Ct. 394, 24 A.L.R. 1238.\n The record wholly fails to reveal that petitioners have been deprived of any right guaranteed by the Federal Constitution, and I am of opinion that the judgment should be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS concurs in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This ancient work, consisting of six books, has long been out of print. A copy of it is preserved in the locked files of the Library of Congress. The following extract from the pages cited is both interesting and instructive:\n'The attorney for the state then proceeds to lay before the jury, all the evidence against the prisoner, without any remarks or arguments. The prisoner by himself or counsel, is then allowed to produce witnesses to counteract and obviate the testimony against him; and to exculpate himself with the same freedom as in civil cases. We have never admitted that cruel and illiberal principle of the common law of England that when a man is on trial for his life, he shall be refused counsel, and denied those means of defense, which are allowed, when the most trifling pittance of property is in question. The flimsy pretence, that the court are to be counsel for the prisoner will only highten our indignation at the practice: for it is apparent to the least consideration, that a court can never furnish a person accused of a crime with the advice, and assistance necessary to make his defense. This doctrine might with propriety have been advanced, at the time when by the common law of England, no witnesses could be adduced on the part of the prisoner, to manifest his innocence, for he could then make no preparation for his defense. One cannot read without horror and astonishment, the abominable maxims of law, which deprived persons accused, and on trial for crimes, of the assistance of counsel, except as to points of law, and the advantage of witnesses to exculpate themselves from the charge. It seems by the ancient practice, that whenever a person was accused of a crime, every expedient was adopted to convict him and every privilege denied him, to prove his innocence. In England, however, as the law now stands, prisoners are allowed the full advantage of witnesses, but excepting in a few cases, the common law is enforced, in denying them counsel, except as to points of law.\n\n'Our ancestors, when they first enacted their laws respecting crimes, influenced by the illiberal principles which they had imbibed in their native country, denied counsel to prisoners to plead for them to anything but points of law. It is manifest that there is as much necessity for counsel to investigate matters of fact, as points of law, if truth is to be discovered. \n\n'The legislature has become so thoroughly convinced of the impropriety and injustice of shackling and restricting a prisoner with respect to his defence, that they have abolished all those odious laws, and every person when he is accused of a crime, is entitled to every possible privilege in making his defence, and manifesting his innocence, by the instrumentality of counsel, and the testimony of witnesses.'\n\n The early statutes of Connecticut, upon examination, do not seem to be as clear as this last paragraph would indicate; but Mr. Swift, writing in 1796, was in a better position to know how the statutes had been interpreted and applied in actual practice than the reader of to-day; and we see no reason to reject his statement. \n\n\n\n\n","120":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nREALTY ACCEPTANCE CORPORATION v. MONTGOMERY(1932)\nNo. 314\nArgued: January 12, 1932Decided: February 15, 1932\n\n\n\n Messrs. R. Randolph Hicks, of New York City, and Charles F. Curley, of Wilmington, Del., for petitioner. \n\n[284 U.S. 547, 548]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Thomas J. Crawford, of New York City, and Robert H. Richards, of Wilmington, Del., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner complains of two orders entered by the Circuit Court of Appeals, one which reversed an order of the District Court setting aside a judgment entered at an earlier term and granting a motion for new trial for the purpose of considering certain newly discovered evidence as to damages, and the other, which vacated its own order previously entered dismissing an appeal from the same judgment and remanding the cause so that the District Court might, in the exercise of its discretion, grant such new trial.\n At the March term, 1929, respondent recovered judgment against petitioner for the breach of a contract of employment. An appeal was perfected to the Circuit Court of Appeals, was heard in that court subsequent to the expiration of the term of the District Court, and resulted in an affirmance 51 F.(2d) 636. Petitioner filed a motion for rehearing, and before disposition thereof presented a petition setting forth that at trial the respondent had failed to disclose certain earnings of which he had been in receipt which should have been taken into account in mitigation of damages; that these facts had been discovered after appeal from the judgment; that the mandate of the \n\n[284 U.S. 547, 549]\n\u00a0\n Court of Appeals should be stayed to afford the District Court opportunity, if it thought proper, to request the return of the record so that the judgment could be opened and, if justice should so require, a new trial be granted on the issue of the quantum of damages. This petition was granted, respondent applied to the District Court, and that court requested the Court of Appeals to return the record for the purpose mentioned. Thereupon the latter court made an order vacating its affirmance of the judgment and dismissing the appeal, thus returning the record to the District Court, which then entertained a motion for a new trial, found the evidence newly discovered within the applicable rule of law, set aside the judgment, and granted a new trial. Respondent then appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals, assigning this action as error. The latter court held that except for its own orders the District Court would have been without authority to set aside the judgment after the term had expired; that no additional power had been conferred upon the trial court by the previously recited orders in the appellate proceedings; and that there had been error in dismissing the first appeal. Accordingly it reversed the District Court's order granting a new trial, revoked its own order dismissing the first appeal, overruled the petition for a rehearing therein, and reinstated the order affirming the original judgment of the District Court.\n The petitioner concedes the District Court lacked power to set aside its judgment after the expiration of the term for the purpose of hearing newly discovered evidence (United States v. Mayer, \n235 \nU.S. 55, 67\n, 35 S. Ct. 16; Delaware, L. & W. R. R. v. Rellstab, \n276 \nU.S. 1\n, 48 S. Ct. 203); it admits the Circuit Court of Appeals has no original jurisdiction, and possesses only such appellate jurisdiction as is conferred by statute. United States v. Jahn, \n155 \nU.S. 109, 112\n, 15 S. Ct. 39; Whitney v. Dick, \n202 \nU.S. 132\n, 26 S. Ct. 584; United States v. Mayer, supra. \n\n[284 U.S. 547, 550]\n\u00a0\n But the claim is that section 701 of the Revised Statutes (28 USCA  876), which defines our appellate jurisdiction, and is made applicable to the Circuit Courts of Appeal by the Act of March 3, 1891, c. 517,  11, 26 Stat. 829, 28 USCA  228 and note, and  230 note (see Ballew v. United States, \n160 \nU.S. 187\n, 16 S. Ct. 263), authorizes those courts, in the proceeding in error, to set aside a judgment and receive additional evidence, if justice so requires, and that such power may also be exercised by remanding the cause to the trial court for similar proceedings. The section is copied in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Stress is placed upon the point that in addition to mere power to affirm, reverse, or modify, jurisdiction is given in the alternative to order such judgment to be rendered or such further proceedings to be had by the inferior court as the justice of the case may require. From this the conclusion is that though no error appears in the record justifying a modification or reversal the appellate court may, if justice so demands, take further proof which the trial court would be powerless to receive because its term has ended, and on the basis of such proof reverse or modify the judgment. In addition the contention is that, though there be no error upon the face of the record, the section authorizes its return to the lower court for the opening of the judgment and reception of newly discovered evidence.\n The section has been construed as applying to cases where a judgment or decree is affirmed upon appeal and further proceedings in the court below are appropriate in \n\n[284 U.S. 547, 551]\n\u00a0\n aid of the relief granted. And the statute warrants the giving of directions by an appellate court for further proceedings below in conformity with a modification or a reversal of a judgment where, in consequence of such action, such proceedings should be had.

United States, supra, on which petitioner relies, went no farther than this, for there a judgment was reversed in part. Northing was there said to indicate that this court would order further proceedings below to attack or set aside a judgment entered on a record which disclosed no error calling for a modification or reversal. No authority is cited in which R. S.  701 has been construed as extending this court's powers in the manner for which petitioner contends. Roemer v. Simon, \n91 U.S. 149\n, is to the contrary. The holding was that upon an appeal in equity this court could not upon motion set aside the decree of the court below and grant a rehearing, and could not receive new evidence; and, further, that as the court below was without power to grant a rehearing after the term at which the decree was entered the remanding of the cause for such purpose would be useless. The opinion adds that if the term had not expired the appellate court might in a proper case, upon request of the court below, return the record, for the opening of the decree and for rehearing.\n In the present case there is a further conclusive reason why the remission of the cause to the District Court was ineffective to give authority to hear the motion to set aside the judgment. Upon the original appeal the Circuit Court of Appeals found no error in the record, and \n\n[284 U.S. 547, 552]\n\u00a0\n affirmed the judgment, but subsequently rescinded the order of affirmance and dismissed the appeal. This action was final, ended the case in that court, and deprived it of all power to add to or alter the record as certified. Since there was no case pending, power was wanting to make any order granting leave to the court below for any purpose. The attempt by remanding the record with leave to the court below to take action which would otherwise have been beyond its powers left the matter precisely as if no such order had been made.\n It follows that the Circuit Court correctly held that what was done subsequent to the affirmance of the judgment in the first appeal was improvident and unauthorized and should be rescinded, and the order which accomplished this end and reinstated the original judgment is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Supreme Court may affirm, modify, or reverse any judgment, decree, or order of a circuit court, or district court acting as a circuit court, or of a distict court in prize causes, lawfully brought before it for review, or may direct such judgment, decree, or order to be rendered, or such further proceedings to be had by the inferior court, as the justice of the case may require.

ALLEN(1932)\nNo. 600\nArgued: Decided: May 16, 1932\n\n\n\n\n[286 U.S. 191, 192]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. J. Wilmer Latimer, Walter C. Clephane, and Gilbert L. Hall, all of Washington, D. C., for petitioners.\n\n\n\n[286 U.S. 191, 194]\n\u00a0\n Mr. George C. Gertman, of Washington, D. C., for respondent.\n\n\n[286 U.S. 191, 196]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In 1922, Thomas Walker filed a bill of interpleader in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, naming as defendants these petitioners ( or their predecessors) and this respondent, for the purpose of having determined, as between them, the ownership of money then in the hands of Walker, which he had collected as rentals from certain real property. The rights of the rival claimants to the funds depended upon the construction of the will of Silas Holmes. The court construed the will in favor of petitioners and against respondent, and thereupon entered a decree awarding the money to the former.\n Thereafter, and pending an appeal from that decree to the District Court of Appeals taken without a supersedeas, petitioners brought an action in ejectment against respondent to recover the real estate from which the rents had been derived. The title which they asserted in that action rested upon the same provisions of the Holmes will as were involved in the interpleader suit; and petitioners pleaded and relied upon the decree in that suit as having conclusively established the construction of these provisions in their favor. See Lessee of Parrish v. Ferris, 2 Black, 606, 608. Judgment was rendered for petitioners, and possession of the real property delivered to them under a writ issued to carry the judgment into effect. From this judgment respondent did not appeal. Thereafter, the District Court of Appeals reversed the decree of the District Supreme Court in the interpleader suit and remanded the cause for further proceedings not inconsistent with its opinion. 57 App. D. C. 78, 17 F.(2d) 666. Following the mandate issued thereon, the trial court vacated its decree and directed payment of the rental money to the respondent. \n\n[286 U.S. 191, 197]\n\u00a0\n Some months later a second ejectment action was brought, this time by respondent against petitioners for the repossession of the same real property. By way of estoppel petitioners pleaded the final judgment in the first ejectment action, upon which the trial court gave judgment in their favor. Upon appeal to the District Court of Appeals the latter judgment was reversed. 54 F.(2d) 713.\n The appellate court thought that the first ejectment action was merely in aid of the decree in the equity suit, and that when that decree was reversed the judgment in the first ejectment action fell with it. With that view we cannot agree. The interpleader suit and the decree made therein involved only the disposition of the funds collected and held by Walker. The decree adjudged, and could adjudge, nothing in respect of the real estate. It is perfectly plain, therefore, that petitioners could not have been put into possession of the real property by force of that decree; and it is equally plain that respondent could not have been put into such possession in virtue of the reversal. So far as that property is concerned, the rule in respect of restitution upon reversal of a judgment is irrelevant. The first action in ejectment was not brought to effectuate anything adjudicated by the decree, or, in any sense, in aid thereof. It was brought to obtain an adjudication of a claim in respect of a different subject matter. The facts and the law upon which the right to the money and the title to the realty depended may have been the same; but they were asserted in different causes of action. The decree in the interpleader suit no more vested title to, or compelled delivery of possession of, the realty than the judgment in the ejectment action required payment to one party or the other of the money surrendered by the stakeholder. Compare United States v. Moser, \n266 \nU.S. 236, 241\n, 45 S. Ct. 66. \n\n[286 U.S. 191, 198]\n\u00a0\n The judgment in the ejectment action was final and not open to assault collaterally, but subject to impeachment only through some form of direct attack. The appellate court was limited to a review of the interpleader decree; and it is hardly necessary to say that jurisdiction to review one judgment gives an appellate court no power to reverse or modify another and independent judgment. If respondent, in addition to appealing from the decree, had appealed from the judgment, the appellate court, having both cases before it, might have afforded a remedy. Butler v. Eaton, \n141 \nU.S. 240\n, 11 S. Ct. 985. But this course respondent neglected to follow. What the appellate court would or could have done if an appeal from the judgment had been taken and had been heard in advance of the appeal from the decree is idle speculation, since the probability that such a contingency would have arisen is so remote as to put it beyond the range of reasonable supposition. In the first place, the appeal from the decree had been taken and was pending when the judgment in the law action was rendered. It well may be assumed that the natural and usual course of hearing cases in the order of their filing would have been followed. But, in addition to that, both appeals necessarily would have been pending before the appeal from the judgment possibly could have been heard, and it rationally may not be doubted that, upon application and a showing of their relationship, the court would have heard them together, or at least not have disposed of the appeal from the judgment without considering its connection with the other appeal from the decree.\n The predicament in which respondent finds himself is of his own making, the result of an utter failure to follow the course which the decision of this court in Butler v. Eaton, supra, had plainly pointed out. Having so failed, we cannot be expected, for his sole relief, to upset the general and well-established doctrine of res judicata, conceived in the light of the maxim that the interest of the \n\n[286 U.S. 191, 199]\n\u00a0\n state requires that there be an end to litigation-a maxim which comports with common sense as well as public policy. And the mischief which would follow the establishment of a precedent for so disregarding this salutary doctrine against prolonging strife would be greater than the benefit which would result from relieving some case of individual hardship. United States v. Throckmorton, \n98 \nU.S. 61, 65\n, 68 S., 69.\n The rule has been settled for this court that, where a judgment in one case has successfully been made the basis for a judgment in a second case, the second judgment will stand as res judicata, although the first judgment be subsequently reversed. Deposit Bank v. Frankfort, \n191 \nU.S. 499\n, 24 S. Ct. 154. There a federal court had upheld a contract of exemption from taxation, basing its decision upon the judgment of a state court of first instance. Subsequently that judgment was reversed. On error to the state court of appeals, it was held that under the doctrine of res judicata the judgment of the federal court estopped each party from again litigating the question. Speaking for the court, Mr. Justice Day said (pages 510, 511 of 191 U. S., 24 S. Ct. 154, 158):\n'It is urged that the state judgment upon which the Federal decree of 1898 is based was afterwards reversed by the highest court of Kentucky, and, therefore, the foundation of the decree has been removed, and the decree itself must fall. But is this argument sound? When a plea of res judicata is interposed, based upon a former judgment between the parties, the question is not what were the reasons upon which the judgment proceeded, but what was the judgment itself; was it within the jurisdiction of the court, between the same parties, and is it still in force and effect? The doctrine of estoppel by judgment is founded upon the proposition that all controversies and contentions involved are set at rest by a judgment or decree lawfully rendered which, in its terms, em- \n\n[286 U.S. 191, 200]\n\u00a0\n bodied a settlement of the right of the parties. It would undermine the foundation of the principle upon which it is based if the court might inquire into and revise the reasons which led the court to make the judgment. ... We are unable to find reason or authority supporting the proposition that because a judgment may have been given for wrong reasons or has been susequently reversed, that it is any the less effective as an estoppel between the parties while in force.'\n\n'It is to be remembered.' the court added (p. 512 of 191 U. S., 24 S. Ct. 154, 158), 'that we are not dealing with the right of the parties to get relief from the original judgment by bill of review or other process in the Federal court in which it was rendered. There the court may reconsider and set aside or modify its judgment upon seasonable application. In every other forum the reasons for passing the decree are wholly immaterial and the subsequent reversal of the judgment upon which it is predicated can have no other effect than to authorize the party aggrieved to move in some proper proceeding, in the court of its rendition, to modify it or set it aside. It cannot be attacked collaterally, and in every other court must be given full force and effect, irrespective of the reasons upon which it is based.'\n\n Parkhurst v. Berdell, 110 N. Y. 386, 392, 18 N. E. 123, 126, 6 Am. St. Rep. 384, is cited with approval. In that case the Court of Appeals of New York rejected the contention that the reversal of a judgment which had been given effect as an estoppel in a second action would avoid the force of the second judgment:\n'If the judgment roll was competent evidence when received,' the state court said, 'its reception was not rendered erroneous by the subsequent reversal of the judgment. Notwithstanding its reversal, it continued in this action to have the same effect to which it was entitled when received in evidence. The only relief a party against whom a judgment, which has been subsequently \n\n[286 U.S. 191, 201]\n\u00a0\n reversed, has thus been received, in evidence, can have, is to move, on that fact, in the court of original jurisdiction, for a new trial; and then the court can, in the exercise of its discretion, grant or refuse a new trial, as justice may require.'\n\n See, also, Gould et al. v. Sternberg, 128 Ill. 510, 515, 516, 21 N. E. 628, 15 Am. St. Rep. 138.\n These decisions constitute applications of the general and well- settled rule that a judgment, not set aside on appeal or otherwise, is equally effective as an estoppel upon the points decided, whether the decision be right or wrong. Cornett v. Williams, 20 Wall. 226, 249, 250; Wilson v. Deen, \n121 \nU.S. 525, 534\n, 7 S. Ct. 1004; Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co. v. Schendel, \n270 \nU.S. 611, 617\n, 46 S. Ct. 420, 53 A. L. R. 1265. The indulgence of a contrary view would result in creating elements of uncertainty and confusion and in undermining the conclusive character of judgments, consequences which it was the very purpose of the doctrine of res judicata to avert.\n Judgment reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO (dissenting).\n The real estate belonging to Silas Holmes was devised by his will, in the event of the death of his daughter 'without issue,' to his nephew and to his brothers and sisters then living in equal shares.\n Upon the death of the daughter a controversy arose between her grandson, Lorenzo Allen, who was the sole surviving descendant of the testator, and the nephew and brothers and sisters.\n An interpleader suit followed to determine the distribution of rents deposited as a fund in the Registry of the Court.\n In that suit the Supreme Court of the District adjudged on July 24, 1925, that the true interpretation of the will of .silas Holmes was that upon the death of his daughter, \n\n[286 U.S. 191, 202]\n\u00a0\n 'without leaving child her surviving,' the real estate described in the bill of complaint was devised to the nephew and the brothers and sisters, and that the rents accruing since her death should be divided in the same way.\n On appeal to the Court of Appeals that decree was reversed (January 3, 1927), with the result that on May 27, 1927, a final decree was entered vacating the decree of July 24, 1925, adjudging that the true interpretation of the will of Silas Holmes was that upon the death of said decedent's daughter, Virginia Allen, leaving issue, i. e., a grandson, but no child her surviving, 'the said will became inoperative as to the real estate therein described and the said testator therefore died intestate as to the said real estate,' and further adjudging that the balance of the fund on deposit in the registry be paid to Lorenzo Allen, the sole heir at law.\n In the meantime, the nephew and the brothers and sisters, who for convenience will be spoken of as the collateral relatives, brought an action of ejectment against the heir to recover the possession of the real estate adjudged to be theirs by the decree of July, 1925. In that action they relied solely upon the will and the decree establishing their ownership thereunder. The defendant, admitting the decree, set up the plead that an appeal had been taken from it and was still undetermined. A demurrer to the plea was sustained, and the plaintiffs recovered a judgment (August 21, 1926), under which possession was delivered to them. From that judgment the defendant did not prosecute an appeal.\n In December, 1927, upon the entry of the final decree in the equity court, the respondent, Lorenzo Allen (the defendant in the first action of ejectment), brought this action of ejectment against the collateral relatives to recover the possession of the real estate from which they \n\n[286 U.S. 191, 203]\n\u00a0\n had ousted him. The defendants pleaded in bar the judgment previously rendered in their favor in the first action of ejectment. The plaintiff ( the respondent here) filed a replication showing the relation between that judgment and the equity decree and the reversal of the decree after possession had been delivered. The Supreme Court of the District sustained a demurrer to the replication and ordered judgment for the defendants. The Court of Appeals reversed and gave the possession to the plaintiff. The case is here upon certiorari.\n The respondent, in order to prevail, must uphold three propositions. He must show: (1) That he is entitled to restitution of any property interests lost to him by force of the erroneous decree; (2) that in losing possession under the judgment of ejectment he suffered a loss that was caused by the decree; (3) that the present action of ejectment is, irrespective of its name, an action for restitution, and an appropriate remedy to put him back where he was at the time of the ouster.\n\n 1. \nAs to proposition No. 1, there is hardly room for controversy. The rule is abundantly settled both in this court and elsewhere that what has been lost to a litigant under the compulsion of a judgment shall be restored thereafter, in the event of a reversal, by the litigants opposed to him, the beneficiaries of the error. Arkadelphia Milling Co. v. St. Louis, S. W. Ry. Co., \n249 \nU.S. 134\n, 39 S. Ct. 237, 242; Northwestern Fuel Co. v. Brock, \n139 \nU.S. 216\n, 11 S. Ct. 523; Bank of United States v. Bank of Washington, 6 Pet. 8, 17; Haebler v. Myers, 132 N. Y. 363, 30 N. E. 963, 15 L. R. A. 588, 28 Am. St. Rep. 589. Two remedies exist, the one by summary motion addressed to the appellate court, the other by a plenary suit. The books show that it has long been the practice to embody in the mandate of reversal a direction that the plaintiff in error 'be restored to all things which he hath lost by occasion of the said judgment.' Arkadelphia Milling Co. v. St. Louis, etc., Ry. Co., \n\n[286 U.S. 191, 204]\n\u00a0\n supra; Haebler v. Myers, supra. What this was might be ascertained through an order to show cause known as a scire facias quare restitutionem habere non debet. Haebler v. Myers, supra. Inquiry was then made whether anything had been taken 'by colour of the judgment,' (Sympson v. Juxon, Cro. Jac., 698), with an appropriate mandate for the return of anything discovered. On the other hand, the litigant who has prevailed on the appeal is not confined to a motion for summary relief. He may elect to maintain an action, or the court in its discretion may remit him to that remedy. Bank of United States v. Bank of Washington, supra; Haebler v. Myers, supra; Clark v. Pinney, 6 Cow. (N. Y.) 297. One form of remedy or the other, however, is granted as of right. The remedy in its essence like the one for money had and received is for the recovery of benefits that in good conscience may no longer be retained. 'It is one of the equitable powers, inherent in every court of justice so long as it retains control of the subject-matter and of the parties, to correct that which has been wrongfully done by virtue of its process.' Arkadelphia Milling Co. v. St. Louis, etc., Ry. Co., supra. Indeed, the correction may extend to cases where the postulants for restitution are not even parties to the record. Arkadelphia Milling Co. v. St. Louis, etc., Ry. Co., supra, page 146 of 249 U. S., 39 S. Ct. 237; Stevens v. Fitch, 11 Metc. (Mass.) 248. The whole subject has heretofore been dealt with in a spirit of the largest liberality. The judicial process has been moulded with an anxious effort to put an end as speedily as may be to wrongs originating in judicial errors.\n\n 2. \nOur second inquiry must now be answered: Was the loss of possession under the judgment of ejectment a loss that was inflicted upon the respondent by force of the decree in equity adjudging, and adjudging erroneously, that the petitioners were the owners?\n A question very similar was considered by the courts of New York in the early case of Clark v. Pinney, 6 \n\n[286 U.S. 191, 205]\n\u00a0\n Cow. (N. Y.) 297 (cited by this court in Bank of United States v. Bank of Washington, supra). The plaintiffs had given a note in satisfaction of an execution issued on a judgment, and thereafter a second judgment was recovered on the note. The first judgment having been reversed, they sued to recover the money paid upon the second. The decision was that the defendant had money in his hands that ex aequo et bono was owing to the plaintiffs, and that he should be compelled to pay it back. The court was not deterred from this conclusion by the intervention of a second judgment, unappealed from, between the first judgment and the payment. It looked to the events in their combined significance, and viewed the action for restitution as an instrument of justice. The entry of a second judgment, instead of being a circumstance fastening the rivets of injustice, was merely an additional reason why the rivets should be broken.\n The problem now before us should be approached in a like spirit.\n If the decree had contained a provision that the petitioners were entitled to a deed to be executed by a trustee, there can be no doubt that upon the reversal of the decree they could have been required to execute a deed back. If the trustee had refrained from executing a conveyance and had been compelled by a separate decree to fulfill what appeared to be his duty, only a narrow view of the remedial powers of equity would discover in the separate decree a decisive element of difference. The restitution that would have been decreed if the auxiliary proceeding had been one in equity is equally available here, where the auxiliary remedy was one at law, an action of ejectment for the recovery of possession. In every substantial sense, the judgment in ejectment was the consequence and supplement of the erroneous adjudication that the petitioners were the owners and entitled to the rents. The respondent made no claim to any right of possession except such right as was his by virtue of ownership under the will. \n\n[286 U.S. 191, 206]\n\u00a0\n The petitioners made no claim on their side apart from the will and the decree adjudicating ownership in them. Looking into the record of the trial, as we are privileged to do, in order to asscertain the grounds upon which possession was awarded (Oklahoma v. Texas, \n256 \nU.S. 70, 88\n, 41 S. Ct. 420; National Foundry & Pipe Works v. Oconto City Water Supply Co., \n183 \nU.S. 216, 234\n, 22 S. Ct. 111; Russell v. Place, \n94 U.S. 606\n, 608), we find that there was no opportunity for a consideration upon the merits of the respondent's claim of title, and that within the principle of res judicata there was nothing to be tried. Indeed, the respondent made no contention to the contrary, but merely urged in his plea that judgment be deferred till the appeal from the decree could be determined by the appellate court. The plea being overruled, judgment of ouster followed as an inevitable consequence. It was as inevitable, and as plainly the fruit of the earlier decree in equity, as it would have been if that decree had said upon its face that the respondent was under a duty to surrender possession to the petitioners if possession was demanded.\n The agrument for the petitioners is that the respondent in this predicament had one remedy, and one only, an appeal from the judgment giving effect to the decree, and that, failing to prosecute that remedy, he became helpless altogether. I concede that an appeal was a remedy available to the respondent, but not that it was his only one, or that the failure to pursue it brought down upon his head a penalty so dire. Clark v. Pinney, supra. Consider the situation in which he would have stood if the appeal had been taken. The judgment of ejectment was not eeroneous when rendered. No other judgment could properly have been rendered if there was to be adherence to the principle of res judicata. The Court of Appeals would have been constrained to affirm it, whether they believed the earlier decision to be correct or erroneous, \n\n[286 U.S. 191, 207]\n\u00a0\n if the accidents of the calendar had brought up the review of the judgment before there had been opportunity to pass upon the decree. Parkhurst v. Berdell, 110 N. Y. 386, 18 N. E. 123, 6 Am. St. Rep. 384; Deposit Bank v. Frankfort, \n191 \nU.S. 499, 512\n, 24 S. Ct. 154. Even if the appeal from the decree had been heard and decided first, the reversal of the second judgment would have followed, not for any error of the trial court, but in furtherance of substantial justice by the application of principles analogous to those that govern the allowance or denial of a writ of restitution. The subject was considered in Butler v. Eaton, \n141 \nU.S. 240\n, 11 S. Ct. 985. The ruling there was that the court in such a situation, if it learns from its own records that the foundation judgment has been reversed, will set aside the second, though the trial be free from error. By a short cut to justice it will relieve the litigant of the necessity of resorting to bills of review and motions for a new trial and all the technical apparatus familiar to students of procedure. Cf. Ballard v. Searls, \n130 \nU.S. 50, 55\n, 9 S. Ct. 418; Walz v. Agricultural Ins. Co., (D. C.) 282 F. 646. On the other hand, there are barriers to remedies so summary where the decree of reversal has been rendered in the courts of another jurisdiction. Deposit Bank v. Frankfort, supra. In such circumstances the reversal is no longer cognizable without proof, is no longer within the range of judicial notice. There are, besides, other complications resulting from the duty of a state to give effect and credit to the judgments of the federal courts and those of other states. Deposit Bank v. Frankfort, supra. The very fact, however, that the second judgment will be reversed where the reversal of the first judgment is known to the appellate court by force of judicial notice is in itself a potent token that the second judgment is understood to be the product of the first, and hence within the equity and reason of the writ of restitution. What was written in Butler v. Eaton, \n\n[286 U.S. 191, 208]\n\u00a0\n supra, pages 243, 244, of 141 U. S., 11 S. Ct. 985, 987, can be applied with little variation here. 'The judgment complained of,' it was there written, 'is based directly upon the judgment of the supreme judicial court of Massachusetts, which we have just reversed. It is apparent from an inspection of the record that the whole foundation of that part of the judgment which is in favor of the defendant is, to our judicial knowledge, without any validity, force, or effect, and ought never to have existed. Why, then, should not we reverse the judgment which we know of record has become erroneous, and save the parties the delay and expense of taking ulterior proceedings in the court below to effect the same object?' The respondent is in a worse plight than was the plaintiff in error in Butler v. Eaton. He has no remedy in the court of first instance, unless it be by an action of this nature, for the time to move for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence expired with the term. United States v. Mayer, \n235 \nU.S. 55\n, 35 S. Ct. 16; Realty Acceptance Corp. v. Montgomery, \n284 \nU.S. 547\n, 52 S. Ct. 215. If he had appealed from the judgment in ejectment, and the appeal had been heard and decided before the reversal of the decree, his position would be no better. Upon the reversal of the decree afterwards he would still, in the view of the petitioners, have been left without a remedy; there would even then have been no power in the court to undo the wrong that had been perpetrated under color of its mandate. I think we should hesitate long before committing our procedure to so sterile a conclusion.\n For the purpose of the case before us, no significance is to be given to the provisions of the Code (Code of District of Columbia,  1002 (D. C. Code 1929, T. 24,  178)) whereby 'any final judgment rendered in an action of ejectment shall be conclusive as to the title thereby established as between the parties to the action and all persons claiming under them since the commencement of the action.' The object of that statute \n\n[286 U.S. 191, 209]\n\u00a0\n was to abrogate anomalies as to the effect of a judgment in ejectment that had grown up at common law when the remedy was held to be one affecting possession only, and not directed to the title. City of Cincinnati v. White, 6 Pet. 431, 443. The codifiers did not mean that a party who has recovered in ejectment shall be more immune from restitution than one in any other form of action. A different question would be here if the persons resisting restitution were not the immediate parties to the suit, but strangers acquiring an interest in the property in reliance on the judgment. As to strangers so situated the remedy of restitution has been excluded since ancient days. Matthew Manning's Case, 4 Coke, 94; Bank of United States v. Bank of Washington, supra.\n\n 3. \nThe third branch of the inquiry need not detain us long. If I have been right in what has gone before, there can be little room for controversy as to the fitness of the remedy. An action for restitution has for its aim to give back to a suitor what a judgment has taken from him. What was taken from the respondent under the shelter of this reversed decree and because of its coercive power was the possession of a tract of land. The effect of a judgment in this action of ejectment will be to re- establish his possession and put him where he was before. The quality of the remedy is to be determined by the end to be achieved, and not by any label, whether restitution or ejectment.\n A system of procedure is perverted from its proper function when it multiplies impediments to justice without the warrant of clear necessity. By the judgment about to be rendered, the respondent, caught in a mesh of procedural complexities, is told that there was only one way out of them, and this a way he failed to follow. Because of that omission he is to be left ensnared in the web, the processes of the law, so it is said, being impotent to set him \n\n[286 U.S. 191, 210]\n\u00a0\n free. I think the paths to justice are not so few and narrow. A little of the liberality of method that has shaped the law of restitution in the past (Clark v. Pinney, supra; Arkadelphia Milling Co. v. St. Louis, etc., Ry. Co., supra) it still competent to find a way.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice STONE join in this opinion. \n\n\n\n","122":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nREICHELDERFER v. QUINN(1932)\n\nArgued: October 17, 1932Decided: December 5, 1932\n\n\n\n\n[287 U.S. 315, 316]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Robert E. Lynch and William W. Bride, both of Washington, D.C ., for petitioners.\n Messrs. George E. Sullivan, Joseph A. Burkart, and Henry I. Quinn, all of Washington, D.C., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case is here on certiorari, \n285 \nU.S. 535\n, 52 S.Ct. 457, to review a decree of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, 60 App.D.C. 325, 53 F.(2d) 1079. Following its earlier decision in Quinn v. Dougherty, 58 App.D.C. 339, 30 F.(2d) 749, that court affirmed a decree of the Supreme Court of the District, enjoining the petitioners, the District Commissioners, from erecting a fire engine house in Rock Creek Park at a point near \n\n[287 U.S. 315, 317]\n\u00a0\n the property of some of the respondents, and adjoining that of others.\n The Commissioners are directed by act of Congress, 45 Stat. 667, to build the engine house at the designated location within the park. The presence of such a structure will, it is admitted, diminish the attractiveness of respondents' lands for residence purposes, and, in consequence, decrease their exchange value. Respondents contend that they have a valuable right appurtenant to their land, in the nature of an easement, to have the land used for park purposes, and that the act of Congress, directing its use for other purposes, is a taking of their property without just compensation, in violation of the Fifth Amendment.\n For present purposes we assume that the proposed building with divert the land from park uses, and address ourselves to the question upon which the other issues in the case depend, whether the respondents, plaintiffs in the trial court, are vested with the right for which they invoke constitutional protection.\n There is no contention that such a right arises as an incident to the ownership of neighboring land, as does an easement of light and air, under the law of some states. See Muhlker v. New York & Harlem Railroad Co., \n197 \nU.S. 544, 564\n, 25 S.Ct. 522. Compare Marchand v. Pennsylvania Railroad, \n153 \nU.S. 380\n, 14 S.Ct. 894. But it is argued that the right asserted, whether it be regarded as arising from a contract with the government or an interest in its lands, has a definite source in the transaction by which the park was created.\n The court below found this source in the first section of the Rock Creek Park Act, 26 Stat. 492 (40 USCA  83), by which the lands taken for the park by purchase or condemnation were 'perpetually dedicated and set apart as a public park or pleasure ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people of the United States, ...' and in the as- \n\n[287 U.S. 315, 318]\n\u00a0\n sessment under section 61, of surrounding lands, including those of respondents, to the extent that they were 'specially benefited by reason of the location and improvement' of the park. The question is thus one of construction of the statute; if it did not create the private rights asserted, it is unnecessary to invoke the police power, as petitioners do, to justify the construction of the engine house. Cf. Jackman v. Rosenbaum Co., \n260 \nU.S. 22, 31\n, 43 S.Ct. 9.\n First. The respondents derived no rights against the government from the dedication of the park alone. The park lands purchased or condemned by authority of the Rock Creek Park Act were vested in the United States in fee. Section 3 of the act (26 Stat. 492) twice declares that 'the title' and once that 'the fee' of the condemned lands shall vest in the United States. By dedicating the lands thus acquired to a particular public use, Congress declared a public policy, but did not purport to deprive itself of the power to change that policy by devoting the lands to other uses. The dedication expressed no more than the will of a particular Congress which does not impose itself upon those to follow in succeeding years. See Newton v. Mahoning County Commissioners, \n100 U.S. 548\n, 559; Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Spratley, \n172 \nU.S. 602, 621\n, 19 S. Ct. 308.\n It is true that the mere presence of the park may have conferred a special benefit on neighboring owners and \n\n[287 U.S. 315, 319]\n\u00a0\n enhanced the value of their property. But the existence of value alone does not generate interests protected by the Constitution against diminution by the government, however unreasonable its action may be. The beneficial use and hence the value of abutting property is decreased when a public street or canal is closed or obstructed by public authority, Meyer v. Richmond, \n172 \nU.S. 82, 95\n, 19 S.Ct. 106; cf. Whitney v. New York, 96 N.Y. 240; Fox v. Cincinnati, \n104 U.S. 783\n; Kirk v. Maumee Valley Co., \n279 \nU.S. 797, 802\n, 803 S., 49 S.Ct. 507; Smith v. City of Boston, 7 Cush.(Mass.) 254; Stanwood v. Malden, 157 Mass. 17, 31 N.E. 702, 16 L.R.A. 591; or a street grade is raised, Smith to Use of Cushing v. Washington, 20 How. 135; see Mead v. Portland, \n200 \nU.S. 148, 162\n, 26 S.Ct. 171; or the location of a county seat, Newton v. Commissioners, supra, or of a railroad is changed, Bryan v. Louisville & N.R. Co. (C.C.A.) 244 F. 650, 659. But in such cases no private right is infringed. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n Beyond the traditional boundaries of the common law, only some imperative justification in policy will lead the courts to recognize in old values new property rights. Compare International News Service v. Associated Press, \n248 \nU.S. 215\n, 39 S.Ct. 68, 2 A.L.R. 293, with Cheney Bros. v. Doris Silk Corporation (C.C.A.) 35 F.(2d) 279. The case is clear where the question is not of private rights alone, but the value was both created and diminished as an incident of the operations of the government. For, if the enjoyment of a benefit thus derived from the public acts of government were a source of legal rights to have it perpetuated, the powers of government would be exhausted by their exercise. \n\n[287 U.S. 315, 320]\n\u00a0\n The case of a park is not unique, as the court below seems to have thought. 3 See Quinn v. Dougherty, 58 App.D.C. 339, 30 F.(2d) 749, 751. It has often been decided that, when lands are acquired by a governmental body in fee and dedicated by statute to park purposes, it is within the legislative power to change the use, Clark v.

The abutting owner cannot complain; the damage suffered by him 'though greater in degree than that of the rest of the public, is the same in kind.' See United States v. Welch, \n217 \nU.S. 333, 339\n, 30 S.Ct. 527, 28 L.R.A.(N.S.) 385, 19 Ann.Cas. 680. \n\n[287 U.S. 315, 321]\n\u00a0\n Second. The fact that lands, including those now owned by respondents, were assessed for benefits, as directed by the Rock Creek Park Act, leads to no different conclusion. Respondents urge that the special benefits required to be assessed included those accruing from the perpetual maintenance of the park; that by virtue of the assessment they have paid for the right to enjoy those benefits in perpetuity. We may assume that the landowners acquired rights commensurate with the assessments authorized. But the statute does not purport to place restrictions on the park lands in their favor, and the decision of this court sustaining the constitutionality of the assessment provision (Wilson v. Lambert, \n168 \nU.S. 611\n, 18 S.Ct. 217), gives no hint that among the benefits for which they were required to pay was a right against the government to have the lands forever used as a park.\n All that the statute says is that the lands acquired shall be perpetually dedicated as a park for the enjoyment of the people of the United States (section 1), and that benefits shall be assessed (section 6). Statutes said to restrict the power of government by the creation of private rights are, like other public grants, to be strictly construed for the protection of the public interest. Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge, 11 Pet. 420, 544-548; Christ Church v. County of Philadelphia, 24 How. 300; Knoxville Water Co. v. Knoxville, \n200 \nU.S. 22, 33\n, 26 S.Ct. 224; Larson v. South Dakota, \n278 \nU.S. 429\n, 49 S.Ct. 196. Thus construed, the dedication of the park, a declaration of a present purpose, does not imply a promise to neighboring landowners that the park would be continued in perpetuity. Cf. Newton v. Commissioners, supra. The benefit of a governmental obligation which the statute neither expresses nor implies obviously was not to be assessed.\n We think that the benefits intended must be taken to be those obvious advantages which would accrue to lands in the vicinity of a park, because of their location, and \n\n[287 U.S. 315, 322]\n\u00a0\n which would be reflected in their market value, even though there were no guaranty that the park would be continued for any particular length of time. \n4\n See Wilson v. Lambert, supra, page 617 of 168 U.S., 18 S.Ct. 217; cf. Susquehanna Power Co. v. State Tax Commission of Maryland, \n283 \nU.S. 291, 296\n, 51 S.Ct. 434; Burbank v. Fay, 65 N.Y. 57, 64. So it was held in Thayer v. City of Boston (D.C.) 206 F. 969, where contentions very similar to those made here were rejected. See, also, Brooklyn Park Commissioners v. Armstrong, supra, page 245, of 45 N.Y. The same result has been reached with regard to the assessment of benefits arising from other types of public improvements, Whitney v. New York, supra, page 246 of 96 N.Y.; City of Chicago v. Union Building Ass'n, 102 Ill. 379, 397, 40 Am.Rep. 598; Kean v. City of Elizabeth, 54 N.J. Law, 462, 24 A. 495, affirmed 55 N.J. Law, 337, 26 A. 939; see Home for Aged Women v. Commonwealth, 202 Mass. 422, 429, 430, 89 N.E. 124, 24 L.R.A.(N.S.) 79; 1 Nichols, Eminent Domain (2d Ed.)  116; and is implicit in the statement, frequently made, that such assessments are an exercise of the taxing power. See Bauman v. Ross, \n167 \nU.S. 548, 588\n, 17 S.Ct. 966; Wilson v. Lambert, supra, page 614 of 168 U.S., 18 S.Ct. 217; Memphis & Charleston Ry. v. Pace, \n282 \nU.S. 241, 245\n, 51 S.Ct. 108. \n\n[287 U.S. 315, 323]\n\u00a0\n The possibility that the United States might, at some later date, rightfully exercise its power to change the use of the park lands, so far as it affected present value, was a proper subject for consideration in valuing the benefits conferred. Cf. United States v. River Rouge Co., \n269 \nU.S. 411\n, 46 S.Ct. 144; Sears v. Street Commissioners, 180 Mass. 274, 282, 62 N.E. 397, 62 L.R.A. 144; Whitney v. New York, supra; 1 Nichols, Eminent Domain, supra.\n Property was not taken without just compensation by either the Rock Creek Park Act or the statute authorizing the construction of the fire house. The only taking occurred when the lands were condemned for the park. Just compensation, the value at that time, Vogelstein & Co. v. United States, \n262 \nU.S. 337\n, 43 S.Ct. 564; United States v. New River Collieries Co., \n262 \nU.S. 341, 344\n, 43 S.Ct. 565, was awarded if the benefits resulting from the proximity of the improvement, valued as the act prescribed, were, as respondents assert, set off against the value of the property taken from the same owners, Bauman v. Ross, supra; Whitney v. New York, supra; Eldridge v. City of Binghamton, supra. See Matter of City of New York, 190 N.Y. 350, 357, 360, 83 N.E. 299, 16 L. R.A.(N.S.) 335, 13 Ann.Cas. 598.\n We note, but do not discuss at length, the objection that the statute authorizing the construction of the fire house is invalid because inconsistent with regulations under the Zoning Act for the District (41 Stat. 500 (D.C. Code 1929, T. 25,  521-530)), setting apart the area in the vicinity of the park for residential properties of the highest class. It is enough to say that the zoning regulations are not contracts by the government and may be modified by Congress. The record and briefs disclose no facts which require us to consider how far the exercise of the power to modify may be subject to constitutional limitations.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Sec. 6.

Douglass v. City of Montgomery, 118 Ala. 599, 24 So. 745, 43 L.R.A. 376. Cf. City of Cincinnati v. White, 6 Pet. 431; Sheffield & Tuscumbia Street Ry. v. Rand & Moore, 83 Ala. 294, 3 So. 686.

There rights in the land or against the municipality were said to have been reserved in the grantor or created in the owners of neighboring land by the terms of the grant.\n Equally distinguishable are the decisions which likewise deal with the authority of a municipality, not the power of the Legislature, to divert park lands from park uses, but in which the lands were acquired by unrestricted purchase or by eminent domain. See 3 Dillon, supra,  991, 1023. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] As originally introduced and reported, the bill authorizing and establishing the park (S. No. 4, 51st Cong., 1st Sess.) had no provision for the assessment of benefited property. 21 Cong.Rec. 96, 353, 902, 1109, 2371, 2578-2590. Such a method of financing was suggested by Representative Payson, Id. 2580, who offered an amendment embodying this plan, Id. 3939, which, after conference, was adopted, in substance, as section 6. See Id. 3952, 3953, 5300-5303, 5673, 5902, 5903, 5988, 6163, 10417-10419, 10457, 10458, 10441-10444. In explaining the assessment provision on the floor, Mr. Payson said: 'Suppose that a man owns a piece of property, distant, we will suppose, a quarter of a mile from the park and that piece of property is worth today $1,000. Now, if by reason of the expenditure made by the Government in this great public improvement this man's property should become, in the judgment of the commission, worth $2, 000, the direct benefit thus arising to the property would be assessed against it to assist in paying for the proposed improvement.'

BUCHHALTER(1932)\nNo. 736\nArgued: April 28, 1932Decided: May 23, 1932\n\n\n\n\n[286 U.S. 451, 452]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Ernest Morris, of Denver, Colo., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[286 U.S. 451, 454]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Henry E. Lutz, of Denver, Colo., for respondent.\n\n\n[286 U.S. 451, 455]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought in the federal court for Colorado by petitioner against respondent, the First National Bank of Denver, and the members of a law firm to obtain judgment against respondent on an oral promise to pay a large sum, and to establish and foreclose a lien therefor upon certain bonds and cash held by the bank in escrow. The principal controversy was between petitioner and respondent. The bank claimed a lien on the fund to secure payment of a small sum owing to it by respondent. The lawyers asserted a claim under an attachment to enforce payment of an amount to be fixed as their compensation for services in a proceeding in the state court. After trial, at which much evidence was heard, the court dismissed the complaint on the merits. Respondent appealed, and petitioner took a cross-appeal. On respondent's appeal, the Circuit Court of Appeals remanded, with \n\n[286 U.S. 451, 456]\n\u00a0\n instructions for further proceedings in the District Court, and on petitioner's appeal affirmed. 54 F. (2d) 834.\n This writ brings here for review the part of the decree directing the District Court to deduct from petitioner's share of the fund in escrow the expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees to be fixed by the District Court, to which respondent and the bank have been put in this litigation.\n The evidence and findings disclose facts, occurring before those alleged in petitioner's complaint, that shed light upon the question presented. In June, 1929, at a state court receiver's sale, he and one Bronstine each bought an undivided half of the property of the Colorado Pulp & Paper Company. The purchase price was paid in cash and in bonds of that company. Under an agreement between petitioner and respondent, the former furnished $61,000 and the latter $53,922, making the total required to pay for the half interest bought by petitioner. It was transferred to petitioner, and later a quarter interest was conveyed by him to respondent. Possession of the property was given to Bronstine, who carried on the business for account of all concerned. Petitioner and respondent wanted to sell their interest, and, in order to force Bronstine to buy them out, they pursued a course of hostile and threatening criticism of his management. And when a partition suit by Bronstine seemed imminent, they, conspiring to embarrass and delay him should he seek relief by that means, falsely made it to appear of record that a quarter interest in the property was subject to a heavy incumbrance. For that purpose they caused to be made and recorded a deed transferring petitioner's quarter interest to respondent, and also a trust deed to the public trustee purporting to secure a note made by respondent to petitioner for $67,500. Respondent soon succeeded in selling the half interest to one Binstock, an associate of Bronstine, for $28,080 in cash, and $92,500 in \n\n[286 U.S. 451, 457]\n\u00a0\n bonds of the Colorado Paper Products Company. Petitioner, as a condition of clearing the title of record, required that all the cash and bonds should be delivered to the bank to be hald in escrow until he and respondent should agree in writing as to the disposition of the same. They promptly divided nearly all of the cash, but came to no agreement for division of the remaining money or the bonds.\n Later, petitioner brought this suit claiming that the fictitious note and trust deed were valid, and alleging that, when the cash was divided, respondent promised to pay him the full amount of the note and $7,500 out of the profits of the venture, and that the bonds should be held in escrow until the balance alleged to be owing, $59,699.61, should be paid. And the complaint alleges that the lawyers had attached the interest of petitioner and respondent, and claimed a prior lien on the fund. The prayer is that petitioner have judgment against respondent for the amount claimed; that the same be declared a lien upon the fund; and that the bank sell the bonds and apply the fund to the payment of the judgment. Respondent's answer alleges that the note and trust deed were fictitious, denies the alleged promise, avers that he and petitioner had approximately equal interest in the property, and that the only agreement between them was that the sale of their half interest be joint, and entire and the proceeds be equally divided between them, and prays that the complaint be dismissed on the merits. The lawyers' answer asserts that they have a lien upon the fund, denies that petitioner has any, and prays that he be denied relief. The bank's answer shows that the cash and bonds were deposited with it to be held in escrow until petitioner and respondent agree in writing as to the disposition of the same, sets forth the division of the cash, alleges that respondent assigned his interest in the fund to the bank as security for the payment of $1,250, \n\n[286 U.S. 451, 458]\n\u00a0\n and prays that it be declared to have a first lien on the fund, be instructed as to disposition of the balance, and have costs and attorneys' fees incurred in this suit.\n After hearing the evidence and before making findings under Equity Rule 70 1\/2 (28 USCA  723), the District Court filed a memorandum showing that petitioner had failed to make out his case. Then respondent submitted requests for findings of fact, and, in addition to those negativing petitioner's cause of action, asked the court to find that petitioner and he entered into a campaign against Bronstine, including the making of the fictitious note and trust deed, to create difficulties and to force Bronstine to buy their interest in the property; that, by making the note the basis of his suit, petitioner attempted to perpetrate a fraud against respondent and to impose upon the court; and that petitioner's testimony is unworthy of belief. And respondent proposed as conclusions of law that petitioner, by reason of the campaign against Bronstine, did not come into court with clean hands, and that the bank should be directed to deliver the entire fund to respondent subject to its lien and the claim of the lawyers. The court, refusing to adopt any such condemnatory requests, made findings merely showing the respective amounts invested in the property by petitioner and respondent; that the fictitious note had been canceled; that pursuant to agreement the proceeds of the sale were to be held by the bank in escrow until respondent and petitioner agreed in writing as to the disposition of the same; that cash had been divided; and that the escrow agreement had not been modified. As its conclusion of law, the court declared that the complaint should be dismissed on the merits as to all defendants, with costs to be taxed against petitioner, and entered its decree accordingly.\n On his appeal, respondent prayed not for reversal of any part of the decree, but that it be made to declare that, as against petitioner, he was the owner of the fund, and \n\n[286 U.S. 451, 459]\n\u00a0\n to direct the bank to deliver it to him. The opinion of the court clearly shows that claim to be devoid of merit. Petitioner on his cross-appeal merely prayed for the relief sought in his complaint. The decree was affirmed, and that ruling is not questioned here. In his brief in that court, petitioner suggested that, if it held his suit was rightly dismissed below, it should direct distribution under the agreement.\n First to be considered is the command of the Circuit Court of Appeals that the District Court deduct from petitioner's share the 'court costs and expenses to which Buchhalter' has 'been put in this litigation including reasonable attorneys' fees to be determined by the trial court.'\n This is not a taxation of costs as between solicitor and client. Cf. Guardian Trust Co. v. Kansas City Southern Ry. Co. (C. C. A.) 28 F.(2d) 233; Id., \n281 \nU.S. 1\n, 50 S. Ct. 194. The only costs allowed to be included in the money judgment against petitioner are those taxable as between party and party; counsel fees or other expenses not so taxable are not to be included. The Circuit Court of Appeals found that, by reason of petitioner's wrongful and fraudulent demands and bad faith in bringing and maintaining this suit, he prevented the distribution of the fund according to the escrow agreement and put respondent and the bank to the expense of making their defense against a groundless claim. It concluded that, because of such inequitable conduct, the decree should impose upon petitioner's share a lien in favor of respondent and the bank for the expenses to which they were so put.\n It is significant that the trial court, though specifically requested by respondent so to do, declined to find that petitioner in bringing this suit attempted to perpetrate a fraud against respondent or to impose upon the court, or that he came with unclean hands, or must have known that the cause of action he alleged was without founda- \n\n[286 U.S. 451, 460]\n\u00a0\n tion in fact. Such refusal strongly suggests that the trial court who saw and heard these antagonists upon the witness stand was of opinion that no such condemnation was warranted by the evidence. Its findings appear to have been diligently restrained to those merely sufficient to show that petitioner failed to sustain the essential allegations of his complaint. Indeed, one of respondent's requests for findings reflects unwillingness on the part of petitioner to accept other than cash for his share, and that there were reasons, other than matters of mere accounting, for the agreement that the cash and bonds should be held in escrow until petitioner and respondent 'have agreed in writing concerning the disposition of the proceeds.'\n The Circuit Court of Appeals went beyond the issues presented by the record. Its opinion shows that determination of the appeals did not require findings as to the good faith of petitioner. Respondent, claiming the entire fund, necessarily opposed distribution under the agreement. A large part of the work of his attorneys is chargeable to the attempt to enforce his groundless claim to the entire fund. He made no application for a lien upon petitioner's share on account of expenses or attorneys' fees. Such allowances are not made as of course. And petitioner had no reason to apprehend that any such matter would be considered on either appeal. He had no opportunity to be heard in respect of the authority of the court to make such an allowance, or as to the facts touching the propriety or basis of the same. Petition for rehearing and denial, as here, upon a reasoned opinion may not in such a matter fairly be regarded as the equivalent of a hearing in advance of decision.\n The opinion below condemns the conduct of both parties in various details of the transaction out of which this litigation arose. The record discloses that, when acting together in the pursuit of gain, they were not governed by \n\n[286 U.S. 451, 461]\n\u00a0\n proper standards, and that, where their interests came in conflict, they disregarded considerations making for fair play. Nice distinctions as to which disclosed the greater lack of good faith are not sufficient to warrant a court of equity in putting upon one any part of the expenses incurred by the other in waging such a contest. Assuming that the matter was properly before the court for consideration, we are of opinion that the record does not warrant any such allowance in favor of respondent.\n The bank is not entitled as against petitioner to any allowance on account of expenses or counsel fees incurred to protect its claim against the fund to secure the debt owing by respondent to it. But under settled principles applied in equity courts, its reasonable expenses, including a fair amount to pay that fees of its attorneys incurred in this suit, and which are attributable to the discharge of its duty under the escrow agreement, properly may be made a first charge against the fund as a whole. United States v. Equitable Trust Co., \n283 \nU.S. 738, 744\n, 51 S. Ct. 639. The decree will be modified in accordance with this opinion, and the costs in this court will be taxed against respondent.\n Modified, and, as modified, affirmed. \n\n\n\n","124":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSCHOENTHAL v. IRVING TRUST CO.(1932)\nNo. 14\nArgued: October 18, 1932Decided: November 7, 1932\n\n\n\n\n[287 U.S. 92, 93]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Leo Guzik and Horace London, both of New York City, for petitioners.\n Messrs. George C. Levin and Saul J. Lance, both of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit in equity brought by respondent in the District Court for Southern New York to recover from Morris Schoenthal $500 and from Fannie Schoenthal $1,000 paid them by the bankrupt. The bill alleged facts sufficient to show that each of these payments operated as a preference under section 60b of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.  96(b), 11 USCA  96(b ), asserted that plaintiff had no adequate remedy at law, and prayed decree declaring the payments preferential and directing defendants to account for and pay to plaintiff the amounts so received with interest and costs. October 27, 1930, defendants separately answered and put in issue all the allegations of the bill.\n The case was advanced to the February, 1931, calendar. February 13, invoking equity rule 22 (28 USCA  723), defendants, on petition and notice of motion to be heard four days \n\n[287 U.S. 92, 94]\n\u00a0\n later, applied for an order transferring the suit to the law side of the court and for a trial by jury. On the return day the application was referred to the judge sitting in equity and was taken up February 24. After hearing counsel, the court denied the motion and immediately proceeded to trial in equity. It heard evidence, filed findings of fact and conclusions of law, and entered judgment that plaintiff recover from Morris Schoenthal $538.74 and from Fannie Schoenthal $1,075.84 and have executions therefor. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed.\n The principal question is whether, assuming they made timely application under rule 22, defendants were entitled to have the suit tried at law.\n Section 267 of the Judicial Code provides: 'Suits in equity shall not be sustained in any court of the United States in any case where a plain, adequate, and complete remedy may be had at law.' 28 U.S.C.  384 (28 USCA  384). That rule has always been followed in courts of equity. The enactment gives it emphasis and indicates legislative purpose that it shall not be relaxed. New York G. & I. Co. v. Memphis Water Co., \n107 \nU.S. 205, 214\n, 2 S.Ct. 279; Matthews v. Rodgers, \n284 \nU.S. 521, 525\n, 52 S.Ct. 217. It serves to guard the right of trial by jury preserved by the Seventh Amendment and to that end it should be liberally construed. Cf. In re Yerger, 8 Wall. 85, 101-103. In England, long prior to the enactment of our first Judiciary Act, common- law actions of trover and money had and received were resorted to for the recovery of preferential payments by bankrupts. \n1\n Suits to recover preferences constitute no \n\n[287 U.S. 92, 95]\n\u00a0\n part of the proceedings in bankruptcy but concern controversies arising out of it. Taylor v. Voss, \n271 \nU.S. 176, 182\n, 46 S.Ct. 461. They may be brought in the state courts as well as in the bankruptcy courts. Collett v. Adams, \n249 \nU.S. 545, 549\n, 39 S.Ct. 372. The question whether remedy must be by action at law or may be pursued in equity notwithstanding objection by defendant depends upon the facts stated in the bill. And, in absence of a clear showing that a court of law lacks capacity to give the relief which the allegations show plaintiff entitled to have, a suit in equity cannot be maintained. Boyce v. Grundy, 3 Pet. 210, 215; Buzard v. Houston, \n119 \nU.S. 347, 352\n, 7 S.Ct. 249; United States v. Bitter Root Dev. Co., \n200 \nU.S. 451, 472\n, 26 S.Ct. 318. The facts here alleged give no support to plaintiff's assertion that it has no adequate remedy at law. The preferences sued for were money payments of ascertained and definite amounts. The bill discloses no facts that call for an accounting or other equitable relief. It is clear that there may be had at law a remedy 'as practical and efficient to the ends of justice and its prompt administration, as the remedy in equity.' Boyce v. Grundy, ubi supra. The contention that section 267 prohibits the maintenance of this suit in equity is sustained in principle by numerous decisions of this court. \n2\n And upon the very question here presented the weight of judicial opinion in the lower federal courts3 and in the state courts4 is that suits such as this cannot be sustained in equity. \n\n[287 U.S. 92, 96]\n\u00a0\n Plaintiff insists that defendants waived their right to have the suit transferred to the law side.\n Rule 22 declares: 'If at any time it appear that a suit commenced in equity should have been brought as an action on the law side of the court, it shall be forthwith transferred to the law side and be there proceeded with, with only such alteration in the pleadings as shall be essential.' As plaintiff's bill shows that it had a plain, adequate, and complete remedy at law, defendants were entitled upon proper application to have the suit transferred and trial by jury. Undoubtedly they might have waived that right. Reynes v. Dumont, \n130 \nU.S. 354, 395\n, 9 S.Ct. 486; American Mills Co. v. American Surety Co., \n260 \nU.S. 360, 363\n, 43 S.Ct. 149.

WATSON(1932)\n\nArgued: Decided: November 7, 1932\n\n\n\n Appeal from the Supreme Court of the State of Florida.\n Mr. W. J. Oven, of Tallahassee, Fla., for appellant.\n Mr. John E. Mathews, of Jacksonville, Fla., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellant seeks reversal of a judgment obtained by appellee upon the ground that section 7051 of the Compiled General Laws 1927, as construed below, is repugnant to the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. Section 237, Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C. \n\n[287 U.S. 86, 87]\n\u00a0\n s 344 (28 USCA  344). Section 7051 declares: 'A railroad company shall be liable for any damage done to persons, live stock or other property, by the running of the locomotives, or cars, or other machinery of such company, or for damage done by any person in the employ and service of such company, unless the company shall make it appear that their agents have exercised all ordinary and reasonable care and diligence, the presumption in all cases being against the company.'\n Watson sued the railway company to recover damages caused by a collision, at a highway grade crossing, between one of defendant's locomotives and plaintiff's mule team being driven by his employee. The declaration alleged that the collision was caused by the negligence of defendant in that it operated the train at excessive speed and failed by whistle or otherwise to give warning. Defendant pleaded not guilty and that the negligence of the driver was the sole cause of the accident. Plaintiff introduced evidence showing the collision and resulting damage. Defendant called witnesses whose testimony tended to show that its employees were not negligent and that the driver's negligence was the sole cause of the accident. Plaintiff produced witnesses in rebuttal who gave evidence to show that the accident resulted from the negligent failure of defendant to give proper warning.\n In the course of its charge the court instructed the jury: (1) The plea of not guilty imposes on plaintiff the burden of proving that the damage was caused by alleged negligence of defendant; (2) 'our statute provides that a railroad company shall be liable for any damage done to stock or property of another by the running of locomotives or cars unless the company shall make it appear that their agents have exercised all ordinary and reasonable care and diligence,-the presumption in all cases being against the company'; (3) if defendant's employees and plaintiff's teamster were at fault, the plaintiff may recover the \n\n[287 U.S. 86, 88]\n\u00a0\n amount of his damages reduced in proportion to the contributory negligence of his servant; (4) if the evidence establishes that the damage alleged was caused by the running of the locomotive, plaintiff may recover, 'unless the defendant company shall make it appear by a preponderance of the evidence that its employees exercised all ordinary and reasonable care and diligence in the premises'; (5) the defendant submitted a request to charge which was by the court 'slightly modified' and given as follows: 'The presumption of negligence cast upon railroads by our statute in personal injury cases ceases when the railroad company has made it appear by a preponderance of the evidence that its agents have exercised all ordinary and reasonable care and diligence. In the presence of such proof by the railroad company the jury do not take any such presumption with them to the jury room in weighing the evidence and in coming to a determination. The statute does not create such a presumption as will outweigh proofs, or that will require any greater or stronger or more convincing proofs to remove it.' Defendant submitted two requests for instructions in respect of negligence on the part of the teamster, but the court refused to give them.\n The jury gave plaintiff a verdict for the amount of his damages, and the trial court entered judgment thereon. The Supreme Court sustained the finding of negligence on the part of the defendant, but held that the evidence established contributory negligence, and ordered that, unless plaintiff enter a remittitur for a specified sum, the judgment should be reversed and a new trial granted. The plaintiff made the reduction, and judgment was entered for the remainder.\n The Florida statute in question is the same as that of Georgia condemned by this court as so unreasonable and arbitrary as to be repugnant to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. It was not necessary to \n\n[287 U.S. 86, 89]\n\u00a0\n consider, and we did not decide, whether the statute also violated the equal protection clause. Western & Atl. R. Co. v. Henderson, \n279 \nU.S. 639\n, 49 S.Ct. 445, reversing 167 Ga. 22, 144 S.E. 905.\n Appellant failed in the trial court to assail the statute on any ground upon which rests our decision in the Henderson Case. In its motion for a new trial and in the assignment of errors submitted with its proposed bill of exceptions, it asserted as to each of the instructions numbered (2), (3), and (4) that the court erred in so charging, 'because the effect of said charge was to deprive the defendant of the equal protection of the law, contrary to the Constitution of the United States.' And it made the same objection to another charge which, so far as concerns questions before us, is not to be distinguished from instruction (4). Appellant has not included in the record its request which was by the court modified and given. It does not appear how the instruction differed from the request, and, as appellant has not complained of the modification or of the charge as given, the instruction is to be considered as not differing materially from the request and to have been acquiesced in and accepted by appellant. The record on which the case was taken to the state Supreme Court discloses no contention on the part of appellant that as construed at the trial the statute is unreasonable or arbitrary or that it operated as a denial of due process of law. But the opinion of that court states-whether inadvertently we need not consider-that some assignments of error question the constitutionality of the section as denying the defendant 'due process of law' and the equal protection of the laws. After reference to our decision in the Henderson Case and to Mobile, J. & K.C.R. R. v. Turnipseed, \n219 \nU.S. 35\n, 31 S.Ct. 136, 32 L.R.A.(N.S.) 226, Ann. Cas. 1912A, 463, the court said (137 So. 719, 723): 'All that the statute does in this state in creating a presumption is thereby to cast upon the railroad company the burden of affirmatively showing that its agents exercised all ordinary and reason- \n\n[287 U.S. 86, 90]\n\u00a0\n able care and diligence, and here the statutory presumption ends.' Held that the trial court 'properly instructed the jury with regard to the presumption in this case,' and overruled appellant's contention that the statute is unconstitutional because it does not apply to busses as well as to railroads.\n The errors assigned and urged here amount to no more than that as construed the section operated to deny appellant equal protection because it required appellant to carry throughout the trial a burden not put upon motor carriers for hire or other litigants, and that the refusal of the trial court to give to the jury the requested instructions in respect of negligence on the part of the teamster deprived appellant of the equal protection of the laws.\n In view of numerous decisions of this court sustaining legislative classifications for various purposes and declaring the principles upon which their constitutional validity depends, it does not require any discussion to show that the mere discrimination resulting from the application of the presumption created by section 7051 to appellant and other railroad companies and the failure of the state to prescribe the same or a like rule in similar actions against carriers by motor for hire or other litigants does not violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Appellant's contention to the contrary is without substance. Missouri Pacific Railway Co. v. Humes, \n115 \nU.S. 512, 522\n, 6 S. Ct. 110; Missouri Railway Co. v. Mackey, \n127 \nU.S. 205, 209\n, 8 S.Ct. 1161; Chicago, K. & W. Railroad Co. v. Pontius, \n157 \nU.S. 209, 210\n, 15 S.Ct. 585; St. Louis & San Francisco Ry. v.

Corrigan, \n257 \nU.S. 312, 337\n, 42 S.Ct. 124, 27 A.L.R. 375.\n The assignments of error accompanying this appeal contain a single reference to due process. It is in a speci- \n\n[287 U.S. 86, 91]\n\u00a0\n fication which merely asserts that the state Supreme Court 'erred in holding that the scope and effect of section 7051 ... did not in the trial of this case in the Court below deprive the ... Railway Company ... of its property without due process of law and of the equal protection of the law as guaranteed to it' by section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n It is essential to a proper presentation of points relied on for reversal that the statute and rules of court requiring and governing the forms of assignments of errors be complied with. Every appeal must be accompanied by an assignment of errors which shall 'set out separately and particularly each error asserted.' R.S.  997, 28 U.S.C.  862 (28 USCA  862); Supreme Court Rule 9 (28 USCA  354). The purpose is to enable the court, as well as opposing counsel, readily to perceive what points are relied on. The substitution of vague and general statement for the prescribed particularity sets the rule at naught. Phillips, etc., Const. Co. v. Seymour, \n91 U.S. 646\n, 648; Briscoe v. Dist. of Columbia, \n221 U.S. 547\n, 549-550, 31 S.Ct. 679. And, as the rule makes for convenience and certainty in the consideration of cases, the court may, and generally it will, disregard a specification that is so uncertain or otherwise deficient as not substantially to comply with the rule, even if the opposing party raises no question and treats it as adequate. The quoted assignment amounts merely to a complaint that the Supreme Court erred in not reversing the judgment of the trial court because 'in the trial of this case' the 'scope and effect' of the section deprived appellant of its property in violation of both the due process and equal protection clauses. An allegation of error could scarcely be more indefinite. It does not identify any ruling at the trial or specify any basis for the assertion of deprivation of constitutional right. It presents no question for our consideration. \n\n[287 U.S. 86, 92]\n\u00a0\n The assignments of error based upon the court's failure to instruct the jury concerning contributory negligence of plaintiff's teamster in accordance with defendant's requests present no question for decision here. The record discloses no foundation for the claim that the refusal so to charge was, as appellant asserts, 'because of the statute.' It does not appear that the trial court regarded the statute as having any relation to the precaution or care required of plaintiff's driver when approaching the crossing. The claim that such refusals transgressed the constitutional rule of equality is utterly without foundation.\n No substantial constitutional question being presented, the appeal will be dismissed.

Kansas, \n278 \nU.S. 191\n, 49 S.Ct. 160.\n It is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","126":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSGRO v. U S(1932)\nNo. 55\nArgued: October 10, 1932Decided: December 5, 1932\n\n\n\n Mr. Irving K. Baxter, of Utica, N.Y., for petitioner. \n\n[287 U.S. 206, 207]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. G. A.Youngquist, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n\n\n[287 U.S. 206, 208]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner was charged with violating the National Prohibition Act (27 USCA) by possessing and selling intoxicating liquor at the Bouckville Hotel. The District Court denied his request to restrain the use of evidence procured by federal officers while searching the hotel under a warrant alleged to be invalid. This evidence was introduced at the trial over his objection. He was found guilty and the judgment against him was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 54 F.(2d) 1083. This Court granted certiorari. \n286 \nU.S. 539\n, 52 S.Ct. 645. The only question presented is as to the validity of the warrant.\n Subject to petitioner's contention, the parties entered into a stipulation of facts which so far as pertinent to the question is as follows: 'That on or about the sixth day of July, 1926, William Arthur, United States Commissioner, at Rome, New York, issued a search warrant based upon an affidavit introduced in evidence in this case, of C. G. Dodd, in which Dodd swore that he made a purchase of beer of the defendant; that on the twenty-seventh day of July, 1926, the said search warrant not having been executed in the interim and ten days from the date of the search warrant having expired, the search warrant was taken by the prohibition agents to whom it was directed back to the commissioner and by him or by someone in his office under his direction and control, the date of the search warrant was changed from July sixth to July twenty-seventh, 1926, and thus reissued; that acting under the color of such search warrant,' the search in question was made. \n\n[287 U.S. 206, 209]\n\u00a0\n The record also contains a certificate by the United States Commissioner, under date of December 20, 1926, as follows: 'I hereby certify that the complaint or affidavit, upon which the search warrant was issued in the above entitled matter was made before me on the 6th day of July, 1926. That the search warrant was issued on or about said 6th day of July, 1926, but was not executed within the ten days prescribed by statute, and was returned to me by Albert Vandiver, Prohibition Agent in Charge of the Syracuse office requesting that same be reissued or redated, and my docket book shows that same was reissued on the 27th day of July, 1926, and mailed back to said Vandiver.'\n The National Prohibition Act, tit. 2,  25, 41 Stat. 305, 315, U.S.C., tit. 27,  39 (27 USCA  39), authorizes the issue of warrants to search for intoxicating liquors as provided in title 11 of the Act of June 15, 1917, 40 Stat. 228.1 Section 11 of the last-mentioned Act (18 USCA  621) has the following requirement: \n\n[287 U.S. 206, 210]\n\u00a0\n 'Sec. 11. A search warrant must be executed and returned to the judge or commissioner who issued it within ten days after its date; after the expiration of this time the warrant, unless executed, is void.'\n As the original warrant was issued on July 6th and was not executed within ten days, it became void under this explicit provision. But the Government contends that the warrant could be redated and reissued, and that in this form it should be regarded as a new warrant under which the search could lawfully be made.\n With this argument we cannot agree. The proceeding by search warrant is a drastic one. Its abuse led to the adoption of the Fourth Amendment, and this, together with legislation regulating the process, should be liberally construed in favor of the individual. Boyd v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 616, 635\n, 6 S.Ct. 524; Byars v. United States, \n273 \nU.S. 28, 32\n, 47 S.Ct. 248; Marron v. United States, \n275 \nU.S. 192, 196\n, 197 S., 48 S.Ct. 74; United States v. Lefkowitz, \n285 \nU.S. 452, 464\n, 52 S.Ct. 420. The statute requires that the judge or commissioner issuing a search warrant for intoxicating liquors must be satisfied 'of the existence of the grounds of the application or that there is probable cause to believe their existence.' Act of June 15, 1917, tit. 11,  6 (18 USCA  616). He must take proof to that end. Id.,  4, 5 ( 8 USCA  614, 615). The warrant must state 'the particular grounds or probable cause for its issue and the names of the persons whose affidavits have been taken in support thereof.' Id.,  6. While the statute does not fix the time within which proof of probable cause must be taken by the jduge or commissioner, it is manifest that the proof must be of facts so closely related to the time of the issue of the warrant as to justify a finding of probable cause at that time. Whether the proof meets this test \n\n[287 U.S. 206, 211]\n\u00a0\n must be determined by the circumstances of each case. It is in the light of the requirement that probable cause must properly appear when the warrant issues that we must read the provision which in explicit terms makes a warrant void unless executed within ten days after its date. That period marks the permitted duration of the proceeding in which the warrant is issued. There is no provision which authorizes the commissioner to extend its life or to revive it.\n The issue of a second warrant is essentially a new proceeding which must have adequate support. The fact that it is a second warrant gives the commissioner no privilege to dispense with the statutory conditions. These cannot be escaped by describing the action as a reissue. If the warrant is the old one, sought to be revived, the proceeding is a nullity, and if it is a new warrant, the commissioner must act accordingly. The statute in terms requires him before issuing the warrant to take proof of probable cause. This he must do by examining on oath the complainant and his witness and requiring their affidavits or depositions. The proof supplied must have appropriate relation to the application for the new warrant and must speak as of the time of the issue of that warrant. The commissioner has no authority to rely on affidavits which have sole relation to a different time and have not been brought down to date or supplemented so that they can be deemed to disclose grounds existing when the new warrant is issued. The new warrant must rest upon a proper finding and statement by the commissioner that probable cause then exists. That determination, as of that time, cannot be left to mere inference or conjecture. The purpose of the statute would be thwarted if by the simple expedient of redating, without more, the time for the execution of a warrant could be extended. \n\n[287 U.S. 206, 212]\n\u00a0\n Applying these principles to the instant case, the warrant cannot be sustained. The proceeding for the warrant issued on July sixth had terminated and that warrant was dead. On the new application of July twenty-seventh the commissioner took no proof to show that probable cause then existed and he made no finding of probable cause at that time. It is impossible by any process of reasoning to obscure or alter what he actually did. He simply changed the date of the old warrant and it was 'thus reissued.' Such action was unauthorized.\n Judgment reversed.\n Mr. Justice STONE and Mr. Justice CARDOZO think that the Commissioner, by redating the warrant, in effect, issued a new warrant, which was adequately supported by facts disclosed in the affidavit, then before him, on which the first warrant had been issued.\n\n The separate opinion of Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS.\n I concur in the conclusion that the judgment below should be reversed.\n An information charged that Petitioner Sgro had violated the National Prohibition Act (27 USCA) by keeping intoxicating liquor at an hotel. In due time and manner he unsuccessfully asked the District Court to prohibit the use of all evidence procured by federal officers while searching the hotel under color of a warrant alleged to be invalid. At the trial this evidence was introduced over his objection. A verdict of guilty followed; judgment thereon was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. If the challenged search warrant was invalid, this judgment must be reversed.\n By stipulation it appears: 'That on or about the sixth day of July, 1926, William Arthur, United States Commissioner, at Rome, New York, issued a search warrant based upon an affidavit introduced in evidence in this case, of C. G. Dodd, in which Dodd \n\n[287 U.S. 206, 213]\n\u00a0\n swore that he made a purchase of beer of the defendant; that on the twenty- seventh day of July, 1926, the said search warrant not having been executed in the interim and ten days from the date of the search warrant having expired, the search warrant was taken by the prohibition agents to whom it was directed back to the commissioner any by him, or by someone in his office under his direction and control, the date of the search warrant was changed from July sixth to July twenty-seventh, 1926, and thus reissued; that acting under the color of such search warrant, Prohibition Agents Henry E. March, Bernard J. Dwyer and B. G. Silvermail went to the premises described in the search warrant, namely the Bouckville Hotel, of which the defendant is the proprietor, at Bouckville, New York, in the Northern District of New York, and there, the defendant being present, searched the premises and found one pint of gin, a pint of beer in the bar room of the said premises, and also found in the cellar of said premises under said bar room three and a half barrels of liquid ....'\n The Fourth Amendment provides: 'The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.'\n The National Prohibition Act, tit. 2,  25, 41 Stat. 305, 315, 27 USCA  39, authorizes the issuance of warrants to search for intoxicating liquors under the circumstances specified by title 11, Public Laws No. 24, 65th Congress (Espionage Act), approved June 15, 1917, 40 Stat. 228 (18 USCA  98, 611-631, 633). The following are among the provisions of the latter act:\n'Sec. 2. A search warrant may be issued under this chapter upon either of the following grounds: ... \n\n[287 U.S. 206, 214]\n\u00a0\n\n'3. When the property, or any paper, is possessed, controlled, or used in violation of section 98 (twenty-two) of this title; in which case it may be taken on the warrant from the person violating said section, or from any person in whose possession it may be, or from any house or other place in which it is concealed.\n\n\n'Sec. 3. A search warrant can not be issued but upon probable cause, supported by affidavit, naming or describing the person and particularly describing the property and the place to be searched.\n\n'Sec. 4. The judge or commissioner must, before issuing the warrant, examine on oath the complainant and any witness he may produce, and require their affidavits or take their depositions in writing and cause them to be subscribed by the parties making them.\n\n'Sec. 5. The affidavits or depositions must set forth the facts tending to establish the grounds of the application or probable cause for believing that they exist.\n\n'Sec. 6. If the judge or commissioner is thereupon satisfied of the existence of the grounds of the application or that there is probable cause to believe their existence, he must issue a search warrant, signed by him with his name of office, to a civil officer of the United States duly authorized to enforce or assist in enforcing any law thereof, or to a person so duly authorized by the President of the United States, stating the particular grounds or probable cause for its issue and the names of the persons whose affidavits have been taken in support thereof, and commanding him forthwith to search the person or place named, for the property specified, and to bring it before the judge or commissioner.'\n\n'Sec. 11. A search warrant must be executed and returned to the judge or commissioner who issued it within ten days after its date; after the expiration of this time the warrant, unless executed, is void.' (18 USCA  612-616, 621.) \n\n[287 U.S. 206, 215]\n\u00a0\n Counsel for the United States submit that while under the Espionage Act (section 11) a search warrant not executed within ten days becomes invalid, the statute does not inhibit utilization of an outlawed warrant as a mere form or blank when preparing a new one based upon the original affidavit; that here the act of the Commissioner in changing the date upon the July 6th warrant and then reissuing it under date of July 27th was to all intents and purposes the issuing of an entirely new and valid warrant supported by the Dodd affidavit of July 6th. This argument is pertinent and should be answered.\n\n It fairly may be assumed that the Commissioner who issued the warrant on July 27th relied upon the original (July 6th) affidavit which remained before him; and if this was permissible, the new warrant, of course, was good-just as good as if no earlier one had been issued upon the same affidavit. But if the original affidavit had become stale by the passage of time, then the new warrant lacked adequate support and was invalid. Manifestly, it is important that there should be some definite rule by which to determine when such an affidavit is impotent; otherwise, the matter is left at large-dependent upon varying views of reasonableness.\n The proceeding by search warrant is a drastic one. Its abuse led to the adoption of the Fourth Amendment, and this, together with legislation regulating such process, should be liberally construed in favor of the individual. Boyd v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 616, 635\n, 6 S.Ct. 524; Adams v. New York, \n192 \nU.S. 585\n, 24 S.Ct. 372; Byars v. United States, \n273 \nU.S. 28\n, 47 S.Ct. 248; Marron v. United States, \n275 \nU.S. 192, 196\n, 197 S., 48 S.Ct. 74.\n The statutes require that a warrant to search for intoxicating liquors shall rest upon duly established probable cause to believe that at the time it issues the liquor is unlawfully possessed. The supporting affidavit must re- \n\n[287 U.S. 206, 216]\n\u00a0\n late to facts which tend to show an unlawful situation actually or probably existing at the moment. Section 11, tit. 11, Espionage Act, declares that after ten days a warrant not fully executed shall be void. That is the prescribed period during which the circumstances existing when it issued can be supposed to continue.\n Considering the whole statute, and especially the evident purpose of Congress to protect against unnecessary delays and uncertainties, I think no search warrant should issue upon an affidavit more than ten days old. After attaining that age statements therein cannot properly indicate presently existing conditions. In practice the contrary view would permit results which the prescribed ten days' limitation was intended to prevent. The disclosed unlawful situation is not presumed to continue more than ten days after a warrant issues and it seems entirely reasonable to conclude that Congress did not intend to sanction a less rigid limitation upon the supporting affidavit.\n It follows that the Commissioner's warrant of July 27th was invalid, even if it be assumed that he then actually relied upon the original supporting affidavit dated three weeks earlier.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The following are among the provisions of the Act of June 15, 1917, tit. 11, 40 Stat. 228:\n'Sec. 3.

WILGUS(1932)\nNo. 40\nArgued: November 10, 1932Decided: December 5, 1932\n\n\n\n\n[287 U.S. 348, 349]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Jacob Weinstein, of Philadelphia, Pa. (Francis Biddle, of Philadelphia, Pa., on the brief), for petitioner.\n Mr. Sidney E. Smith, of Philadelphia, Pa., for respondents.\n\n\n\n[287 U.S. 348, 351]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner, a judgment creditor of Herbert P. Robinson, made application in due form to a United States \n\n[287 U.S. 348, 352]\n\u00a0\n District Court in Pennsylvania praying that leave be granted him to levy an execution upon property in the possession of receivers appointed by that court. An order refusing such leave was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 55 F.(2d) 234. The case is here on certiorari. \n286 \nU.S. 538\n, 52 S.Ct. 580\n\n\n From the record and the admissions of counsel, these facts appear: Herbert P. Robinson was engaged in business in Philadelphia as a dealer in lumber. He was unable to pay his debts as they matured, but he believed that he would be able to pay them in full if his creditors were lenient. Indeed he looked for a surplus of $100,000 if the business went on under the fostering care of a receiver. Most of the creditors were willing to give him time. Two creditors, including the petitioner, were unwilling, and threatened immediate suit. Thus pressed, the debtor cast about for a device whereby the business might go on and the importunate be held at bay. He had to reckon with obstructions erected by the local law. The law of Pennsylvania does not permit the appointment of a receiver for a business conducted by an individual as distinguished from one conducted by a corporation or a partnership. Hogsett v. Thompson, 258 Pa. 85, 101 A. 941. To make such remedies available, there was need to take the title out of Robinson and put it somewhere else. The act responded to the need. On January 9, 1931, the debtor brought about the formation of a Delaware corporation, the Miller Robinson Company. On the same day he made a conveyance to this company of all his property, real and personal, receiving in return substantially all the shares of stock and a covenant by the grantee to assume the payment of the debts. Three days later, on January 12, 1931, in conjunction with a simple contract creditor, he brought suit against the Delaware corporation in the federal court, invoking the jurisdiction of that court on the ground of diversity of \n\n[287 U.S. 348, 353]\n\u00a0\n citizenship. The bill of complaint alleged that creditors were pressing for immediate payment; that one had entered suit and was about to proceed to judgment; that the levy of attachments and executions would ruin the good will and dissipate the assets; and that the business, if protected from the suits of creditors and continued without disturbance could be made to pay the debts and yield a surplus of $100,000 for the benefit of stockholders. To accomplish these ends, there was a prayer for the appointment of receivers with an accompanying injunction. The corporation filed an answer admitting all the averments of the bill and joining in the prayer. A decree, entered the same day, appointed receivers as prayed for in the complaint, and enjoined attachments and executions unless permitted by the court. Four days thereafter, on January 16, 1931, the petitioner began suit against Robinson in the court of common pleas, and on February 4, 1931, recovered a judgment against his debtor for $1,007.65 upon a cause of action for money loaned. On February 26, 1931, he submitted a petition to the United State District Court in which he charged that the conveyance from Robinson to the corporation and the ensuing receivership were parts of a single scheme to hinder and delay creditors in their lawful suits and remedies, and he prayed that he be permitted to issue a writ of fieri facias against the chattels in the possession of the receivers and to sell them so far as necessary for the satisfaction of his judgment. The petition was denied, and the denial affirmed upon appeal.\n The conveyance and the receivership are fraudulent in law as against nonassenting creditors. They have the unity of a common plan, each stage of the transaction drawing color and significance from the quality of the other; but, for convenience, they will be considered in order of time as if they stood apart. The sole purpose of the conveyance was to divest the debtor of his title and \n\n[287 U.S. 348, 354]\n\u00a0\n put it in such a form and place that levies would be averted. The petition to issue execution and the answer by the receivers leave the purpose hardly doubtful. Whatever fragment of doubt might otherwise be left is dispelled by the admissions of counsel on the argument before us. One cannot read the opinion of the Court of Appeals without seeing very clearly that like admissions must have been made upon the argument there. After a recital of the facts, the court stated, in substance, that the aim of the debtor was to prevent the disruption of the business at the suit of hostile creditors and to cause the assets to be nursed for the benefit of all concerned. Perceiving that aim and indeed even declaring it, the court did not condemn it, but found it fair and lawful. In this approval of a purpose which has been condemned in Anglo-American law since the Statute of Elizabeth (13 Fliz. c. 5), there is a misconception of the privileges and liberties vouchsafed to an embarrassed debtor. A conveyance is illegal if made with an intent to defraud the creditors of the grantor, but equally it is illegal if made with an intent to hinder and delay them. Many an embarrassed debtor holds the genuine belief that, if suits can be staved off for a season, he will weather a financial storm, and pay his debts in full. Means v. Dowd, \n128 \nU.S. 273, 281\n, 9 S.Ct. 65. The belief even though well founded, does not clothe him with a privilege to build up obstructions that will hold his creditors at bay. This is true in Pennsylvania under the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, which became a law in that state in 1921. Purdon's Pennsylvania Digest (Statutes), title 39,  357 (39 PS  357). It is true under the Statute of Elizabeth ( 13 Eliz. c. 5), which, in any case not covered by the later act, is still the governing rule. Purdon's Pennsylvania Digest (Statutes), title 39,  361 (39 PS  361); McKibbin v. Martin, 64 Pa. 352, 356, 3 Am.Rep. 588; Stern's Appeal, 64 Pa. 447, 450. Tested by either act, this conveyance may not stand. Hogsett v. Thompson, supra; Mont \n\n[287 U.S. 348, 355]\n\u00a0\n gomery Web Co. v. Dienelt, 133 Pa. 585, 19 A. 428, 19 Am.St.Rep. 663; Atlas Portland Cement Co. v. American Brick & Clay Co., 280 Pa. 449, 124 A. 650; In re Elletson Co.

McKinnon Dash & Hardware Co., 165 N.Y. 78, 58 N.E. 773, 80 Am.St.Rep. 708; Means v. Dowd, supra.\n The conveyance to the corporation being voidable because fraudulent in law, the receivership must share its fate. It was part and parcel of a scheme whereby the form of a judicial remedy was to supply a protective cover for a fraudulent design. Harkin v. Brundage, \n276 \nU.S. 36\n, 48 S.Ct. 268; Decker v. Decker, 108 N.Y. 128, 135, 15 N.E. 307. The design would have been ineffective if the debtor had been suffered to keep the business for himself. Hogsett v. Thompson, supra. It did not gain validity when he transferred the business to another with a capacity for obstruction believed to be greater than his own. The end and aim of this receivership was not to administer the assets of a corporation legitimately conceived for a normal business purpose and functioning or designed to function according to normal business methods. What was in view was very different. A corporation created three days before the suit for the very purpose of being sued was to be interposed between its author and the creditors pursuing him, with a restraining order of the court to give check to the pursuers. We do not need to determine what remedies are available for the conservation of the assets when a corporation has been brought into existence to serve legitimate and normal ends. Ordinarily a creditor who seeks the appointment of receivers must reduce his claim to judgment and exhaust his remedy at law. The Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act may have relaxed that requirement in many of the states (Purdon's Pennsylvania Digest (Statutes) title 39,  351, 359, 360 (39 PS  351, 359, 360); cf. New York Debtor and Creditor Law, article 10 (section 270 et seq.), Consol. Laws, c. 12; American Surety Co. \n\n[287 U.S. 348, 356]\n\u00a0\n v. Conner, 251 N.Y. 1, 166 N.E. 783, 65 A.L.R. 244), but the rule in the federal courts remains what it has always been (Pusey & Jones Co. v. Hanssen, \n261 \nU.S. 491, 497\n, 43 S.Ct. 454; Scott v. Neely, \n140 \nU.S. 106\n, 11 S.Ct. 712; Hollins v. Brierfield Coal & Iron Co., \n150 \nU.S. 371, 379\n, 14 S.Ct. 127; Matthews v. Rodgers, \n284 \nU.S. 521, 529\n, 52 S.Ct. 217). True indeed it is that receiveral have at times been appointed even by federal courts at the suit of simple contract creditors if the defendant was willing to waive the irregularity and to consent to the decree. This is done not infrequently where the defendant is a public service corporation and the unbroken performance of its services is in furtherance of the public good. In re Metropolitan Railway Receivership, \n208 \nU.S. 109, 111\n, 28 S.Ct. 219. It has been done at times, though the public good was not involved, where legitimate private interests might otherwise have suffered harm. United States v. Butterworth-Judson Corp., \n269 \nU.S. 504, 513\n, 46 S. Ct. 179; Kingsport Press v. Brief English Systems (C.C.A.) 54 F.(2d) 497, 500; Harkin v. Brundage, supra, \n276 \nU.S. 52\n, 48 S.Ct. 268. We have given warning more than once, however, that the remedy in such circumstances is not to be granted loosely, but is to be watched with jealous eyes. Michigan v. Michigan Trust Co., \n286 \nU.S. 334, 345\n, 52 S.Ct. 512; Harkin v. Brundage, supra. Never is such a remedy available when it is a mere weapon of coercion, a means for the frustration of the public policy of the state or the locality. It is one thing for a creditor with claims against a corporation that is legitimately his debtor to invoke the aid of equity to conserve the common fund for the benefit of himself and of the creditors at large. Hollins v. Brierfield Coal & Iron Co., \n150 \nU.S. 371, 380\n, 14 S.Ct. 127. Whatever hindrance and delay of suitors is involved in such a remedy may then be incidental and subsidiary. It is another thing for a debtor, co- operating with friendly creditors, to bring the corporation into being with the hindrance and delay of suitors the very aim of its existence. The power to intervene before the legal \n\n[287 U.S. 348, 357]\n\u00a0\n remedy is exhausted is misused when it is exercised in aid of such a purpose. Only exemplary motives and scrupulous good faith will wake it into action.\n The receivership decree assailed upon this record does not answer to that test. We have no thought in so holding to impute to counsel for the debtor or even to his client a willingness to participate in conduct known to be fraudulent. The candor with which the plan has been unfolded goes far to satisfy us, without more, that they acted in the genuine belief that what they planned was fair and lawful. Genuine the belief was, but mistaken it was also. Conduct and purpose have a quality imprinted on them by the law.\n There remains a question of procedure. The prayer of the petitioner was that he be permitted to issue execution upon his judgment in the state court. Cf. Wiswall v. Sampson, 14 How. 52. If there had been any substantial doubt that the conveyance and the receivership were voidable obstructions, the federal court might have refused to permit the tangle to be unraveled in the courts of the state. It might have retained the controversy in its own grasp and made a decision for itself. But in truth there was no substantial doubt as to the quality of conveyance and receivership, no genuine issue to be tried. In such circumstances the petitioner was entitled to an order in the alternative either for the payment of his judgment out of the assets in the hands of the receivers or in default thereof for leave to issue execution. The refusal to grant relief in one or other of these forms is a departure from the bounds of any legitimate discretion which is not without redress.\n The decree is reversed, and the cause remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","128":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSHEARER v. BURNET(1932)\nNo. 469\nArgued: Decided: March 14, 1932\n\n\n\n\n[285 U.S. 228, 229]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. McCready Sykes, of New York City, and Charles Henry Butler, of Washington, D. C., for petitioners.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Whitney North Seymour, of Washington, D. C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioners in these cases, members of a law partnership, filed their individual tax returns for the calendar year 1924. The partnership books were kept on the basis of a fiscal year and the partnership information return, filed in 1924, was for the fiscal year ending April 30th of that year. As required by section 218(a) of the Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. 253, 275, 26 USCA  959(a), the petitioners included in their individual returns their respective shares of the partnership profits for the partnership year ending in 1924. They thus returned, as 1924 income, partnership profits attributable to eight months of the previous year. \n\n[285 U.S. 228, 230]\n\u00a0\n In assessing the tax, the Commissioner rejected their claim that, under the provisions of title 12 of the Revenue Act of 1924 (43 Stat. 353), they were entitled to a reduction of 25 per cent. of the tax at 1923 rates on that portion of their respective shares of the partnership income attributable to the eight months of the partnership year, which fell in the calendar year 1923, and found deficiencies accordingly. The orders of the Board of Tax Appeals sustaining the action of the Commissioner, 18 B. T. A. 393, were affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 52 F.(2d) 17. This Court granted certiorari, \n284 \nU.S. 612\n, 52 S. Ct. 130, 76 L. Ed. -, to resolve a conflict between the decision below and that of the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, in White v. Maddison, 45 F.(2d) 335.\n The provisions of title 12 of the Revenue Act of 1924 embody a comprehensive scheme for relieving taxpayers from the burdens of the higher rates applicable to 1923 income under the 1921 Act (42 Stat. 227). The 1924 Act reduced the rates, but became a law too late in the year to make them readily applicable to income earned in the previous year. Instead, it adopted the less scientific, but more convenient, plan of a level reduction of 25 per cent. of the tax. In making it, Congress was careful to limit the reduction to taxes on income returned for 1923. The applicable provisions are found in sections 1200(a) and 1201(a) and (b) of the 1924 Act. \n1\n Section 1200(a) authorized the allowance to tax \n\n[285 U.S. 228, 231]\n\u00a0\n payers making a return of income for the calendar year 1923. Section 1201( a) and (b) granted it to taxpayers returning income for a fiscal year beginning or ending in 1923, but only with respect to the tax on so much of the income returned as was attributable to income earned in the calendar year 1923\n\n\n Petitioners' claims for the allowance plainly are not comprehended by the language of either section. They made their returns on the calendar year basis, and were entitled to, and presumably received, the allowance authorized by section 1200(a) upon the tax on income returned for the calendar year 1923. But this section does not authorize any reduction of the tax upon income returned for the calendar year 1924, as was that of petitioners. Section 1201(a) and (b) applies only to taxpayers returning income for a fiscal year beginning or ending in 1923. The petitioners, who made no such returns, were thus excluded from the benefits of the 25 per cent. reduction of the tax on any part of their income returned for the calendar year 1924 by the unambiguous language of these sections. See Crooks v. Harrelson, \n282 \nU.S. 55, 60\n, 61 S., 51 S. Ct. 49. $ They argue that the provisions of these sections applicable to income returned for 1923, evidence a general purpose to allow the reduction of tax upon any income attributable to that year. Hence, despite the language of section 1201(b) restricting its benefits to those returning income for taxation for some part of the year 1923, they insist that it should be deemed to extend to taxes on partnership income attributable to 1923, although in \n\n[285 U.S. 228, 232]\n\u00a0\n fact income in 1924, and returned by the taxpayers as such in their 1924 returns.\n Even if there were room for construction of the words of the statute, it is impossible to discern any such general purpose underlying the 1924 Act as would support petitioners' contention. There are two insuperable obstacles to the contruction urged. The first is the necessary effect of section 1200(a) when applied to returns of taxpayers for the calendar year 1923. That section authorizes a reduction of 25 per cent. of the taxes for 1923 upon all income, including that derived from partnerships having a fiscal year beginning in 1922 and ending in 1923. Thus applied, it allows 25 per cent. reduction of petitioners' 1923 tax, including that upon their partnership income, attributable to eight months of 1922. If, as they insist, section 1201(b) is to be construed as permitting a like reduction of the 1924 tax on partnership income attributable to the last eight months of the calendar year 1923, which overlapped the partnership year ending in 1924, petitioners, despite the careful limitation of the reduction to taxes upon income for a single year, would be entitled to a reduction of the tax on partnership income for a period of more than a year, in this case twenty months, eight months of 1922 and the full twelve months of 1923.\n A second objection to the suggested construction of section 1201(b) is that if the reduction, for which it provides, were extended to the tax involved here, it would not necessarily result in a return of 25 per cent. of the tax assessed, as is the obvious purpose of the section. Section 1201(a) and (b) allows the 25 per cent. reduction on that proportion of the tax for the entire year, computed at 1923 rates, which the period of the fiscal year falling within the calendar year 1923 bears to the entire taxable year. As this is the same basis on which the tax is computed, under section 207(a) of the 1924 Act, where the taxable year begins in 1923 and \n\n[285 U.S. 228, 233]\n\u00a0\n ends in 1924, the reduction is exactly 25 per cent. of the tax assessed.\n A different method of computing the tax on a distributive share of partnership income for a partnership fiscal year beginning in 1923 and ending in 1924, is prescribed by section 207(b) of the 1924 Act, 26 USCA  938(a). Under that section the tax computed for the fiscal year at 1923 rates is not, as under section 207(a), apportioned to the number of months of the fiscal year which fall in the calendar year 1923. Instead, section 207(b) applies the 1923 schedule of rates to the income apportioned to 1923, and the 1924 schedule to the income apportioned to 1924. And for purposes of the surtax it places the income from the partnership subject to the 1924 rates in the lower brackets and the income subject to the 1923 rates in the higher brackets.\n The difference in method of calculating the tax on the two classes of income may produce different amounts of tax on the same amount of income. The tax computed under section 207(a) upon income of an individual taxpayer attributable to the first eight months of a fiscal year ending April 30, 1924, would be exactly two-thirds of the total tax, and it is to the two-thirds of this total to which the 25 per cent. reduction is applied by section 1201(b). If applicable to the present case, the reduction would likewise be allowed on two-thirds of the tax for the entire year at 1923 rates. But the tax calculated under section 207(b), on income derived from the partnership, for the same eight months of 1923, would be more than two-thirds of the total tax for the year, because of the higher rate of surtax applicable to the income attributed to 1923 than to the income apportioned to 1924.\n The reduction of the tax calculated as prescribed by section 1201(b) would accordingly not be 25 per cent. of the tax. The section, if construed to extend the reduction to a tax computed as was the petitioners', would thus depart from the \n\n[285 U.S. 228, 234]\n\u00a0\n obvious purpose and definite scheme of the 1924 Act to return uniformly to taxpayers 25 per cent. of the tax on income of a single year. Undoubtedly Congress might have included the tax on this income of petitioners in its scheme for refunding taxes. Its failure to do so is doubtless a consequence of the fact already noted that it did make provision for reduction of the like tax on the income for the corresponding months of 1922.\n Assuming that petitioners can invoke the protection of the Fifth Amendment to secure an equable share of a credit or refund of a tax after it assessment, we can discern in this statute no want of due process of law. The petitioners are within a defined class which Congress clearly had power to select for purposes of a tax refund. See La Belle Iron Works v. United States, \n256 \nU.S. 377, 392\n, 41 S. Ct. 528; Billings v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 261, 282\n, 34 S. Ct. 421; Barclay & Co. v. Edwards, \n267 \nU.S. 442, 450\n, 45 S. Ct. 135, 348.

WOODBINE SAV. BANK OF WOODBINE, IOWA(1932)\nNo. 158\nArgued: Decided: April 11, 1932\n\n\n\n\n\n[285 U.S. 467, 468]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Harold B. Claypool and W. E. Wallace, both of Williamsburg, Iowa, and James M. Parsons, of Des Moines, Iowa, for appellant.\n\n\n\n[285 U.S. 467, 470]\n\u00a0\n Mr. J. A. Murray, of Logan, Iowa, for appellee.\n Mr. Earl F. Wisdom, of Des Moines, Iowa, for Andrew, Superintendent of Banking of State of Iowa, amicus curiae, by special leave of court.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellee, an Iowa banking corporation, brought suit in the courts of that state to enforce the personal liability of appellant, its stockholder, for an assessment made under the Iowa statutes, which provide for the restoration of any impairment of capital of a bank, by assessment pro rata of the stockholders. The case comes here on appeal, Jud. Code  237 (28 USCA  344), from a judgment of the Iowa Supreme Court sustaining the assessment and upholding the statute, which is assailed as infringing the contract and due process clauses of the Federal Constitution (article 1,  10; Amend. 14). 236 N. W. 10.\n On different dates between 1891 and 1917, appellant acquired twenty- six shares of the capital stock of the appellee. Appellee, originally incorporated in 1891, was reincorporated in 1911, appellant acquiring a like number of shares in the new corporation. At that time the liability to assessment of the stockholders in the bank was controlled by sections 1878, 1879, and 1880 of the 1897 Iowa Code, now appearing as sections 9246- 9248, 9249, 9250 of the 1927 Iowa Code. These sections authorize the superintendent of banks to require any impairment of capital of a state bank to be restored by an assessment upon its stockholders, as directed by an appropriate order of the superintendent, 'fixing the amount of the assessment.' Section 9247 imposes on the directors a duty to cause the deficiency in capital, thus determined, to be made good 'by a ratable \n\n[285 U.S. 467, 471]\n\u00a0\n assessment upon the stockholders for the amount of stock held by them,' and requires the proper officers of the bank to give written notice of the assessment, addressed to the several stockholders, which 'shall state the entire sum to be raised, and the amount due from the addressed stockholder.' Section 9248 provides:\n'Should any stockholder neglect or refuse to pay his assessment within ninety days from the date of mailing notice thereof, the board of directors shall cause a sufficient amount of the capital stock held by such stockholder to be sold at public auction to make good the deficiency, after giving ten days' notice thereof by personal service or by posting the same in the bank, and publishing it in some newspaper of the county in which the bank is located, which notice shall recite the assessment made, the amount due thereunder from the stockholder, and the time and place of sale; proof of all which may be made in the manner provided in the preceding section.'\n\n After appellant had acquired his stock, a new section was added by the Act of March 13, 1925, c. 181, Iowa Laws 1925, now  9248-a1 of the 1927 Iowa Code, reading as follows:\n'Should the proceeds of a sale under the preceding section of all the stock of any stockholder be insufficient to satisfy his entire assessment liability he shall be personally liable for the deficiency, which may be collected by suit brought in the name of the bank against such stockholder.'\n\n Following the adoption of this later section, the superintendent of banks determined that appellee's capital had been impaired 100 per cent., and directed an assessment accordingly. Acting under section 9248, appellee's directors sold appellant's stock for $1 a share, and the present suit was brought to recover the deficiency.\n In answer to the objection that the act of 1925 subjected appellant to an unconstitutional burden, appellee \n\n[285 U.S. 467, 472]\n\u00a0\n relies on the statutes antedating appellant's acquisition of his stock, as imposing on him personal liability to pay the assessment, without the aid of the quoted provision of the later act. It also argues that, even if there was no such liability under the earlier statutes, the adoption of the act of 1925 was but an exercise of the power reserved to the Legislature by section 12, art. 8 of the Iowa Constitution, and by section 1619 of the 1897 Iowa Code (section 1090, Iowa Code of 1873), providing that 'the articles of incorporation, by-laws, rules, and regulations of corporations hereafter organized ... shall, at all times, be subject to legislative control, and may be, at any time, altered, abridged, or set aside by law. ...' It is insisted that the power thus reserved embraces, not only a legislative withdrawal of any grant of immunity to the stockholders of the bank, from liability for its debts, but extends to the imposition on them of a new and continuing liability to pay any assessment levied for the restoration of capital of the bank.\n The Supreme Court of Iowa found it unnecessary to pass upon these contentions. Expressly disclaiming any purpose to decide either of them, it assumed, for purposes of decision, that under the earlier statutes the deficiency after sale of the stock could not be collected from the stockholder. It then proceeded to point out that from the beginning the authorized assessments were not upon the stock of the bank, but upon the stockholders personally, and said, 236 N. W. 10, 12:\n'According to the original statute, the stockholder was personally and primarily liable for the assessment, and section 9248 and its predecessors had to do only with the remedy and nothing else. Then, assuming that the only remedy originally made for the collection of the assessment was to confiscate the stockholder's stock, nevertheless, so far as the remedy was sufficient, the stockholder was personally liable for the assessment. This burden \n\n[285 U.S. 467, 473]\n\u00a0\n was cast upon the stockholder himself, even though the only remedy to enforce the obligation was by the sale of the stock. Consequently, appellant's obligation in the premises had not been increased. He was always obligated to pay the assessment. Of course, if he did not pay, the only remedy under the statute was to sell his stock; yet the obligation to pay was there just the same. Now, under the new legislation, the stockholder's liability has not been increased, but rather the remedy for enforcing that obligation has been changed. Were the remedy a part of appellant's contract, a change thereof would amount to an impairment. Barnitz v. Beverly, \n163 \nU.S. 118\n, 16 S. Ct. 1042; Conley v. Barton, \n260 \nU.S. 677\n, 43 S. Ct. 238.\n\n'Obviously in the case at bar, however, we are not confronted with a case where the remedy became a part of the contractual obligation. There is not a syllable in the statutory contract which in any way indicates that the remedy is a part of the agreement. It was not said by the Legislature that there could be no other or different remedy. Hence it was perfectly proper for the law-making body to adopt section 9248-a1 of the 1927 Code, because such amendatory legislation pertained to the remedy only. The purpose of this legislative enactment was to afford a more appropriate remedy for an obligation already existing against appellant. Ever since becoming a stockholder of the appellee bank, he was obligated to pay any legal assessment made for the purpose of repairing the capital stock. This new legislation simply recognized that obligation and afforded a more complete remedy to enforce the same. No new obligation was created by the amendment, but rather the old was recognized and a better way to enforce it provided.'\n\n We find it unnecessary to answer the question implicit in this disposition of the case, whether an obligation can be said to exist apart from a remedy to enforce it-whether, within the meaning of the contract clause, any personal \n\n[285 U.S. 467, 474]\n\u00a0\n obligation of a stockholder in the nature of a contract to restore his pro rata share of any impairment of the corporate capital can be said to exist independently of some means or remedy for enforcing it in addition to the sale of his stock.\n Nor are we called on to discuss here the suggestion that, even though the sale of the stock was the only means of collecting assessments, the contract and due process clauses do not guarantee appellant against the selection and the application to him of any other remedy reasonably adapted to carrying out the policy and purpose plainly declared by the earlier statute, to require complete restoration of any impairment of corporate capital by assessment of the stockholders. See Henley v. Myers, \n215 \nU.S. 373\n, 30 S. Ct. 148; League v. Texas, \n184 \nU.S. 156, 158\n, 22 S. Ct. 475; Graham & Foster v. Goodcell, \n282 \nU.S. 409, 426\n, 51 S. Ct. 186; Milliken v. United States, \n283 U.S. 15\n, 20 et seq., 51 S. Ct. 324; People v. Adams State Bank, 272 Ill. 277, 111 N. E. 989; Irvine v. Elliott (D. C.) 203 F. 82, 96, 97. For we conclude that appellant does not sustain the burden which rests on him of establishing that the later statute is unconstitutional because imposing a liability to which he was not subject under the earlier one.\n In strictness, appellant presents no question of impairment of the obligation of contract for it is not insisted that either party has been deprived by legislative action of any right or remedy secured by the statute in force when appellant acquired his stock. His objection is not directed to any such impairment of right or obligation. It is rather that the act of 1925 imposed on him a personal obligation where none existed before, and that its imposition, by fiat of the law, after he had bought his stock, operates to deprive him of property without due process of law. See League v. Texas, supra, \n184 \nU.S. 158, 161\n, 22 S. Ct. 475. This contention is, of course, without support if the liability to pay the full assessment declared by the earlier stat- \n\n[285 U.S. 467, 475]\n\u00a0\n ute was then enforceable by any appropriate form of remedy. See Pinney v. Nelson, \n183 \nU.S. 144, 147\n, 22 S. Ct. 52; Whitman v. Oxford National Bank, \n176 \nU.S. 559\n, 20 S. Ct. 477; Thomas v. Matthiessen, \n232 \nU.S. 221\n, 34 S. Ct. 312.\n The Supreme Court of Iowa has given no authoritative answer to the question whether, before the act of 1925, there was any remedy other than sale of the stock by which an assessment might be recovered from a stockholder. In the present case it did not decide the question, contenting itself with the observation that 'the only remedy under the statute was to sell his stock.' In two earlier cases, arising long after appellant acquired his stock, it had expressed the view that the only remedy for enforcing the payment of assessments was by sale of the shareholder's stock. See Leach v. Arthur Savings Bank, 203 Iowa, 1052, 1057, 213 N. W. 772; Andrew v. People's State Bank, 211 Iowa, 649, 234 N. W. 542, 546. But in neither was this statement necessary to the decision, nor did it have any bearing on the question actually decided. Both followed the passage of the act of 1925. In no other cited case has the question been considered.\n Where legislation is assailed as impairing the obligation of contract, this Court, in defining the scope of the constitutional immunity, will determine for itself what the contract is for whose protection the immunity is invoked. See Appleby v. City of New York, \n271 \nU.S. 364, 379\n, 380 S., 46 S. Ct. 569. In the circumstances of this case, also, where the alleged infringement of the Fourteenth Amendment turns on the asserted non-existence of a contractual obligation to do that which the challenged statute exacts, appellant must satisfy this Court that he was not so bound. For, here, the nature and extent of his obligation depend upon the construction of a local statute which the highest court of the state has indicated by its latest decision is still open for determination. See Brunswick Terminal Co. v. \n\n[285 U.S. 467, 476]\n\u00a0\n National Bank of Baltimore, \n192 U.S. 386\n, 392 et seq., 24 S. Ct. 314; cf. Broad River Power Co. v. South Carolina, \n281 \nU.S. 537, 540\n, 50 S. Ct. 401\n\n\n The meaning of the sections now in question must be ascertained in the light of the legislative policy of the state. They are a part of its public laws, dealing with a subject of public concern, the stability and solvency of state banking institutions. See Noble State Bank v. Haskell, \n219 \nU.S. 104, 111\n, 112 S., 31 S. Ct. 186, 32 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1062, Ann. Cas. 1912A, 487; Bank of Oxford v. Love, \n250 \nU.S. 603\n, 40 S. Ct. 22. Those laws confer on the superintendent of banks full authority to require a bank to restore impairments of its capital. Section 9235, Iowa Code of 1927 (section 1572, Iowa Code of 1873). He may cause its liquidation if it refuses to comply with his order or is in an insolvent or unsafe condition, or the interests of creditors require it to be closed. Sections 9238, 9239, Iowa Code of 1927 (section 1572, Iowa Code of 1873). The stockholders are made individually liable to creditors, sections 9251, 9252, Iowa Code of 1927 (section 1882, Iowa Code of 1897); and any bank, whether its charter has expired or not, may be dissolved by vote of three-fourths of the stockholders, section 9277, Iowa Code of 1927 ( section 1857, Iowa Code of 1897).\n These sections exhibit an unmistakable purpose to maintain the banks of the state in a solvent condition with capital unimpaired, which is specifically given effect by sections 9246-9248 of the 1927 Code. By these sections the appellant was made aware, when he acquired his stock, that, in the event of any impairment of capital of the bank, the super-intendent of banks was authorized to 'require an assessment upon the stockholders' and to fix 'the amount of the assessment required'; that the directors of the bank could be ordered by the superintendent to 'cause such a deficiency to be made good by a ratable assessment upon the stockholders'; that the officers of the corporation were required to give notice to each stockholder of 'the entire sum to be raised and the \n\n[285 U.S. 467, 477]\n\u00a0\n amount due from the addressed stockholder'; and that after 90 days, allowed for the payment of the assessment, his stock might be sold upon an advertisement required to 'recite the assessment made and the amount due thereunder from the stockholder.' These are phrases importing legal liability. They define an obligation imposed by the statute upon the stockholders to pay the assessments to the bank, see Whitman v. Oxford National Bank, \n176 \nU.S. 559, 562\n, 20 S. Ct. 477, by which alone the complete restoration of impaired capital, which is the legislative purpose, could be secured with certainty.\n If no specific remedy of any kind had been provided to compel payment of assessments, there could be little doubt that the effect of these provisions would have been to create an obligation or liability, quasi contractual in nature, on the part of stockholders acquiring their stock after the enactment, to pay to the bank a sum certain, that is, the assessment when made, for which the common law affords a remedy in debt or indebitatus assumpsit or its modern equivalent. See Mills v. Scott, \n99 U.S. 25\n; Whitman v. Oxford National Bank, \n176 \nU.S. 559\n, 20 S. Ct. 477; Flash v. Conn, \n109 \nU.S. 371\n, 3 S. Ct. 263; Bernheimer v. Converse, \n206 \nU.S. 516, 529\n, 27 S. Ct. 755; Price v. United States, \n269 \nU.S. 492, 500\n, 46 S. Ct. 180; United States v. Chamberlin, \n219 \nU.S. 250\n, 31 S. Ct. 155; Meredith v. United States, 13 Pet. 486, 493; Pacific Mail Steamship Co. v. Joliffe, 2 Wall. 450, 457; Converse v. Hamilton, \n224 \nU.S. 243, 253\n, 32 S. Ct. 415, Ann. Cas. 1913D, 1292; Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. v. Funk, 49 Neb. 353, 68 N. W. 520. See James B. Ames, Lectures on Legal History, Implied Assumpsit, 149, 161.\n In the face of the sweeping language of the statute, the mere fact that it gave a remedy by sale of the stock cannot be taken as necessarily precluding resort to the common-law remedy, which would otherwise be available and by which alone the liability declared could in many cases be successfully enforced. The summary remedy by a sale would often be a speedy and convenient alternative \n\n[285 U.S. 467, 478]\n\u00a0\n method of enforcing the statutory liability to pay assessments. But it is not stated to be exclusive, and its adoption involves no necessary inconsistency with the continued existence of a common-law remedy for the recovery of the sum certain fixed by the assessment and declared to be due by the statute. In those instances, where the impairment is more than 50 per cent, of the capital, the remedy by sale would be insufficient to enforce the liability declared. No reason is suggested why such a remedy should, by mere implication, be deemed exclusive or why the statute should be so construed by inference as to defeat its obvious purpose, or limit or destroy the liability which, in plain terms, it has created.\n It is true that, where a statute creates a liability and provides a remedy by suit specially adapted to its enforcement, other less appropriate common-law remedies are impliedly excluded. See Evans v. Nellis, \n187 \nU.S. 271\n, 23 S. Ct. 74; Pollard v. Bailey, 20 Wall. 520, 527; Williamson v. American Bank (C. C. A.) 115 F. 793; cf. Middletown Bank v. Railway Co., \n197 \nU.S. 394\n, 25 S. Ct. 462. And in every case conditions precedent to the statutory liability must be satisfied before any form of remedy can be resorted to. Fourth National Bank v. Francklyn, \n120 \nU.S. 747\n, 7 S. Ct. 757; Middletown Bank v. Railway Co., supra; State National Bank v. Sayward ( C. C. A.) 91 F. 443. But here the conditions of liability, the order of the super-intendent of banks, the assessment by the directors, and the notice fixing the amount of appellant's obligation, have all been performed. Here the remedy provided is a summary and only partially effective supplement or alternative to that which the common law affords for enforcing the obligation to pay a sum certain, which, when fixed by the prescribed assessment, is declared to be due and owing. The very fact that the remedy is on its face inadequate to compel full performance of the obligation declared is persuasive that it was \n\n[285 U.S. 467, 479]\n\u00a0\n not intended to be exclusive of applicable common-law remedies, by which complete performance might be secured.\n Administrative remedies for the collection of taxes, if not made exclusive by statute, do not preclude the recovery of the tax by a common- law action of debt. Price v. United States, \n269 \nU.S. 492, 500\n, 46 S. Ct. 180; United States v. Chamberlin, \n219 \nU.S. 250, 262\n, 31 S. Ct. 155; Dollar Savings Bank v. United States, 19 Wall. 227, 238, 239; Meredith v. United States, 13 Pet. 486, 493; see Stockwell v. United States, 13 Wall. 531, 542. And in general the liability of stockholders to assessment under local statutes is deemed transitory in nature, enforceable by common-law remedies in states other than that of the corporation, although special statutory forms of remedy given by the local statute could not be resorted to elsewhere. See Whitman v. Oxford National Bank, \n176 \nU.S. 559\n, 20 S. Ct. 477; Hancock National Bank v. Farnum, \n176 \nU.S. 640\n, 20 S. Ct. 506; Hale v. Hardon (C. C. A.) 95 F. 747; Rhodes v. United States National Bank (C. C. A.) 66 F. 512, 34 L. R. A. 742; Dexter v. Edmands (C. C.) 89 F. 467.\n The enactment of the statute of 1925, specifically authorizing a suit for the deficiency after the sale of the stock, served to remove any possible doubts and rendered certain what may previously have been thought by some to be uncertain. But it can hardly be taken to be a legislative determination that under the earlier statutes no common-law remedy could be availed of for the collection of assessments. If not, mere variations of the remedy or the creation of new ones, even though more onerous, for the enforcement of a pre-existing obligation to pay assessments in full, are unobjectionable. See Hill v. Merchants' Mutual Insurance Co., \n134 \nU.S. 515\n, 10 S. Ct. 589; League v. Texas, \n184 \nU.S. 156, 158\n, 22 S. Ct. 475; Henley v. Myers, \n215 \nU.S. 373\n, 30 S. Ct. 148; Conley v. Barton, \n260 \nU.S. 677\n, 43 S. Ct. 238.\n In the absence of an authoritative construction by the state court of the statutes in force when appellant acquired \n\n[285 U.S. 467, 480]\n\u00a0\n his stock, we cannot say that he was not personally liable for his pro rata share of any impairment of the bank's capital assessed against him while he remained a stockholder, whether his stock was sold under section 9248-a1, or not, or that the later statute, which provided a remedy for enforcing such liability, infringed his constitutional rights.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","130":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSINGLETON v. CHEEK(1932)\nNo. 403\nArgued: January 22, 1932Decided: February 15, 1932\n\n\n\n Mr. A. G. C. Bierer, Jr., of Guthrie, Okl., for petitioners.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Lee Ray Jackson, a soldier in the United States Army, received a certificate of insurance on his life, issued by the United States through the Bureau of War Risk Insurance on September 5, 1918. His wife, Mary Lucinda Jackson, was named as beneficiary. He died intestate March 21, 1921, a resident of Craig county, Okl., leaving him surviving his wife and a son named James Lee Boy Jack- \n\n[284 U.S. 493, 494]\n\u00a0\n son, a minor child about seven months old. In March, 1922, the child died, of course, intestate; and in March, 1923, the widow died intestate, in the meantime having married Charley Singleton, one of the petitioners. No part of the insurance due under the certificate was paid during the lifetime of the insured or beneficiary; but the sum accrued between March 31, 1921, and March 30, 1923, has since been paid to the administrator of the estate of Mary Lucinda Jackson, who, at the time of her death, was Mary Lucinda Singleton. The amount of insurance due to the insured on account of permanent disability has been paid to the administrator de bonis non of the estate of Lee Ray Jackson. The remaining installments of the life insurance were commuted, and the sum thereof, fixed by the War Risk Bureau, was also paid to the administrator last named. Such payments of the disability insurance and the sum of the commuted installments were authorized by the Veterans' Bureau and the administrator directed to distribute the amounts in accordance with the intestacy laws of the state of the insured's last legal residence; an award in favor of the administrator in each case having previously been made. The respondents, Edith Cheek, nee Jackson, and Jewel Braziel, nee Jackson, are sisters, and Emmett Jackson is a brother of Lee Ray Jackson. Neither his father nor mother survived him. George Davis and Maggie Davis are the parents of Mary Lucinda Singleton, but neither they nor Charley Singleton are blood kin to the insured.\n During her lifetime Mary Lucinda Jackson administered the estate of Lee Ray Jackson, and upon her final report the court having probate jurisdiction found that she was entitled to all of the estate of the deceased Lee Ray Jackson, one-half in her own right, and the other one- half in the right of the minor child above named. A decree of heirship to that effect was duly entered. \n\n[284 U.S. 493, 495]\n\u00a0\n In the administration following the death of Mary Lucinda Singleton and the infant son of Lee Ray Jackson, the same court determined that petitioners were entitled to the disability insurance which accrued before the death of the insured, but that respondents were entitled to the commuted value of the insurance falling due after the death of the beneficiary, holding that the commuted balance of such insurance was payable to the estate of the insured, but vested in the heirs next surviving within the permitted class of beneficiaries designated by the War Risk Insurance Act of 1917, c. 105, art. 4,  402, 40 Stat. 398, 409, as amended by the Act of 1919, c. 16,  13, 41 Stat. 371, 375, and by the World War Veterans' Act of 1924, c. 320,  300, 303, 43 Stat. 607, 624, 625 (38 USCA  511 note, 514 note). The case was appealed to a state district court, where a different judgment was rendered. From that judgment an appeal was taken to the Supreme Court of Oklahoma, where it was twice heard. That court first sustained the petitioners' contention. Subsequently, upon rehearing, it held in favor of the respondents in respect of the commuted installments accruing after the death of the beneficiary, and in favor of petitioners as to those accruing before her death, following a decision of the Supreme Court of Kentucky in Sutton's Executor v. Barr's Administrator, 219 Ky. 543, 293 S. W. 1075, in which that court had decided that the heirs of the insured in being at the time of the death of the beneficiary took the property, and not those who were heirs at the time of the death of the insured. \n1\n (Okla.) 7 P.(2d) 140.\n By the first Oklahoma decision the doctrine of the Kentucky case, just cited, was expressly disapproved; and, following the view of a number of other state decisions to the contrary, it was held that the decree of the county \n\n[284 U.S. 493, 496]\n\u00a0\n court in the original administration of the Jackson estate fixed the parties entitled to inherit all his estate, 'whether the assets were then in the hands of the administrator, or later came into the possession of an administrator de bonis non'; and that, when the widow died, these assets became assets of her estate, to be distributed among her heirs. By the second Oklahoma decision this was reversed, upon the authority of the very case which had been distinctly rejected in the first decision.\n We are of opinion that the first decision was right, and the second wrong. Undoubtedly, by section 15 of the War Risk Insurance Amending Act of 1919,2 war risk insurance, after the death of the designated beneficiary, became payable to such person or persons within the permitted class of beneficiaries (enumerated in section 402, Act of 1917, as amended by  13, Act of 1919 (41 Stat. 375)) as would, under the laws of the state of the residence of the insured, be entitled to his personal property in case of intestacy. The second decision of the state Supreme Court, therefore, would have been entirely correct if no change had been made in the statute. But a radical change had been effected prior to the award of insurance made by the Veterans' Bureau on August 18, 1925. The Act of March 4, 1925, c. 553, 43 Stat. 1302, 1310 (38 USCA  514), amended section 303 of the World War Veterans' Act of 1924 (which had in turn amended and modified the preceding acts) to read as follows: \n\n[284 U.S. 493, 497]\n\u00a0\n 'If no person within the permitted class be designated as beneficiary for yearly renewable term insurance by the insured either in his lifetime or by his last will and testament or if the designated beneficiary does not survive the insured or survives the insured and dies prior to receiving all of the two hundred and forty installments or all such as are payable and applicable, there shall be paid to the estate of the insured the present value of the monthly installments thereafter payable, said value to be computed as of date of last payment made under any existing award.'\n The amendment, in express terms, was made retroactive so as to take effect as of October 6, 1917, a provision undoubtedly within the power of Congress, for the reasons stated by this court in White v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 175\n, 46 S. Ct. 274.\n By that amendment, the rule, which, upon the happening of the contingencies named in the prior acts, limited the benefit of the unpaid installments to persons within the designated class of permittees, was abandoned, and 'the estate of the insured' was wholly substituted as the payee. All installments, whether accruing before the death of insured or after the death of the beneficiary named in the certificate of insurance, as a result, became assets of the estate of the insured upon the instant of his death, to be distributed to the heirs of the insured in accordance with the intestacy laws of the state of his residence, such heirs to be determined as of the date of his death, and not as of the date of the death of the beneficiary. The state courts, with almost entire unanimity, have reached the same conclusion. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n Judgment reversed.\n\n\n[284 U.S. 493, 497]\n\u00a0\n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] But see Mefford v.

HOLM(1932)\nNo. 617\nArgued: Decided: April 11, 1932\n\n\n\n\n[285 U.S. 355, 356]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George T. Simpson, Alfred W. Bowen, W. Yale Smiley, John A. Weeks, and F. J. Donahue, all of Minneapolis, Minn., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Henry N. Benson, Atty. Gen., and William H. Gurnee, Asst. Atty. Gen., both of St. Paul, Minn., for respondent.\n\n\n[285 U.S. 355, 361]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Under the reapportionment following the fifteenth decennial census, as provided by the Act of Congress of June 18, 1929 (c. 28,  22, 46 Stat. 21, 26 (2 USCA  2a)), Minnesota is entitled to nine Representatives in Congress, being one less than the number previously allotted. In April, 1931, the bill known as House File No. 1456 (Laws Minn. 1931, p. 640), dividing the state into nine congressional districts and specifying the counties of which they should be composed, was passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate of the state, and was transmitted to the Governor, who returned it without his approval. Thereupon, without further action upon the measure by the House of Representatives and the Senate, and in compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives, House File No. 1456 was deposited with the secretary of state of Minnesota. This suit was brought by the petitioner as a 'citizen, elector and taxpayer' of the state to obtain a judgment declaring invalid all fillings for nomination for the office of Representative in Congress, which should designate a subdivision of the state as a congressional district, and to enjoin the secretary of state from giving notice of the holding of elections for that office in such subdivi- \n\n[285 U.S. 355, 362]\n\u00a0\n sions. The petition alleged that House File No. 1456 was a nullity, in that, after the Governor's veto, it was not repassed by the Legislature as required by law, and also in that the proposed congressional districts were not 'compact' and did not 'contain an equal number of inhabitants as nearly as practicable' in accordance with the Act of Congress of August 8, 1911.1\n The respondent, secretary of state, demurred to the petition upon the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. He maintained the validity of House File No. 1456 by virtue of the authority conferred upon the Legislature by article 1,  4, of the Federal Constitution, and he insisted that the act of \n\n[285 U.S. 355, 363]\n\u00a0\n Congress of August 8, 1911, was no longer in force, and that the asserted inequalities in redistricting presented a political and not a judicial question. The trial court sustained the demurrer, and its order was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the state. 238 N. W. 494. The action was then dismissed upon the merits, and the Supreme Court affirmed the judgment upon its previous opinion. 238 N. W. 792. This Court granted a writ of certiorari. \n284 \nU.S. 616\n, 52 S. Ct. 266, 76 L. Ed. -.\n Article 1,  4, of the Constitution of the United States, provides:\n'The times, places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives, shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations, except as to the places of choosing senators.'\n\n Under the Constitution of Minnesota, the 'legislature' consists 'of the senate and house of representatives.' Const. Minn. art. 4,  1. Before any bill passed by the Senate and House of Representatives 'becomes a law,' it must 'be presented to the governor of the state,' and if he returns it, within the time stated, without his approval, the bill may become a law provided it is reconsidered and thereupon passed by each house by a two- thirds vote. Id. art. 4,  11. The state Constitution also provides that, after each Federal census, 'the legislature shall have the power to prescribe the bounds of congressional ... districts.' Id. art. 4,  23. We do not understand that the Supreme Court of the state has held that, under these provisions, a measure redistricting the state for congressional elections could be put in force by the Legislature without participation by the Governor, as required in the case of legislative bills, if such action were regarded as a performance of the function of the Legislature as a lawmaking body. No decision to that effect has been cited. It appears that 'on seven occasions' prior to the measure now under consideration the Legislature of Min- \n\n[285 U.S. 355, 364]\n\u00a0\n nesota had 'made state and federal reapportionments in the form of a bill for an act which was approved by the Governor.' \n2\n While, in the instant case, the Supreme Court regarded that procedure as insufficient to support the petitioner's contention as to practical construction, that question was dismissed from consideration because of the controlling effect which the court ascribed to the federal provision. 238 N. W. page 500. The court expressed the opinion that 'the various provisions of our state Constitution cited in the briefs are of little importance in relation to the matter now in controversy'; that 'the power of the state Legislature to prescribe congressional districts rests exclusively and solely in the language of article 1,  4, of the United States Constitution.' Id. 238 N. W. page 497. Construing that provision, the court reached the conclusion that the Legislature in redistricting the state was not acting strictly in the exercise of the lawmaking power, but merely as an agency, discharging a particular duty in the manner which the Federal Constitution required. Upon this point the court said (Id. 238 N. W. page 499):\n'The Legislature in districting the state is not strictly in the discharge of legislative duties as a lawmaking body, acting in its sovereign capacity, but is acting as representative of the people of the state under the power granted by said article 1,  4. It merely gives expression as to district lines in aid of the election of certain federal officials; prescribing one of the essential details serving primarily the federal government and secondly the people of the state. The Legislature is designated as a mere agency to discharge the particular duty. The Governor's veto has no relation to such matters; that power pertains, under the state Constitution, exclu- \n\n[285 U.S. 355, 365]\n\u00a0\n sively to state affairs. The word 'legislature' has reference to the well-recognized branch of the state government-created by the state as one of its three branches for a specific purpose-and when the framers of the Federal Constitution employed this term, we believe they made use of it in the ordinary sense with reference to the official body invested with the functions of making laws, the legislative body of the state; and that they did not intend to include the state's chief executive as a part thereof. We would not be justified in construing the term as being used in its enlarged sense as meaning the state or as meaning the lawmaking power of the state.'\n\n The question then is whether the provision of the Federal Constitution, thus regarded as determinative, invests the Legislature with a particular authority, and imposes upon it a corresponding duty, the definition of which imports a function different from that of lawgiver, and thus renders inapplicable the conditions which attach to the making of state laws. Much that is urged in argument with regard to the meaning of the term 'Legislature' is beside the point. As this Court said in Hawke v. Smith, No. 1, \n253 \nU.S. 221, 227\n, 40 S. Ct. 495, 497, 10 A. L. R. 1504, the term was not one 'of uncertain meaning when incorporated into the Constitution. What it meant when adopted it still means for the purpose of interpretation. A Legislature was then the representative body which made the laws of the people.' The question here is not with respect to the 'body' as thus described but as to the function to be performed. The use in the Federal Constitution of the same term in different relations does not always imply the performance of the same function. The Legislature may act as an electoral body, as in the choice of United States Senators under article 1,  3, prior to the adoption of the Seventeenth Amendment. It may act as a ratifying body, as in the case of proposed amendments to the Constitution under article 5. Hawke v. Smith, No. \n\n[285 U.S. 355, 366]\n\u00a0\n 1, supra; Hawke v. Smith, No. 2, \n253 \nU.S. 231\n, 40 S. Ct. 498; Leser v. Garnett, \n258 \nU.S. 130, 137\n, 42 S. Ct. 217. It may act as a consenting body, as in relation to the acquisition of lands by the United States under article 1,  8, par. 17. Wherever the term 'legislature' is used in the Constitution, it is necessary to consider the nature of the particular action in view. The primary question now before the Court is whether the function contemplated by article 1,  4, is that of making laws.\n Consideration of the subject-matter and of the terms of the provision requires affirmative answer. The subject-matter is the 'times, places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives.' It cannot be doubted that these comprehensive words embrace authority to provide a complete code for congressional elections, not only as to times and places, but in relation to notices, registration, supervision of voting, protection of voters, prevention of fraud and corrupt practices, counting of votes, duties of inspectors and canvassers, and making and publication of election returns; in short, to enact the numerous requirements as to procedure and safeguards which experience shows are necessary in order to enforce the fundamental right involved. And these requirements would be nugatory if they did not have appropriate sanctions in the definition of offenses and punishments. All this is comprised in the subject of 'times, places and manner of holding elections,' and involves lawmaking in its essential features and most important aspect.\n This view is confirmed by the second clause of article 1,  4, which provides that 'the Congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations,' with the single exception stated. The phrase 'such regulations' plainly refers to regulations of the same general character that the legislature of the State is authorized to prescribe with respect to congressional elections. In exercising this power, the Congress may supplement these state regula- \n\n[285 U.S. 355, 367]\n\u00a0\n tions or may substitute its own. It may impose additional penalties for the violation of the state laws or provide independent sanctions. It 'has a general supervisory power over the whole subject.' Ex parte Siebold, \n100 U.S. 371\n, 387; Ex parte Yarbrough, \n110 \nU.S. 651, 661\n, 4 S. Ct. 152; Ex parte Clarke, \n100 U.S. 399\n; United States v. Mosley, \n238 \nU.S. 383, 386\n, 35 S. Ct. 904; Newberry v. United States, \n256 \nU.S. 232, 255\n, 41 S. Ct. 469. But this broad authority is conferred by the constitutional provision now under consideration, and is exercised by the Congress in making 'such regulations'; that is, regulations of the sort which, if there be no overruling action by the Congress, may be provided by the Legislature of the state upon the same subject.\n The term defining the method of action, equally with the nature of the subject matter, aptly points to the making of laws. The state Legislature is authorized to 'prescribe' the times, places, and manner of holding elections. Respondent urges that the fact that the words 'by law' are found in the clause relating to the action of the Congress, and not in the clause giving authority to the state Legislature, supports the contention that the latter was not to act in the exercise of the lawmaking power. We think that the inference is strongly to the contrary. It is the nature of the function that makes the phrase 'by law' apposite. That is the same whether it is performed by state or national Legislature, and the use of the phrase places the intent of the whole provision in a strong light. Prescribing regulations to govern the conduct of the citizen, under the first clause, and making and altering such rules by law, under the second clause, involve action of the same inherent character.\n As the authority is conferred for the purpose of making laws for the state, it follows, in the absence of an indication of a contrary intent, that the exercise of the authority must be in accordance with the method which the state has prescribed for legislative enactments. We find \n\n[285 U.S. 355, 368]\n\u00a0\n no suggestion in the federal constitutional provision of an attempt to endow the Legislature of the state with power to enact laws in any manner other than that in which the Constitution of the state has provided that laws shall be enacted. Whether the Governor of the state, through the veto power, shall have a part in the making of state laws, is a matter of state polity. Article 1,  4, of the Federal Constitution, neither requires nor excludes such participation. And provision for it, as a check in the legislative process, cannot be regarded as repugnant to the grant of legislative authority. At the time of the adoption of the Federal Constitution, it appears that only two states had provided for a veto upon the passage of legislative bills; Massachusetts, through the Governor, and New York, through a council of revision. \n3\n But the restriction which existed in the case of these states was well known. That the state Legislature might be subject to such a limitation, either then or thereafter imposed as the several states might think wise, was no more incongruous with the grant of legislative authority to regulate congressional elections than the fact that the Congress in making its regulations under the same provision would be subject to the veto power of the President, as provided in article 1,  7. \n\n[285 U.S. 355, 369]\n\u00a0\n The latter consequence was not expressed, but there is no question that it was necessarily implied, as the Congress was to act by law; and there is no intimation, either in the debates in the Federal Convention or in contemporaneous exposition, of a purpose to exclude a similar restriction imposed by state Constitutions upon state Legislatures when exercising the lawmaking power.\n The practical construction of article 1,  4, is impressive. General acquiescence cannot justify departure from the law, but long and continuous interpretation in the course of official action under the law may aid in removing doubts as to its meaning. This is especially true in the case of constitutional provisions governing the exercise of political rights, and hence subject to constant and careful scrutiny. Certainly, the terms of the constitutional provision furnish no such clear and definite support for a contrary construction as to justify disregard of the established practice in the states. McPherson v. Blacker, \n146 \nU.S. 1, 36\n, 13 S. Ct. 3; Missouri Pacific Railway Co. v. Kansas, \n248 \nU.S. 276, 284\n, 39 S. Ct. 93, 2 A. L. R. 1589; Myers v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 52, 119\n, 136 S., 47 S. Ct. 21; The Pocket Veto Case, \n279 U.S. 655\n, 688-690, 49 S. Ct. 463, 64 A. L. R. 1434. That practice is eloquent of the conviction of the people of the states, and of their representatives in state Legislatures and executive office, that in providing for congressional elections, and for the districts in which they were to be held, these Legislatures were exercising the lawmaking power and thus subject, where the state Constitution so provided, to the veto of theGovernor as a part of the legislative process. The early action in Massachusetts under this authority was by 'resolves,' and these, under the Constitution of 1780, were required to be submitted to the Governor, and it appears that they were so submitted and approved by him. \n4\n In New York, \n\n[285 U.S. 355, 370]\n\u00a0\n from the outset, provision for congressional districts was made by statute, 5 and this method was followed until 1931. The argument based on the disposition, during the early period, to curtail executive authority in the states, and on the long time which elapsed in a number of states before the veto power was granted to the Governor, is of slight weight in the light of the fact that this power was given in four states shortly after the adoption of the Federal Constitution,6 that the use of this check has gradually been extended, and that the uniform practice (prior to the questions raised in relation to the present reapportionment) has been to provide for congressional districts by the enactment of statutes with the participation of the Governor wherever the state Constitution provided for such participation as part of the process of making laws. See Moran v. Bowley, 347 Ill. 148, 179 N. E. 526, 527; Koening v. Flynn, 258 N. Y. 292, 300, 179 N. E. 705; Carroll v. Becker (Mo. Sup.) 45 S.W.(2d) 533; State ex rel. Schrader v. Polley, 26 S. D. 5, 7, 127 N. W. 848. The Attorney General of Minnesota, in his argument in the instant case, states: 'It is conceded that until 1931 whenever the State of Minnesota was divided into districts for the purpose of congressional elections such action was taken by the legislature in the form of a bill and presented to and approved by the governor.' \n\n[285 U.S. 355, 371]\n\u00a0\n That the constitutional provision contemplates the exercise of the lawmaking power was definitely recognized by the Congress in the Act of August 8, 1911, 7 which expressly provided in section 4 for the election of Representatives in Congress, as stated, 'by the districts now prescribed by law until such State shall be redistricted in the manner provided by the laws thereof, and in accordance with the rules enumerated in section three of this Act.' The significance of the clause 'in the manner provided by the laws thereof' is manifest from its occasion and purpose. It was to recognize the propriety of the referendum in establishing congressional districts where the state had made it a part of the legislative process. 'It is clear,' said this Court in Davis v. Hildebrant, \n241 \nU.S. 565, 568\n, 36 S. Ct. 708, 710, 'that Congress, in 1911, in enacting the controlling law concerning the duties of the states, through their legislative authority, to deal with the subject of the creation of congressional districts, expressly modified the phraseology of the previous acts relating to that subject by inserting a clause plainly intended to provide that where, by the state Constitution and laws, the referendum was treated as part of the legislative power, the power as thus constituted should be held and treated to be the state legislative power for the purpose of creating congressional districts by law.'\n The case of Davis v. Hildebrant, supra, arose under the amendment of 1912 to the Constitution of Ohio reserving the right 'by way of referendum to approve or disapprove by popular vote any law enacted by the general assembly.' Id., 241 U. S. page 566, 36 S. Ct. 708, 709. The act passed by the General Assembly of Ohio in 1915, redistricting the state for the purpose of congressional elections, was disapproved under the referendum provision, and the validity of that action was challenged under article 1,  4, of the Federal \n\n[285 U.S. 355, 372]\n\u00a0\n Constitution. The Supreme Court of the state, denying a mandamus to enforce the disapproved act, 'held that the provisions as to referendum were a part of the legislative power of the state, made so by the Constitution, and that nothing in the act of Congress of 1911, or in the constitutional provision, operated to the contrary, and that therefore the disapproved law had no existence.' Id. 241 U. S. page 567, 36 S. Ct. 708, 709. This Court affirmed the judgment of the state court. It is manifest that the Congress had no power to alter article 1,  4, and that the act of 1911, in its reference to state laws, could but operate as a legislative recognition of the nature of the authority deemed to have been conferred by the constitutional provision. And it was because of the authority of the state to determine what should constitute its legislative process that the validity of the requirement of the state Constitution of Ohio, in its application to congressional elections, was sustained. This was explicitly stated by this Court as the ground of the distinction which was made in Hawke v. Smith No. 1, supra, where, referring to the Davis Case, the Court said: 'As shown in the opinion in that case, Congress had itself recognized the referendum as part of the legislative authority of the state for the purpose stated. It was held, affirming the judgment of the Supreme Court of Ohio, that the referendum provision of the state Constitution, when applied to a law redistricting the state with a view to representation in Congress, was not unconstitutional. Article 1, section 4, plainly gives authority to the state to legislate within the limitations therein named. Such legislative action is entirely different from the requirement of the Constitution as to the expression of assent or dissent to a proposed amendment to the Constitution. In such expression no legislative action is authorized or required.'\n It clearly follows that there is nothing in article 1,  4, which precludes a state from providing that \n\n[285 U.S. 355, 373]\n\u00a0\n legislative action in districting the state for congressional elections shall be subject to the veto power of theGovernor as in other cases of the exercise of the lawmaking power. Accordingly, in this instance, the validity of House File No. 1456 cannot be sustained by virtue of any authority conferred by the Federal Constitution upon the Legislature of Minnesota to create congressional districts independently of the participation of the Governor as required by the state Constitution with respect to the enactment of laws.\n The further question has been presented whether the Act of Congress of August 8, 1911, is still in force. The state court held that it was not, that it had been wholly replaced by the Act of June 18, 1929. Sections 1 and 2 of the former act, making specific provision for the apportionment under the thirteenth census, are, of course, superseded; the present question relates to the other sections. These have not been expressly repealed. The act of 1929 repeals 'all other laws and parts of laws' that are inconsistent with its provisions (section 21 (46 Stat. 26, 13 USCA  1 note)). The petitioner urges that this act contains nothing inconsistent with sections 3, 4, and 58 of the act of 1911, and the only question is whether these sections by their very terms have ceased to be effective. It is pointed out that the provisions of the act of 1911 were carried into the United States Code. U. S. C., tit. 2,  2-5 (2 USCA  2 and note 3-5 ). Inclusion in the Code does not operate as a re-enactment; it establishes 'prima facie the laws of the United States, general and permanent in their nature, in force on the 7th day of December, 1925.' Act of June 30, 1926, c. 712, 44 Stat. 777. While sections 3 and 4 of the act of 1911 expressly referred to 'this apportionment' (the one made by that Act), the argument is pressed that they contain provisions setting forth a general policy which was intended to apply \n\n[285 U.S. 355, 374]\n\u00a0\n to the future creation of congressional districts, and the election of Representatives, until Congress should provide otherwise.\n There are three classes of states with respect to the number of Representatives under the present apportionment pursuant to the act of 1929, (1) where the number remains the same, (2) where it is increased, and (3) where it is decreased. In states where the number of Representatives remains the same, and the districts are unchanged, no question is presented; there is nothing inconsistent with any of the requirements of the Congress in proceeding with the election of Representatives in such states in the same manner as heretofore. Section 4 of the act of 1911 (2 USCA  4) provided that, in case of an increase in the number of Representatives in any state, 'such additional Representative or Representatives shall be elected by the State at large and the other Representatives by the districts now prescribed by law' until such state shall be redistricted. The Constitution itself provides in article 1,  2, that 'The house of representatives shall be composed of members chosen every second year by the people of the several states,' and we are of the opinion that under this provision, in the absence of the creation of new districts, additional Representatives allotted to a state under the present reapportionment would appropriately be elected by the state at large. Such a course, with the election of the other Representatives in the existing districts until a redistricting act was passed, would present no inconsistency with any policy declared in the act of 1911\n\n\n Where, as in the case of Minnesota, the number of Representatives has been decreased, there is a different situation, as existing districts are not at all adapted to the new apportionment. It follows that in such a case, unless and until new districts are created, all Representatives allotted to the state must be elected by the state at \n\n[285 U.S. 355, 375]\n\u00a0\n large. That would be required, in the absence of a redistricting act, in order to afford the representation to which the state is constitutionally entitled, and the general provisions of the act of 1911 cannot be regarded as intended to have a different import.\n This conclusion disposes of all the questions properly before the Court. Questions in relation to the application of the standards defined in section 3 of the act of 1911 to a redistricting statute, if such a statute should hereafter be enacted, are wholly abstract. The judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n It is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Act of August 8, 1911, c. 5, 37 Stat. 13 (2 USCA  2 and note, 3-5), provided for the apportionment of Representatives in Congress among the several states under the thirteenth census. After fixing the total number of Representatives and their apportionment, in sections 1 and 2, the act provided as follows:\n'Sec. 3. That in each State entitled under this apportionment to more than one Representative, the Representatives to the Sixty-third and each subsequent Congress shall be elected by districts composed of a contiguous and compact territory, and containing as nearly as practicable an equal number of inhabitants. The said districts shall be equal to the number of Representatives to which such State may be entitled in Congress, no district electing more than one Representative.\n\n'Sec. 4. That in case of an increase in the number of Representatives in any State under this apportionment such additional Representative or Representatives shall be elected by the State at large and the other Representatives by the districts now prescribed by law until such State shall be redistricted in the manner provided by the laws thereof and in accordance with the rules enumerated in section three of this Act; and if there be no charge in the number of Representatives from a State, the Representatives thereof shall be elected from the districts now prescribed by law until such State shall be redistricted as herein prescribed.\n\n'Sec. 5. That candidates for Representative or Representatives to be elected at large in any State shall be nominated in the same manner as candidates for governor, unless otherwise provided by the laws of such State.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See Laws of Minnesota 1858, c. 83; 1872, c. 21; 1881, c. 128; 1891, c. 3; 1901, c. 92; 1913, c. 513; 1929, c. 64. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The Constitution of Massachusetts of 1780 provided for the Governor's veto of 'bills' or 'resolves.'

Jordan, Jr., both of Asheville, N.C., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[287 U.S. 435, 437]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Thomas D.Thacher, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n\n\n\n[287 U.S. 435, 438]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Defendant was indicted on two counts (1) for possessing and (2) for selling, on July 13, 1930, one-half gallon of whisky in violation of the National Prohibition Act (27 USCA). He pleaded not guilty. Upon the trial he relied upon the defense of entrapment. The court refused to sustain the defense, denying a motion to direct a verdict in favor of defendant and also refusing to submit the issue of entrapment to the jury. The court ruled that 'as a matter of law' there was no entrapment. Verdict of guilty followed, motions in arrest, and to set aside the verdict as contrary to the law and the evidence, were denied, and defendant was sentenced to imprisonment for eighteen \n\n[287 U.S. 435, 439]\n\u00a0\n months. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment (57 F.(2d) 973), and this Court granted a writ of certiorari limited to the question whether the evidence was sufficient to go to the jury upon the issue of entrapment. \n287 \nU.S. 584\n, 53 S.Ct. 19, 77 L.Ed. --.\n The government, while supporting the conclusion of the court below, also urges that the defense, if available, should have been pleaded in bar to further proceedings under the indictment and could not be raised under the plea of not guilty. This question of pleading appropriately awaits the consideration of the nature and grounds of the defense.\n The substance of the testimony at the trial as to entrapment was as follows: For the government, one Martin, a prohibition agent, testified that having resided for a time in Haywood county, N.C., where he posed as a tourist, he visited defendant's home near Canton, on Sunday, July 13, 1930, accompanied by three residents of the county who knew the defendant well. He was introduced as a resident of Charlotte who was stopping for a time at Clyde. The witness ascertained that defendant was a veteran of the World War and a former member of the Thirtieth Division A.E.F. Witness informed defendant that he was also an ex-service man and a former member of the same Division, which was ture. Witness asked defendant if he could get the witness some liquor and defendant stated that he did not have any. Later there was a second request without result. One of those present, one Jones, was also an ex-service man and a former member of the Thirtieth Division, and the conversation turned to the war experiences of the three. After this, witness asked defendant for a third time to get him some liquor, whereupon defendant left his home and after a few minutes came back with a half gallon of liquor for which the witness paid defendant $5. Martin also testifed that he was 'the first and only person among those pres- \n\n[287 U.S. 435, 440]\n\u00a0\n ent at the time who said anything about securing some liquor,' and that his purpose was to prosecute the defendant for procuring and selling it. The government rested its case on Martin's testimony.\n Defendant called as witnesses the three persons who had accompanied the prohibition agent. In substance, they corroborated the latter's story but with some additions. Jones, a railroad employee, testified that he had introduced the agent to the defendant 'as a furniture dealer of Charlotte,' because the agent had so represented himself; that witness told defendant that the agent was 'an old 30th Division man' and the agent thereupon said to defendant that he 'would like to get a half gallon of whisky to take back to Charlotte to a friend' of his that was in the furniture business with him, and that defendant replied that he 'did not fool with whisky'; that the agent and his companions were at defendant's home 'for probably an hour or an hour and a half and that during such time the agent asked the defendant three or four or probably five times to get him, the agent, some liquor.' Defendant said 'he would go and see if he could get a half gallon of liquor,' and he returned with it after an absence of 'between twenty and thirty minutes.' Jones added that at that time he had never heard of defendant being in the liquor business, that he and the defendant were 'two old buddies,' and that he believed 'one former war buddy would get liquor for another.'\n Another witness, the timekeeper and assistant paymaster of the Champion Fibre Company at Canton, testified that defendant was an employee of that company and had been 'on his job continuously without missing a pay day since March, 1924.' Witness identified the time sheet showing this employment. This witness and three others who were neighbors of the defendant and had known him for many years testified to his good character. \n\n[287 U.S. 435, 441]\n\u00a0\n To rebut this testimony, the government called three witnesses who testified that the defendant had the general reputation of a rum runner. There was no evidence that the defendant had ever possessed or sold any intoxicating liquor prior to the transaction in question.\n It is clear that the evidence was sufficient to warrant a finding that the act for which defendant was prosecuted was instigated by the prohibition agent, that it was the creature of his purpose, that defendant had no previous disposition to commit it but was an industrious, law- abiding citizen, and that the agent lured defendant, otherwise innocent, to its commission by repeated and persistent solicitation in which he succeeded by taking advantage of the sentiment aroused by reminiscences of their experiences as companions in arms in the World War. Such a gross abuse of authority given for the purpose of detecting and punishing crime, and not for the making of criminals, deserves the severest condemnation; but the question whether it precludes prosecution or affords a ground of defense, and, if so, upon what theory, has given rise to conflicting opinions.\n It is well settled that the fact that officers or employees of the government merely afford opportunities or facilities for the commission of the offense does not defeat the prosecution. Artifice and stratagem may be employed to catch those engaged in criminal enterprises. Grimm v. United States, \n156 \nU.S. 604, 610\n, 15 S.Ct. 470; Goode v. United States, \n159 \nU.S. 663, 669\n, 16 S.Ct. 136; Rosen v. United States, \n161 \nU.S. 29, 42\n, 16 S.Ct. 434, 480; Andrews v. United States, \n162 \nU.S. 420, 423\n, 16 S.Ct. 798; Price v.

United States (C.C.A.) 289 F. 251.1 The appropriate object of this permitted activity, frequently essential to the enforcement of the law, is to \n\n[287 U.S. 435, 442]\n\u00a0\n reveal the criminal design; to expose the illicit traffic, the prohibited publication, the fraudulent use of the mails, the illegal conspiracy, or other offenses, and thus to disclose the would-be violators of the law. A different question is presented when the criminal design originates with the officials of the government, and they implant in the mind of an innocent person the disposition to commit the alleged offense and induce its commission in order that they may prosecute.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals reached the conclusion that the defense of entrapment can be maintained only where, as a result of inducement, the accused is placed in the attitude of having committed a crime which he did not intend to commit, or where, by reason of the consent implied in the inducement, no crime has in fact been committed. 57 F.(2d) page 974. As illustrating the first class, reference is made to the case of a sale of liquor to an Indian who was disguised so as to mislead the accused as to his identity. United States v. Healy (D.C.) 202 F. 349; Voves v. United States (C.C.A.) 249 F. 191. In the second class are found cases such as those of larceny or rape where want of consent is an element of the crime. Regina v. Fletcher, 8 Cox C.C. 131; Rex v. McDaniel, Fost. 121, 127, 128; Connor v. People, 18 Colo. 373, 33 P. 159, 25 L.R.A. 341, 36 Am.St.Rep. 295; Williams v. State of Georgia, 55 Ga. 391; United States v. Whittier, 5 Dill. 35, Fed. Cas. No. 16,688; State v. Adams, 115 N.C. 775, 20 S.E. 722. There may also be physical conditions which are essential to the offense and which do not exist in the case of a trap, as, for example, in the case of a prosecution for burglary where it appears that by reason of the trap there is no breaking. \n2\n Rex v. Egginton, 2 Leach, C.C. 913; Regina v. Johnson, Car. & Mar. 218; Saunders v. People, 38 Mich. 218; People v. McCord, 76 Mich. 200, 42 N.W. 1106; Allen v. State, 40 Ala. 334, 91 Am.Dec. 477; Love v.

But these decisions applying accepted principles to particular offenses, do not reach, much less determine, the present question. Neither in reasoning nor in effect do they prescribe limits for the doctrine of entrapment.\n While this Court has not spoken on the precise question (see Casey v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 413, 419\n, 423 S., 48 S.Ct. 373), the weight of authority in the lower federal courts is decidedly in favor of the view that in such case as the one before us the defense of entrapment is available. The government concedes that its contention, in supporting the ruling of the Circuit Court of Appeals, is opposed by decisions in all the other circuits except the Tenth Circuit, and no decision in that circuit suggesting a different view has been brought to our attention. See Capuano v. United States (C.C.A. 1st) 9 F.(2d) 41, 42; United States v. Lynch (D.C.S.D.N.Y., Hough, J.) 256 F. 983, 984; Lucadamo v. United States ( C.C.A.2d) 280 F. 653, 657, 658; Zucker v. United States (C.C.A.3d) 288 F. 12, 15; Gargano v. United States (C.C.A.5th) 24 F.(2d) 625, 626; Cermak v. United States (C.C.A.6th) 4 F.(2d) 99; O'Brien v. United States (C.C.A.7th) 51 F.(2d) 674, 679, 680; Butts v. United States (C.C.A.8th) 273 F. 35, 38, 18 A.L.R. 143; Woo Wai v. United States (C.C.A.9th) 223 F. 412. And the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Fourth Circuit, in the instant case, was able to reach its conclusion only by declining to follow the rule which it had laid down in its earlier decision in Newman v. United States (C.C.A.) 299 F. 128, 131.4 It \n\n[287 U.S. 435, 444]\n\u00a0\n should be added that in many cases in which the evidence has been found insufficient to support the defense of entrapment the availability of that defense, on a showing of such facts as are present here, has been recognized. \n5\n The federal courts have generally approved the statement of Circuit Judge Sanborn in the leading case of Butts v. United States, supra, as follows: 'The first duties of the officers of the law are to prevent, not to punish crime. It is not their duty to incite to and create crime for the sole purpose of prosecuting and punishing it. Here the evidence strongly tends to prove, if it does not conclusively do so, that their first and chief endeavor was to cause, to create, crime in order to punish it, and it is unconscionable, contrary to public policy, and to the established law of the land to punish a man for the commission of an offense of the like of which he had never been guilty, either in thought or in deed, and evidently never would have been guilty of if the officers of the law had not inspired, incited, persuaded, and lured him to attempt to com- \n\n[287 U.S. 435, 445]\n\u00a0\n mit it.' The judgment in that case was reversed because of the 'fatal error' of the trial court in refusing to instruct the jury to that effect. In Newman v. United States, supra, the applicable principle was thus stated by Circuit Judge Woods: 'It is well settled that decoys may be used to entrap criminals, and to present opportunity to one intending or willing to commit crime. But decoys are not permissible to ensnare the innocent and lawabiding into the commission of crime. When the criminal design originates, not with the accused, but is conceived in the mind of the government officers, and the accused is by persuasion, deceitful representation, or inducement lured into the commission of a criminal act, the government is estopped by sound public policy from prosecution therefor.' These quotations sufficiently indicate the grounds of the decisions above cited.\n The validity of the principle as thus stated and applied is challenged both upon theoretical and practical grounds. The argument, from the standpoint of principle, is that the court is called upon to try the accused for a particular offense which is defined by statute and that, if the evidence shows that this offense has knowingly been committed, it matters not that its commission was induced by officers of the government in the manner and circumstances assumed. It is said that where one intentionally does an act in circumstances known to him, and the particular conduct is forbidden by the law in those circumstances, he intentionally breaks the law in the only sense in which the law considers intent. Ellis v. United States, \n206 \nU.S. 246, 257\n, 27 S.Ct. 600, 11 Ann.Cas. 589. Moreover, that as the statute is designed to redress a public wrong, and not a private injury, there is no ground for holding the government estopped by the conduct of its officers from prosecuting the offender. To the suggestion of public policy the objectors answer that the Legislature, acting within its constitutional au- \n\n[287 U.S. 435, 446]\n\u00a0\n thority, is the arbiter of public policy6 and that, where conduct is expressly forbidden and penalized by a valid statute, the courts are not at liberty to disregard the law and to bar a prosecution for its violation because they are of the opinion that the crime has been instigated by government officials.\n It is manifest that these arguments rest entirely upon the letter of the statute. They take no account of the fact that its application in the circumstances under consideration is foreign to its purpose; that such an application is so shocking to the sense of justice that it has been urged that it is the duty of the court to stop the prosecution in the interest of the government itself, to protect it from the illegal conduct of its officers and to preserve the purity of its courts. Casey v. United States, supra. But can an application of the statute having such an effect- creating a situation so contrary to the purpose of the law and so inconsistent with its proper enforcement as to invoke such a challenge- fairly be deemed to be within its intendment?\n Literal interpretation of statutes at the expense of the reason of the law and producing absurd consequences or flagrant injustice has frequently been condemned. In United States v. Palmer, 3 Wheat. 610, 631, Chief Justice Marshall, in construing the Act of Congress of April 30, 1790, section 8 (1 Stat. 113), relating to robbery on the high seas, found that the words 'any person or persons' were 'broad enough to comprehend every human being,' but he concluded that 'general words must not only be limited to cases within the jurisdiction of the state, but also to those objects to which the legislature intended to apply them.' In United States v. Kirby, 7 Wall. 482, the case arose under the Act of Congress of March 3, 1825 \n\n[287 U.S. 435, 447]\n\u00a0\n (4 Stat. 104,  9), providing for the conviction of any person who 'shall, knowingly and wilfully, obstruct or retard the passage of the mail, or of any driver or carrier ... carrying the same.' Considering the purpose of the statute, the Court held that it had no application to the obstruction or retarding of the passage of the mail or of its carrier by reason of the arrest of the carrier upon a warrant issued by a state court. The Court said: 'All laws should receive a sensible construction. General terms should be so limited in their application as not to lead to injustice, oppression, or an absured consequence. It will always, therefore, be presumed that the legislature intended exceptions to its language, which would avoid results of this character. The reason of the law in such cases should prevail over its letter.' And the Court supported this conclusion by reference to the classical illustrations found in Puffendorf and Plowden. Id., pages 486, 487 of 7 Wall.\n Applying this principle in Lau Ow Bew v. United States, \n144 \nU.S. 47\n, 12 S.Ct. 517, 518, the Court decided that a statute requiring the permission of the Chinese government, and identification by certificate, of 'every Chinese person, other than a laborer,' entitled by treaty or the act of Congress to come within the United States, did not apply to Chinese merchants already domiciled in the United States, who had left the country for temporary purposes, animo revertendi, and sought to re-enter it on their return to their business and their homes. And in United States v. Katz, \n271 \nU.S. 354, 362\n, 46 S.Ct. 513, 516, construing title 2, section 10 of the National Prohibition Act (27 USCA  22) so as to avoid an unreasonable application of its words, if taken literally, the Court again declared that 'general terms descriptive of a class of persons made subject to a criminal statute may and should be limited, where the literal application of the statute would lead to extreme or absurd results, and where the legislative pur- \n\n[287 U.S. 435, 448]\n\u00a0\n pose gathered from the whole act would be satisfied by a more limited interpretation.' \n7\n See, to the same effect, Heydenfeldt v. Daney Gold & S. Min. Company, \n93 U.S. 634\n, 638; Carlisle v. United States, 16 Wall. 147, 153; Oates v. National Bank, \n100 U.S. 239\n; Chew Heong v. United States, \n112 \nU.S. 536, 555\n, 5 S.Ct. 255; Holy Trinity Church v. United States, \n143 U.S. 457\n, 459-462, 12 S.Ct. 511; Hawaii v. Mankichi, \n190 U.S. 197\n, 212-214, 23 S. Ct. 787; Jacobson v. Massachusetts, \n197 \nU.S. 11, 39\n, 25 S. Ct. 358, 3 Ann.Cas. 765; United States v. Jin Fuey Moy, \n241 \nU.S. 394, 402\n, 36 S.Ct. 658; Baender v. Barnett, \n255 \nU.S. 224, 226\n, 41 S.Ct. 271; United States v. Chemical Foundation, \n272 \nU.S. 1, 18\n, 47 S.Ct. 1.\n We think that this established principle of construction is applicable here. We are unable to conclude that it was the intention of the Congress in enacting this statute that its processes of detection and enforcement should be abused by the instigation by government officials of an act on the part of persons otherwise innocent in order to lure them to its commission and to punish them. We are not forced by the letter to do violence to the spirit and purpose of the statute. This, we think, has been the underlying and controlling thought in the suggestions in judicial opinions that the government in such a case is estopped to prosecute or that the courts should bar the prosecution. If the requirements of the highest public policy in the maintenance of the integrity \n\n[287 U.S. 435, 449]\n\u00a0\n of administration would preclude the enforcement of the statute in such circumstances as are present here, the same considerations justify the conclusion that the case lies outside the purview of the act and that its general words should not be construed to demand a proceeding at once inconsistent with that policy and abhorrent to the sense of justice. This view does not derogate from the authority of the court to deal appropriately with abuses of its process and it obviates the objection to the exercise by the court of a dispensing power in forbidding the prosecution of one who is charged with conduct assumed to fall within the statute.\n We are unable to approve the view that the court, although treating the statute as applicable despite the entrapment, and the defendant as guilty, has authority to grant immunity, or to adopt a procedure to that end. It is the function of the court to construe the statute, not to defeat it as construed. Clemency is the function of the Executive. Ex parte United States, \n242 \nU.S. 27, 42\n, 37 S.Ct. 72, 74, L.R.A. 1917E, 1178, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 355. In that case, this Court decisively denied such authority to free guilty defendants, in holding that the court had no power to suspend sentences indefinitely. The Court, speaking by Chief Justice White, said: 'If it be that the plain legislative command fixing a specific punishment for crime is subject to be permanently set aside by an implied judicial power upon considerations extraneous to the legality of the conviction, it would seem necessarily to follow that there could be likewise implied a discretionary authority to permanently refuse to try a criminal charge because of the conclusion that a particular act made criminal by law ought not to be treated as criminal. And thus it would come to pass that the possession by the judicial department of power to permanently refuse to enforce a law would result in the destruction of the conceded powers of the other departments, and hence leave no law to be enforced.' And while recognizing the hu- \n\n[287 U.S. 435, 450]\n\u00a0\n mane considerations which had led judges to adopt the practice of suspending sentences indefinitely in certain cases, the Court found no ground for approving the practice 'since its exercise, in the very nature of things, amounts to a refusal by the judicial power to perform a duty resting upon it, and, as a consequence thereof, to an interference with both the legislative and executive authority as fixed by the Constitution.' Id., pages 51, 52 of 242 U.S., 37 S.Ct. 72, 78. Where defendant has been duly indicted for an offense found to be within the statute, and the proper authorities seek to proceed with the prosecutioin, the court cannot refuse to try the case in the constitutional method because it desires to let the defendant go free.\n Suggested analogies from procedure in civil cases are not helpful. When courts of law refuse to sustain alleged causes of action which grow out of illegal schemes, the applicable law itself denies the right to recover. Where courts of equity refuse equitable relief because complainants come with unclean hands, they are administering the principles of equitable jurisprudence governing equitable rights. But in a criminal prosecution, the statute defining the offense is necessarily the law of the case.\n To construe statutes so as to avoid absurd or glaringly unjust results, foreign to the legislative purpose, is, as we have seen, a traditional and appropriate function of the courts. Judicial nullification of statutes, admittedly valid and applicable, has, happily, no place in our system. The Congress by legislation can always, if it desires, alter the effect of judicial construction of statutes. We conceive it to be our duty to construe the statute here in question reasonably, and we hold that it is beyond our prerogative to give the statute an unreasonable construction, confessedly contrary to public policy, and then to decline to enforce it.\n The conclusion we have reached upon these grounds carries its own limitation. We are dealing with a statu- \n\n[287 U.S. 435, 451]\n\u00a0\n tory prohibition and we are simply concerned to ascertain whether in the light of a plain public policy and of the proper administration of justice, conduct induced as stated should be deemed to be within that prohibition. We have no occasion to consider hypothetical cases of crimes so heinous or revolting that the applicable law would admit of no exceptions. No such situation is presented here. The question in each case must be determined by the scope of the law considered in the light of what may fairly be deemed to be its object.\n Objections to the defense of entrapment are also urged upon practical grounds. But considerations of mere convenience must yield to the essential demands of justice. The argument is pressed that if the defense is available it will lead to the introduction of issues of a collateral character relating to the activities of the officials of the government and to the conduct and purposes of the defendant previous to the alleged offense. For the defense of entrapment is not simply that the particular act was committed at the instance of government officials. That is often the case where the proper action of these officials leads to the revelation of criminal enterprises. Grimm v. United States, supra. The predisposition and criminal design of the defendant are relevant. But the issues raised and the evidence adduced must be pertinent to the controlling question whether the defendant is a person otherwise innocent whom the government is seeking to punish for an alleged offense which is the product of the creative activity of its own officials. If that is the fact, common justice requires that the accused be permitted to prove it. The government in such a case is in no position to object to evidence of the activities of its representatives in relation to the accused, and if the defendant seeks acquittal by reason of entrapment he cannot complain of an appropriate and searching inquiry into his own conduct and predisposition as bearing upon that issue. If in con- \n\n[287 U.S. 435, 452]\n\u00a0\n sequence he suffers a disadvantage, he has brought it upon himself by reason of the nature of the defense.\n What has been said indicates the answer to the contention of the government that the defense of entrapment must be pleaded in bar to further proceedings under the indictment and cannot be raised under the plea of not guilty. This contention presupposes that the defense is available to the accused and relates only to the manner in which it shall be presented. The government considers the defense as analogous to a plea of pardon or of autrefois convict or autrefois acquit. It is assumed that the accused is not denying his guilt but is setting up special facts in bar upon which he relies regardless of his guilt or innocence of the crime charged. This, as we have seen, is a misconception. The defense is available, not in the view that the accused though guilty may go free, but that the government cannot be permitted to contend that he is guilty of a crime where the government officials are the instigators of his conduct. The federal courts in sustaining the defense in such circumstances have proceeded in the view that the defendant is not guilty. The practice of requiring a plea in bar has not obtained. Fundamentally, the question is whether the defense, if the facts bear it out, takes the case out of the purview of the statute because it cannot be supposed that the Congress intended that the letter of its enactment should be used to support such a gross perversion of its purpose.\n We are of the opinion that upon the evidence produced in the instant case the defense of entrapment was available and that the trial court was in error in holding that as a matter of law there was no entrapment and in refusing to submit the issue to the jury.\n The judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n[287 U.S. 435, 453]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS is of the opinion that the judgment below should be affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS.\n The facts set forth in the court's opinion establish that a prohibition enforcement officer instigated the commission of the crime charged. The courts below held that the showing was insufficient, as matter of law, to sustain the claim of entrapment, and that the jury were properly instructed to ignore that defense in their consideration of the case. A conviction resulted. The government maintains that the issue of entrapment is not triable under the plea of not guilty, but should be raised by plea in bar or be adjudicated in some manner by the court rather than by the jury, and as the trial court properly decided the question, the record presents no reversible error. I think, however, the judgment should be reversed, but for reasons and upon grounds other than those stated in the opinion of the court.\n Of late the term 'entrapment' has been adopted by the courts to signify instigation of crime by officers of government. The cases in which such incitement has been recognized as a defense have grown to an amazing total. 8 The increasing frequency of the assertion that the defendant was entrapped is doubtless due to the creation by statute of many new crimes ( e.g., sale and transportation of liquor and narcotics) and the correlative establishment of special enforcement bodies for the detection and punishment of offenders. The efforts of members of these forces to obtain arrests and convictions have too often been marked by reprehensible methods.\n Society is at war with the criminal classes, and courts have uniformly held that in waging this warfare the forces of prevention and detection may use traps, decoys, and \n\n[287 U.S. 435, 454]\n\u00a0\n deception to obtain evidence of the commission of crime. Resort to such means does not render an indictment thereafter found a nullity nor call for the exclusion of evidence so procured. \n9\n But the defense here asserted involves more than obtaining evidence by artifice or deception. Entrapment is the conception and planning of an offense by an officer, and his procurement of its commission by one who would not have perpetrated it except for the trickery, persuasion, or fraud of the officer. Federal and state courts have held that substantial proof of entrapment as thus defined calls for the submission of the issue to the jury and warrants an acquittal. The reasons assigned in support of this procedure have not been uniform. Thus it has been held that the acts of its officers estop the government to prove the offense. The result has also been justified by the mere statement of the rule that where entrapment is proved the defendant is not guilty of the crime charged. Often the defense has been permitted upon grounds of public policy, which the courts formulate by saying they will not permit their process to be used in aid of a scheme for the actual creation of a crime by those whose duty is to deter its commission.\n This court has adverted to the doctrine,10 but has not heretofore had occasion to determine its validity, the basis on which it should rest, or the procedure to be followed when it is involved. The present case affords the opportunity to settle these matters as respects the administration of the federal criminal law.\n There is common agreement that where a law officer envisages a crime, plans it, and activates its commission by one not theretofore intending its perpetration, for the sole purpose of obtaining a victim through indictment, conviction and sentence, the consummation of so revolting a plan \n\n[287 U.S. 435, 455]\n\u00a0\n ought not to be permitted by any self respecting tribunal. Equally true is this whether the offense is one at common law or merely a creature of statute. Public policy forbids such sacrifice of decency. The enforcement of this policy calls upon the court, in every instance where alleged entrapment of a defendant is brought to its notice, to ascertain the facts, to appraise their effect upon the administration of justice, and to make such order with respect to the further prosecution of the cause as the circumstances require.\n This view calls for no distinction between crimes mala in se and statutory offenses of lesser gravity; requires no statutory construction, and attributes no merit to a guilty defendant; but frankly recognizes the true foundation of the doctrine in the public policy which protects the purity of government and its processes. Always the courts refuse their aid in civil cases to the perpetration and consummation of an illegal scheme. Invariably they hold a civil action must be abated if its basis is violation of the decencies of life, disregard of the rules, statutory or common law, which formulate the ethics of men's relations to each other. Neither courts of equity nor those administering legal remedies tolerate the use of their process to consummate a wrong. \n11\n The doctrine of entrapment in criminal law is the analogue of the same rule applied in civil proceedings. And this is the real basis of the decisions approving the defense of entrapment, though in statement the rule is cloaked under a declaration that the government is estopped or the defendant has not been proved guilty.\n A new method of rationalizing the defense is now asserted. This is to construe the act creating the offense by \n\n[287 U.S. 435, 456]\n\u00a0\n reading in a condition or proviso that if the offender shall have been entrapped into crime the law shall not apply to him. So, it is said, the true intent of the legislature will be effectuated. This seems a strained and unwarranted construction of the statute; and amounts, in fact, to judicial amendment. It is not merely broad construction, but addition of an element not contained in the legislation. The constituents of the offense are enumerated by the statute. If we assume the defendant to have been a person of upright purposes, law abiding, and not prone to crime,- induced against his own will and better judgment to become the instrument of the criminal purpose of another,-his action, so induced, none the less falls within the letter of the law and renders him amenable to its penalties. Viewed in its true light entrapment is not a defense to him; his act, coupled with his intent to do the act, brings him within the definition of the law; he has no rights or equities by reason of his entrapment. It cannot truly be said that entrapment excuses him or contradicts the obvious fact of his commission of the offense. We cannot escape this conclusion by saying that where need arises the statute will be read as containing an implicit condition that it shall not apply in the case of entrapment. The effect of such construction is to add to the words of the statute a proviso which gives to the defendant a double defense under his plea of not guilty, namely, (a) that what he did does not fall within the definition of the statute, and (b) entrapment. This amounts to saying that one who with full intent commits the act defined by law as an offense is nevertheless by virtue of the unspoken and implied mandate of the statute to be adjudged not guilty by reason of someone else's improper conduct. It is merely to adopt a form of words to justify action which ought to be based on the inherent right of the court not to be made the instrument of wrong.\n It is said that this case warrants such a construction of the applicable act, but that the question whether a similar \n\n[287 U.S. 435, 457]\n\u00a0\n construction will be required in the case of other or more serious crimes is not before the court. Thus no guide or rule is announced as to when a statute shall be read as excluding a case of entrapment; and no principle of statutory construction is suggested which would enable us to say that it is excluded by some statutes and not by others.\n The doctrine rests, rather, on a fundamental rule of public policy. The protection of its own functions and the preservation of the purity of its own temple belongs only to the court. It is the province of the court and of the court alone to protect itself and the government from such prostitution of the criminal law. The violation of the principles of justice by the entrapment of the unwary into crime should be dealt with by the court no matter by whom or at what stage of the proceedings the facts are brought to its attention. \n12\n Quite properly it may discharge the prisoner upon a writ of habeas corpus. 13 Equally well may it quash the indictment or entertain and try a plea in bar. \n14\n But its powers do not end there. Proof of entrapment, at any stage of the case, requires the court to stop the prosecution, direct that the indictment be quashed, and the defendant set at liberty. \n15\n If in doubt as to the facts it may submit the issue of entrapment to a jury for advice. But whatever may be the finding upon such submission the power and the duty to act remain with the court and not with the jury. \n\n[287 U.S. 435, 458]\n\u00a0\n Such action does not grant immunity to a guilty defendant. But to afford him as his right a defense founded not on the statute, but on the court's view of what the ligislature is assumed to have meant, is to grant him unwarranted immunity. If the court may construe an act of Congress so as to create a defense for one whose guilt the act pronounces, no reason is apparent why the same statute may not be modified by a similar process of construction as to the penalty prescribed. But it is settled that this may not be done. Ex parte United States, \n242 \nU.S. 27\n, 37 S.Ct. 72, L.R.A. 1917E, 1178, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 355. The broad distinction between the refusal to lend the aid of the court's own processes to the consummation of a wrong and the attempt to modify by judicial legislation the mandate of the statute as to the punishment to be imposed after trial and conviction is so obvious as not to need discussion.\n Recognition of the defense of entrapment as belonging to the defendant and as raising an issue for decision by the jury called to try him upon plea of the general issue, results in the trial of a false issue wholly outside the true rule which should be applied by the courts. It has been generally held, where the defendant has proved an entrapment, it is permissible for the government to show in rebuttal that the officer guilty of incitement of the crime had reasonable cause to believe the defendant was a person disposed to commit the offense. This procedure is approved by the opinion of the court. The proof received in rebuttal usually amounts to no more than that the defendant had a bad reputation, or that he had been previously convicted. Is the statute upon which the indictment is based to be further construed as removing the defense of entrapment from such a defendant?\n Whatever may be the demerits of the defendant or his previous infractions of law these will not justify the instigation and creation of a new crime, as a means to reach him and punish him for his past misdemeanors. He has committed the crime in question, but, by supposition, \n\n[287 U.S. 435, 459]\n\u00a0\n only because of instigation and inducement by a government officer. To say that such conduct by an official of government is condoned and rendered innocuous by the fact that the defendant had a bad reputation or had previously transgressed is wholly to disregard the reason for refusing the processes of the court to consummate an abhorrent transaction. It is to discard the basis of the doctrine and in effect to weigh the equities as between the government and the defendant when there are in truth no equities belonging to the latter, and when the rule of action cannot rest on any estimate of the good which may come of the conviction of the offender by foul means. The accepted procedure, in effect, pivots conviction in such cases, not on the commission of the crime charged, but on the prior reputation or some former act or acts of the defendant not mentioned in the indictment.\n The applicable principle is that courts must be closed to the trial of a crime instigated by the government's own agents. No other issue, no comparison of equities as between the guilty official and the guilty defendant, has any place in the enforcement of this overruling principle of public policy.\n The judgment should be reversed and the cause remanded to the District Court with instructions to quash the indictment and discharge the defendant.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice STONE concur in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See, also, Regina v.

CO. v. UNITED STATES(1932)\nNo. 339\nArgued: February 15, 1932Decided: March 14, 1932\n\n\n\n\n[285 U.S. 240, 241]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Charles H. Bates, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Charles B. Rugg, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner operates a railway system comprising certain lines of railroad constructed with the aid of congressional grants of public lands. During the years 1920-1923, both inclusive, the company, upon transportation requests issued by the War Department, the Navy Department, and the Marine Corps of the United States, transported military prisoners and their guards; officers of the reserve corps traveling to and from encampments under orders of the Secretary of War; members of the nurse corps of the navy; engineer officers of the War Department in duty in connection with river and harbor works and the California De bris Commission; escorts accompanying the remains of deceased soldiers; enlisted men changing station or returning thereto; officers of the army proceeding to their homes after date of their retirement; and stranded enlisted men of the navy traveling \n\n[285 U.S. 240, 242]\n\u00a0\n back to their proper stations. In settling petitioner's accounts for transportation so furnished, or in adjusting those previously settled, the United States, through its disbursing officers, made or required petitioner to make certain deductions from the amounts due at regular commercial fares, on the ground that the persons transported were troops of the United States within the meaning of the applicable land grant laws, appropriation acts, and land grant equalization agreements. Payment on this basis was accepted under protest. Suit was instituted in the Court of Claims to recover the amounts deducted, the claim being that none of the persons with respect to whose transportation deduction had been made came within the purview of the statutes and agreements requiring the company to carry troops of the United States at reduced fares. The Court of Claims entered judgment for the petitioner on certain items of the claim, but as to most of them found in favor of the United States. A petition for certiorari was filed, and the writ was granted, \n284 \nU.S. 611\n, 52 S. Ct. 128, 76 L. Ed. -, 'limited to the question raised with respect to Engineer officers of the War Department in performing duties in time of peace in connection with rivers and harbors immprovements and the meetings of the California De bris Commission.'\n A portion of what is now petitioner's railroad system was granted aid by the Act of July 27, 1866 (14 Stat. 292). The act made the railroad a post route and military road, the charges of which should be subject to such regulations a Congress might impose. \n1\n With respect \n\n[285 U.S. 240, 243]\n\u00a0\n to the line in question to army appropriation acts provide that such railroad 'having claims against the United States for transportation of troops and munitions of war and military supplies and property ... shall be paid out of the moneys appropriated by the foregoing provisions only on the basis of such rate for the transportation of such troops and munitions of war and military supplies and property as the Secretary of War shall deem just and reasonable under the foregoing provision, such rate not to exceed 50 per centum of the compensation of such government transportation as shall at that time be charged to and paid by private parties to any such company for like and similar transportation; and the amount so fixed to be paid shall be accepted as in full for all demands for such service.' \n 2\n\u00a0\n\n As respects another division of petitioner's system, the grant of lands was under the Act of July 25, 1866 (14 Stat. 239, 240, 241), which provided: 'And said railroad shall be and remain a public highway for the use of the government of the United States, free of all toll or other charges upon the transportation of the property or troops of the United States.' Section 5. This clause was construed in Lake Superior & Mississippi R. R. Co. v. United States, \n93 U.S. 442\n, as conferring only the free use of the roadbed as a highway. Under appropriate legislation following that decision, payment of compensation has been made by the United States for transportation of property and troops at 50 per cent. of that charged to private parties. See United States v. Union Pacific R. R. Co., \n249 \nU.S. 354\n, 39 S. Ct. 294. \n\n[285 U.S. 240, 244]\n\u00a0\n The Government and certain railroads have entered into so-called equalization agreements and joint arrangements for military transportation which provide for deductions additional to the 50 per cent. required by the statutes. The petitioner is a party to these agreements, which have been construed generally as applying to charges for transportation of the same classes of persons of whom the land grant rates would be applicable. Both the petitioner and the Court of Claims have so treated these agreements and arrangements, and our decision under the statutes may be taken to apply to deductions under these contracts.\n This court had occasion in the Union Pacific Case, supra to pass upon the meaning and scope of the phrase 'troops of the United States' as used in the land grant legislation and in the agreements. What was there said is apposite to expenditures under appropriation acts which use the same phraseology and apply to transportation over petitioner's railroad. The opinion in that case demonstrates that the word 'troops' was intentionally used in contradistinction to the words any persons in the service of the United States, or their equivalent, and holds that the word 'troops' had, at the time of the passage of the land grant acts, and ever since has had, an established meaning, namely, 'soldiers collectively-a body of soldiers.'\n Thus the test is whether the person to be transported is one of such a collective body of soldiers. The reduced rate is applicable to a person so described, although he may not be traveling as part of a detachment or moving body of men. Illinois Central R. R. Co. v. United States, 62 Ct. Cl. 61; Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry. Co. v. United States, 58 Ct. Cl. 33. In the Union Pacific Case it was pointed out that although certain persons were properly characterized as members of the army and as having official relation thereto, they could not, at the time of their transportation, be classified as part of the \n\n[285 U.S. 240, 245]\n\u00a0\n troops of the United States, as, for example, a furloughed soldier returning to his station or retired soldiers en route to their homes after retirement.\n The narrow question presented for decision is whether engineer officers cease to be members of the military forces or 'troops of the United States' when they are assigned to duty in connection with the improvement of rivers and harbors or the work of the California De bris Commission.\n While, as is argued by the United States, river and harbor improvement has in one aspect a bearing upon the military defense of the United States, obviously the principal purpose of this work is the promotion of commerce and transportation, by maintaining and deepening channels, and constructing dikes, jetties, and other works which effect the improvement of navigation generally.\n The California De bris Commission was created by the Act of March 1, 1893 (27 Stat. 507 (33 USCA  661 et seq.)), which authorized the appointment of a commission from officers of the corps of engineers of the United States army, whose duty was to mature and adopt a plan or plans to improve the navigability of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers in California, deepen their channels, and protect their banks, with a view of preventing encroachment and damage from de bris resulting from mining operations, natural erosion, or other causes, and restoring as far as practicable the navigability of the rivers to the condition existing in 1860. The commission was to permit mining by hydraulic processes, provided this could be done without injury to the navigability of the rivers or to the lands adjacent thereto. Quite evidently this work is of a nonmilitary nature and in the interest of commerce and navigation.\n Conceding that engineer officers of the United States army perform a true military function when engaged in work on the military defences of the United States, and, when so engaged form a part of the nation's troops, we \n\n[285 U.S. 240, 246]\n\u00a0\n are of opinion that their activity in connection with rivers and harbors work and the California De bris Commission is nonmilitary in character, and falls within the same category as that of many other employees and officials of the War Department, the nature of whose service excludes them from classification as part of the 'troops of the United States.'\n Congress has recognized that such service by engineer officers is nonmilitary. For example, in the Army Appropriation Act for 1930, approved February 28, 1929 (45 Stat. 1349, 1374, 1379), title 1 deals with military activities and expenses of the War Department incident thereto. Title 2 has to do with nonmilitary activities of the War Department, and under the subtitle 'Corps of Engineers' makes appropriation for defraying the expenses of the California De bris Commission, and also for the rivers and harbors improvement work of the United States to be carried on under the control and supervision of the Chief of Engineers of the War Department. The Secretary of War, in his annual reports, under the caption 'Civil Activities of the Corps of Engineers,' mentions rivers and harbors work and that of the California De bris Commission. \n 3\n\u00a0\n\n The Court of Claims held the view that as respects engineer officers employed in the capacities mentioned the government was entitled to the deduction of 50 per cent. under the terms of the land-grant acts and appropriations pursuant thereto and other deductions under the equalization agreement and joint military arrangements. For the reasons given we are of the contrary opinion, and accordingly reverse the judgment of the Court of Claims and remand the cause for further proceedings in conformity herewith.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of July 27, 1866, 14 Stat. 292,  11.

Milner, both of Louisville, Ky., for appellants.\n Mr. Charles N. Hobson, of Frankfort, Ky., for the Commonwealth of Kentucky.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case involves franchise taxes imposed by Kentucky in respect of railroad lines in that state that are a part of the system of appellant, the Southern Railway Company, a Virginia corporation, and here referred to as the Southern system. A judgment of the circuit court of \n\n[284 U.S. 338, 340]\n\u00a0\n Woodford county affirmed in the highest court of the state, 204 Ky. 388, 264 S. W. 850, determined that there remained unpaid franchise taxes to be assessed on values of intangible elements amounting to.$1,730.090.02 for 1918 and $3,028,592.62 for 1919. These additional values were attributed solely to 127.63 miles of railroad in that state belonging to a Kentucky corporation, the Southern Railway Company in Kentucky. The lines of the Cincinnati, New Orleans & Texas Pacific Railway Company had been held to form a part of the system, but that company paid taxes in Kentucky upon its tangible property and also franchise taxes calculated on the basis of its own net earnings. The commonwealth originally made no claim against appellants for any taxes in respect of that company's lines. This court, \n274 \nU.S. 76\n, 47 S. Ct. 542, reversed the judgment of the state court on the ground that the additional values attributed to such 127.63 miles were so excessive and arbitrary as in reality to include property outside Kentucky and that the enforcement by that state of franchise taxes based thereon would violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n After receiving our opinion and mandate, the Court of Appeals of Kentucky remanded the case to the circuit court; and there the commonwealth amended its petition so as to claim, in addition to its earlier demands, franchise taxes in respect of the Kentucky mileage of the Cincinnati, New Orleans & Texas Pacific. The facts were stipulated. Appellant maintained below that the proceedings were in conflict with our mandate and that to enforce the taxes claimed would be to tax property outside the commonwealth. The court adjudged the commonwealth entitled to recover as to the Kentucky mileage of both companies on the basis of the same values that in the former judgment had been assigned to the line of the Southern Railway Company in Kentucky alone. The Court of Appeals affirmed. 238 \n\n[284 U.S. 338, 341]\n\u00a0\n Ky. 638, 38 S.W.(2d) 696. This appeal is under 28 U. S. C.,  344(a), 28 USCA  344(a).\n Our former decision merely held that the particular application of the state statute then under consideration was repugnant to the due process clause. The judgment now before us is based on a different claim. The remanding of the case by the Court of Appeals and the filing of an amended petition in the circuit court by the commonwealth and the trial thereon were not inconsistent with the mandate of this court. Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Hill, \n193 \nU.S. 551, 553\n, 24 S. Ct. 538; Wolff Packing Co. v. Industrial Relations Court, \n267 \nU.S. 552, 562\n, 45 S. Ct. 441.\n The additional values adjudged are based on average net earnings per mile of the system in the year preceding that for which the franchise taxes are imposed. As shown in our former opinion, net earnings of the 127. 63 miles of the Southern Railway in Kentucky were very small for 1917 and there was a large deficit in 1918. But the net earnings per mile of the Cincinnati, New Orleans & Texas Pacific, having 197.5 miles in Kentucky, for both years were high when compared with the average of the system. The values on which the last-mentioned company separately paid franchise taxes were excluded.\n The Kentucky mileage used in the calculations included certain trackage rights and also the Kentucky lines of the Mobile & Ohio, the Cumberland Railroad, and the Cumberland Railway. The Court of Appeals held that the lines of these three companies were not a part of the system. Commonwealth v. Southern R. Co., 193 Ky. 474, 481, 237 S. W. 11. But the commonwealth shows that, taking both years together, the additional values so arrived at are much less than if the computation had been correctly made. The error operates to the advantage of appellants. They have not shown, and but faintly claim, that when attributed to the entire system mileage in Kentucky, the additional values are so excessive or arbitrary as to \n\n[284 U.S. 338, 342]\n\u00a0\n amount to the inclusion of property outside the state. On this record, it cannot be said that the enforcement of franchise taxes on the basis of values established by the judgment would deprive appellants of their property in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The judgment requires that, in addition to the taxes levied for the two years, there shall be paid a penalty of 20 per cent. on the taxes based on the omitted assessment 'which shall be collected and accounted for as other taxes.' Ky. St.  4241. Seventy-five per cent. of the amount so added is for the compensation of officers prosecuting the action. The appellant company maintains that it is not liable for the taxes or the penalty because during 1918 and 1919 the system was in the possession and control of the Director General. And the latter says that the enforcement of the penalty against him would violate the acts of Congress under which the railroads were taken and operated.\n Neither contention can be sustained.\n The opinion below shows that the property was not assessed when it should have been because of the failure of the company to report as required. It was not relieved of that duty by any federal law. On the contrary, the Act of March 21, 1918, 40 Stat. 451, after requiring every agreement for compensation to the carriers to provide that all taxes during the period of federal control other than certain war taxes should be paid out of operating revenues, section 1, declares that nothing in the act should be construed to amend, repeal, impair or affect the existing laws or powers of the states in relation to taxation. Section 15. Whatever may be the rights of the company as between it and the Director General, its obligations under state tax laws remain unaffected by federal enactments.\n Referring to the enforcement of the judgment, the Court of Appeals said (page 661 of 238 Ky., 38 S.W.(2d) 696, 706): \n\n[284 U.S. 338, 343]\n\u00a0\n 'The state cannot compel the government of the United States to pay the taxes or the penalty, but it has a lien on the property which should have been assessed to secure the payment of the taxes,' and declared that the penalty is not one where the element of punishment predominates.

Alderman, of Washington, D. C., for petitioners.\n Mr. Wm. C. Wolfe, of Orangeburg, S. C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent brought this action under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (45 USCA  51-59) to recover for the death of her intestate, a conductor in petitioners' employ, who was killed in a head-on collision while riding on the engine of an \n\n[286 U.S. 313, 314]\n\u00a0\n extra train. Petitioners operate a single track railroad between Charleston and Columbia, S. C., through Branchville, Orangeburg, St. Matthews, and Ft. Motte. Trains running from Columbia to Charleston are designated east bound, and those from Charleston to Columbia west bound. On the morning of the accident the engine of a west-bound freight train became disabled at Ft. Motte, a station nineteen miles west of Orangeburg. A yard engine kept at Branchville, eighteen miles east of Orangeburg, was ordered to go to its relief. This locomotive, running light, was designated as Extra 483 West, and had a crew consisting of respondent's intestate as conductor, an engineer, and a fireman. A freight train known as Extra 723 East was moving eastwardly from Columbia to Charleston, and it was necessary for the two to meet and pass somewhere on the line. The train dispatcher at Charleston sent a telegraphic order to Branchville, the place of departure of Extra 483, and to Orangeburg, the selected passing point, as follows:\n'Extra 723 East get this order and meet Extra 483 West at Orangeburg. Engine 483 run extra Branchville to Andrews.'\n\n Such an order is known as a form 31, which has to be signed for by the conductor when delivered to him. The order was transmitted and received by the operators at Branchville and Orangeburg as a 'three-copy' order and the operator at Branchville accordingly made three copies, one for his file and two which he delivered to respondent's intestate, who signed for the same and delivered one to the engineer. They read it in the presence of the fireman before leaving Branchville. There was nothing on the face of the order to indicate that No. 483 would be given additional copies of it, or would receive any other order, at Orangeburg, the designated passing point. The Charleston dispatcher intended that this order as transmitted to Orangeburg, and addressed at that point to 'Extra 723 \n\n[286 U.S. 313, 315]\n\u00a0\n East and operator,' should be what is known as a 'five-copy' order-that is, that the operator at Orangeburg should make five copies, one for his file and two to be delivered to the conductor of each of the trains which were to pass at that point. Through some oversight the Orangeburg operator received the message as a three-copy order, one of which would be retained for his file and the other two given to the conductor of Extra 723 East. Thus there were no copies for delivery, as intended, to respondent's intestate, the conductor of Extra 483 West, as there would have been had the order been received and understood at Orangeburg as a five-copy one.\n Under the rules of the company the eastbound train, 723, was the superior, and it was the duty of 483 to take the siding at Orangeburg and permit the other to pass on the main track. At that point the semaphore signal was located in front of the operator's office about seventy-five yards east of the east switch of the pass track, so that the west-bound 483 approaching Orangeburg would necessarily have to pass this semaphore to reach the entrance of the pass track, which is about three-fourths of a mile long. As 483 was approaching the semaphore, the Charleston dispatcher called the Orangeburg operator and inquired as to its whereabouts. The operator replied that it was then approaching. The dispatcher told the operator to 'tell him to go to the west end of the pass track and wait on Extra 723.' Engine 483 stopped just east of the semaphore and blew four blasts, a signal inquiring whether the operator has any orders for the train. In response the latter dropped the semaphore, which is an indication to the crew that there are no further orders, and that they are to proceed under those they then have. The intended verbal instructions were not given. After leaving Branchville, the crew of No. 483, having received no further or other orders with respect to passing Extra 723, were under a duty to follow the written orders received at Branch- \n\n[286 U.S. 313, 316]\n\u00a0\n ville, which involved passing the semaphore at Orangeburg and going on the pass track to clear the main line for No. 723. Instead the train went up the main line, failing to enter the pass track at either the east or the west switch. As it approached the west switch a yard locomotive blew a warning blast and the engine stopped momentarily. The fireman then inquired of the conductor and engineer whether they were not going to go in on the pass track, to which the conductor replied that they had time to reach the switch at Stilton, some two miles beyond. They proceeded on the main track beyond Stilton, evidently missing the switch there because of a heavy fog. The engine collided head-on with Extra 723, killing respondent's intestate and the engineer, and three of the crew of 723.\n There was no allegation of negligence on the part of the engineer of 483 or any member of the crew of Extra 723, the sole claims being with respect the failure of the operator at Orangeburg to make a five-copy passing order and deliver two copies of it to the respondent's intestate, and the failure of the same operator to give the verbal instructions to respondent's intestate to run to the west end of the pass track and wait for 723. A request by petitioners for a binding instruction, on the ground that there was no evidence of negligence on the part of petitioners or their employees which in whole or in part caused the accident was refused. The trial court submitted the case to the jury, and a resulting verdict and judgment in favor of respondent was affirmed by the state Supreme Court.\n Beyond peradventure respondent's intestate disobeyed a definite order which was not revoked or superseded by any other orders, verbal or written. By force of this order and the rules of the company, No. 483 was bound to pass the semaphore at Orangeburg, run onto the pass \n\n[286 U.S. 313, 317]\n\u00a0\n track, and not leave until 723 had passed on the main track. Copies were found on the persons of both the conductor and engineer after the collision. This crass disobedience of operating orders was the sole cause of the intestate's death. If the order respecting the passing of the trains had been made as a five-copy order, the operator at Orangeburg would merely have handed the crew two copies in the same words as those of the order they then held, which then governed their conduct. If the operator at Orangeburg had verbally confirmed the order that 483 was to run to the west end of the pass track and wait there for 723 this verbal instruction would not in any wise have altered the duty of respondent's intestate under his existing written orders.\n The suggestion is made that the dispatcher was negligent in not communicating the passing order to the crew of Extra 723 at some point west of Orangeburg, so that they would have known they were to pass Extra 483 at Orangeburg. But such a precedure would not have altered the running of Extra 723 in any particular. It would still have had the right of way over 483 to and through Orangeburg, and the accident occurred over three miles west of that point.\n The case comes to this, that respondent's intestate had clear and definite orders which, if obeyed, would have avoided the accident, and the disobedience whereof was the sole efficient cause of his death. As said in Unadilla Valley Railway Co. v. Caldine, \n278 \nU.S. 139, 142\n, 49 S. Ct. 91:\n'A failure to stop a man from doing what he known that he ought not to do, hardly can be called a cause of his act. Caldine had a plain duty and be knew it. The message would only have given him another motive for obeying the rule that he was bound to obey.'\n\n The record is destitute of any evidence of negligence on the part of the petitioners or their servants or agents \n\n[286 U.S. 313, 318]\n\u00a0\n which was in any degree a cause of the death of respondent's intestate, and there was nothing to submit to the jury.\n The judgment must be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n So ordered. \n\n\n\n","137":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSPROLES v.

P. C. art. 827a). 56 F.(2d) 189. The decree was entered on pleadings and proofs, and the complainants and interveners appeal. The act was assailed upon the ground that certain of its provisions violate the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, and also the commerce and contract clauses (article 1,  8, cl. 3, section 10, cl. 1) of the Federal Constitution. The statute is an amendatory act and the provisons in question are found in sections 2, 3, 5, and 7 (Vernon's Ann. P. C. Tex. art.827a,  2, 3, 5, and 5(b).\n Section 21 prohibits the operation on any highway of any 'vehicle,' as defined, exceeding stated limitations of size, or any vehicle not constructed or equipped as required, and also the transportation of any load exceeding the dimensions and weights prescribed. The state highway department may grant permits, for ninety days, for the transportation 'of such overweight or oversize or overlenght commodities as cannot be reasonably dismantled,' or for the operation 'of super-heavy and oversize equipment' for the transportation of such commodities, provided that hauls under these permits shall be made 'by the shortest practicable route.' \n\n[286 U.S. 374, 381]\n\u00a0\n Section 32 limits the width of a vehicle including load, to 96 inches, the height to 12 1\/2 feet, the length to 35 feet, and the length of a combination of vehicles, coupled together, to 45 feet. It forbids the transportation as a load, or as part of a load, of any commodity in containers having more than 30 cubic feet and weighing more than 500 pounds, where there are more than 14 of such containers carried as a load on 'any such vehicle or com- \n\n[286 U.S. 374, 382]\n\u00a0\n bination,' no load of any such containers to be carried in excess of 7,000 pounds. There are exempted from the limitation as to size 'implements of husbandry, including machinery used solely for the purpose of drilling water wells, and highway building and maintenance machinery temporarily propelled or moved upon the public highways.'\n Section 53 prohibits any 'commercial motor vehicle' (which the act defines as one designed or used for the transportation of property), truck- tractor, or trailer from operating outside of an incorporated city or town with a load exceeding 7,000 pounds 'on any such vehicle or train or combination of vehicles,' and provides further that no motor vehicle ( which includes passenger buses) shall operate outside a city or town with a greater weight than 600 pounds 'per inch width of tire upon any wheel concentrated upon the surface of the highway.' \n\n[286 U.S. 374, 383]\n\u00a0\n Section 74 inserts a paragraph to be known as section 5(b) of the amended statute, providing that the foregoing limitations as to length of vehicle or combination of vehicles and weight of loads, and height of vehicle with load, shall not apply to vehicles 'when used only to transport property from point of origin to the nearest practicable common carrier receiving or loading point or from a common carrier unloading point by way of the shortest practicable route to destination, provided said vehicle does not pass a delivery or receiving point of a common carrier equipped to transport said load,' or when used to transport property 'from the point of origin to point of destination' when the latter is less distant from the point of origin 'than the rearest practicable common carrier receiving or loading point equipped to transport such load.' This provision is subject to the limitation that, except by special permit, as provided in the act, the length of such vehicles shall not exceed 55 feet, or the weight of such loads 14,000 pounds, and also that the requirement as to the 'weight per inch width of tire' shall still be applicable.\n The District Court made comprehensive findings. These set forth the various interests of the complainant and interveners (common carriers and contract carriers, in intrastate and interstate commerce, and manufacturers and distributors of commodities), their large investments, the extent of their operations in highway transportation, the character and uses of their equipment, and the losses \n\n[286 U.S. 374, 384]\n\u00a0\n to which they would be subjected by requirements of the statute. Other findings may be summarized as follows:\n Of all the registered vehicles on the highways, including trucks, buses and automobiles, less than four-tenths of one per cent. have a rated carrying capacity of more than 7,000 pounds; not more than 5,500 trucks, out of a total of 206,000, have such a capacity and are affected by the prescribed load limit. There are approximately 200,000 miles of state and county highways in Texas and less than 20,000 miles of these are state designated highways, the improvement of which represents a public investment of more than $250,000,000. The annual maintenance cost of state designated highways for the past three years averaged $12,000,000 and that of the more than 180,000 miles of county highways 'is many millions of dollars annually.' In enacting the statute, 'the Legislature of Texas found as a fact that 7,000 pounds load weight, plus the weight of the vehicle, is the maximum load that should be allowed to pass over the Texas highways, taking into consideration the manner of past and present construction, probable future construction, cost of maintenance, strength of bridges, condition of traffic, etc.,' and this finding of the Legislature is supported by the preponderance of the evidence before the court. \n\n[286 U.S. 374, 385]\n\u00a0\n There are highways of concrete and other rigid and semirigid type of construction, and also bridges, capable of carrying a greater load than 7, 000 pounds, but these do not form a regularly connected system and are scattered throughout the state. There are all types of roads, 'ranging from dirt, gravel, shell, asphalt and bitulithic to concrete and brick highways' of varying degrees of strength; the operations of complainant and interveners, and others similarly circumstanced, are conducted over all these types of highways, and bridges, except in some instances where operations may be over a regular route. The statute was enacted in the interest of the whole state, and the state highway system in particular, and the operations of complainant and interveners constitute a very small portion of the traffic which the highways bear.\n The number of trucks in use in Texas has increased 300 per cent. in the last six years; official registrations show an increase from 65,536 in 1924 to 206,527 in 1930, not including the large increase in interstate truck traffic; and this increase in 'truck density' justifies the dimensional and weight restrictions of the statute in the interest of public safety and convenience and highways protection. In 1930, there were only 900 passenger buses operating over the Texas highways, representing less than .004 of one per cent. of the total number of vehicles; these passenger buses, while similar in many respects in construction to trucks carrying freight, are specially equipped to haul passengers, operate under regulations of the railroad commission and under conditions wholly different from those of trucks; that the differnce between these two types of vehicles and the number of each type, and in their operation, is ample justification for legislative classification. Excessive loads on trucks are damaging the highways and the limitation of the net load to 7,000 pounds will cause a saving to the state in maintenance costs. Heavily loaded trucks cause accidents and reduced loads will result in greater safety. \n\n[286 U.S. 374, 386]\n\u00a0\n On account of the width of traffic lanes, vehicles of greater width or length than that prescribed by the statute are hazardous for passing traffic, and the hazard will be materially reduced by a lighter load and a lesser width and length. There are low underpasses and bridge portals in Texas making necessary the prescribed height limit of 12 1\/2 feet; a low center of gravity makes a truck less likely 'to topple over or spill on the highway,' and for that reason less dangerous.\n In order to carry on the business of farming, 'implements of husbandry, plows, threshing machines, hay presser, etc.,' must be moved from one place to another. The same is true of machinery for water well drilling and highway construction. The uses of the highways for this sort of transportation are temporary only and essential to the public welfare.\n The average distance traveled by trucks carrying property from points of origin to common carrier receiving points, or from common carrier unloading points to destination, is from four to eight miles; these hauls are universally short. Such operations are confined to small areas and greatly reduce the danger of traffic congestion or highway injury incident to truck transportation. Those persons coming under the exception permitted by section 7 (section 5(b) of the act transport under distinctly different circumstances from complainant and interveners who transport over fixed routes, and from other persons using the highways. This exception will have the effect of diverting from the highways generally a great deal of traffic and thus reduce congestion and danger.\n There are a large number of commodities 'such as boilers, transformers, telephone poles, etc., as cannot be reasonably dismantled' and which it is necessary to transport. The state highway commission in the performance of its duty of issuing special permits under section 2 \n\n[286 U.S. 374, 387]\n\u00a0\n acts as an administrative, fact-finding body and under a prescribed standard.\n Upon the facts found, the District Court concluded that the requirements of the statute, aside from section 3, subdivision (f), if independently considered, were reasonable and within the constitutional authority of the state.\n The intervener W. T. Stevens, who is engaged in hauling uncompressed cotton, specifically complained of section 3, subdivision (f), as creating an arbitrary and unconstitutional discrimination against him, and the District Court made separate findings upon this point. The court found that the customary square bale of uncompressed cotton is of a greater size than 30 cubic feet and that the average 'square bale of uncompressed cotton, when compressed to a standard density, is less than 30 cubic feet in size'; and that the average square bale of cotton, whether uncompressed or compressed, weights approximately 500 pounds or more. There is the further finding that there is no commodity commonly transported over the highways of Texas which conforms to the description-' contained, boxed or bound in any container, box or binding, containing more than 30 cubic feet and weighing more than 500 pounds'-other than square bales of uncompressed cotton. The court held that the limitation of the load to 'fourteen packages, boxes, barrels or bales' exceeding the dimensions stated in section 3, subdivision (f), was reasonable and valid when construed in connection with the provision of section 5 (which became effective January 1, 1932) limiting loads to 7,000 pounds, and expressed the opinion that 14, 000 pounds of uncompressed cotton may be transported under the provisions of section 7 (section 5(b). But the court also held that if section 3, subdivision (f), is construed independently of the provisions of section 5, the former 'has no relation to the supposed mischiefs to be remedied and is unreasonable and unlawfully discriminatory' in its application to the intervener Stevens. \n\n[286 U.S. 374, 388]\n\u00a0\n As the findings of the District Court, so far as they deal with matters of fact, are supported by the evidence, we pass to the consideration of the questions of law raised by appellants' contentions.\n First. The limitation, by section 5,5 of the net load on trucks to 7, 000 pounds is attacked as an arbitrary regulation depriving appellants of their property without due process of law. Appellants urge that this provision repeals the former law which was properly designed to protect the highways and that the drastic requirement of the amendment is opposed to sound engineering opinion; that when gross weight is restricted by the 600 pounds per inch of tire spread upon the highway there is left a sufficient margin to carry greater cargoes than 7,000 pounds without causing damage; and that damage from overweight can be prevented only by regulations which fix a miximum gross load and provide for its proper distribution through axles and wheels to the highway surface.\n In exercising its authority over its highways the state is not limited to the raising of revenue for maintenance and reconstruction, or to regulations as to the manner in which vehicles shall be operated, but the state may also prevent the wear and hazards due to excessive size of vehicles and weight of load. Limitations of size and weight are manifestly subjects within the broad range of legislative discretion. To make scientific precision a criterion of constitutional power would be to subject the state to an intolerable supervision hostile to the basic principles of our government and wholly beyond the protection which the general clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was intended to secure. Ohio Oil Co. v. Conway, \n281 \nU.S. 146, 159\n, 50 S. Ct. 310. When the subject lies within the police power of the state, debatable questions as to reasonableness are not for the courts but for the Legislature, \n\n[286 U.S. 374, 389]\n\u00a0\n which is entitled to form its own judgment, and its action within its range of discretion cannot be set aside because compliance is burdensome. Standard Oil Co. v. Marysville, \n279 \nU.S. 582, 586\n, 49 S. Ct. 430; Price v. Illinois, \n238 \nU.S. 446, 452\n, 453 S., 35 S. Ct. 892; Hadacheck v. Sebastian, \n239 \nU.S. 394, 410\n, 36 S. Ct. 143, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 927; Euclid v. Ambler Company, \n272 \nU.S. 365, 388\n, 47 S. Ct. 114, 54 A. L. R. 1016; Zahn v. Board of Public Works, \n274 \nU.S. 325, 328\n, 47 S. Ct. 594. Applying this principle, this Court in Morris v. Duby, \n274 \nU.S. 135\n, 47 S. Ct. 548, sustained the regulation of the highway commission of Oregon, imposed under legislative authority, which reduced the combined maximum weight in the case of motor trucks from 22,000 pounds, which had been allowed under prior regulations, to 16,500 pounds. \n6\n See, also, Carley v. Snook, \n281 \nU.S. 66, 73\n, 50 S. Ct. 204, 68 A. L. R. 194. The requirement in Morris v. Duby, related to the gross load limit, but we know of no constitutional distinction which would make such legislation appropriate and deny to the state the authority to exercise its discretion in fixing a net load limit. We agree with the District Court that the limitation imposed by section 5 of the statute does not violate the due process clause.\n Second. The objection to the prescribed limitation as repugnant to the commerce clause is also without merit. The court, in Morris v. Duby, supra, 274 U. S. at page 143, 47 S. Ct. 548, 550, answered a similar objection to the limitation of weight by the following statement, which is applicable here: 'An examination of the acts of Congress discloses no provision, express or implied, by which there is withheld from the state its ordinary police power to conserve the highways \n\n[286 U.S. 374, 390]\n\u00a0\n in the interest of the public and to prescribe such reasonable regulations for their use as may be wise to prevent injury and damage to them. In the absence of national legislation especially covering the subject of interstate commerce, the state may rightly prescribe uniform regulations adapted to promote safety upon its highways and the conservation of their use, applicable alike to vehicles moving in interstate commerce and those of its own citizens.' In the instant case, there is no discrimination against interstate commerce and the regulations adopted by the state, assuming them to be otherwise valid, fall within the established principle that in matters admitting of diversity of treatment, according to the special requirements of local conditions, the states may act within their respective jurisdictions until Congress sees fit to act. Minnesota Rate Cases, \n230 \nU.S. 352, 399\n, 400 S., 33 S. Ct. 729, 48 L. R. A. ( N. S.) 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18. As this principle maintains essential local authority to meet local needs, it follows that one state cannot establish standards which would derogate from the equal power of other states to make regulations of their own. See Hendrick v. Maryland, \n235 \nU.S. 610, 622\n, 35 S. Ct. 140; Kane v. New Jersey, \n242 \nU.S. 160, 167\n, 37 S. Ct. 30; Michigan Commission v. Duke, \n266 \nU.S. 570, 576\n, 45 S. Ct. 191, 36 A. L. R. 1105; Interstate Busses Corporation v. Blodgett, \n276 \nU.S. 245, 250\n, 251 S., 48 S. Ct. 230; Sprout v. South Bend, \n277 \nU.S. 163, 169\n, 48 S. Ct. 502, 62 A. L. R. 45; Continental Baking Co. et al. v. Woodring, \n286 \nU.S. 352\n, 52 S. Ct. 595, 76 L. Ed. -, decided May 23, 1932\n\n\n Third. The conclusion that the state had authority to impose the limitation of section 5 for the purpose of protecting its highways meets the contention based on the contract clause of the Federal Constitution. Contracts which relate to the use of the highways must be deemed to have been made in contemplation of the regulatory authority of the state. With respect to the power of Congress in the regulation of interstate commerce, this court has had frequent occasion to observe that it is not fettered by the necessity of maintaining existing arrangements which \n\n[286 U.S. 374, 391]\n\u00a0\n would conflict with the execution of its policy, as such a restriction would place the regulation of interstate commerce in the hands of private individuals and withdraw from the control of Congress so much of the field as they might choose by prophetic discernment to bring within the range of their agreements. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Mottley, \n219 \nU.S. 467, 482\n, 31 S. Ct. 265, 34 L. R. A. (N. S.) 671; Philadelphia, Baltimore & Washington R. R. Co. v. Schubert, \n224 \nU.S. 603, 613\n, 614 S., 32 S. Ct. 589; New York Central & Hudson River R. R. Co. v. Gray, \n239 \nU.S. 583\n, 36 S. Ct. 176; Continental Insurance Co. v. United States, \n259 \nU.S. 156, 171\n, 42 S. Ct. 540. The same principle applies to state regulations in the exercise of the police power. Rast v. Van Deman, \n240 \nU.S. 342, 363\n, 36 S. Ct. 370, L. R. A. 1917A, 421, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 455; Union Dry Goods Co. v. Georgia Public Service Commission, \n248 \nU.S. 372, 375\n, 376 S., 39 S. Ct. 117, 9 A. L.

Ct. 325; Morris v. Duby, supra.\n Fourth. We are thus brought to the questions raised with respect to the discriminatory provisions of sections 3, 5, and 7 of the act which are assailed as denying to appellants the equal protection of the laws.\n Section 3(a)7 provides that the limitations as to size of vehicle shall not apply to 'implements of husbandry, including machinery used solely for the purpose of drilling water wells, and highway building and maintenance machinery temporarily propelled or moved upon the public highways.' The District Court was of the opinion that the term 'implements of husbandry' has reference to such implements as 'tractors, plows, trucks, hay presses, etc.,' and that the use of the highways for this purpose, as well as for the movement of the described machinery, is but temporary. 56 F.(2d) 189, at page 190. Appellants urge that any implement, truck or vehicle used by a farmer is an 'implement of husbandry' and hence, that under \n\n[286 U.S. 374, 392]\n\u00a0\n this exception trucks used by farmers in connection with dairies or farms may be operated throughout Texas without any restriction as to size. We see no reason for attributing such a broad construction to the provision, if its validity can be saved by a narrower one, and we are informed that the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas has held that the term 'implement of husbandry' in this statute covers only farm machinery and not trucks used as an incident to the business of farming. Reaves v. Texas (Tex. Cr. App.) 50 S.W.(2d) 286. Appellants also insist that the words 'temporarily propelled or moved upon the public highways' apply only to 'highway building and maintenance machinery' and not to 'implements of husbandry.' If the construction by the District Court of the term 'implements of husbandry' is correct, it would follow that the movement would be relatively temporary and infrequent as compared with the ordinary uses of the highways by motor trucks. We think that the exception, in the light of the context and of its apparent purpose, instead of being arbitrary relieves the limitation of an application which otherwise might itself be considered to be unreasonable with respect to the exceptional movements described.\n We do not find the provision of section 3(c),8 fixing approximately the same limit of length for individual motor vehicles and for a combination of such vehicles, to be open to objection. If the state saw fit in this way to discourage the use of such trains or combinations on its highways, we know of no constitutional reason why it should not do so.\n Objection is made to section 7 (section (b)9 permitting an additional length of vehicles and greater loads than 7,000 \n\n[286 U.S. 374, 393]\n\u00a0\n pounds (up to 14,000 pounds) when the vehicles are operated, as stated, between points of origin, or destination, and 'common carrier receiving or loading,' or unloading, points. Appellants urge that this provisions, by reason of the use of the terms 'nearest practicable common carrier receiving or loading point' and 'shortest practicable route to destination,' and 'common carrier receiving or loading point equipped to transport such load,' is so uncertain that it affords no standard of conduct that it is possible to know. We cannot agree with this view. The 'common carrier receiving or loading points,' and the unloading points, described, seem quite clearly to be points at which common carriers customarily receive shipments, of the sort that may be involved, for transportation, or points at which common carriers customarily unload such shipments. 'Shortest practicable route' is not an expression too vague to be understood. The requirement of reasonable certainty does not preclude the use of ordinary terms to express ideas which find adequate interpretation in common usage and understanding. Waters-Pierce Oil Co. v. Texas (No. 1), \n212 \nU.S. 86, 109\n, 29 S. Ct. 220; Nash v. United States, \n229 \nU.S. 373, 377\n, 33 S. Ct. 780; Miller v. Strahl, \n239 \nU.S. 426, 434\n, 36 S. Ct. 147; Omaechevarria v. Idaho, \n246 \nU.S. 343, 348\n, 38 S. Ct. 323; Hygrade Provision Co. v. Sherman, \n266 \nU.S. 497, 502\n, 45 S. Ct. 141; Bandini Co. v. Superior Court, \n284 \nU.S. 8, 18\n, 52 S. Ct. 103. The use of common experience as a glossary is necessary to meet the practical demands of legislation. In this instance, to insist upon carriage by the shortest possible route, without taking the practicability of the route into consideration, would be but an arbitrary requirement, and the expression of that which otherwise would necessarily be implied, in order to make the provision workable, does not destroy it.\n If taken to be sufficiently definite, appellants deny that the exception is justified. The District Court found that it relates to hauls that are universally short, averaging \n\n[286 U.S. 374, 394]\n\u00a0\n from four to eight miles, and that those who come within the exception transport under distinctly different circumstances from other persons using the highways. Appellants contest the latter statement and urge that the former ground is insufficient. But the Legislature in making its classifications was entitled to consider frequency and character of use and to adapt its regulations to the classes of operations, which by reason of their extensive as well as constant use of the highways brought about the conditions making the regulations necessary. Continental Baking Co. v. Woodring, supra. It is said that the exception was designed to favor transportation by railroad as against transportation by motortrucks. If this was the motive of the Legislature, it does not follow that the classification as made in this case would be invalid. The state has a vital interest in the appropriate utilization of the railroads which serve its people as well as in the proper maintenance of its highways as safe and convenient facilities. The state provides its highways and pays for their upkeep. Its people make railroad transportation possible by the payment of transportation charges. It cannot be said that the state is powerless to protect its highways from being subjected to excessive burdens when other means of transportation are available. The use of highways for truck transportation has its manifest convenience, but we perceive no constitutional ground for denying to the state the right to foster a fair distribution of traffic to the end that all necessary facilities should be maintained and that the public should not be inconvenienced by inordinate uses of its highways for purposes of gain. This is not a case of a denial of the use of the highways to one class of citizens as opposed to another or of limitations having no appropriate relation to highway protection. It is not a case of an arbitrary discrimination between the products carried, as in the case of Smith v. Cahoon, \n283 \nU.S. 553, 567\n, 51 S. Ct. 582. The pro- \n\n[286 U.S. 374, 395]\n\u00a0\n vision of section 7 (Vernon's Ann. P. C.  5(b) permitting increased loads under the stated conditions applies to all persons and to all products. The discrimination is simply in favor of short hauls and of operations which, as the District Court found, are confined to small areas and greatly reduce the danger of traffic congestion and highway casualties. The limitation of the length of vehicles, covered by the exception, to 55 feet, and of the weight of their loads to 14,000 pounds, must be taken to be within the legislative discretion for the same reasons as those which were found to sustain the general limitation of size and weight to which the exception applies.\n Another objection to classification is based on the fact that the limitation of section 510 applies to 'commercial motor vehicles' which, as defined in the act, do not include passenger buses. The latter motor vehicles, while subject to the general limitation of 'six hundred (600) pounds per inch width of tire upon any wheel concentrated upon the surface of the highway,' are not subject to a load limit. The District Court found, as above stated, that there were only 900 passenger buses operating over the Texas highways (representing less than .004 of one per cent. of the total number of vehicles) and that the difference between the two types of vehicles and number of each type and in the conditions of operations were such as to support the classification. Appellants press the contention that, as admitted by the District Court, the damage to the highways is as great from a load of persons as from a load of freight, and that the combined weight of vehicles and load in the case of passenger buses is greater than the combined weight of vehicles and load carrying freight where the net load is limited to 7,000 pounds. These considerations would be controlling if there were no other reasonable basis for classification than the mere matter \n\n[286 U.S. 374, 396]\n\u00a0\n of weight. But in passing upon the question of the constitutional power of the state to fashion its regulations for the use of the highways it maintains, we cannot ignore the fact that the state has a distinct public interest in the transportation of persons. We do not think that it can be said that persons and property, even with respect to their transportation for hire, must be treated as falling within the same category for purposes of highway regulation. The peculiar importance to the state of conveniences for the transportation of persons in order to provide its communities with resources both of employment and of recreation, the special dependence of varied social and educational interests upon freedom of intercourse through safe and accessible facilities for such transportation, are sufficient to support a classification of passenger traffic as distinct from freight. There is no constitutional requirement that regulation must reach every class to which it might be applied-that the Legislature must regulate all or none. Silver v. Silver, \n280 \nU.S. 117, 123\n, 50 S. Ct. 57. The state is not bound to cover the whole field of possible abuses. Patsone v. Pennsylvania, \n232 \nU.S. 138, 144\n, 34 S. Ct. 281. The question is whether the classification adopted lacks a rational basis. Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., \n220 \nU.S. 61, 78\n, 31 S. Ct. 337, Ann. Cas. 1912C, 160; Keokee Coke Co. v. Taylor, \n234 \nU.S. 224, 227\n, 34 S. Ct. 856; Miller v. Wilson, \n236 \nU.S. 373, 384\n, 35 S. Ct. 342, L. R. A. 1915F, 829; Carley v. Snook, supra; Smith v. Cahoon, supra. We cannot say that such a basis is lacking in this instance.\n In view of our conclusion that the limitation in section 5, and the exception in section 7 (section 5(b), are valid, it is unnecessary to consider the question which has been presented as to the validity of section 3(f), if it were regarded as an independent provision, that is, in case the objections to section 5 were sustained. It appears to be conceded that under the ruling of the District Court as to section 5 and section 7 ( section 5(b), which we have approved, motor transportation of uncompressed cotton is placed upon an equal basis with other articles of commerce. 56 F.( 2d) 189, at pages 191, 193. \n\n[286 U.S. 374, 397]\n\u00a0\n Fifth. Appellants also urge that section 211 is invalid as a delegation of power to the state highway department in violation of section 28, article 1, of the Texas Constitution and of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution. We think that the objection is untenable. We agree with the District Court that the authority given to the department is not to suspend the law, but is of a fact-finding and administrative nature, and hence is lawfully conferred. See Trimmier v. Carlton, 116 Tex. 591, 296 S. W. 1070. Under section 2, special permits may be granted by the department, for limited periods, for the transportation 'of such overweight or oversize or overlength commodities' when it is found that they 'cannot be reasonably dismantled,' or for the operation of superheavy and oversize equipment for the transportation of commodities ascertained to be of that character. This authorization, in our judgment, does not involve an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. Union Bridge Co. v. United States, \n204 \nU.S. 364\n, 27 S. Ct. 367; United States v.

S. Code, title 45,  51 (45 USCA  51)) to recover damages for his death. She had a verdict in her favor in the circuit court of Prairie county, Ark., and the Supreme Court of the state affirmed. 43 S.W.(2d) 251. The case is here on certiorari. \n285 \nU.S. 531\n, 52 S. Ct. 394, 76 L. Ed. -.\n Simpson was the engineer of No. 775, an extra train engaged in interstate commerce. Before leaving Pine Bluff, Ark., he received a written train order, No. 104, notifying him to proceed south to the cross- over at McNeil, Ark., and there wait upon a siding until another train, No. 18, going north, had arrived and passed. On arriving at McNeil, Simpson took his train, consisting of 43 freight cars, upon the siding at the cross-over, but did not wait there. He had received at McNeil another order (train order No. 132) notifying him that another train (second 18) was to meet him farther south at Stamps. The conjecture is offered that he confused train No. 18 with second No. 18, though there is no dispute that to a railroad employee the description was entirely intelligible, trains of the same number being designated as first, second, third, and so forth. At all events, Simpson, instead of waiting at the siding, moved out upon the main track. About a mile away there was a head-on collision between his train and No. 18, in which he and others were killed.\n The respondent admits, as she admitted on the trial, that the engineer was negligent, and rests her right to recover upon what is characterized as the doctrine of 'the last clear chance.' To bring that doctrine into play she relies upon these facts: At the end of the long train of 43 freight cars was a caboose in which the conductor and two brakemen rode. The brakemen say that, as the train left the siding, they remembered the first order, and asked the conductor whether any new ones contradicting it had come into his hands. Not hearing of any, they called out \n\n[286 U.S. 346, 350]\n\u00a0\n to apply the air brakes, and one of them offered to do so himself. This the conductor forbade, and said to bring him the written orders which were in the cupola of the caboose, so that he might read them again. This was done at once. While the orders were in the conductor's hands, and he was reading them again, the collision occurred.\n The facts so summarized are insufficient to relieve the engineer from the sole responsibility for the casualty that resulted in his death. What was said by this Court in Davis v. Kennedy, \n266 \nU.S. 147\n, 45 S. Ct. 33, might have been written of this case: 'It was the personal duty of the engineer positively to ascertain whether the other train had passed. His duty was primary as he had physical countrol of No. 4, and was managing its course. It seems to us a perversion of the statute to allow his representative to recover for an injury directly due to his failure to act ... on the ground that possibly it might have been prevented if those in secondary relation to the movement had done more.' See, also, Unadilla Ry. Co. v. Caldine, \n278 \nU.S. 139\n, 49 S. Ct. 91; Frese v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. R. Co., \n263 \nU.S. 1, 3\n, 44 S. Ct. 1; Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Wiles, \n240 \nU.S. 444, 448\n, 36 S. Ct. 406.\n We do not need to inquire whether a different conclusion would follow if the conductor in the caboose had discovered that the engineer had gone upon the main track through a misunderstanding of a later order, and, discovering this, had failed after a substantial interval of time to give warning of a peril that he could have easily averted. Nothing of the kind appears. There is an absence of the essential factors that wake into life the doctrine of the last clear chance. In the first place, the conductor did not know any more than Simpson did that an order had been violated. He was distrustful of his memory, and was looking at the written orders at the moment of the collision. Negligent he may have been, but not \n\n[286 U.S. 346, 351]\n\u00a0\n recklessly indifferent to a duty to counteract a peril perceived and understood. Woloszynowski v. N. Y. C. R. R. Co., 254 N. Y. 206, 172 N. E. 471; Inland & Sea-Board Coasting Co. v. Tolson, \n139 \nU.S. 551, 558\n, 11 S. Ct. 653. In the second place, the negligence of the engineer and the negligence of the conductor were substantially concurrent. The negligence of the engineer was a continuing one (St. Louis & San Francisco Ry. Co. v. Schumacher, \n152 \nU.S. 77, 81\n, 14 S. Ct. 479), for he was under a duty from the moment that he went out on the main track to return to a place of safety. The negligence of the conductor in failing to give warning was not separated by any considerable interval from the consequences to be averted, nor is there any satisfactory proof that warning, if given, would have been effective to avert them. The transaction from start to finish must have been a matter of seconds only. In the brief for the respondent nice calculations are submitted in an attempt to prove that, if the conductor had applied the brakes at once, his train could have been stopped at a point that would have separated it by a space of approximately half a mile from train No. 18 rushing on from the south, and that, if all this had happened, the engineer of No. 18 might have noticed the stationary train in time to stop his own and thus prevent collision. Calculations so nice are unavailing to prove anything except the unity of the whole transaction. The several acts of negligence were too closely welded together in time as well as in quality to be viewed as independent. Kansas City Southern Ry. v. Ellzey, \n275 \nU.S. 236, 241\n, 48 S.

PAUL FIRE & MARINE INS. CO. v. BACHMANN(1932)\nNo. 311\nArgued: January 12, 1932Decided: February 23, 1932\n\n\n\n\n[285 U.S. 112, 113]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. James M. Guiher, Philip P. Steptoe, and Louis A. Johnson, all of Clarksburg, W. Va., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Charles J. Schuck and Carl G. Bachmann, both of Wheeling, W. Va., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This action to recover on a policy of fire insurance was brought in the federal court for Northern West Virginia by Sophia C. Bachmann, a citizen of that state, against \n\n[285 U.S. 112, 114]\n\u00a0\n the St. Paul Fire & Marine Insurance Company, a Minnesota corporation. The parties stipulated that the plaintiff was entitled to recover 'unless the policy had been forfeited and nullified by the alleged violations as set forth in defendant's Specifications fo Defense Nos. 1 and 2 filed in this case.' The first specification recited the increase of hazard warranty: 'Unless otherwise provided by agreement in writing added hereto, this company shall not be liable for loss or damage occurring (b) while the hazard is increased by any means within the control or knowledge of the insured'; and alleged that by means 'within the knowledge and control of the plaintiff and her agent or agents' the fire hazard had been increased. The second specification of defense recited the prohibited articles warranty: 'Unless otherwise provided by agreement in writing added hereto, this Company shall not be liable for loss or damage occurring (d) while ... there is kept, used or allowed on the described premises ... gasoline ...'; and alleged that 'at the time of the fire complained of, and prior thereto, large quantities of gasoline were being kept ... upon and about the insured premises, all of which was well known to the plaintiff and her agent or agents, and was in violation of the foregoing condition and warranty.'\n To each defense the plaintiff replied that the warranty recited had been modified by a rider added to the policy; and also that prior to the fire she had no knowledge or control, as alleged, of the circumstances relied upon as showing breach of the warranty. The rider set forth in the reply altered the occupancy clause of the policy, which had originally described the insured building as 'occupied as Produce Store,' so that it read, 'occupied for bottling automobile oils, offices, and other mercantile purposes not more hazardous.' Another clause of the policy permitted the insured 'for present and other occupancies not more hazardous' 'to do such work and \n\n[285 U.S. 112, 115]\n\u00a0\n to keep and use such materials as are usual in such occupancies;' and a rule of the West Virginia Fire Underwriters' Association (concededly a part of the insurance contract) provides that 'the word 'materials' as used above, includes gasoline and such other materials as are prohibited by the printed conditions of the policy, when kept and used for such purposes as are usual to the occupancies permitted.' Gasoline is used in the business of bottling automobile oils.\n The case was tried before a jury. The defendant introduced evidence tending to show that the premises were occupied at the time of the fire by a tenant engaged in the illegal manufacture of intoxicating liquors; and that a large quantity of gasoline was kept on the premises for use in that connection. But it failed in its effort to prove that the plaintiff had knowledge of these facts. The verdict was for the plaintiff; and the judgment entered thereon was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 49 F.(2d) 158. The writ of certiorari was granted because of alleged conflict with decisions of this Court and of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, \n284 \nU.S. 605\n, 52 S. Ct. 31, 76 L. Ed. -.\n The only error assigned here by the insurance company relates to the construction of the prohibited articles warranty, and to the Circuit Court of Appeals' approval of the trial court's instructions with reference thereto. It is contended that under that warranty, even as modified by the rider, the presence of gasoline in connection with the use of the premises for the illegal manufacture of intoxicating liquors was an absolute bar to liability, regardless of the plaintiff's knowledge or control of the conditions; and that the trial court, in instructing the jury that the defendant must establish the fact of such knowledge and control, confused the requirements of the prohibited articles warranty with those of the increase of hazard warranty, and in effect read the condition against the use of gasoline out of the policy. \n\n[285 U.S. 112, 116]\n\u00a0\n In passing upon this contention, the Circuit Court of Appeals said:\n'At the time of the inspection by the agent of the insurance company, and the attachment of the rider to the policy, the building was being used for the handling and bottling of automobile oil, and it was shown that gasoline was stored in the building, and that the agent of the insurance company saw that gasoline was being used and stored in the building. It was contended on the trial below that this rider constituted a permit for the handling of gasoline within the building, and that its effect was to remove gasoline from the prohibited articles warranty, and that the quantity of gasoline, if greater than used at the time of the issuance of the permit, brought this question into the increased hazard class. The trial court took this view of the case, and we think properly so. The agent of the insurance company knew that the rider permitted the use of gasoline, at least to some extent, and, in order to show that the hazard was increased by a greater use of gasoline, as a defense to the recovery by the insured, the insurance company must under the terms of the policy, as above discussed, bring such fact 'within the knowledge and control' of the insured or her agent.'\n\n In so holding the court was in error. Because of the terms of the rider, a determination of the hazard involved was essential to maintaining the defense under the prohibited articles warranty as well as that under the increase of hazard warranty. But the two warranties are distinct. The latter is not violated, unless there is increase of hazard within the knowledge and control of the insured. The former may be violated if a tenant keeps the prohibited article on the premises, even if this was done without the knowledge and control of the insured. Liverpool & London Insurance Co. v. Gunther, \n116 \nU.S. 113, 128\n, 129 S., 6 S. Ct. 306; Gunther v. Liverpool & London & Globe Insurance Co., \n134 \nU.S. 110, 116\n, 10 S. Ct. 448. Compare Imperial Fire \n\n[285 U.S. 112, 117]\n\u00a0\n Insurance Co. v. Coos County, \n151 \nU.S. 452, 463\n, 464 S., 14 S. Ct. 379. The rider attached to the policy altered the prohibition against gasoline only to the extent of permitting it to be kept and used for the purpose of bottling automobile oils, or for 'other mercantile purposes not more hazardous.' The court could not say as a matter of law whether the business of operating moonshine stills was or was not more hazardous than that of bottling automobile oils. Compare Royal Exch. Assur. of London v. Thrower (C. C. A.) 246 F. 768, 772; Phoenix Assur. Co. v. Franklin Brass Co. (C. C. A.) 58 F. 166, 171; Schaffer v. Hampton Insurance Co., 183 Minn. 101, 235 N. W. 618. If it was more hazardous, the presence of the gasoline constituted a violation of the warranty. The question should have been submitted to the jury.\n It is urged on behalf of the respondent that the insurance company is not in a position to complain of this error. Stress is laid on the circumstance that in its specifications of defense the company alleged knowledge and control by the insured of the presence of the gasoline and the operation of the stills; and it is argued that the parties are bound by the issue as thus joined. But the pleading set forth the prohibited articles warranty and asserted a defense under it. Any additional matter, which might by implication be read as an attempted construction of the warranty, is to be regarded as surplusage. Compare Lawrence v. Hyde, 77 W. Va. 639, 643, 88 S. E. 45; Lohr v. Wolfe, 71 W. Va. 627, 628, 77 S. E. 71; Jones v. Sanitary District of Chicago, 265 Ill. 98, 100, 101, 106 N. E. 473; Hall v. Spaulding, 42 N. H. 259, 262. When the defendant later sought instructions that proof of knowledge and control by the insured was not essential to establishment of the defense, the plaintiff made no effort to show that it had been prejudiced.\n A more serious difficulty is that the defendant did not itself seek proper instructions. The burden was upon \n\n[285 U.S. 112, 118]\n\u00a0\n it to prove that the occupancy was not one to which the gasoline permit extended. Compare Logan v. Provident Savings Life Assurance Society, 57 W. Va. 384, 390, 50 S. E. 529. Yet it presented no request that the jury be instructed as to the meaning of the rider. Nor did it request an instruction that the jury find whether the occupancy at or before the time of the fire was more hazardous than that of bottling automobile oils. Its request was merely that the jury be charged that the plaintiff could not recover if at and prior to the time of the fire substantial quantities of gasoline were being kept on the premises 'either for the purpose of operating moonshine stills or for any other purpose not permitted by the policy.' Thus, it requested the court to hold as a matter of law that operating moonshine stills was outside the scope of the permitted occupancies. The court could not take judicial notice that the operation of the stills was more hazardous than bottling automobile oils or say that it was not a mercantile purpose.\n But the defendant's failure to ask proper instructions does not cure the error in the instructions which were given, and excepted to. Compare Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Volk, \n151 \nU.S. 73, 78\n, 14 S. Ct. 239. At the plaintiff's request the trial judge charged that, 'unless the plaintiff ... had control or knowledge of the keeping and using of such gasoline or the operation of such stills, such keeping, using and operation ... constitute no defense'; that 'the defendant by the issuance of the rider ... is estopped to avoid the policy because of the fact that quantities of gasoline were kept and used upon the premises since the said rider permitted the bottling of automobile oils which according to the uncontradicted evidence contained gasoline.' These instructions, while correct in so far as they bore upon the defense under the increase of hazard warranty, were erroneous in respect to that under the prohibited articles war- \n\n[285 U.S. 112, 119]\n\u00a0\n ranty. The fact that the defendant had incorporated errors of law in the instructions which it sought upon the second defense did not justify putting the case to the jury solely upon the first. Compare Westchester Fire Ins. Co. v. Fitzpatrick (C. C. A.) 2 F.(2d) 651, 654; Sutherland v. Payne (C. C. A.) 274 F. 360, 361; Rothe v. Pennsylvania Co. (C. C. A.) 195 F. 21, 25; Audubon Bldg. Co. v.

C., for respondents.\n\n\n\n[286 U.S. 510, 514]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n November 9, 1931, the prosecuting attorney of Arapahoe county, Colo., filed an information in the state court charging that on November 7 Henry Dierks killed and murdered Melford Smith. A warrant issued, the accused was arrested thereon and admitted to bail. He filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus cum causa in the United States District Court alleging that he is a United States prohibition agent and other facts in which he claims immunity from prosecution in the state court and prayed removal of the case to the federal court under Judicial Code,  33, as amended (28 U. S. C.  76 (28 USCA  76)). The district judge granted the writ, the marshal served it as required by the statute, and so the case was taken from the state court. The prosecuting attorney promptly \n\n[286 U.S. 510, 515]\n\u00a0\n moved to remand on the ground that the petition is not sufficient to give the federal court jurisdiction. His motion was denied. 55 F.(2d) 371. Thereupon, leave having been granted, the state acting through its Governor filed a motion in this court for a rule requiring the district judge to show cause why a writ of mandamus should not issue to compel him to remand the case. The motion was granted and the judge has made his response to the rule in which he maintains that mandamus should not be granted. The case is submitted by the state on the brief of its attorney general. The Solicitor General of the United States submits a brief in opposition.\n As the prosecuting attorney did not join issue with any of the allegations of the petition for removal, the jurisdiction of the federal court and the validity of its action are to be determined upon the allegations of the petition.\n Eliminating formal parts and much unnecessary verbiage, we give its full substance. After showing that Dierks was accused, arrested and admitted to bail the petition represents:\n He has long been a prohibition agent and the act for which he was informed against was done by right of his office and while he was engaged in the discharge of his official duties 'in making and attempting to make an investigation concerning a violation of the National Prohibition Act and other Internal Revenue laws, and reporting the results of said investigation, and in protecting himself in the discharge of his duty as follows:'\n November 7, 1931, he and one Ellsworth, another prohibition agent, were directed by the administrator in charge to investigate a complaint of violations of the prohibition act and revenue laws reported as being committed at No. 3005, South Broadway in Englewood. About 9:30 in the evening they went to that place for the purpose of investigating such violations. It was a hamburger stand or restaurant. Petitioner exhibited his badge and in- \n\n[286 U.S. 510, 516]\n\u00a0\n formed the man in charge that he was a prohibition agent and had come to investigate reports of violations of the act and was given permission to search the premises. While he 'was in the act of observing and searching said premises, one Melford Smith entered ... seated himself on an unoccupied stool at the counter ... took out a pint bottle of wine from his inside coat pocket, and set the said bottle of wine on the counter ... in full and open view of your petitioner, and ... then proceeded to look for a drinking glass.'\n Upon seeing the bottle of wine and believing Smith engaged in violating the prohibition act and revenue laws, petitioner 'proceeded to take possession of said bottle of wine, and to arrest ... Smith; that thereupon ... Smith did resist arrest, did attempt to destroy said bottle of wine, and did proceed to assault your petitioner and did attempt to escape, and that thereupon one Al Green did attempt ... to help ... Smith to escape, and that in the scuffle that ensued, and while your petitioner was engaged in the discharge of his official duties as such Federal Prohibition Officer in making, and attempting to make, said arrest of said Melford Smith, and in protecting himself in the discharge of his duties, and in attempting to seize said bottle of wine, it became necessary in order to subdue ... Smith for your petitioner to strike, and he did strike, ... Smith on the head with your petitioner's gun; that thereupon ... Ellsworth came to the assistance of your petitioner;' and that they 'did arrest the said Melford Smith, the said Al Green, and one Leonard Carpenter, and did convey them to the' jail at Denver.\n And the petitioner goes on to say that when Smith was placed in the jail he did not appear to have received injury, but that on the following day he became sick and died and petitioner 'alleges that the said Melford Smith \n\n[286 U.S. 510, 517]\n\u00a0\n did die from an injury to his head caused by a blow given ... by your petitioner during the scuffle. ...' And petitioner states 'he is not guilty of the crime of murder, or any other offense' and that the criminal proceeding 'arises out of and solely by reason of the acts performed by your petitioner as an officer acting' under the authority of the revenue laws and the National Prohibition Act.\n The protection afforded by section 331 extends to prohibition agents. 27 U. S. C.  45 (27 USCA  45). The various acts of Congress constituting the section as it now stands were enacted to maintain the supremacy of the laws of the United States by safeguarding officers and others acting under federal authority against peril of punishment for violation of state law or obstruction or embarrassment by reason of opposing policy on the part of those exerting or controlling state power. Tennessee v. Davis, \n100 U.S. 257\n; Maryland v. Soper (No. 1), \n270 \nU.S. 9, 32\n, 46 S. Ct. 185; Nashville v. Cooper, 6 Wall. 247, 253; Findley v. Satterfield, Fed. Cas. No. 4,792. It scarcely need be said that such measures are to be liberally construed to give full effect to the purposes for which they were enacted. See Venable v. \n\n[286 U.S. 510, 518]\n\u00a0\n Richards, \n105 U.S. 636\n, 638; State of North Carolina v. Sullivan (C. C.) 50 F. 593, 594. And it is axiomatic that the right of the states, consistently with the Constitution and laws of the United States, to make and enforce their own laws is equal to the right of the federal government to exert exclusive and supreme power in the field that by virtue of the Constitution belongs to it. The removal statute under consideration is to be construed with highest regard for such equality. Federal officers and employees are not, merely because they are such, granted immunity from prosecution in state courts for crimes against state law. Congress is not to be deemed to have intended that jurisdiction to try persons accused of violating the laws of a state should be wrested from its courts in the absence of a full disclosure of the facts constituting the grounds on which they claim protection under section 33.\n Here the state of Colorado charges petitioner with deliberate murder. While homicide that is excusable or justifiable may be committed by an officer in the proper discharge of his duty, murder or other criminal killing may not. The burden is upon him who claims the removal plainly to set forth by petition made, signed and \n\n[286 U.S. 510, 519]\n\u00a0\n unequivocally verified by himself all the facts relating to the occurrence, as he claims them to be, on which the accusation is based. Without such disclosure the court cannot determine whether he is entitled to the immunity. No question of guilt or innocence arises and no determination of fact is required but it must fairly appear from the showing made that petitioner's claim is not without foundation and is made in good faith.\n As said by Chief Justice Taft speaking for the court in Maryland v. Soper, supra, \n270 \nU.S. 33\n, 46 S. Ct. 185, 190: 'It must appear that the prosecution ... has arisen out of the acts done by him under color of federal authority and in enforcement of federal law, and he must by direct averment exclude the possibility that it was based on acts or conduct of his, not justified by his federal duty. ... (p. 34 of 270 U. S., 46 S. Ct. 185, 191.) In invoking the protection of a trial of a state offense in a federal court under section 33, a federal officer abandons his right to refuse to testify because accused of crime, at least to the extent of disclosing in his application for removal all the circumstances known to him out of which the prosecution arose. The defense he is to make is that of his immunity from punishment by the state, because what he did was justified by his duty under the federal law, and because he did nothing else on which the prosecution could be based. He must establish fully and fairly this defense by the allegations of his petition for removal before the federal court can properly grant it. It is incumbent on him, conformably to the rules of good pleading, to make the case on which he relies, so that the court may be fully advised and the state may take issue on a motion to remand.' And the opinion pointed out ( page 35 of 270 U. S., 46 S. Ct. 185, 191) that the allegations of the petition for removal there under consideration did not negative the possibility that the accused were doing other than official acts at the time or on the occasion of the alleged murder or 'make it clear and specific that whatever was done by them leading to the \n\n[286 U.S. 510, 520]\n\u00a0\n prosecution was done under color of their federal official duty. ... In order to justify so exceptional a procedure, the person seeking the benefit of it should be candid, specific and positive in explaining his relation to the transaction growing out of which he has been indicted, and in showing that his relation to it was confined to his acts as an officer.'\n It appears from a mere inspection of the petition before us that it does not measure up to the required standard. The outstanding fact is that petitioner killed Smith by intentionally striking him on the head with a gun. That is the basis of the state's prosecution. The burden is on the accused to submit a 'candid specific and positive' statement of the facts so that the court will be able to determine the validity of his claim for removal. It is sufficiently shown that in performance of official duties he and another agent went into the place described to observe whether federal law was being violated and that the deceased entered and was about to take a glass of wine from a bottle that he carried in his pocket. These facts led up to the crucial occurrences the principal of which was the death blow. And as to these the statements are not such as would naturally be employed by one desiring fully to portray what happened. For example, it is said petitioner 'proceeded to take possession of said bottle' and to 'arrest ... Smith' and that thereupon Smith 'did resist arrest' and attempt to destroy the bottle of wine and 'did proceed to assault your petitioner' and did 'attempt to escape' and that Green did attempt to assist deceased to escape and that 'in the scuffle that ensued' and while petitioner was engaged in the discharge of his duties, etc., it became necessary 'in order to subdue ... Smith for your petitioner to strike' him 'on the head with your petitioner's gun.'\n While phrases such as those quoted may appropriately be used to characterize facts that have been disclosed, \n\n[286 U.S. 510, 521]\n\u00a0\n they are not calculated to give specific information as to the details of the occurrence. The statements of the petition are so vague, indefinite and uncertain as not to commit petitioner in respect of essential details of the defense he claims. They are not sufficient to enable the court to determine whether his claim of immunity rests on any substantial basis or is made in good faith.

United States. \n274 \nU.S. 640\n, 47 S. Ct. 714. The suit was originally brought against the two corporate petitioners and certain individuals, the state not being a party, and the circumstances, so far as they then appeared, were set out in the opinion of this Court as follows (pages 642- 644 of 274 U. S., 47 S. Ct. 714, 715):\n'This is a second suit by the United States, and is in aid of the first, for the restoration to the government of some 5,500 acres of public lands located in Utah, title to which was procured by a fraud perpetrated upon the land officers of the United States. The first suit, which resulted in a judgment for the government (affirmed ( Milner v. U. S. (C. C. A.)) 228 F. 431), was predicated upon the following circumstances:\n\n'The United States, in 1894, made a grant of public lands to the state of Utah to aid in the establishment of an agricultural college, certain schools and asylums, and for other purposes. Sections 8 and 10, Act of July 16, 1894, c. 138, 28 Stat. 107, 109, 110. Mineral lands were not included. See Milner v. United States (C. C. A.) 228 F. 431, 439; United States v. Sweet, \n245 \nU.S. 563\n, 38 S. Ct. 193; Mullan v. United States, \n118 \nU.S. 271, 276\n, 6 S. Ct. 1041; section 2318, R. S. (30 USCA  21). The grant was not of lands in piece. Selections were to be made by the state with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, from unappropriated public lands, in such manner as the Legislature should provide. The Legislature (Laws Utah 1896, c. 80) later created a board of land commissioners, with general supervisory powers over the disposition of \n\n[284 U.S. 534, 540]\n\u00a0\n the lands, and with authority to select particular lands under the grants.\n\n'During the period from December 10, 1900, to September 14, 1903, Milner and others, the predecessors in interest of the Carbon County Land Company, one of the petitioners, made several applications to the state commission to select and obtain in the name of the state the lands now in question, and at the same time entered into agreements with the commission to purchase the lands from the state. In aid of the applications and agreements, milner and his associates filed affidavits with the commission, stating that they were acquainted with the character of these lands, which they affirmed were nonmineral and did not contain deposits of coal. They also deposed that the applications were not made for the purpose of fraudulently obtaining mineral holdings, but to acquire the land for agricultural use. The applicants were obviously aware that the affidavits or the information contained in them would in due course be submitted to the Land Office of the United States with the state commission's selections, as they were in fact. On the faith of these and other documents, the selections were approved by the Secretary of the Interior and the tracts in question were certified to the state on various dates, the last being in December, 1904. Certification was the mode of passing title from the United States to the state.\n\n'In January, 1907, the United States brought the first suit, against Milner and his associates and the Carbon County Land Company, which had been organized by Milner to take over the land, and was controlled by him. The suit was founded on the charge that the certifications were procured by the fraudulent misrepresentations of Milner and the others, since they knew at the time of the applications that the lands contained coal deposits. Although the bill ... sought the quieting of the government's title. It affirmatively appears that on June 8, 1914, the District \n\n[284 U.S. 534, 541]\n\u00a0\n Court entered a decree declaring that the United States 'is the owner' and 'entitled to the possession' of the lands in question and that the defendants 'have no right, title, or interest, or right of possession,' and perpetually enjoining them 'from setting up or making any claim to or upon said premises.' The Circuit Court of Appeals, in affirming the decree, held that 'the whole transaction was a scheme or conspiracy on the part of Milner to fraudulently obtain the ownership of these lands from the United States.\"\n\n In its first opinion, this Court held, for reasons stated and upon authorities cited, that the decree in the earlier suit conclusively established that the Carbon County Land Company was a party to the fraudulent conspiracy to procure certification of the title to the lands to the state; that as against the land company and all claiming under it, the United States was equitably entitled to the land; that the land company, so far as it had acquired any interest in the land, was not shielded from the consequence of its fraud by having procured a conveyance to the state, even though the latter was not a party to the fraud; and that the land company could not acquire any further interest in the property from the state free of the obligation to make restitution of it, which equity imposes on one who despoils another of his property by fraud. Independent Coal & Coke Co. v. United States, supra, pages 647, 648 of 274 U. S., 47 S. Ct. 714\n\n\n As the Independent Coal & Coke Company had acquired its alleged interest in the lands subsequent to their certification by the United States, it was held that it took them subject to the equities of the United States, unless the defense of bona fide purchaser was affirmatively established, and 'that none of the defendants, nor any claiming under them with notice, could by any legal device, however ingenious, acquire title from the state free from the taint of their fraud.' Id. pages 646, 647 of 274 U. S., 47 S. Ct. 714, 717. \n\n[284 U.S. 534, 542]\n\u00a0\n After the cause had been remanded to the District Court, the two corporate petitioners answered, and the state, which had contented itself with filing a brief amicus curiae when the cause was first here, was permitted to intervene. By its bill of complaint in intervention the state set up that at the time of the selection and certification of the lands it 'believed and had ever since believed that the land so certified by it was agricultural in character and it did not contain any known mineral'; that in 1920, which was subsequent to the decree in the first suit, it had entered into a new contract with the land company, under which it had sold and conveyed the lands to that company for $100 an acre, or a total of $ 556,428, taking back a mortgage for that amount, and had since assessed taxes, which were liens upon the lands, aggregating $40,000. The government, by its answer, prayed the cancellation of the mortgage and tax liens, or, in the alternative, if that relief were denied, that the certification of the lands of the state by the United States be canceled.\n After a trial upon evidence, the district court, without making findings, gave judgment canceling the patent from the state of the land company and quieting the state's title. The Court of Appeals, in reversing this decree, made findings, which the evidence supports, that the state, as alleged, had, in 1920, patented the lands to the Carbon County Land Company, taking back a mortgage for the purchase price, and that in the same year the land company had sold 1,120 acres of the land to the Independent Coal & Coke Company, which had notice of all the proceedings, including the final decree in the first suit.\n Upon these findings, it is apparent, from our earlier opinion, that neither of the corporate petitioners can retain any interest in the land, as against the United States. As the coal company purchased a part of the lands with notice of the equities of the United States against the land company, it took subject to those equities, and can \n\n[284 U.S. 534, 543]\n\u00a0\n be in no better position with respect to them than its grantor. The land company, a party to the fraud by which the certification of the lands to the state was procured, and to the decree in the first suit which so determined, could not improve its position by taking any further conveyance from the state. However innocent the state and its officials may have been in this transaction, any interest the land company could acquire from the state in its own behalf was but the fruit of its fraud and of its violation of the decree against it. This aspect of the case was discussed and passed upon in our first opinion, pages 647, 648, 649 of 274 U. S., 47 S. Ct. 714, and the conclusion there reached requires affirmance of the decree so far as it affects the land company and the coal company.\n The state of Utah can stand in no better situation with respect to the mortgage and tax liens which it asserts. A copy of the bill of complaint in the original suit was handed to the state board of land commissioners when the suit was begun in 1907, and the state has been fully advised of all the subsequent proceedings. By 1904 it had contracted to sell the lands to Milner and associates for $1.50 an acre, payable in installments of 25 cents a year. By virtue of these contracts, the vendees were equitably entitled to the land, and the state's interest was but that of vendor, having the mere right to retain the title as security for any unpaid balance of the agreed purchase price. See Williams v. United States, \n138 \nU.S. 514, 516\n, 11 S. Ct. 457; Boone v. Chiles, 10 Pet. 177, 224. It was the equitable ownership in the lands thus acquired by Milner and associates and conveyed by them to the land company which the decree in the first suit, in 1914, adjudged to be in the United States.\n The government's allegation in its answer to the intervention complaint of the state that at the time of the decree the purchase price had been paid in full was not denied by the state's replication. No evidence on the \n\n[284 U.S. 534, 544]\n\u00a0\n point was offered, but in the present circumstances we do not think it material. Subject to the state's security title and right as vendor, every interest in the land was vested in the land company, whose rights remained unchallenged and unaffected by any action of the state when the decree was entered in the first suit. That decree irrevocably fastened the equities of the United States upon every right and interest which the land company had or could procure in the land. So far as the state was concerned, the decree substituted the United States in the place and stead of the land company as equitable owner of the land, and stripped the latter of power of surrender its interest to the state. The decree1 was likewise of binding force upon everyone, including the state, who might later knowingly attempt to acquire any new or different interest in the land in derogation of the equities adjudged to be in the United States. Even if we were to assume that, at the time of the decree there was an unpaid balance of purchase money (which could not have exceeded $1.50 an acre), the state was entitled only to retain its title until payment was made. Beyond this it could make no profit and derive no benefit free of the equitable rights of the United States. Any grant of the lands by the state to the Land Company or to a stranger, \n\n[284 U.S. 534, 545]\n\u00a0\n without the assent of the United States, would have been in violation of its equitable rights as they had been adjudicated by the decree. See Gorham v. Farson, 119 Ill. 425, 10 N. E. 1; Haughwout v. Murphy, 22 N. J. Eq. 531, 546, 547; Taylor v. Kelly, 56 N. C. 240.\n Ignoring those rights, the state issued a patent to the land company, receiving as the proceeds of its wrongful conveyance the mortgage of the land company, an active participant in the fraudulent scheme, to secure the increased payments of $100 an acre. It actively facilitated the conveyance to the coal company by the land company by agreeing with both that the state would release from the mortgage the lands conveyed to the coal company upon payment of $112,000, which the coal company undertook to pay. This attempted enlargement of the state's interest in the lands, in diminution of the equities of the United States, like the conveyance, mortgage, and agreement by which the attempt was made, was a violation of the decree and of the equitable rights confirmed by it, from which the state can take no benefit. This is not any the less the case because the land company, as against the United States, could not rightly receive the patent or retain its benefits or grant to any other than the United States any interest in the patented lands.\n The state urges that the United States is estopped to assert any claim to the lands as against it by statements made by a Special Assistant Attorney General in a conversation between him and members of the board of land commissioners in 1907, when he delivered to them a copy of the bill of complaint in the first suit. We agree with the court below that his statements cannot be regarded as so inconsistent with the bill as to form any basis for the alleged estoppel. In any case, he was obviously without authority to dispose of the lands, and could not estop it from asserting rights of the \n\n[284 U.S. 534, 546]\n\u00a0\n United States in its mineral rights which he could not surrender. Utah Power & Light Co. v. United States, \n243 \nU.S. 389, 408\n, 409 S., 37 S. Ct. 387. See, also, San Pedro and Canon del Agua Co. v. United States, \n146 U.S. 120\n, 131 et seq., 13 S. Ct. 94.\n It is also argued that the lands were not mineral lands, and that the adjudication to that effect in the first suit is not res adjudicata as to the state. That question was again litigated in the present suit, and upon this issue the court below, upon sufficient evidence, found in favor of the United States. See Diamond Coal & Coke Co. v. United States, \n233 \nU.S. 236\n, 34 S. Ct. 507. But we do not think that question requires our examination or is open upon the present record. The decree in the first suit adjudicated the equitable rights of the United States as against the corporate petitioners. For reasons already stated, the state has at no time had or asserted any interest superior to that of the United States, except its vendor's title, which it has since relinquished to the land company.\n In our first opinion we held that the six-year statute of limitation of actions to cancel patents granted by the United States (43 USCA  1166), even if embracing a suit brought for cancellation of a certification of lands by the United States, had no application to the relief sought against the corporate petitioners. For the same reason it can have none to the relief granted against the state in accordance with the prayer of the bill. The present suit did not seek cancellation of the certification, unless that prayer was denied. It asserts equitable rights to interests in the land derived under and by virtue of the certification. The decree proceeds, and is affirmed here, on the ground that the mortgage and tax liens asserted by the state are subordinate to those rights.\n We have considered, but find it unnecessary to discuss, other objections to the decree.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The decree provided 'That the plaintiff (the United States) is the owner and entitled to possession of the following described property, towit: ... and that plaintiff's title thereto be quieted against any and all claims of the defendants, or either of them or of any person or persons claiming, or hereafter to claim through or under the said defendants, or any or either of them; that said defendants, and each of them, have no right, title or interest, or right of possession in or to said premises hereinabove described, or to any part thereof; and the said defendants, and each of them, are perpetually restrained and enjoined from setting up or making any claim to or upon said premises, or any part thereof, and all claims of said defendants, and each of them, are hereby quieted.' \n\n\n\n\n","142":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF WYO. v. STATE OF COLO.(1932)\nNo. 15\nArgued: Decided: May 31, 1932\n\n\n\n Mr. Paul W. Lee of Denver, Colo, for the State of Colorado. \n\n[286 U.S. 494, 495]\n\u00a0\n Mr. James A. Greenwood, of Torrington, Wyo., for the State of wyoming.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit brought by the state of Wyoming against the state of Colorado to enforce a decree of this court (\n259 \nU.S. 419, 496\n, 42 S. Ct. 552; \n260 \nU.S. 1\n, 43 S. Ct. 2) rendered in an earlier suit between the same states respecting their relative rights to divert and use for irrigation the waters of the Laramie river, a stream rising in Colorado and flowing northward into Wyoming.\n In the present bill, shortly described, Wyoming alleges that Colorado is departing from that decree by permitting the diversion and use within her territory of waters of the Laramie in quantities largely in excess of those accorded to her by the decree; that these excessive diversions are preventing Wyoming from receiving and using the amount of water which the decree accorded to her; that Colorado, unless restrained by this court, will continue to permit such excessive diversions and thereby will largely or entirely deprive Wyoming of the use of the water accorded to her in the decree; that the measuring devices installed by Colorado to measure the waters diverted within her territory do not accurately show the full quantities so diverted; and that Colorado refuses, although duly requested, to permit Wyoming to install other suitable devices or participate in the measurements. \n\n[286 U.S. 494, 496]\n\u00a0\n The bill construes the decree as determining the rights of the two states in the waters of the Laramie by according to Colorado\n\n 1. \n18,000 acre-feet of water per annum by reason of the Skyline ditch appropriation;\n\n 2. \n4,250 acre-feet of water per annum by reason of certain meadowland appropriations;\n\n 3. \nA relatively small amount of water appropriated prior to 1902 through the Wilson Supply ditch from the headwaters of Deadman creek, a Colorado tributary of the Laramie; and\n\n 4. \n15,500 acre-feet of water per annum by reason of the Laramie- Poudre tunnel appropriation, making an aggregate of 37,750 acre-feet per annum, apart from the Wilson Supply ditch appropriation;\n and by according to Wyoming 272,500 acre-feet of water per annum by reason of appropriations in that state.\n The relief sought is the protection and quieting of Wyoming's rights under the decree; provision for accurately and effectively measuring and recording the quantities of water diverted in Colorado; an injunction restraining Colorado from continuing or making any diversion in excess of the quantities of water accorded to her by the decree, in the event the injunction in that decree is held to relate only to diversion by reason of the Laramie-Poudre tunnel appropriation; and such other and full relief as may be just and equitable.\n Colorado challenges the bill by a motion to dismiss in the nature of a demurrer. The principal grounds of the motion are: (1) That the bill proceeds upon the theory that the prior decree determined, as against Colorado and her water users, the full quantity of water which rightfully may be diverted from the stream within that state, and likewise the quantity which Wyoming and her water users are entitled to receive and use from the stream \n\n[286 U.S. 494, 497]\n\u00a0\n within that state-all of which, it is insisted in the motion, is refuted by the record, opinion and decree in the prior suit. (2) That the bill shows that the acts complained of are not acts done by Colorado, or under her authority, but acts done by private corporations and individuals not parties to the present suit and with respect to which no relief can be had against Colorado. And (3) that, in any event, the bill fails to show with certainty any violation of the decree or any damage to Wyoming or her water users.\n In the bill, Wyoming does take the position that the decree in the earlier suit determines the rights of each state as against the other, including their respective water users, respecting the diversion and use of the waters of the interstate stream; in other words, that the decree fixes and limits the quantities of water which Colorado, including her water users, is entitled to divert and use within that state and thus withhold from Wyoming, and likewise determines the amount of water which Wyoming, including her water users, is entitled to receive and use within her territory. Counsel for Colorado, recognizing that such is the position taken in the bill, say in their brief: 'The principal purpose of the motion to dismiss is to join issue with the contention of the complainant that the whole matter has already been adjudicated by the former decree. The problem so presented is a law question and it is apprehended that this should be determined in limine.' And, after indicating Colorado's purpose to answer if so required, they further say: 'We insist, however, that the cause will be greatly accelerated and confusion be avoided by determining at the threshold the issues of law tendered by the complainant, and thereupon the issues of fact should be defined, if any are considered to stand for adjudication after passing upon the construction problem, which is the only substantial controversy \n\n[286 U.S. 494, 498]\n\u00a0\n in the case.' Evidently therefore the construction of the decree in the earlier suit is the chief matter in dispute.\n That suit was brought by Wyoming against Colorado and two Colorado corporations. The corporations, with Colorado's authority and permission, were proceeding to divert water from the Laramie in Colorado and to conduct it through a proposed tunnel into to the valley of the Cache la Poudre in Colorado, there to be used in irrigation. The project was designed to divert from the Laramie 56,000 acre-feet per annum at first and 15,000 more later on. The purpose of the suit was to prevent the proposed diversion, and to that end the complaint set forth, among other things, that the doctrine of appropriation for beneficial use whereby priority in time gives priority in right, was recognized and applied by both Colorado and Wyoming in adjusting conflicting claims to the use of waters of natural streams; that Wyoming and her citizens had been for many years irrigating and thereby making highly productive very large amounts of land along the Laramie and its tributaries in that state through the use of waters appropriated for that purpose from those streams, and expenditures running into millions of dollars had been made in the construction of reservoirs, canals, and other appliances for the purpose of so using such waters; that these appropriations and this use had been maintained from a time long prior to the commencement of the Laramie- Poudre tunnel project in Colorado; that the date when that project was commenced was 'on or about the first day of December, 1909'; that before that project was commenced Colorado and certain of her citizens had appropriated water from the Laramie in Colorado for the irrigation of lands (meadow lands) in that state adjacent to that stream, but that the total amount of water reasonably and beneficially used upon such lands did not exceed 6,000 acre-feet per annum; that 'no other appropriations or use of said waters of \n\n[286 U.S. 494, 499]\n\u00a0\n said Laramie River or its tributaries had been made by the State of Colorado or its citizens, or within the said State of Colorado, prior to the appropriations of said waters by your orator and its citizens as herein set forth'; that prior to the commencement of the Laramie-Poudre tunnel project in Colorado, Wyoming and her citizens had appropriated all of the available waters of the Laramie and its tributaries for the actual irrigation of lands in Wyoming aggregating hundreds of thousands of acres and supporting thousands of people; that without the use of the waters so appropriated these lands would be to a large extent valueless and incapable of supporting any considerable population; and that the consummation of the proposed Laramie-Poudre tunnel diversion would deprive Wyoming and her citizens of a very large amount of water to the use of which they were rightly entitled in virtue of their appropriations, and would take from many of their lands much of their value.\n The prayer was for an injunction preventing the defendants and each of them from making the proposed diversion, and for general relief.\n Colorado, in answering the complaint, admitted that before the commencement of the Laramie-Poudre tunnel project certain of her citizens had appropriated water from the Laramie and its tributaries in that state for the irrigation of adjacent lands (meadow land), but averred that these appropriations amounted to about 8,000 acre-feet per annum; alleged that 'other appropriations of said waters of said Laramie River and its tributaries had been made by the State of Colorado and its citizens within the State of Colorado prior to the appropriations of said waters by complainant and its citizens'; averred that the right to the proposed Laramie-Poudre tunnel diversion was initiated, by commencement of construction, August 25, 1902, and that at the time of such initiation there was abundant water in the Laramie to satisfy all \n\n[286 U.S. 494, 500]\n\u00a0\n prior appropriations then in existence in Colorado any Wyoming; denied that Wyoming and her citizens had appropriated all of the available waters of the Laramie and its tributaries prior to that threatened diversion, and averred that there was ample water in those streams to supply the threatened diversion and all prior rights in Wyoming; alleged that when the right to make that diversion was initiated, the appropriations effected or initiated in Wyoming did not exceed 50,000 acre-feet; averred that the maximum diversion which could be made through the Laramie-Poudre tunnel project did not exceed 70,000 acre-feet annually, and the topographical and physical conditions were such that 'by the system sought to be enjoined herein, and all other available means, no more than 90,000 acre-feet annually can be diverted from said stream and its tributaries for usc upon lands lying within the State of Colorado'; and denied that the consummation of the threatened diversion would work any injury to Wyoming or her citizens or the lands in that state.\n Thus the pleadings directly put in issue the priority and measure of the appropriations in each state as against those in the other state, and also the extent of the available supply of water whereon all of the appropriations depended.\n Evidence was produced by both states directly bearing upon these issues. Colorado's evidence was addressed to showing all appropriations in that state, not merely the Laramie-Poudre tunnel appropriation; and that evidence dealt in detail with the dates and measure of the meadow-land appropriations referred to in the complaint and answer; with the existence, date, and measure of the Skyline ditch appropriation and the Wilson Supply ditch appropriation; and even with an appropriation from Sand creek, a small interstate steam nominally but not actually a tributary of the Laramie. Colorado's state engineer gave \n\n[286 U.S. 494, 501]\n\u00a0\n 4,250 acre-feet per annum as the measure of the meadowland appropriations, 18,000 acre-feet per annum as the measure of the Skyline ditch appropriation, and 2,000 acre-feet per annum as the measure of the Wilson Supply ditch appropriation. Some of her witnesses gave different measures. All who spoke of the Wilson Supply ditch agreed that it was used to divert water from the headwaters of Deadman creek, a Colorado tributary of the Laramie, into Sand creek, from which that water, or its equivalent, was rediverted at a lower point, along with other water from Sand creek, through the Divide ditch and ultimately carried into the Cache la Poudre Valley. Colorado's evidence indicated that the meadowland, Skyline, and Wilson Supply appropriations were earlier than the Laramie-Poudre tunnel appropriation and many of the Wyoming appropriations; and Wyoming recognized this difference in the dates of appropriation, although raising some question as to the quantity of water in the earlier appropriations so recognized.\n In their briefs in that suit counsel for Colorado, while urging that the doctrine of appropriation was not applicable to a controversy between the two states, but only to controversies between private appropriators within the same state, recognized that the court might hold otherwise; and on that basis they presented what they termed 'a complete review of the evidence showing the respective priorities of diversion from the Laramie River in Colorado and Wyoming.' In that review they listed the aforementioned meadowland, Skyline, Wilson Supply, and Sand creek appropriations and the proposed Laramie-Poudre tunnel appropriation, as constituting the 'diversions and use by Colorado and her citizens,' and urged that Colorado be recognized as entitled to all of them under the rule of priority, if that rule was given effect. \n\n[286 U.S. 494, 502]\n\u00a0\n With the issues, evidence, and propositions of law here outlined submitted to it, the court proceeded to a decision.\n The influence to be given to the doctrine of appropriations was much considered, as the opinion shows, and in disposing of the question the court said (\n259 \nU.S. 467, 468\n, 470 S., 42 S. Ct. 552, 558):\n'The lands in both states are naturally arid, and the need for irrigation is the same in one as in the other. The lands were settled under the same public land laws, and their settlement was induced largely by the prevailing right to divert and use water for irrigation, without which the lands were of little value. Many of the lands were acquired under the Desert Land Act, which made reclamation by irrigation a condition to the acquisition. ...\n\n'In neither state was the right to appropriate water from this interstate stream denied. On the contrary, it was permitted and recognized in both. The rule was the same on both sides of the line. Some of the appropriations were made as much as 50 years ago, and many as much as 25. In the circumstances we have stated, why should not appropriations from this stream be respected, as between the two states, according to their several priorities, as would done if the stream lay wholly within either state? By what principle of right of equity may either state proceed in disregard of prior appropriations in the other?\n\n'Colorado answers that this is not a suit between private appropriators. This is true, but it does not follow that their situation and what has been accomplished by them for their respective states can be ignored. As respects Wyoming, the welfare, prosperity, and happiness of the people of the larger part of the Laramie valley, as also a large portion of the taxable resources of two counties, are dependent on the appropriations in that state. \n\n[286 U.S. 494, 503]\n\u00a0\n Thus the interests of the state are indissolubly linked with the rights of the appropriators. To the extent of the appropriation and use of the water in Colorado a like situation exists there. ...\n\n'We conclude that Colorado's objections to the doctrine of appropriation as a basis of decision are not well taken, and that it furnishes the only basis which is consonant with the principles of right and equity applicable to such a controversy as this is. The cardinal rule of the doctrine is that priority of appropriation gives superiority of right. Each of these states applies and enforces this rule in her own territory, and it is the one to which intending appropriators naturally would turn for guidance. The principle on which it proceeds is not less applicable to interstate streams and controversies than to others. \n1\n Both states pronounce the rule just and reasonable as applied to the natural conditions in that region, and to prevent any departure from it the people of both incorporated it into their Constitutions. It originated in the customs and usages of the people before either state came into existence, and the courts of both hold that their constitutional provisions are to be taken as recognizing the prior usage rather than as creating a new rule. These considerations persuade us that its application to such a controversy as is here presented cannot be other than eminently just and equitable to all concerned.'\n\n Respecting the available supply of water the court found from the evidence that Sand creek is nominally but not actually a tributary of the Laramie, and therefore not to be considered; that at Woods, a gauging station near the Colorado-Wyoming state line, the natural flow of the Laramie after the 'recognized Colorado ap- \n\n[286 U.S. 494, 504]\n\u00a0\n propriations' are satisfied is such as to afford an available supply of 170,000 acre-feet per year, but not more; that the stream receives below Woods contributions of 93,000 acre-feet from the Little Laramie and 25,000 acre-feet from smaller affluents, making the entire available supply 288, 000 acre-feet, apart from the quantities required to satisfy the 'recognized Colorado appropriations'; and that:\n'The available supply-the 288,000 acre-feet-is not sufficient to satisfy the Wyoming appropriations dependent thereon and also the proposed Colorado appropriation,2 so it becomes necessary to consider their relative priorities.\n\n'There are some existing Colorado appropriations having priorities entitling them to precedence over many of the Wyoming appropriations. These recognized Colorado appropriations are3 18,000 acre-feet for what is known as the Skyline Ditch, and 4,250 acre-feet for the irrigation of that number of acres of native hay meadows in the Laramie valley in Colorado; the 4,250 acre-feet being what Colorado's chief witness testifies is reasonably required for the purpose, although a larger amount is claimed in the state's answer. These recognized Colorado appropriations, aggregating 22,250 acre-feet, are not to be deducted from the 288,000 acre-feet; that being the available supply after they are satisfied. Nor is Colorado's appropriation from Sand creek to be deducted; that creek, as we have shown, not being a tributary of the Laramie.'\n\n From the evidence bearing upon the relative priorities of the proposed Colorado appropriation and the Wyoming appropriations the court found that work on the former \n\n[286 U.S. 494, 505]\n\u00a0\n was begun in the latter part of October, 1909, and was prosecuted with such diligence that the appropriation should be accorded a priority as of the date when the work was begun; that some of the Wyoming appropriations were senior and others junior to that appropriation; that those which were senior to it and dependent on the common source of supply amounted to 272, 500 acre-feet per annum; and that: 'As the available supply is 288,000 acre-feet, and the amount covered by senior appropriations in Wyoming is 272,500 acre-feet, there remain 15,500 acre-feet which are subject to this junior appropriation in Colorado.'\n After stating these findings, the court's opinion concluded: A decree will accordingly be entered enjoining the defendants from diverting or taking more than 15,500 acre-feet per year from the Laramie river by means of or through the so-called Laramie-Poudre project.'\n Thereupon a decree was entered declaring (\n259 \nU.S. 496\n, 42 S. Ct. 552):\n'It is considered, ordered and decreed that the defendants, their officers, agents and servants, be, and they are hereby, severally enjoined from diverting or taking from the Laramie River and its tributaries in the State of Colorado more than fifteen thousand five hundred (15,500) acre-feet of water per annum in virtue of or through what is designated in the pleadings and evidence as the Laramie- Poudre Tunnel appropriation in that State,\n\n'Provided, that this decree shall not prejudice the right of the State of Colorado, or of any one recognized by her as duly entitled thereto, to continue to exercise the right now existing and hereby recognized to divert and take from such stream and its tributaries in that State eighteen thousand (18,000) acre-feet of water per annum in virtue of and through what is designated in the pleadings and \n\n[286 U.S. 494, 506]\n\u00a0\n evidence as the Skyline Ditch appropriation in that State; nor prejudice the right of that State, or of any one recognized by her as duly entitled thereto, to continue to exercise the right now existing and hereby recognized to divert and take from such stream and its tributaries in that State four thousand two hundred and fifty (4,250) acre-feet of water per annum in virtue of and through the meadow-land appropriations in that State which are named in the pleadings and evidence; nor prejudice or affect the right of the State of Colorado or the State of Wyoming, or of any one recognized by either State as duly entitled thereto, to continue to exercise the right to divert and use water from Sand Creek, sometimes spoken of as a tributary of the Laramie River, in virtue of any existing and lawful appropriation of the waters of such creek.'\n\n Colorado and her codefendants presented a petition for rehearing on stated grounds, one of which was that the Wilson Supply ditch appropriation was inadvertently omitted, in both opinion and decree, from the recognized early Colorado appropriations. As the omission was in fact inadvertent, the decree was then so modified as to include that appropriation among the others which Colorado was recognized as having a right to continue. \n260 \nU.S. 1\n, 43 S. Ct. 2. A change in the provision respecting costs also was sought in the petition, and was included in the modified decree. In other respects the original decree was adhered to and a rehearing denied. In that petition Colorado and her codefendants construed the decree as allotting the available supply between the two states according to priority in appropriation and limiting Colorado's allotment 'to 37,750 acre feet annually-Skyline 18,000, plus Colorado meadows 4,250, plus Laramie-Poudre 15,500.'\n We are of opinion that the record, opinion, and decree in the prior suit, here reviewed at length, show very plainly that the decree must be taken as determining the \n\n[286 U.S. 494, 507]\n\u00a0\n relative rights of the two states, including their respective citizens, to divert and use the waters of the Laramie and its tributaries. These rights were put in issue by the pleadings, displayed in the evidence, and considered and resolved in the opinion. Not only so, but the question of priority in time and right as between the appropriations in Colorado and those in Wyoming was directly presented by the pleadings and evidence and distinctly dealt with and resolved in the opinion.\n As appears from the opinion, the court held that the doctrine, long recognized and enforced in both states, whereby priority of appropriation gives superiority of right, furnished the only equitable and right basis on which to determine the controversy between them shown in the pleadings and evidence.\n And as further appears from the opinion, the court made specific findings showing the amount of water in the available supply, its insufficiency to satisfy all asserted appropriations, the date when the proposed tunnel appropriation in Colorado was initiated, the names and amounts of the appropriations in Colorado which were senior to that appropriation, the amount of water included in the Wyoming appropriations which were senior to it, and the amount which would remain in the supply and be subject to that appropriation after deducting what was required to satisfy the senior appropriations in both states.\n These findings were pertinent to the issues, and upon them the court pronounced its decree. Under a familiar rule the facts thus determined are not open to dispute in a subsequent suit between the same states. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n As before shown, the modified decree (1) restricts diversion under the Colorado tunnel appropriation to 15,500 acre-feet, the amount which under the findings would re- \n\n[286 U.S. 494, 508]\n\u00a0\n main in the supply after deducting the quantities included in the senior appropriations in both states; (2) recognizes and protects the Skyline appropriation of 18,000 acre-feet, it being a senior Colorado appropriation; (3) similarly sustains the meadow-land appropriations of 4, 250 acre-feet, they being senior Colorado appropriations; (4) recognizes and protects the small Wilson Supply ditch appropriation made prior to 1902, it being a senior Colorado appropriation inadvertently omitted from the list in the opinion but given its proper place by a modification of the original decree; and (5) saves from prejudice all appropriations of the waters of Sand creek, found not to be a tributary of the Laramie.\n The decree enjoins any diversion through the tunnel appropriation in excess of the 15,500 acre-feet accorded to it-and this doubtless for the reason that there had been a declared and real purpose to divert from 56, 000 to 71,000 acre-feet under that appropriation. No showing appears to have been made indicative of any occasion at that time for a broader injunction. Of course, in the absence of such a showing, a broader injunction was not justified. Certainly the limited injunction which was granted does not warrant any inference that it marks the limits of what was intended to be decided. Such an inference would be inconsistent with other parts of the decree and with the opinion and the findings therein.\n Construing the decree in the light of the record and opinion, to which counsel for both states appeal, we think it was intended to and does define and limit the quantity of water which Colorado and her appropriators may divert from the interstate stream and its tributaries and thus withhold from Wyoming and her appropriators.\n But it is said that water claims other than the tunnel appropriation could not be, and were not, affected by the decree, because the claimants were not parties to the suit or represented therein. In this the nature of the suit is misconceived. It was one between states, each acting \n\n[286 U.S. 494, 509]\n\u00a0\n as a quasi sovereign and representative of the interests and rights of her people in a controversy with the other. Counsel for Colorado insisted in their brief in that suit that the controversy was 'not between private parties' but 'between the two sovereignties of Wyoming and Colorado'; and this court in its opinion assented to that view, but observed that the controversy was one of immediate and deep concern to both states and that the interests of each were indissolubly linked with those of her appropriators. \n259 \nU.S. 468\n, 42 S. Ct. 552. Decisions in other cases also warrant the conclusion that the water claimants in Colorado, and those in Wyoming, were represented by their respective states and are bound by the decree. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n The contention that the present bill shows that the acts complained of are not acts done by Colorado, or under her authority, but acts done by private corporations and individuals not parties to the present suit, is shown by the bill to be untenable. It is there alleged that Colorado in 1926 permitted a diversion from the Laramie through the Laramie-Poudre tunnel appropriation materially in excess of the 15,500 acre-feet specified in the decree; that in 1926, 1927, and 1928, with the knowledge, permission, and co-operation of Colorado, diversions were made from the Laramie and its tributaries through the Skyline ditch appropriation in stated amounts materially in excess of the 18,000 acre-feet specified in the decree; that in 1926, 1927, 1928, and 1929, with the knowledge, consent, and co-operation of Colorado, diversions were made from the Laramie and its tributaries through the meadow-land appropriations in various amounts pronouncedly in excess of the 4,250 acre-feet \n\n[286 U.S. 494, 510]\n\u00a0\n specified in the decree; and that Colorado has permitted other diversions from the Laramie and its tributaries in violation of the decree through the Bob creek and other designated ditches, none of which were recognized or named in the findings or decree.\n The contention that the bill fails to show with certainty any violation of the decree or any damage to Wyoming or her water users is largely refuted by the allegations just noticed, and is further refuted by an allegation that annually since the entry of the decree the amount of water in the Laramie available to Wyoming for its water users has been less than the 272,500 acre-feet specified in the court's findings, and this shortage has been caused by the excessive and otherwise unlawful diversions before described. It is true that some of the allegations purporting to state violations of the decree are uncertain and indefinite, but there are many which are not subject to this criticism, and plainly there is enough in the bill to require that the defendant be called upon to answer it.\n An order will be entered overruling the motion to dismiss, permitting Wyoming to amend her bill within thirty days by making some of its allegations more definite and certain, if she be so advised, and permitting Colorado to answer the bill or amended bill, as the case may be, on or before the 1st day of September next.\n Motion to dismiss overruled. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Followed and applied in Weiland, State Engineer of Colorado, v.

The appellants severally were engaged in transporting freight by means of motortrucks over the highways of the state, between certain cities located within the state, under private contracts made with various named shippers, which contracts, among other terms, fixed the rate to be charged for the transportation services. While these contracts were in force and in process of being performed, the state statute was passed (Acts Tex. 1929, c. 314 as amended by Acts Tex. 1931, c. 277 (Vernon's Ann. Civ. St. Tex. art. 911b,  1 et seq.)), the effect of which, it is alleged, is to prohibit appellants from carrying out the terms, provisions, and conditions of their contracts; to preclude them from transporting freight over the highways of the state under their contracts as private carriers to their great injury; and to subject them to criminal prosecutions. It is further alleged that an enforcement of the act will destroy the business of appellants, and, unless restrained, will cause them irreparable injury.\n The following constitute the salient provisions of the act. Section 1 defines various terms used in the act. Section 3 provides that no common carrier of property for compensation or hire shall operate over the highways of the state without first obtaining a certificate of public convenience and necessity, and that no contract carrier shall thus operate without a permit so to do. Section 4 vests the Railroad Commission with authority to supervise and regulate the transportation of property for compensation or hire by motor vehicle on any public highway of the state; to fix maximum or minimum, or maximum and minimum, rates, fares, and charges in accordance with the specific provisions of the act; to prescribe rules and regulations for the government of motor carriers, for the safety of their operations, and for other purposes; to require each driver to have a license pursuant to an examination as to his ability and fitness. By the same section the commission is given broad powers of supervision and \n\n[287 U.S. 251, 261]\n\u00a0\n regulation in respect of matters affecting the relationship of the motor carriers and the shipping public, as may be necessary in the interest of the public; and also to supervise and regulate such carriers generally 'so as to carefully preserve, foster and regulate transportation and to relieve the existing and all future undue burdens on the highways arising by reason of the use of the highways by motor carriers, adjusting and administering its regulations in the interests of the public.' The Railroad Commission and the highway commission are directed to co-operate in respect of the condition of the public highways and their ability to carry existing and proposed additional traffic.\n Section 5 contains various provisions relating to common carriers over the highways, and among other things requires them to have certificates of public convenience and necessity. Section 6(a) provides that no motor carrier now operating as a contract carrier, or hereafter desiring to engage in so doing, shall operate until it shall have received a permit from the Railroad Commission which shall not be issued until the applicant has complied with the requirements of the act. Section 6(c) directs that such permits shall be granted only after a hearing, and not if the commission be of opinion 'that the proposed operation of any such contract carrier will impair the efficient public service of any authorized common carrier or common carriers then adequately serving the same territory.'\n Section 6(d) authorizes the Railroad Commission to issue special permits to persons desiring to transport for hire over the state highways live stock, mohair, wool, milk, and certain other commodities, upon such terms and under such regulations as may be deemed proper, having in mind the protection of the highways and the safety of the traveling public. Section 6aa gives the commission authority to prescribe rules and regulations governing the operation of contract carriers in competition with com- \n\n[287 U.S. 251, 262]\n\u00a0\n mon carriers over the highways, and to prescribe minimum rates to be collected by such contract carriers 'which shall not be less than the rates prescribed for common carriers for substantially the same service.'\n Section 6bb provides that no permit to operate as a contract carrier shall be granted to any person operating as a common carrier holding a certificate of convenience and necessity, and that no certificate of convenience and necessity shall be granted to any person operating as a contract carrier, and that no vehicle shall be operated by any motor carrier with both a permit and a certificate.\n Section 13 requires all motor carriers to give bonds and insurance policies, which among other things shall provide that the obligor will pay judgments recovered against the motor carrier based on claims for loss or damages for personal injuries, or 'loss of, or injury to, property occurring during the term of said bonds and policies and arising out of the actual operation of such motor carrier.' The section contains a proviso directing the commission not to require insurance covering loss of or damage to cargo in amount excessive for the class of service to be rendered by the carrier.\n Section 22(b) is a broad declaration of policy. It declares that the business of operating as a motor carrier of property for hire along the highways of the state is one affected with the public interest. It further declares that the rapid increase of motor carrier traffic and the lack of effective regulation have increased the dangers and hazards on public highways and made more stringent regulations imperative to the end that the highways may be rendered safer for public use, the wear and tear upon them reduced, discrimination in rates eliminated, congestion of traffic minimized, the use of the highways for transportation of property for hire restricted to the extent required by the necessities of the general public, and the various transportation agencies of the state adjusted and \n\n[287 U.S. 251, 263]\n\u00a0\n correlated 'so that public highways may serve the best interest of the general public.'\n The case was heard by a statutory court consisting of three judges, under section 266 of the Judicial Code, U.S.C., title 28,  380 (28 USCA 380), upon the pleadings and affidavits and other evidence. That court delivered an opinion and denied an interlocutory injunction (D.C.) 53 F.( 2d) 509. Later, and upon final hearing, the court made findings of fact and entered a decree denying a permanent injunction. The case comes here by appeal from that decree.\n Appellants assail the statute upon the following grounds: (1) That as applied to appellants, all of whom are private contract carriers, the result of the statute is to compel them to dedicate their property to the quasi public use of public transportation before they can operate their motors over the highways, and thus to take their property for public use without adequate compensation and to deprive them of their property without due process of law. In other words, the alleged effect of the statute is to convert the private carriers into common carriers by legislative fiat. (2) That the business of appellants is not affected with a public interest, and the provisions of the statute so declaring in terms, or in effect, constitute an attempt to deprive appellants of their property without due process of law, and to abrogate their right of private contract. (3) That the statute by requiring appellants to obtain a permit in the nature of a certificate of public convenience and necessity subjects them to other regulations before they can lawfully operate upon the highways, which regulations are not imposed upon other private carriers similarly situated, and thereby appellants are denied the equal protection of the laws. (4) That other regulations to which appellants are subjected are not made applicable to persons using the highways in transportation of their own commodities under substantially similar conditions, \n\n[287 U.S. 251, 264]\n\u00a0\n and thereby appellants are denied the equal protection of the laws.\n To these contentions appellees reply: (a) That the act does not undertake to convert the contract carriers into common carriers, or to require them to devote their property to any different or greater public use than that to which they have already voluntarily dedicated it, or to render any service beyond that which they have contracted to render, but merely fixes reasonable conditions upon the permissive use which they make of public property as a place of business. (b) That the act is bottomed upon the state's power to protect its highways and remove traffic hazards, as well as upon its power and duty to foster and preserve a dependable transportation system for the whole people. (c) That the contract carriers reached by the act are, under conditions, now obtaining upon the highways, engaged in a business affected with a public interest, and the reasonable regulation of their rates and practices is essential for the protection of that interest. (d) That the act is not discriminatory in the particulars asserted by appellants.\n First. It is well established law that the highways of the state are public property; that their primary and preferred use is for private purposes; and that their use for purposes of gain is special and extraordinary, which, generally at least, the legislature may prohibit or condition as it sees fit.

Public Utilities, 125 Me. 63, 65, 130 A. 866. \n\n[287 U.S. 251, 265]\n\u00a0\n Putting aside the question whether the statute may stand against the attack made under the due process of law clause, upon the theory that appellants, by reason of their use of the public highways, are engaged in a business impressed with a public interest, and the question whether it may be justified on the ground that, wholly apart from its relation to highway conservation, it is necessary in order to prevent impairment of the public service of authorized common carriers adequately serving the same territory, we confine our inquiry to the question whether, in the light of the broad general rule just stated, the statute may be construed and sustained as a constitutional exercise of the legislative power to regulate the use of the state highways. Provisions of the statute assailed on the ground that they are not highway regulations and violate the due process of law clause are: the requirement that the private contract carrier before engaging in business must obtain a permit upon considerations relating to the effect of their competition upon existing common carriers; the provision authorizing the Railroad Commission to fix the minimum rates of such private carriers operating in competition with common carriers, which shall not be less than the rates pescribed for common carriers for substantially the same service; and the requirement, as appellants interpret the statute, that such private carriers must furnish cargo insurance policies and bonds.\n We are of opinion that neither by specific provision or provisions, nor by the statute considered as a whole, is there an attempt to convert private contract carriers by motor into common carriers. Certainly, the statute does not say so. Common carriers by motor and private contract carriers are classified separately and subjected to distinctly separate provisions. By section 1(h), the contract carrier is defined as 'any motor carrier ... transporting \n\n[287 U.S. 251, 266]\n\u00a0\n property for compensation or hire over any highway in this State other than as a common carrier.' It is difficult to see how the Legislature could more clearly have evinced an intention to avoid an attempt to convert the contract carrier into a common carrier. It is true that the regulations imposed upon the two classes are in some instances similar, if not identical; but they are imposed upon each class considered by itself, and it does not follow that regulations appropriately imposed upon the business of a common carrier may not also be appropriate to the business of a contract carrier.\n Appellants, in support of their contention, rely upon prior decisions of this court; but there is nothing in any of them, as a brief review will disclose, which requires us to hold that the legislation here under review compels private contract carriers to assume the duties and obligations of common carriers, or interferes with their freedom to limit their business to that of carrying under private contracts as they have been wont to do.\n Michigan Public Utilities Commission v. Duke, \n266 \nU.S. 570\n, 45 S.Ct. 191, 36 A.L.R. 1105, dealt with a state law which expressly provided that all persons engaged in the transportation of persons or property for hire by motor vehicle upon the public highways of the state should be common carriers, and that all laws of the state regulating transportation by other common carriers should apply with equal force and effect to such common carriers. It was upon this express provision that this court based its holding (pages 577, 578 of 266 U.S., 45 S.Ct. 191) that it was beyond the power of the state by legislative fiat to convert property used exclusively in the business of a private carrier into a public utility, or to make the owner a public carrier, since that would be to take private property for public use without just compensation in violation of the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n Buck v. Kuykendall, \n267 \nU.S. 307\n, 45 S.Ct. 324, 38 A.L. R. 286, and Bush & Sons Co. v. Maloy, \n267 \nU.S. 317\n, 45 S.Ct. 326, 327, were cases which dealt with state \n\n[287 U.S. 251, 267]\n\u00a0\n statutes affecting interstate commerce and with discriminations relating thereto. No such questions are raised in respect of the application to appellants of the Texas statute now under consideration.\n The question decided in Frost & Frost Trucking Co. v. R.R. Comm., \n271 \nU.S. 583\n, 46 S.Ct. 605, 47 A.L.R. 457, differs entirely from that here presented. There (page 592 of 271 U.S., 46 S.Ct. 605) the California Supreme Court (Frost v. Railroad Comm., 197 Cal. 230, 240 P. 26) had construed a provision of the state statute which required the private contract carrier to obtain, not a permit, as here, but a certificate of public convenience and necessity before doing business over the state highways, as a condition obliging him to dedicate his property to the business of public transportation and to subject himself to all the duties and burdens imposed by the act upon common carriers. This court, in accordance with the settled rule, accepted that construction as binding and, in that view, said (page 592 of 271 U.S., 46 S.Ct. 605, 606):\n'... The case presented is not that of a private carrier, who, in order to have the privilege of using the highways, is required merely to secure a certificate of public convenience and become subject to regulations appropriate to that kind of a carrier, but it is that of a private carrier, who, in order to enjoy the use of the highways, must submit to the condition of becoming a common carrier and of being regulated as such by the Railroad Commission. The certificate of public convenience, required by section 5, is exacted of a common carrier, and is purely incidental to that status. The requirement does not apply to a private carrier qua private carrier, but to him only in his imposed statutory character of common carrier. Apart from that signification, so far as he is concerned, it does not exist.'\n\n On the contrary, the Texas statute in respect of permits deals exclusively with the private contract carrier, and requires the issue of the permit not to him in the imposed character of a common carrier, but in his actual character \n\n[287 U.S. 251, 268]\n\u00a0\n as a private contract carrier. If the California statute requiring a certificate had been thus interpreted by the highest court of the state, the foregoing quotation clearly suggests that our decision might have been otherwise.\n Smith v. Cahoon, \n283 \nU.S. 553\n, 51 S.Ct. 582, dealt with a Florida statute indiscriminately applying to all who operated motor vehicles for compensation or as common carriers over public highways, and prohibiting such operation without a certificate of public convenience and necessity, application for which was to be accompanied by a schedule of tariffs. No certificate was valid unless a bond were given by the applicant for protection against injuries resulting from negligence, and for the protection of persons and property carried. The Railroad Commission was vested with authority to fix or approve rates, regulate service, prescribe methods of keeping accounts, etc. Schedules of rates were to be open to the public, and all alterations in tariffs were under the commission's control. The violation of any provision of the act was made a misdemeanor punishable by fine or imprisonment or by both. This court held that, since the statute affixed the same conditions to all who applied for certificates, and embraced in those conditions a scheme of supervision and control which constitutionally could be applied only to common carriers, a private carrier for hire could not constitutionally be arrested under it for failure to procure a certificate or pay the tax required by the act. It further held that, if the statute were regarded as intended to afford one constitutional scheme for common carriers and another for private carriers, it failed to define the obligations of private carriers with the certainty required of criminal statutes, and was therefore void; and that this defect was not removed by a decision of the state court declaring the provisions separable, and that only those legally applicable to private carriers were intended to apply to them, without also deciding which provisions were so applicable. 'No separate \n\n[287 U.S. 251, 269]\n\u00a0\n scheme of regulation,' we said (page 563 of 283 U.S., 51 S.Ct. 582, 585), 'can be discerned in the terms of the act with respect to those considerations of safety and proper operation affecting the use of highways which may appropriately relate to private carriers as well as to common carriers.'\n The vice of the statute was that all carriers for hire, whether public or private, were put upon the same footing by explicit provisions which could not be severed so as to afford one valid scheme for common carriers and another for private carriers, with the result that, until the separability of these provisions should be determined by competent authority, they were void for uncertainty. In the Texas statute no such uncertainty exists. The provisions intended to be applicable to contract carriers are distinctly set forth and separately stated, plainly leaving for determination only the question whether such provisions, or any of them, are invalid as so applied. Continental Baking Co. v. Woodring, \n286 \nU.S. 352, 364\n, 52 S.Ct. 595\n\n\n We come, then, to consider the challenged provisions of the statute under review, in the light of their exclusive relation to contract carriers, unembarrassed by any previous ruling of this court. In view of the conclusions to which we shall come, it is not necessary to determine whether the operation of trucks for the transportation of freight under private contracts, carried into effect by the use of the public highways, is a business impressed with a public interest.\n There is ample support in the record for the following findings of the court below:\n'The evidence shows there are 1,360,413 motor vehicles other than either common or contract carriers or commercial carriers of passengers registered for use on the highways of Texas, and that it is one of the purposes of the Legislature to make the use of the highways safer and more convenient for these private operators, involving incidentally either a lessening of commercial transporta- \n\n[287 U.S. 251, 270]\n\u00a0\n tion on the highways, or such improvement in their character and practices as to effect the same result. In this connection, the Court finds that the provisions of the statute carried out in accordance with the declaration of purpose and the specific instructions therein will have the effect either of lessening commercial traffic on the highways, or, by bringing it under careful and adequate supervision, of making the use thereof by the very large number of owners and operators of private motor vehicles safer and more convenient.\n\n'The increase of unregulated truck transportation over the highways had developed a difficult and perplexing public problem to the extent that the Governor of the State in his message to the Legislature called attention to the fact that the highways were being taken and badly used by motor vehicles engaged in the transportation of freight for hire.\n\n'The number of contract carriers on the highways of Texas having rapidly grown, as elsewhere found, the business they conduct now exists as a very large factor in commercial transportation. The court finds that it is not the effect of one such carrier or a limited number thereof which produced the serious problem with which the Legislature of Texas purported to deal and has dealt, but it is the effect, in the aggregate, of such contract carriers that is important.\n\n'The inevitable result of the continuance of the enormous increase of so-called private carriers for hire and the continual decrease in the number of common carriers holding certificates of public convenience and necessity will be the practical disappearance altogether of common carriers from the roads.\n\n'The Legislature has declared that all of the available carriage service, including common carriage by rail and road and contract carriage by road, are so interdependent \n\n[287 U.S. 251, 271]\n\u00a0\n that the public may not continue to have a safe and dependable transportation system unless private carriers operating on the same roads with common carriers are brought under just and reasonable regulations bringing their service into relation with common carriers, and we find the evidence supports this finding.\n\n'The requirement of the Texas statute under attack that contract carriers must have a permit with the prerequisites in the statute for such a permit, is reasonable, particularly in that this method enables the State to know who will use its highways and to more efficiently regulate such use. The permit system has immediate relation to the condition of the roads and bridges, congestion of the highways and the character of equipment to be used, which relates not only to the effect of the operations on business but also to the problem of safety and convenience in use of the highway.\n\n'The experience of the Railroad Commission supports the Legislative declaration that unregulated contract carriers under the former law effectively prevents the primary purpose of fostering and conserving for the public welfare all commercial transportation on the highways which it has been the purpose of the laws of Texas, under rules of the Commission, to foster.'\n\n These and other findings and the evidence contained in the record conclusively show that during recent years the unregulated use of the highways of the state by a vast and constantly growing number of private contract carriers has had the effect of greatly decreasing the freight which would be carried by railroads within the state, and, in consequence, adding to the burden upon the highways. Certainly, the removal or amelioration of that burden, with its resulting injury to the highways, interference with their primary use, danger, and inconvenience, is a legitimate subject for the exercise of the state legislative power. And that this was one of the chief ends sought \n\n[287 U.S. 251, 272]\n\u00a0\n to be accomplished by the provisions in question, the record amply establishes.\n The assailed provisions, in this view, are not ends in and of themselves, but means to the legitimate end of conserving the highways. The extent to which, as means, they conduce to that end, the degree of their efficiency, the closeness of their relation to the end sought to be attained, are matters addressed to the judgment of the Legislature, and not to that of the courts. It is enough if it can be seen that in any degree, or under any reasonably conceivable circumstances, there is an actual relation between the means and the end. Compare McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 409, 410, 419, 421, 423; Veazie Bank v. Fenno, 8 Wall. 533, 549; Legal Tender Cases, 12 Wall. 457, 539, 540, 541, 542, 543; Pomeroy, Constitutional Law (9th Ed .)  268a.\n Turning our attention then to the provision for permits, it is to be observed that the requirement is not that the private contract carrier shall obtain a certificate of public convenience and necessity, but that he shall obtain a permit, the issue of which is made dependent upon the condition that the efficiency of common carrier service then adequately serving the same territory shall not be impaired. Does the required relation here exist between the condition imposed and the end sought? We think it does. But, in any event, if the Legislature so concluded, as it evidently did, that conclusion must stand, since we are not able to say that in reaching it that body was manifestly wrong. Jacobson v. Massachusetts, \n197 \nU.S. 11, 30\n, 31 S., 25 S.Ct. 358, 3 Ann.Cas. 765. Compare Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., \n272 \nU.S. 365, 395\n, 47 S.Ct. 114, 54 A.L.R. 1016; Zahn v. Board of Public Works, \n274 \nU.S. 325, 328\n, 47 S.Ct. 594. Debatable questions of this character are not for the courts, but for the Legislature, which is entitled to form its own judgment. Sproles v. Binford, \n286 \nU.S. 374, 388\n, 389 S., 52 S.Ct. 581. Leaving out of consideration common carriers by \n\n[287 U.S. 251, 273]\n\u00a0\n trucks, impairment of the railway freight service, in the very nature of things, must result, to some degree, in adding to the burden imposed upon the highways. Or, stated conversely, any diversion of traffic from the highways to the railroads must correspondingly relieve the former and therefore contribute directly to their conservation. There is thus a substantial relation between the means here adopted and the end sought. This is made plain by the Sproles Case, supra (page 394 of 286 U.S., 52 S. Ct. 581, 587):\n'The state has a vital interest in the appropriate utilization of the railroads which serve its people, as well as in the proper maintenance of its highways as safe and convenient facilities. The state provides its highways and pays for their upkeep. Its people make railroad transportation possible by the payment of transportation charges. It cannot be said that the state is powerless to protect its highways from being subjected to excessive burdens when other means of transportation are available. The use of highways for truck transportation has its manifest convenience, but we perceive no constitutional ground for denying to the state the right to foster a fair distribution of traffic to the end that all necessary facilities should be maintained and that the public should not be inconvenienced by inordinate uses of its highways for purposes of gain. This is not a case of a denial of the use of the highways to one class of citizens as opposed to another, or of limitations having no appropriate relation to highway protection.'\n\n What has just been said applies in the main to the other challenged provision authorizing the commission to prescribe minimum rates not less than those prescribed for common carriers for substantially the same service. This provision, by precluding the contract carriers from rendering service at rates under those charged by the railroad carriers, has a definite tendency to relieve the highways by \n\n[287 U.S. 251, 274]\n\u00a0\n diverting traffic from them to the railroads. The authority is limited to the fixing of minimum rates. The contract carrier may not charge less than the rates so fixed, but is left free to charge as much more as he sees fit and can obtain. Undoubtedly, this interferes with the freedom of the parties to contract, but it is not such an interference as the Fourteenth Amendment forbids. While freedom of contract is the general rule, it is nevertheless not absolute but subject to a great variety of legitimate restraints, among which are such as are required for the safety and welfare of the state and its inhabitants. Knoxville Iron Co. v. Harbison, \n183 \nU.S. 13, 22\n, 22 S.Ct. 1; Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Riverside Mills, \n219 \nU.S. 186, 202\n, 31 S.Ct. 164, 31 L.R.A.( N.S.) 7; Chicago, B. & Quincy R. Co. v. McGuire, \n219 U.S. 549\n, 567, et seq ., 31 S.Ct. 259; Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. Int. Com. Comm., \n221 \nU.S. 612, 619\n, 31 S.Ct. 621. When the exercise of that freedom conflicts with the power and duty of the state to safeguard its property from injury and preserve it for those uses for which it was primarily designed, such freedom may be regulated and limited to the extent which reasonably may be necessary to carry the power and duty into effect. Compare McLean v. Arkansas, \n211 \nU.S. 539, 545\n, 29 S.Ct. 206; Miller v. Wilson, \n236 \nU.S. 373, 380\n, 35 S.Ct. 342, L.R.A. 1915F, 829; Frisbie v. United States, \n157 \nU.S. 160, 165\n, 15 S.Ct. 586; Highland v. Russell Car & Snow Plow Co., \n279 \nU.S. 253, 261\n, 49 S.Ct. 314; Adkins v. Children's Hospital, \n261 \nU.S. 525, 546\n, 43 S.Ct. 394, 24 A.L.R. 1238.\n Here the circumstance which justifies what otherwise might be an unconstitutional interference with the freedom of private contract is that the contract calls for a service, the performance of which contemplates the use of facilities belonging to the state; and it would be strange doctrine which, while recognizing the power of the state to regulate the use itself, would deny its power to regulate the contract so far as it contemplates the use. 'Contracts which relate to the use of the highways must be deemed to have been made in contemplation of the regulatory authority of the state.' Sproles v. Binford, supra, \n\n[287 U.S. 251, 275]\n\u00a0\n at pages 390, 391 of 286 U.S., 52 S.Ct. 581, 586, and authorities cited. The principle that Congress may regulate private contracts whenever reasonably necessary to effect any of the great purposes for which the national government was created, Highland v. Russell Car & Snow Plow Co., supra, at page 261 of 279 U.S., 49 S.Ct. 314, applies to a state under like circumstances.\n An entirely different question was presented in the Frost Trucking Case, supra. There, as we pointed out (pages 591, 592, of 271 U.S., 46 S. Ct. 605), the California act, as construed by the highest court of the state, was in no real sense a regulation of the use of the public highways. Its purpose was to protect the business of those who were common carriers in fact by controlling competitive conditions. Protection or conservation of the highways was not involved. \n1\n The condition which constrained the private contract carrier to become a common carrier, therefore, had no relation to the highways. In this view, the use of the highways furnished a purely unrelated occasion for imposing the unconstitutional condition, affording no firmer basis for that condition than would have been the case if the contract carrier were using a road in private ownership.\n The Texas statute, on the contrary, rests definitely upon the policy of highway conservation, and the provision now under review is governed by the same principle as that which recognizes the authority of a state to prescribe the conditions upon which it will permit public work to be done on its behalf. Among such conditions it may prescribe that laborers employed by a contractor to do such work shall not be permitted to labor more than eight hours per day. Atkin v. Kansas, \n191 \nU.S. 207\n, 24 S.Ct. 124. 'It cannot be deemed a part of the liberty of any contractor,' it is said at pages 222, 223 of 191 U.S., 24 S.Ct. 124, 127, 'that he be allowed to do public work in any mode he may choose to adopt \n\n[287 U.S. 251, 276]\n\u00a0\n without regard to the wishes of the state. On the contrary, it belongs to the state, as the guardian and trustee for its people, and having control of its affairs, to prescribe the conditions upon which it will permit public work to be done on its behalf, or on behalf of its municipalities. No court has authority to review its action in that respect. Regulations on this subject suggest only considerations of public policy. And with such considerations the courts have no concern.' See, also, Ellis v. United States, \n206 \nU.S. 246, 256\n, 27 S.Ct. 600, 11 Ann.Cas. 589; Heim v. McCall, \n239 \nU.S. 175, 191\n, 36 S.Ct. 78, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 287. It may be said with like force that it belongs to the state, 'as master in its own house,' to prescribe the terms upon which persons will be permitted to contract in respect of the use of the public highways for purposes of gain. See Hodge Drive-It-Yourself Co. v. Cincinnati, \n284 \nU.S. 335, 337\n, 52 S.Ct. 144.\n We need not consider whether the act in some other aspect would be good or bad. It is enough to support its validity that, plainly, one of its aims is to conserve the highways. If the Legislature had other or additional purposes, which, considered apart, it had no constitutional power to make effective, that would not have the result of making the act invalid. Ellis v. United States, \n206 \nU.S. 246, 256\n, 27 S.Ct. 600, 11 Ann.Cas. 589. Nor does it matter that the legislation has the result of modifying or abrogating contracts already in effect. Such contracts are to be regarded as having been made subject to the future exercise of the constitutional power of the state. Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Mottley, \n219 U.S. 467\n, 480, et seq., 31 S.Ct. 265, 34 L.R.A.(N.S.) 671; Union Bridge Co. v. United States, \n204 \nU.S. 364, 400\n, 27 S.Ct. 367; Sproles v. Binford, supra, at pages 390, 391 of 286 U.S., 52 S.Ct. 581.\n The provision of section 13, requiring every motor carrier, whether operating under permit or certificate, to furnish a bond and policy of insurance conditioned that the obligor will pay, among other things, for loss of, or injury to, property arising out of the actual operation of the carrier, is construed by appellants as including car- \n\n[287 U.S. 251, 277]\n\u00a0\n goes carried by them, and is assailed as a requirement bearing no relation to public safety, but as an attempt to condition the purely private contractual relationship between shipper and private carrier. It is said that the proviso which prohibits the commission from requiring insurance covering loss of, or damage to, cargo in an excessive amount requires the construction suggested. So far as appears, no attempt yet has been made to enforce the provision against any of these appellants, and until that is done they have no occasion to complain. Moreover, no state court thus far has dealt with the question, and, unless obliged to do otherwise, we should not adopt a construction which might render the provision of doubtful validity, but await a determination of the matter by the courts of the state. Utah Power & L. Co. v. Pfost, \n286 \nU.S. 165, 186\n, 52 S.Ct. 548.\n Second. The contention that the act, in certain particulars, denies appellants the equal protection of the laws requires only brief consideration. Section 6(d), which authorizes the issue of special permits to persons engaged in the business of transporting certain named commodities upon such terms, conditions, and restrictions as the Railroad Commission may deem proper, etc., is said to discriminate arbitrarily against carriers of commodities of a similar character, in that the selected carriers are not required to comply with many of the onerous provisions of the statute. It is by no means clear that such is the case, and it is asserted on behalf of appellees, and not disputed, that the Attorney General of the state, in an official opinion, has construed the provision to mean that persons operating under these special permits either as contract or common carriers are subject to the provisions of the act applicable to such carriers, and that this construction has been accepted by the Railroad Commission. There is nothing in the record to suggest that the provision has been otherwise applied. Appellants in this \n\n[287 U.S. 251, 278]\n\u00a0\n regard, therefore, have no ground upon which to base a complaint.\n Nor do we find merit in the further contention that the act arbitrarily discriminates against appellants because it does not apply to persons, commonly known as 'shipper-owners,' who are transporting their own commodities under substantially similar conditions. It is obvious that certain provisions of the statute, like that requiring the commission to fix minimum rates, can have no application to such owners. We are of opinion, from an examination of the act and the companion act which was upheld by this court in Sproles v. Binford, supra, that all provisions relating to contract carriers which are germane to shipper-owners are made applicable to them. In any event, it is not shown that the act thus far has been so administered as to result in any unlawful discrimination.\n The decree of the court below is\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice BUTLER dissents. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The California Supreme Court expressly said that the act 'does not purport to be and is not in fact a regulation of the use of the highways.'

Sterling, Governor of the state of Texas, W. W. Sterling, adjutant general of the state, and Jacob F. Wolters, brigadier general of the Texas National Guard, from enforcing their military or executive orders regulating or restricting the production of oil from complainants' wells and from interfering in any manner 'with the lawful production of oil from plaintiffs' property.' 57 F.(2d) 227, 242. By stipulation, causes of action set forth in the amended bill of complaint against these defendants and others were severed, and the suit proceeded to trial upon the merits against these defendants separately, and was submitted upon the pleadings and the evidence taken on the application for the interlocutory injunction. The court entered final judgment making the interlocutory injunction permanent, and appeals have been taken to this Court from both the interlocutory order and the final judgment. As the case is now here on the latter appeal (No. 453), the appeal from the interlocutory order (No. 11) will be dismissed. Champlin Refining Co. v. Corporation Commission, \n286 \nU.S. 210, 224\n, 52 S.Ct. 559. \n\n[287 U.S. 378, 387]\n\u00a0\n Complainants, as owners of interests in oil and gas leaseholds, originally brought the suit, on October 13, 1931, against members of the Railroad Commission of Texas, the Attorney General of the state, Brigadier General Wolters, and others, to restrain the enforcement of orders of the commission limiting the production of oil. These orders were alleged to be arbitrary and illegal, as having been made in violation of the statutes of Texas and in pursuance of a conspiracy in the interest of prices, and as operating to deprive complainants of their property without due process of law, contrary to both the state and the Federal Constitutions. The District Judge set the application for preliminary injunction for hearing on October 28, 1931, before a specially constituted court of three judges, and meanwhile made a temporary order restraining the defendants from limiting complainants' production below 5,000 barrels per well. 57 F.(2d) page 229. The defendants who were members of the Railroad Commission accordingly ceased their attempt to enforce the orders thus challenged.\n Previously, on August 16, 1931, Governor Sterling had issued a proclamation stating that certain counties (in which complainants' properties were located) were in 'a state of insurrection, tumult, riot, and a breach of the peace,' and declaring 'martial law' in that territory. The Governor directed Brigadier General Wolters to assume supreme command of the situation and to take such steps as he might deem necessary in order 'to enforce and uphold the majesty of the law,' subject to the orders of the Governor as commanders in chief, as given through the adjutant general. From that time General Wolters acted as 'commanding officer of said military district.'\n When the District Court made its temporary restraining order in this suit, as above stated, Governor Sterling, learning that the orders made by the Railroad Commis- \n\n[287 U.S. 378, 388]\n\u00a0\n sion could no longer be enforced, issued his oral and written orders to General Wolters to limit the production of oil in the described military district to 165 barreils per well per day. This was the limit fixed by the commission's order of October 10th, the enforcement of which was subject to the restraining order. On October 28th, the Governor made the limit 150 barrels, and on November 6th, 125 barrels. These orders were enforced by General Wolters, and contempt proceedings were brought against him.\n On November 20, 1931, by leave of the District Court, complainants filed an amended bill making Governor Sterling and W. W. Sterling, adjutant general, parties to the suit, and alleging that the above- mentioned military and executive orders limiting production were without justification in law or in fact, were arbitrary and capricious, and were repugnant to the state and Federal Constitutions. Complainants alleged that there had been no request by the civil authorities for the use of the military forces; that all courts in said area were 'open and transacting their ordinary business'; that there were 'no armed bodies of civilians in said area,' nor 'any bodies of men threatening bloodshed, violence or destruction'; but that, on the contrary, 'the citizens in said community are in a quiet, peaceable condition and amenable and obedient to any process which might be served upon them.' Defendants Governor Sterling. Adjutant General Sterling, and General Wolters answered the bill, setting forth the executive proclamation and orders, and the declaration of martial law, and asserting the validity of the acts assailed. By a supplemental petition, in response to the answer, complainants denied that the Governor, under the Constitution and statutes of the state, could lawfully exercise the authority he had assumed, and specifically alleged that, if any statute of the state conferred such authority, it contravened stated pro- \n\n[287 U.S. 378, 389]\n\u00a0\n visions of the Constitution of the state and the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. At the time of the hearing of the application for preliminary injunction, it appeared that the executive orders had further limited the complainants' production to 100 barrels per day. 57 F. (2d) page 229.\n Upon that application, the District Court received the evidence submitted by both parties, and, considering it to be 'without substantial conflict,' stated that it established the following facts:\n In August, 1931, the Legislature of Texas passed an amended oil and conservation act. Chapter 26, Acts 42d Leg. (1931) 1st Called Sess., Vernon's Ann. Civ. St. Texas, arts. 6008, 6014, 6029, 6032, 6049c. The Governor, in issuing his proclamation of August 16th, recited the provisions of the Constitution and statutes of Texas for the conservation of oil and gas and the existence in the East Texas oil field, the territory in question, of an organized group of oil and gas producers who were said to be in a state of insurrection against the conservation laws; that the civil officers did not have a sufficient force to compel them to obey; that by reason of their reckless production enormous physical waste was being created; that this condition had brought about such a state of public feeling that, if the state government could not protect the public's interest, they would take the law into their own hands; that this condition had caused threats of acts of violence; that it was necessary to give the Railroad Commission time to have hearings and promulgate proper orders to put the law into force; that a state of 'insurrection, tumult, riot and breach of the peace existed in the defined area,' and that there was 'serious danger threatening to citizens and property, not only there, but in other oil producing areas of the State'; and that it was necessary 'that the reckless and illegal exploitation' should be stopped until such time as the said resources might be property conserved and developed \n\n[287 U.S. 378, 390]\n\u00a0\n under the protection of the civil authorities. The troops were then called out, and the oil wells were shut down. In September, after the commission had made its order limiting production, while the proclamation of martial law was not rescinded nor the troops entirely withdrawn, the military occupation in force ended. The wells were opened and continued to produce daily under the order of the Railroad Commission. General Wolters, with the assistance of the 'Rangers,' the civil officers of the community, and 'the few military still remaining in the field,' and in aid of the commission, patrolled the territory to see that its orders were complied with; that from time to time the commission, sometimes with the approval, and sometimes with the disapproval, of the Governor, made its orders further limiting production, and these orders were obeyed.\n The District Court also found that, after the restraining order against the commission had been issued in this suit, the defendants Governor Sterling and General Wolters 'determined not to brook court interference with the program of restricted production which they determined to continue.' Acting 'in the real, though mistaken, belief that the federal court, while competent as to the commission, was during the continuance of the proclaimed state of war without jurisdiction over their actions,' by virtue of the claim, which the District Court found to be wholly without support in the evidence, 'that war conditions were prevailing in the field, and that military necessity required the action,' they 'ousted the commission from the fixing of and superintendence over the daily production allowed, and have since controlled production by purported military orders.'\n As to the actual conditions in the area affected by these orders, the District Court made for following finding:\n'It was conceded that at no time has there been any actual uprising in the territory. At no time has any mili- \n\n[287 U.S. 378, 391]\n\u00a0\n tary force been exerted to put riots or mobs down. At no time, except in the refusal of defendant Wolters to observe the injunction in this case, have the civil authorities or courts been interfered with or their processes made impotent. Though it was testified to by defendants that from reports which came to them they believed that, if plaintiffs' wells were not shut in, there would be dynamiting of property in the oil fields, and efforts to close them and any others which opened by violence, and that, if that occurred, there would be general trouble in the field, no evidence of any dynamite having been used, or show of violence practiced or actually attempted, or even threatened against any specific property in the field, was offered. We find, therefore, that, not only was there never any actual riot, tumult, or insurrection, which would create a state of war existing in the field, but that, if all of the conditions had come to pass, they would have resulted merely in breaches of the peace, to be suppressed by the militia as a civil force, and not at all in a condition constituting, or even remotely resembling, a state of war.' 57 F.(2d) page 231.\n\n Referring to the testimony of Governor Sterling and General Wolters that the orders had not been issued for the purpose of affecting prices, nor even per se to limit production, but 'as acts of military necessity to suppress actual threatened war' as they believed from reports brought to them that 'unless they kept the production of oil down to within 400,000 barrels, a warlike riot or insurrection, in effect a state of war, would ensue,' the District Court said:\n'We find no warrant in the evidence for such belief. Looking at it in the light most favorable to defendants' contention, it presents nothing more than threats of violence or breaches of the peace. The testimony showed that martial law had not ousted the commission from making and enforcing rules regulating conservation, ex- \n\n[287 U.S. 378, 392]\n\u00a0\n cept alone as to production from the field. One of their witnesses testified: 'Now the Governor with his military representatives has taken over the proration end but the conservation end is still with the Commission.' The evidence shows no insurrection nor riot; in fact, existing at any time in the territory, no closure of the courts, no failure of civil authorities. It shows that at no time has there been in fact any condition resembling a state of war, and that, unless the Governor may be proclamation create an irrebuttable presumption that a state of war exists, the actions of the Governor and his staff may not be justified on the ground of military necessity.' 57 F.(2d) 231.\n\n Having thus found the facts, the District Court, maintaining its jurisdiction, examined the provisions of the Constitution and statutes of the state to ascertain whether they had conferred upon the Governor the power he had assumed to exercise. The court concluded that not only was no such affirmative authority conferred, but that express provisions of the Constitution withheld such power; that, when the Governor calls out the troops of Texas, it is not as a military but as a civil officer; that their powers and duties are derived from the civil law; and that at no time and under no conditions are their actions above court review. The court held that, under the Constitution of Texas, courts may not be closed or their processes interfered with by military orders, that courts cannot be ousted by the agencies detailed to aid them, and that their functions cannot be transferred to tribunals unknown to the Constitution. In this view, the court decided that appellants 'without warrant of law' had been depriving complainants of their undoubted right to operate their own properties in a prudent and reasonable way, in accordance with the laws of the state. 57 F.(2d) pages 236-241. The final judgment, entered pursuant to the stipulation of the parties and upon the same record, rests upon the same findings and conclusions. \n\n[287 U.S. 378, 393]\n\u00a0\n Appellants contend (1) that the Governor has power to declare martial law; (2) that courts may not review the sufficiency of facts upon which martial law is declared; (3) that courts may not control by injunction the means of enforcing martial law; and (4) that the finding of the Governor of necessity to take property is due process of law.\n First. The District Court had jurisdiction. The suit is not against the state. The applicable principle is that, where state officials, purporting to act under state authority, invade rights secured by the Federal Constitution, they are subject to the process of the federal courts in order that the persons injured may have appropriate relief.

The Governor of the state, in this respect, is in no different position from that of other state officials. See Davis v. Gray, 16 Wall. 203, 210, 233; Continental Banking Co. v. Woodring, Governor of Kansas, et al., \n286 \nU.S. 352\n, 52 S.Ct. 595; Binford et al. v. J. H. McLeaish & Co., \n284 \nU.S. 598\n, 52 S.Ct. 207; Id. (D.C.) 52 F.( 2d) 151, 152; Sproles v. Binford et al., \n286 \nU.S. 374\n, 52 S.Ct. 581. Nor does the fact that it may appear that the state officer in such a case, while acting under color of state law, has exceeded the authority conferred by the state, deprive the court of jurisdiction. Iowa- Des Moines Nat. Bank v. Bennett, \n284 \nU.S. 239, 246\n, 52 S.Ct. 133; Fidelity & Deposit Co. v.

The jurisdiction of the District Court so constituted, and of this Court upon appeal, extends to every question involved, whether of state or federal law, and enables the \n\n[287 U.S. 378, 394]\n\u00a0\n court to rest its judgment on the decision of such of the questions as in its opinion effectively dispose of the case. Siler v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., \n213 \nU.S. 175, 191\n, 29 S.Ct. 451; Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Garrett, \n231 \nU.S. 298, 303\n, 34 S.Ct. 48; Davis v.

Appellants rely upon article 4,  1, 7, and 10 of the state Constitution, and articles 5778, 5830, 5834, and 5889 of the Revised Civil Statutes of the state 1925. The provisions of the state Constitution make the Governor the chief executive officer of the state and commander in chief of its military forces, with 'power to call forth the militia to execute the laws of the state, to suppress insurrection, repel invasion, and protect the frontier.' The Governor 'shall cause the laws to be faithfully executed.' The statutes cited are set forth in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[287 U.S. 378, 395]\n\u00a0\n In support of the conclusion of the court below that the Governor did not have authority as extensive as that asserted in this case, appellees invoke the provisions of the Bill of Rights (article 1) of the state Constitution as follows:\n'Sec. 12. The writ of habeas corpus is a writ of right, and shall never be suspended. ...'\n\n'Sec. 24. The military shall at all times be subordinate to the civil authority.'\n\n'Sec. 28. No power of suspending laws in this state shall be exercised except by the legislature.'\n\n'Sec. 29. To guard against transgressions of the high powers herein delegated, we declare that everything in this 'Bill of Rights' is excepted out of the general powers of government, and shall forever remain inviolate, and all laws contrary thereto, or to the following provisions, shall be void.'\n\n Appellees contend that the subsequent articles of the Constitution are to be construed in harmony with these provisions of the Bill of Rights, and that these show clearly that it was not the intention of the people of Texas to confer upon the Governor the authority to declare martial law, but only to suppress insurrections, to repel invasions, and to afford the protection necessary to preserve the peace, acting in aid, and not in subversion, of the civil authority and of the jurisdiction of the courts. These provisions, said the District Court, 'were written into the fundamental law as direct inhibitions upon the executive, by men who had suffered under the imposition of martial law, with its suspension of civil authority, and the ousting of the courts during reconstruction in Texas.' 'In every convention,' said the court, 'in every gathering assembled, protesting the suppression of free speech, the interference with the processes, the judgments, the decrees of courts, these men had denounced martial tyranny, and sought relief against it, and, when they met \n\n[287 U.S. 378, 396]\n\u00a0\n to adopt the Constitution of 1876 which still obtains, they determined to, and they did, so write the fundamental law that such deprivations of liberty might never again occur.' 57 F.(2d) page 237.\n While we recognize the force of these observations, and the question of the interpretation of the provisions of the state Constitution is before us, it is still a matter of local law, as to which the courts of the state would in any event have the final word. We do not find it necessary to determine that question, and we shall not attempt to explore the history of Texas or to review the decisions of the state courts cited by the appellees. \n2\n We pass to the consideration of the federal question presented, and for that purpose we shall assume, without deciding, that the law of the state authorizes what the Governor has done.\n Third. The existence and nature of the complainants' rights are not open to question. Their ownership of the oil properties is undisputed. Their right to the enjoyment and use of these properties, subject to reasonable regulation by the state in the exercise of its power to prevent unnecessary loss, destruction, and waste, is protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Ohio Oil Company v. Indiana, \n177 \nU.S. 190\n, 20 S.Ct. 576; Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., \n220 \nU.S. 61\n, 31 S.Ct. 337, Ann. Cas. 1912C, 160; Walls v. Midland \n\n[287 U.S. 378, 397]\n\u00a0\n Carbon Co., \n254 \nU.S. 300\n, 41 S.Ct. 118; Bandini Petroleum Co. v. Superior Court, \n284 U.S. 8\n, 52 St.Ct. 103; Champlin Refining Co. v. Corporation Commission, \n286 \nU.S. 210\n, 52 S.Ct. 559. The state, in this instance, had asserted its regulatory authority by enacting laws for the prevention of waste, and had empowered the Railroad Commission to investigate and to establish rules to this end. The commission then made its orders governing and limiting oil production. The complainants brought suit in the federal court to restrain the enforcement of these orders upon the ground that they were unauthorized, arbitrary, and capricious, and violated the federal right to the enjoyment and use of the properties. Exercising the jurisdiction conferred by federal statute, a federal judge had granted a temporary restraining order, pending the convening of the court which by that statute was charged with the duty to determine whether the requirement of the commission was valid or its enforcement should be enjoined. While this orderly process was going forward, it was superseded and in effect nullified by the Governor of the state who undertook by military order to effect the limitation which the commission by that process was for the time being forbidden to maintain. And, when the federal court, finding his action to have been unjustified by any existing exigency, has given the relief appropriate in the absence of other adequate remedy, appellants assert that the court was powerless thus to intervene, and that the Governor's order had the quality of a supreme and unchallengeable edict, overriding all conflicting rights of property and unreviewable through the judicial power of the federal government.\n If this extreme position could be deemed to be well taken, it is manifest that the fiat of a state Governor, and not the Constitution of the United States, would be the supreme law of the land; that the restrictions of the Federal Constitution upon the exercise of state power would \n\n[287 U.S. 378, 398]\n\u00a0\n be but impotent phrases, the futility of which the state may at any time disclose by the simple process of transferring powers of legislation to the Governor to be exercised by him, beyond control, upon his assertion of necessity. Under our system of government, such a conclusion is obviously untenable. There is no such avenue of escape from the paramount authority of the Federal Constitution. When there is a substantial showing that the exertion of state power has overridden private rights secured by that Constitution, the subject is necessarily one for judicial inquiry in an appropriate proceeding directed against the individuals charged with the transgression. To such a case the federal judicial power extends (article 3,  2), and, so extending, the court has all the authority appropriate to its exercise. Accordingly, it has been decided in a great variety of circumstances that, when questions of law and fact are so intermingled as to make it necessary, in order to pass upon the federal question, the court may, and should, analyze the facts. Even when the case comes to this Court from a state court, this duty must be performed as a necessary incident to a decision upon the claim of denial of federal right. Kansas City Southern Ry. Co. v. C. H. Albers Commission Co., \n223 \nU.S. 573, 591\n, 32 S.Ct. 316; Creswill v. Grand Lodge Knights of Pythias, \n225 \nU.S. 246, 261\n, 32 S.Ct. 822; Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. North Dakota, \n236 \nU.S. 585, 593\n, 35 S.Ct. 429, L.R.A. 1917F, 1148, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 1; Union Pacific R. Co. v. Public Service Commission, \n248 \nU.S. 67, 69\n, 39 S.Ct. 24; Merchants' National Bank v. Richmond, \n256 \nU.S. 635, 638\n, 41 S.Ct. 619; First National Bank v. City of Hartford, \n273 \nU.S. 548, 552\n, 553 S., 47 S.Ct. 462, 59 A.L.R. 1; Fiske v. State of Kansas, \n274 \nU.S. 380, 385\n, 386 S., 47 S.Ct. 655\n\n\n Fourth. The application of these principles does not fail to take into account the distinctive authority of the state. In the performance of its essential function, in promoting the security and well-being of its people, the state must, of necessity, enjoy a broad discretion. The range of that discretion accords with the subject of its exercise. Jacobson v. Massachusetts, \n197 \nU.S. 11, 31\n, 25 S.Ct. 358, 3 Ann.Cas. 765; \n\n[287 U.S. 378, 399]\n\u00a0\n Standard Oil Company v. City of Marysville, \n279 \nU.S. 582, 584\n, 49 S.Ct. 430; Ohio Oil Company v. Conway, \n281 \nU.S. 146, 159\n, 50 S.Ct. 310. As the state has no more important interest than the maintenance of law and order, the power it confers upon its Governor as chief executive and Commander in chief of its military forces to suppress insurrection and to preserve the peace is of the highest consequence. The determinations that the Governor makes within the range of that authority have all the weight which can be attributed to state action, and they must be viewed in the light of the object to which they may properly be addressed and with full recognition of its importance. It is with appreciation of the gravity of such an issue that the governing principles have been declared.\n By virtue of his duty to 'cause the laws to be faithfully executed,' the executive is appropriately vested with the discretion to determine whether an exigency requiring military aid for that purpose has arisen. His decision to that effect is conclusive. That construction, this Court has said, in speaking of the power constitutionally conferred by the Congress upon the President to call the militia into actual service, 'necessarily results from the nature of the power itself, and from the manifest object contemplated.' The power 'is to be exercised upon sudden emergencies, upon great occasions of state, and under circumstances which may be vital to the existence of the Union.' Martin v. Mott, 12 Wheat. 19, 29, 30. Similar effect, for corresponding reasons, is ascribed to the exercise by the Governor of a state of his discretion in calling out its military forces to suppress insurrection and disorder. Luther v. Borden, 7 How. 1, 45; Moyer v. Peabody, \n212 \nU.S. 78, 83\n, 29 S.Ct. 235, 236. The nature of the power also necessarily implies that there is a permitted range of honest judgment as to the measures to be taken in meeting force with force, in suppressing violence and restoring order, for, without such liberty to \n\n[287 U.S. 378, 400]\n\u00a0\n make immediate decisions, the power itself would be useless. Such measures, conceived in good faith, in the face of the emergency, and directly related to the quelling of the disorder or the prevention of its continuance, fall within the discretion of the executive in the exercise of his authority to maintain peace. Thus, in Moyer v. Peabody, supra, the Court sustained the authority of the Governor to hold in custody temporarily one whom he believed to be engaged in fomenting disorder, and right of recovery against the Governor for the imprisonment was denied. The Court said that, as the Governor 'may kill persons who resist,' he 'may use the milder measure of seizing the bodies of those whom he considers to stand in the way of restoring peace. Such arrests are not necessarily for punishment, but are by way of precaution to prevent the exercise of hostile power. So long as such arrests are made in good faith and in the honest belief that they are needed in order to head the insurrection off, the governor is the final judge and cannot be subjected to an action after he is out of office on the ground that he had not reasonable ground for his belief.' In that case it appeared that the action of the Governor had direct relation to the subduing of the insurrection by the temporary detention of one believed to be a participant, and the general language of the opinion must be taken in connection with the point actually decided. Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 399; Carroll v. Carroll, 16 How. 275, 287; Myers v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 52, 142\n, 47 S.Ct. 21.\n It does not follow from the fact that the executive has this range of discretion, deemed to be a necessary incident of his power to suppress disorder, that every sort of action the Governor may take, no matter how unjustified by the exigency or subversive of private right and the jurisdiction of the courts, otherwise available, is conclusively supported by mere executive fiat. The contrary \n\n[287 U.S. 378, 401]\n\u00a0\n is well established. What are the allowable limits of military discretion, and whether or not they have been overstepped in a particular case, are judicial questions. Thus, in the theater of actual war, there are occasions in which private property may be taken or destroyed to prevent it from falling into the hands of the enemy or may be impressed into the public service, and the officer may show the necessity in defending an action for trespass. 'But we are clearly of opinion,' said the Court speaking through Chief Justice Taney, 'that in all of these cases the danger must be immediate and impending; or the necessity urgent for the public service, such as will not admit of delay, and where the action of the civil authority would be too late in providing the means which the occasion calls for. ... Every case must depend on its own circumstances. It is the emergency that gives the right, and the emergency must be shown to exist before the taking can be justified.' Mitchell v. Harmony, 13 How. 115, 134. See, also, United States v. Russell, 13 Wall. 623, 628. There is no ground for the conclusion that military orders in the case of insurrection have any higher sanction or confer any greater immunity.\n We need not undertake to determine the intended significance of the expression 'martial law,' and all its possible connotations, as it was employed in the Governor's proclamation. Nor are we concerned with the permissible scope of determinations of military necessity in all their conceivable applications to actual or threatened disorder and breaches of the peace. Fundamentally, the question here is not of the power of the Governor to proclaim that a state of insurrection, or tumult, or riot, or breach of the peace exists, and that it is necessary to call military force to the aid of the civil power. Nor does the question relate to the quelling of disturbances and the overcoming of unlawful resistance to civil authority. The question before us is simply with respect to the Gover- \n\n[287 U.S. 378, 402]\n\u00a0\n nor's attempt to regulate by executive order the lawful use of complainants' properties in the production of oil. Instead of affording them protection in the lawful exercise of their rights as determined by the courts, he sought, by his executive orders, to make that exercise impossible. In the place of judicial procedure, available in the courts which were open and functioning, he set up his executive commands which brooked neither delay nor appeal. In particular, to the process of the federal court actually and properly engaged in examining and protecting an asserted federal right, the Governor interposed the obstruction of his will, subverting the federal authority. The assertion that such action can be taken as conclusive proof of its own necessity and must be accepted as in itself due process of law has no support in the decisions of this Court.\n Appellants' contentions find their appropriate answer in what was said by this Court in Re Milligan, 4 Wall. 2, 124, a statement as applicable to the military authority of the state in the case of insurrection as to the military authority of the nation in time of war: 'The proposition is this: That in a time of war the commander of an armed force (if in his opinion the exigencies of the country demand it, and of which he is to judge), has the power, within the lines of his military district, to suspend all civil rights and their remedies, and subject citizens as well as soldiers to the rule of his will; and in the exercise of his lawful authority cannot be restrained, except by his superior officer or the President of the United States. If this position is sound to the extent claimed, then when war exists, foreign or domestic, and the country is subdivided into military departments for mere convenience, the commander of one of them can, if he chooses, within the limits, on the plea of necessity, with the approval of the Executive, substitute military force for and the exclusion of the laws, and punish all persons, as he thinks right and \n\n[287 U.S. 378, 403]\n\u00a0\n proper, without fixed or certain rules. The statement of this proposition shows its importance; for, if true, republican government is a failure, and there is an end of liberty regulated by law. Martial law, established on such a basis, destroys every guaranty of the Constitution, and effectually renders the 'military independent of and superior to the civil power.' ... Civil liberty and this kind of martial law cannot endure together; the antagonism is irreconcilable and, in the conflict, one or the other must perish.'\n Fifth. The argument of appellants intimates, while it reserves the question, that it may be possible for the courts to call upon the Governor, after the alleged emergency has passed, to account for what he has done, but that they may not entertain a proceeding for injunction. The suggestion confuses the question of judicial power with that of judicial remedy. If the matter is one of judicial cognizance, it is because of an alleged invasion of a right, and the judicial power necessarily extends to the granting of the relief found to be appropriate according to the circumstances of the case. Whether or not the injured party is entitled to an injunction will depend upon equitable principles; upon the nature of the right invaded and the adequacy of the remedy at law. If the court finds that the limits of executive authority have been transgressed, and that in view of the character of the injury equitable relief by injunction is essential in order to afford the protection to which the injured party is entitled, it cannot be said that the judicial power is fettered because the injury is attributable to a military order.\n In the present case, the findings of fact made by the District Court are fully supported by the evidence. They leave no room for doubt that there was no military necessity which, from any point of view, could be taken to justify the action of the Governor in attempting to limit \n\n[287 U.S. 378, 404]\n\u00a0\n complainants' oil production, otherwise lawful. Complainants had a constitutional right to resort to the federal court to have the validity of the commission's orders judicially determined. There was no exigency which justified the Governor in attempting to enforce by executive or military order the restriction which the District Judge had restrained pending proper judicial inquiry. If it be assumed that the Governor was entitled to declare a state of insurrection and to bring military force to the aid of civil authority, the proper use of that power in this instance was to maintain the federal court in the exercise of its jurisdiction, and not to attempt to override it; to aid in making its process effective and not to nullify it, to remove, and not to create, obstructions to the exercise by the complainants of their rights as judicially declared. It is also plain that there was no adequate remedy at law for the redress of the injury, and, as the evidence showed that the Governor's orders were an invasion under color of state law of rights secured by the Federal Constitution, the District Court did not err in granting the injunction.\n The judgment of the District Court is affirmed. \n No. 11\n, appeal dismissed.\n No. 453, judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Revised Civil Statutes of Texas, 1925:\n'Art. 5778. The Governor shall have power in the case of insurrection, invasion, tumult, riot or breach of peace, or imminent danger thereof, to order into the active service of this State any part of the militia that he may deem proper.'\n\n'Art. 5830. When an invasion of, or an insurrection in, this State is made or threatened, or when the Governor may deem it necessary for the enforcement of the laws of this State, he shall call forth the active militia or any part thereof to repel, suppress, or enforce the same, and if the number available is insufficient he shall order out such part of the reserve militia as he may deem necessary.'\n\n'Art. 5834.

THE WHITE CITY(1932)\nNo. 217\nArgued: January 6, 1932Decided: March 14, 1932\n\n\n\n\n\n[285 U.S. 195, 196]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Neil P. Cullom and William F. Purdy, both of New York City, for petitioner. \n\n[285 U.S. 195, 197]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Chauncey I. Clark, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner, the assignee of the owner of a forty-five foot motorboat, the Drifter, filed a libel in admiralty in \n\n[285 U.S. 195, 198]\n\u00a0\n the Southern district of New York against respondent to recover for injury sustained by the former while being towed by the latter. The court held that the tug was a bailee of the tow, and that, it having been shown by the evidence that the former received the latter in good condition and delivered it damaged without being able to account for the injury, there was a presumption of negligence on the part of the tug, and that she must be held liable. 35 F.(2d) 1006. The Circuit Court of Appeals held the towage contract did not put the tow in bail to the tug, and that the mere fact of injury created no presumption of negligence, and reversed the decree. 48 F.(2d) 557.\n Petitioner maintains that the tug was bailee for hire, and that, by proving the tug received the tow in good order and delivered it in a damaged condition, he made a prima facie case of negligence which cast upon such bailee the burden of showing the circumstances surrounding the damage. And he insists that, even if the presumption did not so arise, there was ample proof of negligence on the part of the owners of respondent.\n The facts supported by the evidence, so far as they are material to these contentions, may be stated briefly as follows:\n October 13, 1925, Roos, an employee of the Consolidated Shipbuilding Corporation which had just completed the Drifter, made an agreement with Alexander Simpson for its towage from the builder's plant at Morris Heights in New York City of Port Newark alongside the steamer Suscalanco on which it was to be shipped. Later Simpson told Roos that the White City, an excursion boat owned by Herbert Simpson and one Rhodes, would do the towing. Roos told Simpson that the boat should be at the plant at 6 o'clock in the morning. Her owners brought her about 8 and were the only persons aboard at any time here involved. Employees of the builder as- \n\n[285 U.S. 195, 199]\n\u00a0\n sisted in attaching the Drifter, then in good condition, to the White City by a forty-foot rope. A cradle in which the former was to be stowed on the deck of the Suscalanco was attached by another rope about the same length to the stern of the Drifter. The builder put an employee, one Weston, on the Drifter, merely, as petitioner maintains, to tend lines when she was brought alongside the Suscalanco.\n Respondent took the tow down the East River; the cradle became detached at Hell Gate; reattaching it caused delay of fifteen or twenty minutes, but no damage occurred to the Drifter at that time. Respondent continued down the river, across the Upper Bay, through Kill van Kull and into Newark Bay, where, about 5 o'clock in the afternoon, she sighted the Suscalanco going out to sea. Then the tug went to Fisher's Dock in Bayonne, and, her owners having learned by telephone that the shipment could be made on a later steamer, remained there over night. The Drifter was tied alongside the pier with fenders to prevent injury. Weston, with the acquiescence of the owners of the tug, went home for the night, but did not return. Simpson testified that on the morning following he went aboard the Drifter to steer her while she and the cradle were being towed to destination; that before leaving the dock he inspected her, and that she was in the same condition as when received. When they arrived at Port Newark, about 8 in the morning, the Drifter's hull planking was broken or damaged amidship on the starboard side just above the water line causing a dish-shaped depression about three-quarters of an inch deep, roughly circular, and about twelve or fourteen inches in diameter. At the trial it was suggested by way of explanation that the hole might have been made by a piece of driftwood of which there was much in the bay. But there was no evidence to show, and the trial court found that neither Rhodes nor simp- \n\n[285 U.S. 195, 200]\n\u00a0\n son could explain when, how, or where the damage happened.\n Decisions of this Court show that under a towage contract the tug is not a bailee of the vessel in tow or its cargo. And it is established here and by numerous rulings of lower federal courts that evidence showing a tug's receipt of a tow in good order and delivery in damaged condition raises no presumption of negligence.\n The supplying of power by a vessel, usually one propelled by steam, to tow or draw another is towage. Many vessels, such as barges and canal boats, have no power of their own and are built with a view to receiving their propelling force from other sources. And vessels having motive power often employ auxiliary power to assist them in moving about harbors and docks. Benedict on Admiralty (5th Ed.)  100.\n The tug does not have exclusive control over the tow, but only so far as is necessary to enable the tug and those in charge of her to fulfill the engagement. They do not have control such as belongs to common carriers and other bailees. They have no authority over the master or hands of the towed vessel beyond such as is required to govern the movement of the flotilla. In all other respects and for all other purposes the vessel in tow, its cargo and crew, remain under the authority of its master; and, in emergency, the duty is upon him to determine what shall be done for the safety of his vessel and her cargo. In all such cases the right of decision belongs to the master of the tow and not to the master of the tug. A contract merely for towage does not require or contemplate such a delivery as is ordinarily deemed essential to bailment. The Webb, 14 Wall. 406, 414; Eastern Transportation Line v. Hope, \n95 U.S. 297\n, 299; The L. P. Dayton, \n120 \nU.S. 337, 351\n, 7 S. Ct. 568; The Burlington v. Ford, \n137 \nU.S. 386, 391\n, 11 S. Ct. 138; The J. P.

Law, 446, 449, 92 A. 59; Fletcher v. Ingram, 46 Wis. 191, 202, 50 N. W. 424. The owner of the Drifter did not surrender to respondent any right of control that does not pass in virtue of a contract merely for towage. The fact that the man put aboard by the builder did not remain to the end or that the owner did not choose to keep some one on the tow is immaterial.\n Petitioner's claim against respondent is not for breach of contract, but one in tort. His allegations and proof in respect of the agreement between the parties were made by way of inducement to his real grievance which was the damage to the Drifter claimed to have been caused by negligence of the respondent. It has long been settled that suit by the owner of a tow against her tug to recover for an injury to the tow caused by negligence on the part of the tug is a suit ex delicto and not ex contractu. The Quickstep, 9 Wall. 665, 670; The Syracuse, 12 Wall. 167, 171; The J. P. Donaldson, supra, \n167 \nU.S. 603\n, 17 S. Ct. 951; The John G. Stevens, \n170 \nU.S. 113, 125\n, 18 S.

In the case last cited Judge Lowell said (page 312 of 6 F.): 'These cases of tow against tug are, in form and fact, very like collision cases. The contract gives rise to duties very closely resembling those which one vessel owes to others which it may meet.' In The John G. Stevens, supra, this court cited The Arturo approvingly and said (page 126 of 170 U. S., 18 S. Ct. 544, 549): 'The essential likeness between the ordinary case of a collision between two ships, and the liability of a tug to her tow for damages caused to the latter by a collision with a \n\n[285 U.S. 195, 202]\n\u00a0\n third vessel, is exemplified by the familiar practice in admiralty ... which allows the owner of a tow, injured by a collision caused by the conduct of her tug and of another vessel, to sue both in one libel, and to recover against either or both, according to the proof at the hearing.' And the rule that the lien for damages occasioned by negligent towage takes precedence of liens for supplies previously furnished the offending vessel rests upon the ground that the claim, like those in case of collision, is one in tort arising out of duty imposed by law and independently of any contract or consideration for the towage. The John G. Stevens, supra, \n170 \nU.S. 126\n, 18 S. Ct. 544; The Arturo, supra.\n While respondent was not an insurer or liable as a common carrier, it owed to the owner of the Drifter the duty to exercise such reasonable care and maritime skill as prudent navigators employ for the performance of similar service. The burden was upon petitioner to show that the loss for which he sought recovery was caused by a breach of that duty. The mere fact that the Drifter was in good order when received by respondent and in damaged condition when delivered does not raise any presumption of fault. As said by this court in The L. P. Dayton, supra, (page 351 of 120 U. S., 7 S. Ct. 568, 574): 'To hold otherwise would require that in every case, as between the tow and its tug, the latter should be required affirmatively to establish its defense against the presumption of its negligence. ...' (page 352 of 120 U. S., 7 S. Ct. 568, 575.) 'Neither is it material that the facts of the case, and the causes of the collision, are peculiarly within the knowledge of the respondents. It is alleged in the present case, as one of the inconveniences of the libelant's situation, that it would be compelled, in order to establish the allegations of the libel, to resort to the testimony of those navigating the respective tugs, and thus call witnesses interested to exonerate the vessel to which they were attached. We are not aware, however, of any ground on which such an inconvenience can affect the rule of law which governs \n\n[285 U.S. 195, 203]\n\u00a0\n the rights of the parties.' See The Webb, supra; Eastern Transportation Line v. Hope, supra. The rule has been applied in numerous cases in the lower federal courts. \n1\n There is nothing about the injury itself to warrant any inference that it resulted from fault or negligence on the part of respondent.\n There is no support for petitioner's contention that, without regard to the asserted presumption, the evidence shows that the injury to the Drifter was caused by negligence of respondent. The facts to which he refers are these: The tug arrived at the plant two hours late; respondent remained over night at Bayonne without authority and left the Drifter without a watchman; on the following morning, without effort to obtain the services of Weston or another, the tug proceeded to Port Newark. He calls attention to the absence of evidence further to show how the Drifter was moored at Bayonne and whether she was lighted during the night. On that basis he argues that it is possible that the injury occurred during the night; that the Drifter 'might have been rammed by some other boat or if the lines were not slackened and the tide receded she might have been hanging on the side of the dock as the result whereof, a pile might have stove a hole in her side.' The burden of proof as to respondent's negligence remained upon petitioner throughout the trial. His contentions clearly show that the evidence leaves the time, place, and cause of the injury \n\n[285 U.S. 195, 204]\n\u00a0\n in the realm of conjecture. The evidence is consistent with an hypothesis that the tug was not negligent and with one that it was, and therefore has no tendency to establish either. Gunning v. Cooley, \n281 \nU.S. 90, 94\n, 50 S. Ct. 231, and cases cited.\n We find that respondent caused unnecessary parts of the record to be printed ammounting in all to 186 pages. This is admitted in a statement filed by counsel for respondent. The cost of such printing will be charged to respondent.

See State Budget Commission v. Lebus, 244 Ky. 700, 703, 714, 51 S.W.(2d) 965, as to warrants outstanding. Defendants' answers denied the above-mentioned allegations, but it does not appear that there has been a hearing upon evidence of the issue tendered, and no findings of fact upon the subject have been made by the courts below.\n The decrees are reversed and the causes remanded to the District Courts, of three judges, for final hearing upon the merits, without prejudice to a determination upon evidence with respect to the questions of the status of outstanding warrants upon the general fund in the state treasury, and whether warrants of the sort contemplated by section 10 of the act in question are accorded preference in payment over other warrants and the basis, if any, for the assurance that such preference will be continued so that in the event of actions by the plaintiffs at law under section 10 they would be afforded a certain reasonably prompt and efficacious remedy.

Carlstrom, both of Springfield, Ill., for appellant.\n Mr. Josiah Whitnel, of East St. Louis, Ill., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case is here on appeal, Jud. Code  238, 266 (28 USCA  345, 380), from a final decree of a District Court of three judges for the Southern District of Illinois, enjoining the assessment and collection from appellee of the minimum annual corporation franchise tax of $1,000, under sections 105, 107, 112, 114, of the Illinois Corporation Act (Smith- Hurd Rev. St. 1931, c. 32), as an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce, and as violating the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. After argument here on the merits, the cause was again argued \n\n[284 U.S. 530, 532]\n\u00a0\n by direction of the Court, argument being limited to the question of the jurisdiction of the District Court, both with respect to the amount involved in the suit and its jurisdiction as a court of equity.\n The bill sets up as ground for equitable relief the threat of revocation of appellee's certificate of authority to do business within the state for failure to pay the tax, pursuant to sections 92 and 94 of the act, and the consequent irreparable injury to its business. The equity jurisdiction of the District Court was challenged by appellant's motion below to dismiss the bill of complaint, and by the assignments of error here, and the question presented, like that in Matthews v. Rodgers, \n284 \nU.S. 521\n, 52 S. Ct. 217, decided this day, is whether, under state laws, the appellee is afforded such an adequate remedy, by payment of the tax and the maintenance of a suit at law to recover it, as to preclude resort to the preventive jurisdiction of equity.\n By the laws of Illinois, as appellant argues, a tax paid under duress and protest that it is illegally exacted may be recovered at law in an action of assumpsit, brought either against the taxing body, the state excepted, see Harvey & Body v. Olney, 42 Ill. 336; or against the collecting officer, see Yates v. Royal Insurance Co., 200 Ill. 202, 65 N. E. 726; School of Domestic Arts and Science v. Harding, 331 Ill. 330, 163 N. E. 15. See, also, German Alliance Insurance Co. v. Van Cleave, 191 Ill. 410, 413-414, 61 N. E. 94, and Hawkins v. Lake County, 303 Ill. 624, 629, 136 N. E. 487, in each of which the court entertained bills by numerous taxpayers to enjoin the collection of taxes or to compel their refund, on the express ground that to do so would avoid a multiplicity of suits at law.\n Recovery of the tax may not be had, even though illegally exacted, unless its payment is procured by duress. See Richardson Lubricating Co. v. Kinney, 337 Ill. 122, 168 N. E. 886. But where the payment is of a corporate franchise tax like the present, made to avoid forfeiture \n\n[284 U.S. 530, 533]\n\u00a0\n of the franchise, which would result from nonpayment, there is such duress as entitles the taxpayer to recover. O'Gara Coal Co. v. Emmerson, 326 Ill. 18, 21, 156 N. E. 814; Western Cartridge Co. v. Emmerson, 335 Ill. 150, 166 N. E. 501. See Chicago & Eastern Illinois Ry. Co. v. Miller, 309 Ill. 257, 140 N. E. 823.\n By the Illinois statute, applicable to the present tax, Smith-Hurd's 1931 Revised Illinois Statutes, c. 127,  172,  2(a), it is provided that:\n'It shall be the duty of every officer, board, commission, commissioner, department, institute, arm or agency brought within the provisions of this Act by Section 1 hereof to hold for thirty days all moneys received for or on behalf of the State under protest and on the expiration of such period to deposit the same with the State Treasurer unless the party making such payment shall within such period file a bill in chancery and secure a temporary injunction restraining the making of such deposit, in which case such payment shall be held until the final order or decree of the court.'\n\n This statute, for reasons stated at length in Matthews v. Rodgers, supra, can neither enlarge nor diminish the equity jurisdiction of the federal courts. It does not purport to confer any new remedy for the recovery of the tax. Nor does it impair the existing legal remedy, but supplements it by providing a method under the local procedure for staying payment over of the tax money, so that it may be available for the satisfaction of any judgment obtained against the collector. See Interstate Iron & Steel Co. v. Stratton, 340 Ill. 422, 172 N. E. 705; O'Gara Coal Co. v. Emmerson, supra; Hump Hairpin Mfg. Co. v. Emmerson, 293 Ill. 387, 127 N. E. 746; Id., \n258 \nU.S. 290\n, 42 S. Ct. 305.\n These cases recognize the continued existence in Illinois of the right to recover the tax. The fact that in them the suits brought were denominated 'equitable,' \n\n[284 U.S. 530, 534]\n\u00a0\n although the only relief of an equitable nature, sought or allowed, was the injunction against payment over of the tax, which was but incidental to the recovery of the money, cannot alter the character of the right as one enforceable at law. In determining what is a legal remedy and its adequacy to defeat their equity jurisdiction, the federal courts are guided by the historic distinction between law and equity in those courts, not by the name given to remedies or to distinctions made between them by the state practice. Scott v. Neely, \n140 U.S. 106\n, 110-111, 11 S. Ct. 712; Hollins v. Brierfield Coal & Iron Co., \n150 \nU.S. 371, 379\n, 14 S. Ct. 127. By this test the remedy by suit to recover a tax which has been paid is essentially a legal remedy, and it is not any the less so nor any the less adequate because the state practice has annexed to it an equitable remedy.\n There being a legal remedy for the recovery of the tax, no case is made for invoking the jurisdiction of equity to enjoin collection of it, in the absence of allegations setting up special circumstances which would render the legal remedy inadequate.

The ruling of the Commissioner in this case, that the amounts so distributed from royalties were taxable income, was upheld by the Board of Tax Appeals, 18 B.T.A. 901, and by the Court of \n\n[287 U.S. 314, 315]\n\u00a0\n Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, 55 F.(2d) 626, which remanded the case to the Board for further proceedings, to enable the petitioner to offer additional testimony having a bearing on the correct computation of the deficiency, in accordance with the opinion of the court. The parties stipulate that the decision of this case shall be controlled by that of Bankers' Pocahontas Coal Co. v. Burnet, Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and the judgment below is accordingly.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","149":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSUN OIL CO. v. DALZELL TOWING CO.(1932)\nNo. 38\nArgued: November 16, 1932Decided: December 5, 1932\n\n\n\n\n[287 U.S. 291, 292]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Frank A. Bull and Russell T. Mount, both of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. Chauncey I. Clark, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit in admiralty brought by petitioner in the Southern district of New York against respondent and three steam tugs, Dalzellite, W. F. Dalzell, and Fred B. Dalzell, Jr., to recover damages alleged to have been caused by their negligence to petitioner's tank steamer Sabine Sun. The court dismissed the libel. (D.C.) 48 F.(2d) 598. Petitioner appealed from so much of the decree as dismissed the libel as to the towing company. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 55 F.(2d) 63.\n Respondent operates steam tugboats in and about New York harbor. May 14, 1925, in anticipation of the arrival of the Sabine Sun, Turnbull, petitioner's assistant marine superintendent, arranged by telephone to have respondent send tugs to take her through waters leading to Newark Bay and to a dock at Bergen Point, N.J. There was no writing or formal contract concerning the service to be rendered. The agreement pieced out from the oral order and acceptance and prior like transactions between the parties included as one of its terms the following clause: 'When the captain of any \n\n[287 U.S. 291, 293]\n\u00a0\n tug engaged in the services of towing a vessel which is making use of her own propelling power goes on board said vessel, it is understood and agreed that said tugboat captain becomes the servant of the owners in respect to the giving of orders to any of the tugs engaged in the towage service and in respect to the handling of such vessel, and neither the tugs nor their owners or agents shall be liable for any damage resulting therefrom.'\n On the next day the tanker anchored off Stapleton, Staten Island. The W. F. Dalzell came alongside, and Bennett, her captain, went on board and acted as pilot. Using her own power and accompanied by the tug she got under way. The Dalzellite joined them off St. George and thence the three vessels went on through the Kill van Kull. Off Port Richmond the Fred B. Dalzell, Jr. became part of the flotilla. Fort, her captain, then went upon the tanker and acted as pilot, relieving Bennett. The tanker's captain, his third officer, a quartermaster and Turnbull were also there. She continued on her way using her own propelling power and assisted by the tugs. When rounding Bergen Point she went aground outside the channel, and it was then, as alleged in the libel, that she sustained the damages for which petitioner seeks to recover. She was backed off the obstruction, turned into the channel and without other mishap taken to the dock.\n In view of petitioner's failure to appeal from the dismissal as to the tugs, we must assume that as to them petitioner failed to make out its case and that the stranding of the tanker was not in whole or in part due to any fault of theirs. It was not shown that respondent was to have or at any time did have control of the tanker or that it agreed or undertook to do more than to furnish tugs to assist her while using her own propelling power. Her master, officers, and crew were at their stations, and her propelling power and steering apparatus were used to bring her to destination. And if the pilotage clause is \n\n[287 U.S. 291, 294]\n\u00a0\n valid, the tug captains while on board the tanker and respectively acting as her pilot were for that turn the servants of petitioner and the respondent may not be held responsible for any act or omission of theirs during the period of that service.\n The validity of its applicable provision cannot reasonably be doubted. So far as concerns the service to be rendered under the agreement, respondent was not a common carrier or bailee or bound to serve or liable as such. Towage does not involve bailment, and the services covered by the contract were less than towage. Stevens v. The White City, \n285 \nU.S. 195, 200\n, 52 S.Ct. 347. There is no foundation in this case for the application of the doctrine that common carriers and others under like duty to serve the public according to their capacity and the terms of their undertaking cannot by any form of agreement secure exemption from liability for loss or damage caused by their own negligence. N.Y.C. Railroad Company v. Lockwood, 17 Wall. 357; Liverpool & G. W. Steam Co. v. Phenix Ins. Co., \n129 \nU.S. 397, 440\n, 9 S.Ct. 469. Respondent had no exclusive privilege or monopoly in respect of the services that petitioner desired to have performed for its tanker. And petitioner was under no compulsion to accept the terms of respondent's pilotage clause. There is nothing to suggest that the parties were not on equal footing or that they did not deal at arm's length. 'There is no rule of public policy which denies effect to their expressed intention, but, on the contrary, as the matter lies within the range of permissible agreement, the highest public policy is found in the enforcement of the contract which was actually made.' Santa Fe, P. & P. Railway Co. v. Grant Brothers, \n228 \nU.S. 177, 188\n, 33 S.Ct. 474, 478.\n Respondent's responsibility is not to be extended beyond the service that it undertook to perform. It did not furnish pilotage. The provision that its tug captains while upon the assisted ship would be the servants of her \n\n[287 U.S. 291, 295]\n\u00a0\n owner is an application of the well-established rule that when one puts his employee at the disposal and under the direction of another for the performance of service for the latter. such employee while so engaged acts directly for and is to be deemed the employee of the latter and not of the former. Denton v. Yazoo & M.V.R. Co., \n284 \nU.S. 305, 308\n, 52 S.Ct. 141. It would be unconscionable for petitioner upon occurrence of a mishap to repudiate the agreement upon which it obtained the service.\n The decree under consideration is not in conflict with the decisions of this court cited by petitioner, The Steamer Syracuse, 12 Wall. 167, and Compania de Navegacion v. Ins. Co., \n277 \nU.S. 66\n, 48 S.Ct. 459. Neither involved an agreement similar to the provisions of the pilotage clause on which this case turns.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","150":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTAYLOR v. U.S.(1932)\nNo. 693\nArgued: Decided: May 2, 1932\n\n\n\n Mr. R. Palmer Ingram, of Baltimore, Md., for petitioner.[ Taylor v. U.S. \n286 U.S. 1\n (1932) ]\n\n\n[286 U.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Thomas D.Thacher, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n An indictment, United States District Court for Maryland, charged petitioner Taylor with the unlawful possession of intoxicating liquor- whisky, 122 cases.\n By timely petition to the court he asserted that in the nighttime prohibition agents acting without warrant had entered and searched the garage adjacent to his residence and had found and seized the liquor; that with this as evidence the indictment had been obtained; he anticipated that like use would be made of it at the trial. The prayer for its exclusion was denied.\n By stipulation the cause went for trial by the court without a jury. The District Attorney called three of the agents who participated in the search. The defendant moved to exclude all their testimony on the ground \n\n[286 U.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n that the search and seizure, made without warrant and in violation of his constitutional rights, were unreasonable; also that his private dwelling had been entered contrary to the inhibition of the Willis-Campbell Act ( section 6 (18 USCA  53)). The trial court overruled this motion, adjudged defendant guilty, and imposed fine and imprisonment. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment, 55 F.(2d) 58. The cause comes up by certiorari, \n285 \nU.S. 534\n, 52 S. Ct. 410, 76 L. Ed. -.\n There is a suggestion, first made here, that the bill of exceptions printed in the record was signed by the judge out of time and therefore cannot be considered.\n The trial took place during February, 1931. By proper orders permission to file the bill of exceptions was extended to May 17, 1931- Sunday. It was actually signed on May 18th. Immediately following the signature of the judge the following appears-'5\/18\/31. This Bill of Exceptions is agreed upon. Simon E. Sobeloff, U. S. Attorney. James M. Hoffa, Assistant U. S. Attorney.'\n The facts surrounding the preparation and signing have been presented by affidavit and are not in dispute. Having prepared the bill, petitioner's counsel duly lodged it with the United States attorney. For convenience of the latter's office there were extensions of time to May 17th. On May 16th, the Assistant District Attorney having just completed examination of the bill, went with petitioner's counsel to the judge's chambers to secure his signature. Failing to find him, they agreed to ask his signature on Monday, May 18th. On that day, with the express approval of all parties, and in pursuance of the earlier agreement, the judge signed the bill. The considerable delay in settling the bill followed the request of the Assistant District Attorney in charge and was permitted for his convenience.\n In these exceptional circumstances-the facts being undisputed-we think the petitioner is entitled to the bene- \n\n[286 U.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n fit of the bill. And negativing and intent to relax the general rule, we accept it as adequate and properly incorporated in the record. See Waldron v. Waldron, \n156 \nU.S. 361, 378\n, 15 S. Ct. 383.\n Without undertaking to defend the challenged search and seizure, the Solicitor General submits the cause for our decision. As the conviction was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, he prefers not to enter a confession of error. He does, however, say that in his opinion, without regard to whether the garage constituted part of the private dwelling, upon the facts shown, the entry by the agents was wrongful and the search and seizure unreasonable. With this view we agree. The judgment below must be reversed.\n During the night, November 19, 1930, a squad (six or more) of prohibition agents while returning to Baltimore city discussed premises 5100 Curtis avenue, of which there had been complaints 'over a period of about a year.' Having decided to investigate they went at once to the garage at that address, arriving there about 2:30 a. m. The garage-a small metal building-is on the corner of a city lot and adjacent to the dwelling in which petitioner Taylor resided. The two houses are parts of the same premises.\n As the agents approached the garage, they got the odor of whisky coming from within. Aided by a searchlight, they looked through a small opening and saw many cardboard cases which they thought probably contained jars of liquor. Thereupon they broke the fastening upon a door, entered, and found 122 cases of whisky. No one was within the place, and there was no reason to think otherwise. While the search progressed, Taylor came from his house and was put under arrest. The search and seizure were undertaken with the hope of securing evidence upon which to indict and convict him. \n\n[286 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n Although over a considerable period numerous complaints concerning the use of these premises had been received, the agents had made no effort to obtain a warrant for making a search. They had abundant opportunity so to do and to proceed in an orderly way even after the odor had emphasized their suspicions; there was no probability of material change in the situation during the time necessary to secure such warrant. Moreover, a short period of watching would have prevented any such possibility.\n We think, in any view, the action of the agents was inexcusable and the seizure unreasonable. The evidence was obtained unlawfully and should have been suppressed. See Carroll v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 132\n, 45 S. Ct. 280, 39 A. L. R. 790; United States v. Lefkowitz and Paris, \n285 \nU.S. 452\n, 52 S. Ct. 420, 76 L. Ed. -, decided April 11, 1932, and cases there cited.\n Prohibition officers may rely on a distinctive odor as a physical fact indicative of possible crime; but its presence alone does not strip the owner of a building of constitutional guaranties (Const. Amend. 4) against unreasonable search. This record does not make it necessary for us to discuss the rule in respect of searches in connection with an arrest. No offender was in the garage; the action of the agents had no immediate connection with an arrest. The purpose was to secure evidence to support some future arrest.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","151":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTEXAS & P. RY. CO. U.S.(1932)\nNo. 634\nArgued: April 14, 1932Decided: May 16, 1932\n\n\n\n Messrs. John W. Davis and Newton K. Fox, both of New York City, for petitioner. \n\n[286 U.S. 285, 286]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Charles B.Rugg, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n\n\n[286 U.S. 285, 287]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n During federal control of railways, that of petitioner was operated by the Director General under the Act of March 21, 1918.1 Pursuant to the Transportation Act, 1920,2 the government relinquished the property March 1, 1920; petitioner accepted the provisions of section 2093 of the act, and consequently received for the six-month \n\n[286 U.S. 285, 288]\n\u00a0\n period commencing March 1, 1920, an allowance awarded by the Interstate Commerce Commission to make good the guaranty embodied in that section. The company omitted this sum from taxable income returned for the year 1920. After audit the Commissioner of Internal Revenue added the amount to the petitioner's income and assessed a resulting additional tax, which was paid under protest. Upon rejection of a claim for refund, suit was brought in the Court of Claims to recover the portion of the tax attributable to the inclusion of the guaranty payment, petitioner asserting that the amount received was a subsidy or gift, and therefore not income within the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution or section 213 of the Revenue Act of 1918.4 Recovery was denied. This court granted certiorari. \n284 \nU.S. 616\n, 52 S. Ct. 266, 76 L. Ed. -.\n By the terms of section 209 of the Transportation Act, railroad companies which, like petitioner, had made contracts with the Director General for annual compensation during federal control, were guaranteed an operating income for the ensuing six months of not less than one-half the amount of such compensation. A minimum operating revenue was also assured to carriers not having such contracts, which had been under federal control of adversely affected thereby. Payment was conditioned on the carrier's acceptance of the provisions of the section, one of which was the agreement that, if operating revenue for the period should exceed the guaranteed amount, the excess should be paid into the Treasury. Petitioner signified its acceptance.\n The statute in terms guarantees a 'minimum operating income' for six months after relinquishment of federal control. The situation in which the railroads of the country were as a result of war-time government opera- \n\n[286 U.S. 285, 289]\n\u00a0\n tion is well described in United Stated v. Guaranty Trust Co., \n280 \nU.S. 478, 484\n, 50 S. Ct. 212. During that period their expenses had risen and there had been no commensurate increase in rates. While the government had either paid, or was obligated to pay, just compensation for their requisition, the amount of it was known to be insufficient for rehabilitation of the roads as privately owned and operated organizations. Until rates could be adjusted to meet increased expenses, loans be negotiated, and operating forces realigned and reintegrated, the credit of the carriers must by some means be re-established. Thus the government had a real obligation, not readily susceptible of accurate measurement, to assist in the restoration of normal conditions. The purpose of the guaranty provision was to stabilize the credit position of the roads by assuring them a minimum operating income. They were bound to operate their properties in order to avail themselves of the government's profer. Under the terms of the statute, no sum could be received save as a result of operation. If the fruits of the employment of a road's capital and labor should fall below a fixed minimum, then the government agreed to make up the deficiency, and, if the income were to exceed that minimum, the carrier bound itself to pay the dxcess into the federal treasury. In the latter event, the carrier unquestionably would have been obligated to pay income tax measured by actual earnings; in the former, it ought not to be in a better position than if it has earned the specified minimum. Clearly, then, the amount paid to bring the yield from operation up to the required minimum was as much income from operation as were the railroad's receipts from fares and charges.\n The sums received under the act were not subsidies or gifts-that is, contributions to the capital of the railroads-and this fact distinguishes cases such as Edwards v. Cuba Railroad Co., \n268 \nU.S. 628\n, 45 S. Ct. 614, where the payments \n\n[286 U.S. 285, 290]\n\u00a0\n were conditioned upon construction work performed. Here they were to be measured by a deficiency in operating income, and might be used for the payment of dividends, of operating expenses, of capital charges, or for any other purpose within the corporate authority, just as any other operating revenue might be applied. The government's payments were not in their nature bounties, but an addition to a depleted operating revenue consequent upon a federal activity.\n In a proper sense these payments constituted income to the carrier not exempt from taxation under the Sixteenth Amendment or the Revenue Act of 1918. The Court of Claims was right in denying the claim, and the judgment must be\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Chapter 25, 40 Stat. 451. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Act of February 28, 1920, c. 91, 41 Stat. 456. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] 41 Stat. 464 (U.

D. Roger Englar and Chauncey I. Clark, both of New York City, for Spencer Kellogg & Sons, Inc.\n\n\n[285 U.S. 502, 505]\n\u00a0\n Miss Elizabeth Robinson and Mr. Lucien V.

J ., on the west shore of the Hudson river, opposite Ninety-Sixth street, New York. The home office of the corporation is in Buffalo, where the chief executive officers reside. The Edgewater plant employs many workmen who live in New York. In order to ferry these men to and from the factory the company owned and operated the Linseed King, a gasoline launch of a length of forty-five feet and a beam of ten feet, having a small wheel house forward, and behind that an inclosed cabin which occupied practically the entire deck space. The company's practice was to send the boat from Edgewater, early in the morning, to the foot of Ninety-Sixth street, where the men went on board and were transported to the factory in time for their work. Although the safe load was estimated at not over sixty passengers, she had eighty-six life preservers aboard and had frequently carried more than eighty persons. This number seriously crowded her cabin, the total superficial area of which was two hundred thirty- three square feet, two lengthwise seats occupying about one-third of the space. \n\n[285 U.S. 502, 507]\n\u00a0\n On the morning in question the boat left the New Jersey pier before daybreak, in charge of one man. As the New York shore was approached drift ice was encountered which had come down the river during the night and been driven to the easterly side by a west wind. The launch passed safely through the ice and reached the foot of Ninety-Sixty street. There another of the company's employees, who was detailed to give general assistance and may be considered a deckhand, came on board. The launch was immediately filled from a crowd of waiting men. It is difficult to ascertain exactly how many boarded her; but the courts below have found that there were at least seventy-eight. On the return trip the thicker part of the ice towards the New York shore was successfully traversed, and when the master considered himself clear of ice he proceeded at full speed- about seven miles an hour. Shortly thereafter a cake or floe of ice stove a hole in the boat's port bow and caused her to fill and sink in about two minutes. The result was a panic in the cabin, a rush for the exits, which were small, and one of which opened inward, thus being difficult of operation on account of the crowded condition. Some of the passengers were thrown into the river, reached floating cakes of ice, and were rescued. Thirty-five bodies were found in the cabin, but the number lost was never definitely determined.\n Actions were brought in the New York courts against Kellogg & Sons by certain of the survivors and by the administrators of some of those who had been drowed. One libel was filed in the District Court for Southern New York. Claims were made by others and suits threatened. The company filed a petition for limitation and sought an injunction against all proceedings upon any claim, in cluding those for workmen's compensation under the New Jersey act, except that no injunction was asked against the mere filing of claims with the New Jersey State Work- \n\n[285 U.S. 502, 508]\n\u00a0\n men's Compensation Bureau. The launch was surrendered, its value ascertained as $1,500, proper stipulation entered, and an order of reference made to a commissioner to receive claims. An injunction pendente lite was issued as prayed embracing not only the claimants, but the State Compensation Bureau, service being made upon the secretary of that body. Claims were filed, and the claimants in their answers to the petition denied the company's right to limitation.\n Upon the issues so made the cause came on for hearing before the District Court, and at the conclusion of the evidence that court denied the owner's right to limit and referred all of the claims to a commissioner for report as to their validity and the amounts to be awarded. The latter recommended awards to sundry claimants. On exceptions the District Court confirmed some and altered others.\n Those who were killed and injured in the disaster were of three classes: (1) Regular employees of Kellogg & Sons in the Edgewater plant. ( 2) Men who had applied on December 18 for work in discharging the cargo of a ship expected on that day. She did not then arrive, and they were given employment check stubs and told to return on the following day, which they did; but as she had not then docked they were advised to report again on the morning of the accident. The vessel had berthed the evening before, and if these men had succeeded in reaching the pier at Edgewater they would have been preferred in the allotment of work in discharging her cargo. (3) Men seeking employment in answer to an advertisement for laborers inserted in the New York newspapers, who had, however, not been interviewed by the company officials, and who would therefore have had to apply and be accepted upon arrival at the Edgewater pier. \n\n[285 U.S. 502, 509]\n\u00a0\n The owner insisted that as the men in groups (1) and (2) were employees within the intent of the workmen's compensation law of New Jersey their remedy was exclusively under that act, and no damages could be granted to any of them or to the personal representatives of deceased members of these classes in this proceeding. No such objection was urged against awards to men in the third class. The commissioner overruled the owner's contention, held the workmen's compensation act was inapplicable, and all of the claimants should receive awards in the admiralty court. Upon exceptions the District Court reversed the commissioner's conclusions and held that those falling within the first class must be dismissed from the case, as any redress to which they were entitled was under the New Jersey act, but that the men in the second had never been actually employed, and were consequently outside the compensation law, and the commissioner's recommendations as to awards to them should be confirmed. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the action of the District Court.\n The petition for certiorari (No. 430) by the owner alleged error in refusing to limit liability and in not remitting the claimants in the second group to their remedy under the workmen's compensation act. Claimants of the first group also filed a petition (No. 444) asserting the court below improperly disposed of their claims, and that they were entitled to awards in the pending cause. The cases were heard together.\n The first question for decision is whether Kellogg & Sons, as owner, was entitled to a decree limiting its liability. The master's negligence is not denied; indeed the owner proved that definite and peremptory instructions had been given him never to run when there was ice in the river. His disregard of these was the proximate cause of the disaster.\n\n\n[285 U.S. 502, 510]\n\u00a0\n The right to limit liability turns upon whether such negligence was with the owner's privity or knowledge. \n2\n Both courts below, after painstaking examination of the evidence, found there was such privity or knowledge and accordingly ruled that the claim for limitation must be denied. We accept this concurrend finding. There was sufficient evidence to support it. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n The Linseed King was admittedly unfit to run through ice. This fact was known to the owner's executive officers, who had instructed one Stover, the works manager and representative of the company in charge of the Edgewater plant, that the boat should never be run through ice, and that as soon as ice showed itself in the river she was to be laid up for the winter. He was also directed that whenever there was a likelihood of the presence of ice all trips were to be made only in broad daylight, and even these were to be discontinued when ice definitely appeared. The decision as to when the ferry should be withdrawn for the winter rested with him.\n In view of the weather conditions and the observation of ice in the river some days prior to the accident by several witnesses, amongst them one of Stover's own subordinates, he should not have rested upon the mere instruction to the master not to run through ice. Before allowing the ferriage operation he was under obligation to assure himself by inquiries or by personal inspection that the Linseed King should not incur the hazard of colliding, as she did, with ice floes in the river.\n\n\n[285 U.S. 502, 511]\n\u00a0\n We agree with the courts below that Stover's position as works manager of the Edgewater plant and the scope of his authority render his privity or knowledge that of the company. Parsons v. Empire Trans. Co. (C. C. A.) 111 F. 202; Oregon R. L. Co. v. Portland & A. S. S. Co. (D. C.) 162 F. 912; Sanbern v. Wright & Cobb Co. (D. C.) 171 F. 449, affirmed (C. C. A.) 179 F. 1021; Boston Towboat Co. v. Darrow-Mann Co. (C. C. A.) 276 F. 778. Compare Craig v. Continental Ins. Co., \n141 \nU.S. 638, 647\n, 12 S. Ct. 97. The owner was therefore chargeable with negligence in not taking measures for the safety of the passengers which the weather conditions required, Texas & Gulf S. S. Co. v. Parker (C. C. A.) 263 F. 864; The Virginia (D. C.) 264 F. 986, affirmed (C. C. A.) 278 F. 877.\n It is said that the master, admittedly competent had definite and positive instructions not to run through ice; that when he encountered ice on his trip from the New Jersey shore, it became his duty at once to abandon the trip and return to the Edgewater plant. The argument is that as the boat was seaworthy when there was no ice and instructions had been given to a competent master not to run her through ice, the owner did its full duty and cannot be held responsible as having privity or knowledge of a violation by the master of these explicit instructions. Cases such as La Bourgogne., \n210 \nU.S. 95\n, 28 S. Ct. 664, which involved the master's failure to obey rules and instructions when on the high seas and disaster attributable to such fault, are cited. But there is a vast difference between the cases relied on and the instant one. The launch was used for ferriage over a distance of about a mile and a third. She was known to be unseaworthy and unfit if there was ice in the river. There is no analogy between such a situation and that presented in the cited cases where the emergency must be met by the master alone. In these there is no opportunity of consultation or cooperation or of bringing the proposed action of the master to the owner's knowledge. The latter must rely upon the master's obeying \n\n[285 U.S. 502, 512]\n\u00a0\n rules and using reasonable judgment. The conditions on the morning in question could have been ascertained by Stover, if he had used reasonable diligence, and we think the evidence is adequate to support the finding that the negligence which caused the disaster was with his, and therefore with the owner's, privity or knowledge.\n What was the duty of the admiralty court after it found the circumstances did not permit limitation of liability? Having found that certain claimants were within the scope of the workmen's compensation act the District Court refused them any awards and remitted them to the Compensation Bureau. This was approved by the Circuit Court of Appeals. But we think that the admiralty court, having taken jurisdiction and brought all claimants into concourse, should have given complete relief. Hartford Accident & Indemnity Co. v. Southern Pacific Co., \n273 \nU.S. 207\n, 47 S. Ct. 357. The petitioners in No. 444 maintain, first, that the state statute providing workmen's compensation is inapplicable to the maritime torts here in question and that they were entitled to relief under the maritime law or the death statutes of New York adopted as part of that system. Secondly, they say that the owner having invoked the jurisdiction of admiralty, enjoined prosecution of claims before the Workmen's Compensation Bureau, compelled claimants to appear in the admiralty court to try the question of limitation, and delayed for years any prosecution before the bureau, has chosen its forum, forced them to litigate therein, and the jurisdiction so lawfully attaching cannot be surrendered in favor of that under the workmen's compensation law of the state. As we think the first contention well founded we have no occasion to pass upon the second.\n Kellogg & Sons undertook the interstate carriage of passengers by water on a launch operated by its servants. This was a maritime matter. The ferriage was for the facilitation of the company's business and for its con- \n\n[285 U.S. 502, 513]\n\u00a0\n venience as well as that of the employees. \n4\n The injury to the passengers resulted from negligence of the company's agents in the navigation of the launch. It was a maritime tort. The rights and obligations of the parties depended on and arose out of the maritime law. A proceeding to impose liability for such a tort is a cause in admiralty within the meaning of article 3,  2 of the Constitution, triable in the United States courts sitting in admiralty. Leathers v. Blessing, \n105 U.S. 626\n, 630; Workman v. New York, \n179 \nU.S. 552, 565\n, 21 S. Ct. 212; Atlantic Transport Co. v. Imbrovek, \n234 \nU.S. 52, 58\n, 34 S. Ct. 733, 51 L. R. A. (N.

Dawson, \n264 \nU.S. 219, 226\n, 44 S. Ct. 302.\n The Workmen's Compensation Law of New Jersey (Comp. St. Supp.  236-1 et seq.), the purpose of which was to supersede the common law redress in tort cases and statutory rights consequent upon death by wrongful act, and to substitute a commuted compensation for injury or death of an employee, irrespective of fault, is not applicable to the injuries and deaths under consideration.\n The decisions hold that the remedy which the compensation statute attempts to give is of a character wholly unknown to the common law, incapable of enforcement \n\n[285 U.S. 502, 514]\n\u00a0\n by the ordinary processes of any court, and is not saved to suitors from the grant of exclusive jurisdiction to the courts of the United States of all civil cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.

None of the employees or the personal representatives here concerned could have proceeded in admiralty to enforce the workmen's compensation law of New Jersey. That law has not been recognized and taken up as part of the admiralty jurisprudence of the United States.\n The compensation act is inapplicable to such a maritime tort, and the injured person is entitled to his remedy under rules recognized in admiralty. Messel v. Foundation Co., \n274 \nU.S. 427\n, 47 S. Ct. 695; Warren v. Morse Dry Dock & Repair Co., 235 N. Y. 445, 447, 139 N. E. 569.\n In the Jensen Case, supra, this Court said: 'And finally, this remedy ( under the compensation act) is not consistent with the policy of Congress to encourage investments in ships, manifested in the acts of 1851 (9 Stat. 635, c. 43) and 1884 (Rev. Stat.  4283-4285 (46 USCA  183-185); section 18, Act of June 26, 1884, c. 121, 23 Stat. 57 (46 USCA  189)) which declare a limitation upon the liability of their owners.'\n Kellogg & Sons sustained towards employees injured or killed the dual relationship of a carrier by water and a general employer at its Edgewater plant. \n6\n Under the federal statutes the company, acting in the first capacity, was entitled to a limitation of liability unless the claimants could prove negligence with the owner's privity or knowledge. They assumed the burden of proving such negligence. They sustained it and are entitled to recover according to the rules of the maritime law, including, of course, any applicable death statute. \n\n[285 U.S. 502, 515]\n\u00a0\n The court below was right in refusing a limitation of liability and in holding that the applicants for employment who had been told to return on the morning in question were entitled to awards in this proceeding; but it erred in denying awards according to the rules recognized in admiralty to the surviving employees and personal representatives of deceased employees of Kellogg & Sons, and remitting them to their remedy under the New Jersey Compensation Act. The decree is therefore reversed and the cause remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n It is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice STONE join in so much of the opinion as holds that limitation of liability was rightly refused. They concur also in the conclusion that Kellogg & Sons are liable in this proceeding, but they do so upon the ground that the owner having invoked, as stated, the jurisdiction in admiralty, it cannot be surrendered in favor of that under the workmen's compensation law of the state.\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND is of opinion that the petition in No. 444 is not well founded and that the decree should be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 9 Stat. 635, R.

Gardner, of New York City, for appellee Long Island R. co.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This appeal involves the validity of a certificate of public convenience and necessity of the Interstate Commerce Commission, permitting the abandonment by Long Island Railroad Company of a portion of its Whitestone branch. Separate bills were filed by appellants to enjoin action by the railroad and to adjudge the certificate void. They were consolidated and heard by a specially constituted \n\n[284 U.S. 360, 365]\n\u00a0\n district court. \n1\n The parties having stipulated that they had offered all the proofs they desired to present, the court refused an interlocutory injunction, and dismissed the bills.\n The Long Island Railroad Company, chartered under the laws of New York, whose lines lie wholly within that state, transports passengers and freight in interstate commerce by the use of steam and electricity. Its Whitestone branch extends a distance of 4.7 miles from the Port Washington branch to the Flushing River, and thence to Whitestone Landing. The bulk of its passenger traffic is intrastate, and only a slight amount interstate; but it carries a considerable volume of freight, 75 per cent. of which is interstate. In these respects the branch is representative of conditions throughout the system. There are five passenger stations on the branch line-Flushing, which is much the largest, and four others beyond.\n In January, 1928, the city of New York opened a rapid transit line connecting Flushing with Manhattan. There ensued a 33 per cent. decrease in the passenger revenue of the Whitestone branch; and its operating deficit of some $18,000 for 1927 increased to over $125,000 in 1928. There was a further decrease of over 26 per cent. in passenger revenue in the first five months of 1929\n\n\n On June 2, 1926, the Transit Commission pursuant to a program of grade crossing abolition ordered the elimination of four in and near Flushing. There are twelve such crossings on the entire branch, removal of all of which was in contemplation, and it was estimated that to remove them would cost about $4,000,000, the company's share being $2,000,000, which it could borrow from the state at from 4 to 5 per cent. interest. The elimination of \n\n[284 U.S. 360, 366]\n\u00a0\n the crossings would save $37,000 per year now spent for guarding them. On December 31, 1928, the total value of land and improvements on the portion of the branch sought to be abandoned was approximately $933,000.\n The company did not appeal from the order, as it might have done, but formally offered to quitclaim to the city of New York that portion of the branch which is involved in this proceeding. The city did not accept the proffer. The effective date of the grade separation order was postponed to December 31, 1928, and upon the Transit Commission's refusal further to extend the time for compliance, the company, on January 10, 1929, filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission its application under section 1(18) of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended by the Transportation Act of 1920,2 for a certificate permitting the abandonment of the 4.1 miles of the branch extending from west of Flushing River to the terminus at Whitestone Landing. After interventions by the Transit Commission, the city of New York, and others, the matter was heard by an examiner, whose proposed report was the subject of argument before Division 4 of the Commission. It found in favor of the application, and ordered that a certificate issue. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n During the hearing the company proposed that it would substitute truck service for the freight traffic to be affected by the abandonment, and it would, if a franchise were granted it by the city of New York, inaugurate a passenger bus service to the towns on the branch, which would connect them with its station at Flushing and with the terminus of the city's rapid transit line to Manhattan.\n A reargument was granted before the full Commission, which affirmed4 the report of Division 4. Since, however, the interveners expressed some doubt as to the com- \n\n[284 U.S. 360, 367]\n\u00a0\n pany's making satisfactory arrangements for bus service, the Commission indefinitely suspended the order to afford opportunity for negotiating the proposed bus franchise. The company promptly applied to the proper authorities, agreeing to take a grant terminable at short notice and on terms favorable both to the city and to the traveling public. No response was made to its offer and no action was taken on its application. After waiting five months it applied to the Commission to take final action, setting forth the neglect of the city to act in the matter. Thereupon the Commission ordered that its certificate should take effect 120 days from June 17, 1931.5\n By their bills the state of New York and the Transit Commission challenge the power of the Interstate Commerce Commission to issue a certificate of public convenience and necessity in such a case as is here presented, and assert that if it has such power, the proofs do not warrant its action.\n First. It is claimed that the certificate has as its sole basis the order of the State Transit Commission for the removal of grade crossings; that the latter was valid and within the state's constitutional right, regardless of its effect on interstate commerce, and that the Interstate Commerce Commission cannot destroy or impair this right, or hamper its exercise, by authorizing an abandonment of the railroad's line. We think this assertion is based upon a misconception of the Commission's action. In ascertaining the public convenience and necessity the Commission was bound to weigh the benefit to accrue to interstate commerce by the abandonment against the resultant prejudice and injury to intrastate commerce. Colorado v. United States, \n271 \nU.S. 153, 168\n, 46 S. Ct. 452. The finding was that continued operation would result in a serious and increasing depletion of revenue, due to the competi- \n\n[284 U.S. 360, 368]\n\u00a0\n tion by the city's rapid transit lines and their probable extension which would entail an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce. It was found that the expenditure for removal of grade crossings would, in the circumstances, be a waste of the company's funds, and that the requirement of the State Transit Commission removed all doubt of the propriety of abandonment of the branch. The magnitude of the required outlay as compared with the value of the whole property, and the resulting effect on the company's revenue, were facts properly taken into account in passing on the application. Compare Oregon R. & N. Co. v. Fairchild, \n224 \nU.S. 510, 529\n, 32 S. Ct. 535; Lehigh Valley R. Co. v. Board of Commissioners, \n278 \nU.S. 24, 34\n, 49 S. Ct. 69, 62 A. L. R. 805; New Orleans P. S., Inc., v. New Orleans, \n281 \nU.S. 682, 687\n, 50 S. Ct. 449.\n In reaching these conclusions the Commission considered the needs of the communities served, and gave due regard to them. It was shown that the city authorities had refused to take over the line, when the company offered to convey it, on the ground that the territory could be adequately served by bus transportation. Moreover, the company could not maintain satisfactory schedules on the branch, because of congestion in the tunnels under the East River, and without better schedules could not hope to increase use of this line. It was in evidence that the company's offer to establish an adequate bus system had not been accepted by the city authorities. There was other proof, which need not be detailed, as to the intrastate traffic needs. All these matters were given due consideration by the Commission in reaching its ultimate conclusion. It followed the course outlined in Colorado v. United States, supra, and the claim that its action was beyond its authority and without warrant of law cannot be sustained. That decision requires a holding that appellant's assertion of unconstitutional invasion of the state's sovereignty is without merit. We need not elaborate what was there said on the subject. \n271 \nU.S. 165\n, 46 S. Ct. 452. \n\n[284 U.S. 360, 369]\n\u00a0\n Second. Appellants insist that the Commission's findings and conclusions, assuming that its order was within its powers, lack support in the evidence. They say the proofs show the continued operation of the branch will not prejudice, burden, obstruct, or interfere with interstate commerce, or lessen the ability of the carrier to serve that commerce, and since it is shown that the abandonment will cause prejudice to several communities the certificate should not have been granted. There is no contradiction of the fact that the branch is operating at a serious loss, as shown by the carrier's accounts offered in evidence, and that this will continue and increase from year to year and be aggravated by expenditures for the removal of grade crossings. Appellants criticize the allocation of certain rentals and overheads by the company, and point to evidence produced by them indicating that the operating losses are in fact much less than those claimed by the carrier. The Commission, however, concluded that the railroad's figures came nearer representing the true situation than those offered by the intervenors. The latter further assert that the intrastate passenger traffic of the railroad constitutes by far the greater and more profitable portion of its business; that the interstate traffic represents only about sixteen per cent. of its gross revenue and is unprofitable; that the system as a whole has large net earnings and is a successful enterprise; and that the Commission was in error in considering incidental and dependent interstate traffic as an excuse for federal interference with a highly remunerative local traffic. They seek thus to distinguish the present case from Colorado v. United States, supra, and assert that the Commission ignored the test there approved and acted upon the erroneous theory that proof that the continuance of the Whitestone branch would constitute a burden on interstate commerce was unnecessary.\n We do not so read the Commission's report. That body professed to follow the decision in the Colorado Case, and \n\n[284 U.S. 360, 370]\n\u00a0\n we think that it did so. The court there held that in the issuance of a certificate of public convenience and necessity the Commission need not determine with mathematical exactness the extent of the burden imposed upon interstate commerce by the operation of a branch line; that such burden might involve various elements, and that if upon the whole proof the conclusion was warranted that continued operation would in fact unreasonably burden the interstate commerce of the carrier, the Commission was justified in authorizing abandonment. There as here the system lay wholly within the state and was prosperous, and no claim was made that immediate abandonment of the local branch was necessary to enable the carrier to earn a reasonable return on its investment. Here, as in the Colorado Case, the Commission had regard for the needs of intrastate as well as interstate commerce. The evidence was ample to give a comprehensive view of the entire situation, and due weight was accorded all of the proofs in the light of the conflicting requirements. The contention that the Commission went upon the theory that it might authorize abandonment in disregard of the evidence is not supported by the record.\n The judgment must be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Pursuant to U.

Siegel and Milton B. Seasonwein, both of New York City, for respondent.\n\n\n[285 U.S. 452, 457]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question is whether searches and seizures claimed by the government to have been made as lawfully inci- \n\n[285 U.S. 452, 458]\n\u00a0\n dent to the arrest of respondents on a warrant for conspiracy to violate the National Prohibition Act transgressed their rights under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments.\n January 12, 1931, a prohibition agent complained to a United States Commissioner in the Southern District of New York that commencing June 21, 1930, and continuing to the time of making the complaint Henry Miller ( meaning respondent Lefkowitz), Jane Doe (meaning respondent Paris), and another person called Richard Roe did conspire to sell, possess, transport, furnish, deliver, and take orders for intoxicating liquor contrary to the National Prohibition Act (27 USCA). The complaint alleged it was a part of the conspiracy that from room 604 at 1547 Broadway defendants should solicit orders for liquor, have it delivered by express companies or other carriers, collect for it, and share the proceeds. It alleged certain overt acts but they have no significance upon the question under consideration. The allegations of the complaint show that the complaining witness had knowledge and information of facts amply sufficient to justify the accusation.\n The commissioner issued his warrant, to which was attached a copy of the complaint, commanding the marshal and his deputies to arrest defendants. It was given to a deputy marshal for execution and he, the complaining witness, and three other prohibition agents went to room 604. The room was about ten feet wide and twenty feet long and was divided by a partition. In its outer portion, there were a stenographer's desk used by respondent Paris, a towel cabinet, and a waste basket, and in the inner part another desk and basket. When the deputy marshal and agents entered, Lefkowitz was in the room. The deputy marshal arrested him, and thereupon one of the prohibition agents searched and took from his person various papers and other things all of which were given to the deputy marshal and later turned over to the assistant United States attorney. The agents opened all the \n\n[285 U.S. 452, 459]\n\u00a0\n drawers of both desks, examined their contents, took therefrom and carried away books, papers, and other articles. \n1\n They also searched the towel cabinet and took \n\n[285 U.S. 452, 460]\n\u00a0\n papers from it. 2 There was no breaking as the desks and cabinet were not locked. They also took the contents of the baskets and later pasted together pieces of papers found therein. \n3\n Respondent Paris came in while the room was being searched, and the deputy marshal arrested her. All the searches and seizures were made without a search warrant. The prohibition agents delivered to the special agent in charge all the things taken from the desks, cabinet, and baskets. And, until delivered to the assistant United States attorney after Lefkowitz applied to the court for their suppression and return, they were held by the agent in charge for use in making further investigations concerning the conspiracy referred to in the complaint.\n January 21, 1931, the District Court on the application of Lefkowitz issued an order to show cause, why the court \n\n[285 U.S. 452, 461]\n\u00a0\n should not make an order for the suppression of evidence obtained by reason of the search of the room and for the return of all the books, papers, and other things belonging to Lefkowitz. With the exception of some things that the prosecuting attorney did not wish to retain as evidence and which he had returned to Lefkowitz before the hearing, all the papers and articles seized were produced and submitted to the court. The Government submitted, in opposition to respondents' motions, affidavits of its attorney, the deputy marshal, and three of the four prohibition agents.\n The District Court denied respondents' motions. It construed the complaint to charge felony under section 37 of the Criminal Code (18 USCA  88) defining conspiracy and title 2,  21 of the National Prohibition Act ( 27 USCA  33) defining nuisance, held that each of the papers seized was, within the meaning of title 2, sections 21 and 22 (27 USCA  33, 34), kept and used to maintain a nuisance; said that 'it is enough if the conspiracy was there or the petitioners or their associates had any of them gathered in the room to conduct the conspiracy or do any act to effect its object'; that 'it might well follow that, in the sense of the word as used in the Carroll Case (\n267 \nU.S. 132\n, 45 S. Ct. 280, 39 A. L. R. 790), supra, the seized papers were contraband'; and that 'it is not necessary, however, to determine that, for the reason that, at least within the Marron Case (\n275 \nU.S. 192\n, 48 S. Ct. 74) all the papers were but usual and ordinary means of carrying on a business of the character presented here.' 47 F.(2d) 921, 922.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. 52 F.(2d) 52, 54. It found that the search of the person of Lefkowitz was lawful and that the things taken might be used as evidence against him, held that the things seized when the office and furniture were explored did not belong to the same class, referred to 'the firmly rooted proposition that what are called general exploratory searches throughout premises and personal property are forbidden,' and said that it did not matter 'whether the articles of personal property \n\n[285 U.S. 452, 462]\n\u00a0\n opened and the contents examined are numerous or few, the right of personal security, liberty and private property is violated if the search is general, for nothing specific, but for whatever the containers may hide from view, and is based only on the eagerness of officers to get hold of whatever evidence they may be able to bring to light. ... Such a search and seizure as these officers indulged themselves in is not like that in Marron v. United States ... where things openly displayed to view were picked up by the officers and taken away at the time an arrest was made. The decision that does control is Go-Bart Co. v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 344\n, 51 S. Ct. 153. Indeed, this case differs in its essential facts from that one so slightly that what is said in that opinion in characterizing the search made will apply with equal force to this one, which must accordingly be held unreasonable.'\n The government maintains that the facts and circumstances set forth in the affidavits submitted by it constitute a sufficient showing not only that the arrests were lawfully made on a valid warrant for the offense charged in the complaint but also that, without regard to the warrant, the arrests were justified as having been made for a felony by officers believing upon probable cause that respondents committed it and that when arrested they were actually engaged in the commission of crime. And it argues that, since the arrests were lawful, the search of the place where they were made was lawful, and that, having the right to search the premises, the officers were bound to do it thoroughly.\n It is clear that respondents were arrested in the proper execution of the warrant, and not by officers acting without a warrant merely upon probable cause to believe that respondents were guilty of a felonious conspiracy. The offense charged involved the use of the room only to solicit orders for liquor, to cause it to be delivered, to collect for it and divide proceeds. There is nothing in \n\n[285 U.S. 452, 463]\n\u00a0\n the record to support the claim that at the time of the arrest, the offense for which the warrant issued or any other crime was being committed in the presence of the officers. It cannot be claimed that they saw conspiracy being committed or that any understanding, agreement, or combination was being had, made, or formed in their presence. Go-Bart Co. v. United States, supra, \n282 \nU.S. 357\n, 51 S. Ct. 153. The maintenance of a nuisance or conspiracy to maintain one is not involved. The complaint did not attempt or purport to charge either. It did not allege that the room was a place where liquor was or ever had been manufactured, sold, kept, or bartered, or that it contained fixtures or other things essential or intended to be used for the sale of liquor to be consumed on the premises or otherwise. The mere soliciting of orders from the room in connection with the other uses alleged in the complaint is not sufficient to constitute the maintenance of nuisance therein. See sections 18, 21, and 22, title 2, National Prohibition Act, 27 U. S. C.  30, 33 and 34 (27 USCA  30, 33, 34); Miller v. United States (C. C. A.) 300 F. 529, 535; Schechter v. United States (C. C. A.) 7 F.(2d) 881. Cf. Todd v. United States (C. C. A.) 48 F.(2d) 530, 532. The facts and circumstances stated in the affidavits of the prohibition agents do not support but are inconsistent with and negative the assertions therein contained to the effect that respondents were arrested while commiting the crime of conspiracy or nuisance.\n The only question presented is whether the searches of the desks, cabinet, and baskets and the seizures of the things taken from them were reasonable as an incident of the arrests. And that must be decided on the basis of valid arrests under the warrant. Save as given by that warrant and as lawfully incident to its execution, the officers had no authority over respondents or anything in the room. The disclosed circumstances clearly show that the prohibition agents assumed the right contemporaneously with the arrest to search out and scru- \n\n[285 U.S. 452, 464]\n\u00a0\n tinize everything in the room in order to ascertain whether the books, papers or other things contained or constituted evidence of respondents' guilt of crime, whether that specified in the warrant or some other offense against the Act. Their conduct was unrestrained. The lists printed in the margin show how numerous and varied were the things found and taken.\n The Fourth Amendment forbids every search that is unreasonable and is construed liberally to safeguard the right of privacy. Byars v. United States, \n273 \nU.S. 28, 32\n, 47 S. Ct. 248. Its protection extends to offenders as well as to the law abiding. Weeks v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 383\n, 34 S. Ct. 341, L. R. A. 1915B, 834, Ann. Cas. 1915C, 1177; Agnello v. United States, \n269 \nU.S. 20, 32\n, 46 S. Ct. 4, 51 A. L. R. 409. The authority of officers to search one's house or place of business contemporaneously with his lawful arrest therein upon a valid warrant of arrest certainly is not greater than that conferred by a search warrant issued upon adequate proof and sufficiently describing the premises and the things sought to be obtained. Indeed, the informed and deliberate determinations of magistrates empowered to issue warrants as to what searches and seizures are permissible under the Constitution are to be preferred over the hurried action of officers and others who may happen to make arrests. Security against unlawful searches is more likely to be attained by resort to search warrants than by reliance upon the caution and sagacity of petty officers while acting under the excitement that attends the capture of persons accused of crime. United States v. Kirschenblatt (C. C. A.) 16 F.(2d) 202, 203, 51 A. L. R. 416; Go-Bart Co. v. United States, supra, \n282 \nU.S. 358\n, 51 S. Ct. 153.\n Respondents' papers were wanted by the officers solely for use as evidence of crime of which respondents were accused or suspected. They could not lawfully be searched for and taken even under a search warrant issued upon ample evidence and precisely describing such things \n\n[285 U.S. 452, 465]\n\u00a0\n and disclosing exactly where they were. Gouled v. United States, \n255 \nU.S. 298, 310\n, 41 S. Ct. 261.\n These searches and seizures are to be distinguished from the seizure of a ledger and some bills that was sustained in the Marron Case. There, prohibition officers lawfully on the premises searching for liquor described in a search warrant, arrested the bartender for crime openly being committed in their presence. He was maintaining a nuisance in violation of the act. The offense involved the element of continuity, the purchase of liquor from time to time, its sale as a regular thing for consumption upon the premises, and other transactions including the keeping of accounts. The ledger and bills being in plain view were picked up by the officers as an incident of the arrest. No search for them was made. The ledger was held to be part of the outfit actually used to commit the offense. The bills were deemed so closely related to the business that it was not unreasonable to consider them as employed to carry it on. While no use was being made of the book or papers at the moment of the arrest, they-like containers, chairs and tables for customers, the cash register, glasses, and supplies-were kept to be utilized when needed. The facts disclosed in the opinion were held to justify the inference that when the arrest was made the ledger and bill were in use to carry on the criminal enterprise.\n Here, the searches were exploratory and general and made solely to find evidence of respondents' guilt of the alleged conspiracy or some other crime. Though intended to be used to solicit orders for liquor in violation of the act, the papers and other articles found and taken were in themselves unoffending. The decisions of this court distinguish searches of one's house, office, papers or effects merely to get evidence to convict him of crime from searches such as those made to find stolen goods for return \n\n[285 U.S. 452, 466]\n\u00a0\n to the owner, to take property that has been forfeited to the government, to discover property concealed to avoid payment of duties for which it is liable, and from searches such as those made for the seizure of counterfeit coins, burglars' tools, gambling paraphernalia, and illicit liquor in order to prevent the commission of crime.

United States, supra, \n255 \nU.S. 306\n, 41 S. Ct. 261; Carroll v. United States, supra.\n In Entick v. Carrington, 19 How. St. Tr. 1029, Lord Camden declared that one's papers are his dearest property, showed that the law of England did not authorize a search of private papers to help forward conviction even in cases of most atrocious crime and said (page 1073 of 19 How. St. Tr.): 'Whether this proceedeth from the gentleness of the law towards criminals, or from a consideration that such a power would be more pernicious to the innocent than useful to the public, I will not say. It is very certain, that the law obligeth no man to accuse himself; because the necessary means of compelling self-accusation, falling upon the innocent as well as the guilty, would be both cruel and unjust; and it should seem, that search for evidence is disallowed upon the same principle. There too the innocent would be confounded with the guilty.'\n The teachings of that great case were cherished by our statesmen when the Constitution was adopted. In Boyd v. United States, supra, \n116 \nU.S. 630\n, 6 S. Ct. 524, 532, this court said: 'The principles laid down in this opinion (Entick v. Carrington) affect the very essence of constitutional liberty and security. ... They apply to all invasions on the part of the government and its employees of the sanctity of a man's home and the privacies of life. ... Any forcible and compulsory extraction of a man's own testimony, or of his private papers to be used as evidence to convict him of crime, or to forfeit his goods, is within the condemnation of that judgment. In this regard the fourth and fifth \n\n[285 U.S. 452, 467]\n\u00a0\n amendments run almost into each other.' And this court has always construed provisions of the Constitution having regard to the principles upon which it was established. The direct operation or literal meaning of the words used do not measure the purpose or scope of its provisions. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 406, 407, 421; Boyd v. United States, supra; Byars v. United States, ubi supra.\n This case does not differ materially from the Go-Bart Case and is ruled by it. An arrest may not be used as a pretext to search for evidence. The searches and seizures here challenged must be held violative of respondents' rights under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] From the outer desk were taken: \n[\nFootnote 1\n] Black leather covered loose-leaf notebook, containing alphabetical list of names and addresses. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] An envelope marked room 604, 1547 Broadway, New York City, containing a 1929 New York State motor vehicle registration certificate 5 Y-2555, issued to Milton Hordish, 635 Kelly street, Bronx, N.

In 1923, on account of the illness of Aspasia's husband, they went back to Greece with the intention, which the courts below found that they retained, of making only a temporary visit. The death of the husband and the necessity of settling his estate prolonged their stay until 1924. Beginning in that year they made several unsuccessful applications to the United States Consul General at Athens for documents that would permit them to return to New York. Finally, in 1929, they got authority to cross Canada on a pretended trip from Greece to Japan, and in 1930 presented themselves at St. Albans, Vt., for admission to the United States. They were taken into custody by the immigration inspector and sought release by habeas corpus, on the ground that they were entitled to enter the country. It was held that they 'were properly excluded under section 13(a) of the Immigration Act of 1924 (8 USCA  213(a), since the Secretary of Labor did not admit them in his discretion ... and neither presented an unexpired valid immigration visa or an unexpired valid permit to re-enter in accordance with the regulations promulgated under section 13(b) of that act.' (C. C. A.) 49 F.(2d) 730, 733. A contrary decision was reached in Johnson v. Keating (C. C. A.) 17 F.(2d) 50. Therefore a writ of certiorari was granted by this court \n284 \nU.S. 601\n, 52 S.

By section 13 of the Act (8 USCA  213) and the regulations under it, as remarked by the court below, a returning alien cannot enter unless he was either an immigration visa or a return permit. The relators must show not only that they ought to be admitted, but that the United States by the only voice authorized to express its will has said so.

A judgment of the District Court in favor of the respondent was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. 57 F.(2d) 385. The case is here on certiorari. \n286 \nU.S. 540\n, 52 S.Ct. 648\n\n\n The respondent was a railroad under federal control when control was relinquished by the government on March 1, 1920. By the Transportation Act of that year (41 Stat. 464,  209, 49 U.S.C.,  77 (49 USCA  77)), it had the protection of guaranty as to its railway operating income for six months thereafter. The United States guaranteed that during this guaranty period the income should be not less than one-half of the annual compensation to which the carrier was entitled during the period of federal control. United States v. Guaranty Trust Co., \n280 \nU.S. 478\n, 50 S. Ct. 212; Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. United States, \n286 \nU.S. 285\n, 52 S.Ct. 528; Continental Tie & Lumber Co. v. United States, \n286 \nU.S. 290\n, 52 S.Ct. 529. Upon the Interstate Commerce Commission was laid the duty of ascertaining the amounts necessary to make good this guaranty and of certifying to the Secretary of the Treasury the results of the inquiry. Something more was required for this purpose than the mere comparison of receipts and expenses during the period of control with receipts and expenses during the six months following. In the ascertainment of railway operating income, or any deficit therein, the amount to be included in operating expenses for maintenance of way and structures, or for maintenance of equipment, was to be fixed by the Commission, and was not dependent solely on the action \n\n[287 U.S. 144, 147]\n\u00a0\n of the carrier. For that purpose reference was to be had to the tests prescribed by the standard form of contract for federal control. Transportation Act 1920,  209(f)(3), 49 USCA  77(f)(3); Federal Control Contract,  5(a). The Commission was to take as its base the average six months' maintenance expenses of the carrier during the years characterized as 'the test period,' i.e., the three years ending June 30, 1917. This amount was to be readjusted, however, so as to make allowance for changes in the extent of property maintained, for changes in the nature or intensity of the use, and, most important, for changes in the cost of labor and material. The end in view was the arrival at a figure that would permit the property to be kept up in the same state of reparation as at the time when the carrier's possession had been yielded to the government. The task of the Commission was not exhausted, however, when it ascertained the allowance to be made for the cost of maintenance. It was to require the restatement of other operating expenses in addition to those for maintenance 'to the extent necessary to correct and exclude any disproportionate or unreasonable charge to such expenses' for the guaranty period, or any charge 'which under a proper system of accounting is attributable to another period.' Transportation Act 1920,  209(f), (5), 49 USCA  77(f)(5).\n A task so vast and intricate exacted time and study. Many of the carriers, however, including this respondent, were in urgent need of cash for pressing obligations. The statute contained provisions that were intended to relieve the pressure. By section 209(h), of the act (41 Stat. 464, 466), the Commission was empowered, upon application during the guaranty period, to issue certificates for advance payments, such advances to be not in excess of the 'estimated amount' necessary to make good the guaranty. The Secretary of the Treasury was directed to make the advances in the amounts specified in the certificate upon the execution by the carrier of a contract, 'secured in such manner as \n\n[287 U.S. 144, 148]\n\u00a0\n the Secretary may determine,' that upon final determination of the amount of the guaranty it would repay the excess payment with interest, if excess there should be found to be. Under the authority of that section, certificates in the amount of $6,500,000 were issued by the Commission and collected by the carrier. The payments thus received were well within the limit of the guaranty as finally determined, and as to these no claim for reimbursement is put forward by the government.\n The relief permissible under section 209(h) turned out to be inadequate. It was limited to applications made before the guaranty period had expired, to applications; that is to say, before September 1, 1920. In the case of the respondent, as in that of other carriers, the guaranty period expired with the Commission still unready to announce its ultimate award, and with the pressure of the need for intermediate relief as urgent as before. Accordingly, the Transportation Act 1920 was amended on February 26, 1921, by authorizing the Commission, if not at the time able finally to determine the whole amount due, to make its certificate for any amount definitely ascertained by it to be due, and thereafter in the same manner to make further certificates, until the whole amount due had been certified. Act of February 26, 1921, c. 72, 41 Stat. 1145,  212, 49 U.S.C .  79 (49 USCA  79). The text of the statute is quoted in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[287 U.S. 144, 149]\n\u00a0\n At the time of the enactment of that section, the respondent had already filed with the Commission a guaranty claim in the sum of $18,498, 391.67, of which $6,500,000 had already been paid through certificates issued under section 209(h), leaving a balance of $11,998,391.67 still claimed to be due. The respondent, in submitting this claim, gave notice that it required a $6,000,000 advance to meet a pressing obligation, and asked for a certificate to that extent to be used as a basis for credit upon an application for a bank loan. Such a certificate was issued on February 23, 1921, though the Commission and the carrier understood that under the statute then in force it could not be made the basis for a payment by the Secretary of the Treasury. Three days later section 212 was added to the Transportation Act, and the legal aspect of the situation was at once transformed. At the respondent's request, the Commission canceled its advisory certificate of February 23, 1921, and on March 1, 1921, issued a new certificate under the authority of the statute. 'The Commission has ascertained and hereby certifies to the Secretary of the Treasury that the amount of six million dollars ($6,000,000) in addition to \n\n[287 U.S. 144, 150]\n\u00a0\n any sum or sums heretofore certified in favor of the carrier under section 209 of the Transportation Act 1920 (49 USCA  77), is necessary to make good to said carrier the guaranty provided by the said section. The Commission hereby certifies that such amount of six million dollars ($6, 000,000) cannot be reduced by further accounting or otherwise,' with which was coupled a statement that additional amounts might be found to be owing on further investigation.\n The respondent, armed with this certificate, procured from the Treasury the $6,000,000 required for its present needs. This amount, added to the earlier payments of $6,500,000, makes up a total of $12,500,000 collected on account of its claim against the government. The total was nearly $6,000,000 less than the amount claimed by the respondent to be ultimately due. It was about $3,200,000 less than the estimate of the final payment submitted as a basis for the certificate in a report to the Commission by the Bureau of Finance. Whatever the final payment might afterwards be found to be, the sum certified to be due left or seemed to leave a margin of error ample enough for any change within the zone of reasonable expectation.\n The Commission, after satisfying thus the instant needs of the respondent, continued the investigations necessary to ascertain the final balance. Not till five years had passed was it ready to announce its findings. In the meantime it had filed a series of reports or decisions defining or revising the principles and formulae that were to govern it thereafter in the allowance or disallowance of expenditures for maintenance. See, e.g., Maintenance Expenses under section 209, 70 I.C.C. 115; In the Matter of Final Settlement under section 209 of the Transportation Act 1920, 70 I.C.C. 771. By its final certificate issued on June 8, 1926, under section 209(g), it certified that the total amount necessary to make good the guaranty was \n\n[287 U.S. 144, 151]\n\u00a0\n $11,170,214.02, which was less by $1,329,786.98 than the payments already made. Cf. Great Northern Railway v. United States, \n277 \nU.S. 172\n, 48 S.Ct. 466. For the recovery of the difference with interest this action was brought.\n We may assume in favor of the petitioner that a certificate issued by the Commission under section 212 of the statute is open to impeachment for fraud or mistake, and that payments burdened with those infirmities are subject to be reclaimed. If this be assumed, it does not avail without more to lay a duty of restitution upon the carrier before us. Fraud in the making of the certificate is neither proved nor even intimated. Mistake also there was none, but merely a revision of judgment in respect of matters of opinion. The respondent reported that it had paid out for maintenance during the guaranty period $28,982,000. There is no claim that this report was false even to a penny. Readjustments were needed, however, as we have already pointed out, whereby allowance might be made for fluctuations in the cost of labor and material, as well as for other economic changes, between the period of test and the period of guaranty. The formulae for the readjustment of maintenance expenditures in use by the Commission on March 1, 1921, reduced the maintenance allowance to $27, 233,000, which was more than one and a half million dollars less than the expenditures actually made. The formulae in use on June 8, 1926, reduced the allowance for maintenance to $23,815,000. In this last reduction lies the explanation of the discrepancy between the partial certificate and the final one. Neither set of formulae is an expression of mathematical truth in such a sense that accuracy may be affirmed of one and error of the other. Each makes it necessary to multiply the expenses of the test period by a factor derived from an imperfect and approximate estimate of a composite change of prices. To what extent the factor is an expression of mere opinion is perceived when the process back of it is \n\n[287 U.S. 144, 152]\n\u00a0\n considered. At the date of the partial certificate various items of expense during the years of the test period-the cost of locomotives, of cars, of tracks, and many others-were separately considered, and the proper percentages of increase during the period of the guaranty applied separately to each of them. At the date of the final certificate, the Commission determined to abandon these refinements. It joined together all the property of all the carriers in regional or territorial groups, and ascertained the factor of increase for the members of a group collectively. By the use of this method, the test period expense was to be 'multiplied by a factor representing the increase in the general level of cost of labor and material for the territories in which the lines of railroad of the carrier are situated.' A general equation factor was substituted for a series of factors separately computed and separately applied. The result, as the Commission concedes in its report, is at best an approximation representing an exercise of judgment as to the effect of a composite increase. What is thus conceded in the report as to the source of the discrepancy between the two certificates was confirmed upon the trial by the testimony of a witness for the government. The difference, he tells us, 'grew out of a difference of opinion as to the method of calculation rather than out of errors in the figures submitted.' The Commission has not said that in any particular case the general equation factor will yield results more accurate than those attained by the method theretofore in use. It has claimed no more for the new method than an enhancement of simplicity along with an approach to accuracy not inferior to that of the method displaced.\n In these circumstances we find no basis for a holding that the payment made to the respondent under the partial certificate of March 1, 1921, was due to any mistake of fact, either unilateral or mutual. United States v. Barlow, \n132 \nU.S. 271, 280\n, 281 S., 10 S.Ct. 77. Cf. Gordon v. Butler, \n\n[287 U.S. 144, 153]\n\u00a0\n \n105 \nU.S. 553, 557\n, 558 S.. The officials of the government knew precisely what they were doing, and kept well within the statute defining their authority. They did not act illegally like the officials whose acts were challenged in the cases cited by the petitioner. Wisconsin Central Railroad Co. v. United States, \n164 \nU.S. 190\n, 17 S.Ct. 45; Grand Trunk Western Railway Co. v. United States, \n252 \nU.S. 112\n, 40 S. Ct. 309; Burnet v. Porter, \n283 \nU.S. 230\n, 51 S.Ct. 416. Charged with a difficult task exacting judgment and discretion, they came to a decision in good faith with knowledge of the relevant facts and without departure from the law. If the payment under their certificate is to be reclaimed, some other ground than mistake or illegality must be found to sustain the reclamation.\n Mistake and illegality being thus excluded from the reckoning, we are brought to a second ground for reclamation put forward by the government. The argument is made that, by the true construction of the statute, a certificate issued by the Commission under section 212 is provisional and tentative; that, upon the issuing of a final certificate of inconsistent tenor, it is superseded and nullified as to the past as well as to the future; and that payments made under its authority, though legal in the making, become illegal by retroaction. We do not so interpret the meaning of the statute. If all that the lawmakers had in view was to authorize mere advances on the basis of an estimate, the carrier remaining bound to refund the excess in the event that the estimate was thereafter found to be too high, a suitable form was at hand in section 209(h) for the expression of their purpose. All that was necessary was to strike out the requirement that application must be made during the guaranty period, and to provide that the promise of the carrier to refund might be accepted without security. Section 209(h), thus reframed, would have given expression with nicety to the obligation which the respondent is said to have assumed. \n\n[287 U.S. 144, 154]\n\u00a0\n But section 212, as enacted, was drafted upon different lines. By subdivision a of the section, the Commission, if unable finally to determine the whole amount due, may make its certificate for any amount definitely ascertained by it to be due, with supplemental certificates from time to time thereafter. No longer does the statute speak, as it had spoken in section 209(h), of 'estimated amounts,' and of contracts to refund any excess in the 'advances.' The newly authorized certificates are to represent what has been 'definitely ascertained'; and moneys procured thereby are characterized no longer as 'advances,' but as partial or final payments. If, however, the meaning of subdivision a,  212, could conceivably be doubtful when considered by itself, the doubt is removed by subdivision b. The law-makers foresaw that there might be 'deferred debits and credits,' such as unsettled damage claims, which could not be fully ascertained till a long time had gone by. Accordingly, subdivision b provides that the Commission shall be 'authorized, in the case of deferred debits and credits which cannot at the time be definitely determined, to make, whenever in its judgment practicable, a reasonable estimate of the net effect of any such items,' the estimates so made to be 'prima facie but not conclusive evidence of their correctness in amount in final settlement.' The petitioners would have us hold that subdivisions a and b, parts of a single section, mean one and the same thing with all their differences of form. The contrast between them is too pointed to permit us to find identity of thought lurking dormant and concealed beneath this diversity of phrase.\n Thus far we have not traveled, in our search for the meaning of the lawmakers, beyond the borders of the statute. In aid of the process of construction we are at liberty, if the meaning be uncertain, to have recourse to the legislative history of the measure and the statements by those in charge of it during its consideration by the \n\n[287 U.S. 144, 155]\n\u00a0\n Congress. United States v. Missouri Pacific Railroad Co., \n278 \nU.S. 269, 278\n, 49 S.Ct. 133. If such recourse be had, there is confirmation of the view that the certificates were more than estimates of provisional advances. Subdivisions a and b, as originally introduced, drew no distinction as to the effect of payments made thereunder, the certificates being as conclusive under the one as under the other. A proposed amendment to modify subdivision b by making the effect of such certificates prima facie, but not conclusive, was carried. 60 Congressional Record, part 3, pages 2815, 2816. A separate proposed amendment to modify subdivision a in substantially the same way was rejected. 60 Congressional Record, part 3, pages 2812, 2815. In the discussion of these amendments, the inquiry was pressed whether the government would be helpless if the certificates were too high. The answer was emphatic that the certificates were final. 60 Congressional Record, part 3, pages 2739, 2802, 2803, 2809, 2812, 2813.\n A word of answer is still due to the argument of the government that the certificate is void because the work of the Commission was so hasty and imperfect as to involve an abdication of its statutory duty. Without probing at this time the legal implications of this argument, we find it without adequate basis in the facts. Whatever basis it has is in the testimony of an accountant in the service of the Commission. His conclusions are contradicted by evidence, direct and circumstantial, offered by the carrier, and contradicted also by the recitals of his superior's certificate. The record may permit an inference that the whole amount owing in order to discharge the guaranty had not been so definitely determined as to make the Commission willing to recommend a settlement in full, though even this may be uncertain. It does not command a holding that the margin of error was so inscrutable as to preclude the definitive approval of a payment on account.\n The judgment is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Sec. 212.

UNITED STATES(1932)\nNo. 348\nArgued: January 15, 1932Decided: February 15, 1932\n\n\n\n\n\n[284 U.S. 511, 513]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Harry Le Baron Sampson, of Boston, Mass., for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Charles B. Rugg, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner sued to recover an alleged overpayment of income and profits taxes for 1918. The court made findings of fact, ruled in favor of petitioner as to a part of the amount and gave it judgment for $160,978.83 which is not here challenged. The court dismissed petitioner's complaint as to two other claims which this writ, \n284 \nU.S. 610\n, 52 S. Ct. 126, 76 L. Ed. -, brings up for consideration. One is on account of buildings erected by it for war purposes on leased land. The other involves the valuation of petitioner's inventories relating to government contracts. There is printed in the margin a statement showing the net income and taxes as determined by the Commissioner, the reduction made by the judgment and the deductions claimed by petitioner and denied by the court. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The substance of the findings as to the buildings may be stated as follows:\n Petitioner, for some years before the war, had been a manufacturer of ammunition for small arms used in times \n\n[284 U.S. 511, 514]\n\u00a0\n of peace. It carried on at Lowell, Massachusetts, principally in buildings rented from a power company. During the years 1911 to 1914, inclusive, its business was relatively small and not profitable. In 1914 it commenced making ammunition for use in the war and, for the purpose of continuing that business while the war should last, it constructed new buildings upon the power company's land at a cost of $802,499.49 pursuant to an agreement that it should have the right to use them rent free until December 31, 1924, and then hand them over to the power company. Until the armistice, at first for foreign governments and later for our own, it had orders, and used all the buildings, up to their capacity in the manufacture of war ammunition. There was no way of knowing when this demand would cease.\n Petitioner did not except to make military ammunition after conflict ended and in fact received no orders after the armistice. It continued the commercial ammunition business but made no profit in any year from 1918 to the end of the lease. The buildings could not be rented. Those belonging to the power company had been incorporated into the new ones. The space so made was much greater than required for its commercial ammunition business. Petitioner, for the purpose of utilizing the excess, undertook the manufacture of some other things, but that business was small and resulted in loss each year. There was a garage used during the war production but not needed afterwards. Petitioner attempted to operate the building as a public garage but, realizing no net return, rented it to others from October, 1923, until the end of the lease.\n The Commissioner allowed deductions on account of the cost of the buildings for the years from 1914 to 1917, inclusive, amounting in all to $ 197,107.74, leaving as of the end of 1917, cost less depreciation $605,391. 75. In the settlement of its 1918 taxes petitioner claimed that, as \n\n[284 U.S. 511, 515]\n\u00a0\n of the end of that year, the value of its right to use the new buildings during the remainder of the term was $190,969.86, and the Court of Claims found it not in excess of that amount. Petitioner claimed a deduction of the difference between the depreciated cost and such residual value. The Commissioner disallowed the claim on the ground that it had not abandoned the use of the buildings or permanently devoted them to a radically different use. He allowed $86,484.54, arrived at by distributing the cost of each building ratably over the period ending with the term of the lease. The difference between the deduction claimed and that allowed is $327,937. 35. In its tax returns for the remaining years of the lease, petitioner claimed deductions on account of the buildings amounting in all to $190, 969.86, but the Commissioner added to such deductions $327,937.35.\n The Revenue Act of 1918, 40 Stat. 1077, controls and its pertinent provisions are printed in the margin. \n2\n The \n\n[284 U.S. 511, 516]\n\u00a0\n Government maintains that subsection (8) excludes the allowance claimed. The contention is without merit. The argument is that, by authorizing amortization in respect of buildings erected for war production after April 6, 1917, Congress denied allowances for obsolescence as to like buildings constructed before the war. But obsolescence and amortization are not synonymous. While in some connections like meaning may be attributed to them, they do not necessarily or generally refer to the same thing. 'Obsolescence' may arise from changes in the art, shifting of business centers, loss of trade, inadequacy, supersession, prohibitory laws, and other things which, apart from physical detrioration, operate to cause plant elements or the plant as a whole to suffer diminution in value. Burnet v. Niagara Brewing Co., \n282 \nU.S. 648, 654\n, 51 S. Ct. 262; Gambrinus Brewery Co. v. Anderson, \n282 \nU.S. 638\n, 51 S. Ct. 260. 'Amortization' as used in the act is not so broad; it refers to deductions on account of such part of the costs of certain facilities as has been borne by the taxpayer, 'but not again including any amount otherwise allowed.' This safeguard against duplication of allowances on account of the same diminution in value shows that deductions for amortization were not intended to exclude obsolescence, but rather were to be made in addition or having regard to allowances deducted on account of obsolescence and the like.\n The legislative history of the act negatives the contention. In explanation of the deduction for amortization the Committee on Ways and Means, having charge of the measure, reported that many facilities provided for \n\n[284 U.S. 511, 517]\n\u00a0\n war purposes would be of little value after termination of the conflict; that, under the law then existing, it was impossible to allow deductions other than for the 'ordinary exhaustion, wear and tear, and depletion of such property' and that the purpose was 'to allow special amounts for amortization, according to the peculiar condition in each case. ...'3 When that report was made, and as the draft of the Act was originally passed by the House and amended and passed in the Senate, it contained no provision expressly authorizing allowances for obsolescence. Subsection (7) in the form in which it was finally adopted was formulated in conference much later than the committee report, and after the provision for amortization as finally enacted had been agreed to. See Gambrinus Brewery Co. v. Anderson, supra, \n282 \nU.S. 643\n, 51 S. Ct. 260. Manifestly Congress intended by subsection (7) to establish a general rule and by subsection (8) to authorize, in a limited class of cases and under special circumstances, the amortization of certain costs by deductions not duplicating any other allowed by that or previous acts of Congress.\n Under the circumstances disclosed by the findings, the buildings erected by petitioner are not to be distinguished from equipment designed, constructed and suitable only for the performance of a single job or from brewery plants put out of use by prohibitory laws. The Government does not suggest that any part of the allowance claimed should have been deducted in petitioner's returns for years prior to 1918. It was impossible to know when the conflict would cease but it was certain that, when demand for war materials ended, there necessarily would be great diminution in the value of the buildings. That remaining after the armistice, November 11, 1918, was prop- \n\n[284 U.S. 511, 518]\n\u00a0\n erty to be regarded as in the nature of salvage. The depreciated cost less the value of petitioner's right to use the buildings after 1918 must be taken into account for the proper determination of petitioner's 1918 income and profits taxes. Gambrinus Brewery Co. v. Anderson, supra; Burnet v. Niagara Brewing Co., supra.\n The findings as to inventories may be stated as follows:\n At the end of 1918, petitioner had large quantities of material acquired for the production of war ammunition to be supplied by it under four contracts with the Government. The contracts provided that the Chief of Ordnance, upon termination or limitation of the war, might notify petitioner that any part of the articles then remaining undelivered should not be manufactured or delivered, and that: 'In the event of such complete or partial termination (of performance of the contract) the United States shall inspect all completed articles then on hand and such as may be completed within thirty (30) days after such notice and shall pay to the Contractor the price herein fixed for all articles accepted. ... The United States shall also pay to the contractor the cost of materials and component parts purchased by the contractor for the performance of this contract and then on hand ...' together with other allowances mentioned. \n 4\n\u00a0\n\n In December, 1918, the Chief of Ordnance caused letters to be sent petitioner in respect of each of its contracts stating: 'You are requested in the public interest immediately to suspend further operations under your contract ... and incur no further expenses in connection with the performance of said contract. This request is made with a view to the negotiation of a supplemental contract providing for the cancellation, settlement and \n\n[284 U.S. 511, 519]\n\u00a0\n adjustment of your existing contract, in a manner which will permit of a more prompt settlement and payment than will be practicable under the terms of said existing contract. Please acknowledge receipt of this notice immediately, and indicate your decision as to compliance with or rejection of this request. Upon notice of your compliance, a representative of the Ordnance Department will forthwith take up with you the proposed negotiation.' \n5\n Before the end of the year petitioner complied with these requests and ceased production under the contracts.\n At the end of that year there was no market for the materials in the inventories; they were not saleable at any price approaching cost; it was wholly uncertain what amounts might be obtained in settlement, and no negotiations for adjustments or settlement had been made.\n After negotiations involving much time and expense, partial settlements were reached in 1920 under which the Government took over and paid petitioner's cost for most of the raw material and work in process, except labor and overhead items chargeable to the latter. In final settlements in 1921 and 1922 there were compromises under which the Government paid a portion of the cost of some items and made no allowance for others.\n Petitioner kept its books on the accrual basis and elected to price its inventories at cost or market whichever was lower. The difference between petitioner and the Commissioner as to 1918 taxes was whether inventories of material on hand at that date should be taken at $231,615. 43, the then market value, or at $732,088.62 which was made up of amounts eventually realized by petitioner under the contracts of settlement. The latter was used by the Commissioner. \n\n[284 U.S. 511, 520]\n\u00a0\n Mere inspection of the suspension requests disclose that they were not intended to be the notices provided for in the clauses authorizing the Government to terminate manufacture or deliveries. College Point Boat Co. v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 12, 15\n, 45 S. Ct. 199. And upon petitioner's compliance with such requests the contract provisions as to payments by the Government to petitioner of cost were superseded. At the end of 1918, the Government was not bound to take or to pay petitioner for any property covered by the inventories. Petitioner had no assurance as to what settlements finally would be made or that it ever would receive more than the then market value of the inventories. Up to the time of the partial settlements in 1920, petitioner had no agreement that it would be paid the cost of any part of the property. Cf. Lucas v. American Code Co., \n280 \nU.S. 445, 449\n, 50 S. Ct. 202.\n Petitioner's position was not different from that of a merchant whose stock on hand at the end of the tax year and not covered by contracts of sale had declined in value and was inventoried below cost. In such case amounts in excess of inventory value realized from sales in subsequent years are attributable to such years. Gains or losses must be accounted for in the year in which they are realized. The purpose of the inventories is to assign to each period its profits and losses. Lucas v. Kansas City Structural Steel Co., \n281 \nU.S. 264, 268\n, 50 S. Ct. 263. The tax laws are calculated to produce revenue ascertainable and payable at regular intervals. Otherwise it would not be practicable to devise methods of accounting, assessment or collection capable of operation. Burnet v. Sanford & Brooks Co., \n282 \nU.S. 359, 365\n, 51 S. Ct. 150. The taking of petitioner's inventories at market value was essential to a proper disclosure of its financial position. Regulations in force at the time of the Commissioner's determination declare that items such as claims for compensation under canceled government contracts constitute income for the year in which \n\n[284 U.S. 511, 521]\n\u00a0\n they are allowed or their value is otherwise definitely determined. Regulations 65, Artcle 50. And see Regulations 45, Articles 1582-1584, as amended by T. D. 3296. On the facts found there was no warrant for including in petitioner's 1918 taxable income on account of such inventories any amount in excess of market value at the end of that year.\n The lower court's dismissal of petitioner's claims for deduction of $ 327,937.35 on account of buildings and $500,473.19 on account of inventories cannot be sustained.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \n Net income $1,792,432.58 Taxes $1,152,123.53 Reduction by court 195,362.67 Taxes 160,978.83 Leaving income 1,597,069.91 Taxes 991,144.70 Deduction claimed on account of buildings 327,937.35 Taxes 270,220.38 Deduction on account of inventories 500,473.19 Taxes 412,389.91\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 'Sec. 234.

CORSI(1932)\nNo. 10\nArgued: Decided: November 7, 1932\n\n\n\n\n[287 U.S. 129, 130]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Charles B.Rugg, Asst. Atty. Gen., for respondent.\n Mr. Leo Stapf (Mr. Harold Van Riper, of New York City, on the brief), for petitioner.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By writ of habeas corpus petitioner challenged the legality of his arrest for deportation as an alien alleged to have remained in the United States in violation of the terms of section 14 of the Immigration Act of 1924 (chapter 190, 43 Stat. 153, 162 (8 USCA  214)). That section provides:\n'Any alien who at any time after entering the United States is found ... to have remained therein for a longer time than permitted under this subchapter or regulations made thereunder, shall be taken into custody and deported. ...'\n\n The undisputed facts are that petitioner, a German citizen, deserted his ship, the Hansa, February 15, 1923, in the port of New York, and remained in this country until March, 1929, when he signed as a member of the crew of a vessel of United States registry, the America, for a voyage to Germany and return. This vessel stayed in Germany two and a half days; but it does not appear whether petitioner went ashore. He arrived in the \n\n[287 U.S. 129, 131]\n\u00a0\n United States on the return voyage in April, 1929, and was discharged from the ship, but was not examined by any immigration officer, nor did he possess an immigration vise or pay a head tax. On March 20, 1931, while working in Florida as a butcher, he was arrested on a warrant charging that he had remained in the country for a period longer than permitted by the Immigration Act of 1924 and the regulations thereunder. After hearing, an order of deportation was made. On this showing the District Court dismissed the writ and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed.\n The entry in 1923 was irregular, and petitioner was not entitled to remain. 1 Under the statute then in force he was subject to be deported; but such action could be taken only within three years of his entry. \n2\n The Immigration Act of 1924 did not alter the status of one who had unlawfully entered the country or remained after the passage of the Act of 1917,3 but abolished the three-year period of \n\n[287 U.S. 129, 132]\n\u00a0\n limitation only as to those entering after 1924. Section 14, quoted supra; Philippides v. Day, \n283 \nU.S. 48\n, 51 S.Ct. 358. The petitioner was therefore entitled to invoke immunity under the act of 1917 unless he lost it by making the voyage to Germany in 1929\n\n\n The question is whether by so doing he made a new entry into the United States which left him amenable to the provisions of the act of 1924. The court below answered in the affirmative. \n4\n Other Circuit Courts of Appeal have held the contrary. \n5\n In view of these conflicting decisions, certiorari was granted.\n The relator's arrival in the United States in April, 1929, was an entry into this country notwithstanding he was a member of the crew of an American ship which had made a round trip voyage. He came from a place outside the United States, and from a foreign port or place, within the meaning of the immigration laws. United States ex rel. Claussen v. Day, \n279 \nU.S. 398\n, 49 S.Ct. 354. While that case construed section 19 of the Act of February 5, 1917 (8 USCA  155), and the time limitation on deportation therein contained, the decision as to what constitutes an entry is equally conclusive in construing other sections of the immigration law.\n That petitioner entered without permission does not entitle him as an alien seaman to more than sixty days' stay in the United States. His noncompliance with the regulations respecting such seamen cannot confer upon him greater rights than if he had satisfied their requirements. Philippides v. Day, supra.\n The statutes requiring the master of a ship, under penalties, to bring back to the United States a seaman who signs for a round trip voyage are said to make the entry \n\n[287 U.S. 129, 133]\n\u00a0\n of April 1929, lawful (see 18 USCA  486). The argument, in substance, based upon the theory that an American vessel is American soil, was effectively answered, as respects the requirements of the Immigration Acts, in the Claussen Case, supra. Irrespective of any statutory duty to return the seaman to this country, the petitioner's entry would have been lawful had he complied with the provisions of statute and regulation for temporary sojourn as an alien seaman. The obligation of the master to return him did not, as contended, confer the right to remain here permanently.\n If we are to disregard petitioner's status as an alien seaman, the law required that he should have submitted himself to inspection, should have produced an immigration vise , and paid a head tax, if as an immigrant he desired to apply for citizenship. \n6\n He did none of these things, and in this aspect remained here in violation of law.\n The suggestion is made that, since the relator could not have been deported after the expiration of three years from his original entry in 1923, his status when discharged as one of the crew of the America in 1929 was that of an 'immigrant previously lawfully admitted to the United States, who is returning from a temporary visit abroad,' and thus he was a nonquota immigrant within section 4 of the Act of 1924.7 But he was not lawfully admitted for permanent residence in 1923, and his stay here cannot be converted into such lawful residence by the mere fact that the then applicable statute limited the time within which deportation proceedings could be had.

S. C.,  1-7, 15 USCA  1-7), and of the Clayton Act, c. 323, 38 Stat. 730 (title 15, U. S. C.,  12-27, 15 USCA  12-27). The district court granted a motion to dismiss the amended bill on the ground, principally, that the matters complained of were \n\n[284 U.S. 474, 479]\n\u00a0\n within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States Shipping Board, under the Shipping Act of 1916, c. 451, 39 Stat. 728, as amended by the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, c. 250, 41 Stat. 988 (title 46, U. S. C.,  801-842, 46 USCA  801-842), 39 F. (2d) 204. The circuit court of appeals affirmed. 50 F.(2d) 83.\n For present purposes, the substance of the pertinent allegations of the bill may be stated as follows: The petitioner, during the time mentioned in the bill, operated steamships for the carriage of general cargo between the port of New York and specifid foreign ports. The respondents are corporations also engaged in foreign commerce between the United States and specified foreign countries, carrying ninety-five per cent. of the general cargo trade from North Atlantic ports in the United States to the ports of Great Britain and Ireland. These corporations and the petitioner are the only lines maintaining general cargo services in that trade. Respondents have entered into and are engaged in a combination and conspiracy to restrain the foreign trade and commerce of the United States in respect of the carriage of general cargo from the United States to the foreign ports named, with the object and purpose of driving the petitioner and all others not parties to the combination out of, and of monopolizing, such trade and commerce. The conspiracy involves the establishment of a general tariff rate and a lower contract rate; the latter to be made available only to shippers who agree to confine their shipments to the lines of respondents. The differentials thus created between the two rates are not predicated upon volume of traffic or frequency or regularity of shipment, but are purely arbitrary and wholly disproportionate to any difference in service rendered; that sole consideration being their effect as a coercive measure. The tariff rate in numerous instances is as much as one hundred per cent. higher than the contract rate. The disproportionately \n\n[284 U.S. 474, 480]\n\u00a0\n wife spread of these differentials is wholly arbitrary and unreasonable. The respondents have put into effect what is called a scheme of joint exclusive patronage contracts, by which shippers are required to agree to ship exclusively by their lines, and to refrain from offering any shipments to petitioner. Unless they so agree, the shippers are forced to pay the far higher general tariff rates. This plan is resorted to for the purpose of coercing shippers to deal exclusively with respondents and refrain from shipping by the vessels of petitioner, and thus exclude it entirely from the carrying trade between the United States and Great Britain.\n Other means to accomplish the same end are alleged, such as giving rebates, spreading false rumors, and falsely stating that petitioner is about to discontinue its service; making use of their combined economic bargaining power to coerce various shippers, who are also producers of commodities used in large quantities by respondents, to enter into joint exclusive contracts with them; and threatening to blacklist forwarders and refuse to pay them joint brokerage fees unless they discontinue making, or advising shippers to make, shipments in petitioner's ships. Certain overt acts are alleged as being in furtherance of the combination, conspiracy, and attempt to monopolize. A more detailed analysis of the amended bill is embodied in the statement of the case which precedes the opinion of the court below.\n It may be conceded that looking alone to the Sherman Anti-Trust Act the bill states a cause of action under sections 1 and 2 of that act (15 USCA  1, 2) and consequently furnishes ground for an injunction under section 16 of the Clayton Act (15 USCA  26) unless the Shipping Act stands in the way; and this was the view of both courts below.\n The Shipping Act is a comprehensive measure bearing a relation to common carriers by water substantially the same as that borne by the Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA  1 et seq.) to \n\n[284 U.S. 474, 481]\n\u00a0\n interstate common carriers by land. When the Shipping Act was passed, the Interstate Commerce Act had been in force in its original form or in amended forms for more than a generation. Its provisions had been applied to a great variety of situations, and had been judicially construed in a large number and variety of cases. The rule had become settled that questions essentially of fact and those involving the exercise of administrative discretion, which were within the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission, were primarily within its exclusive jurisdiction, and, with certain exceptions not applicable here, that a remedy must be sought from the Commission before the jurisdiction of the courts could be invoked. In this situation, the Shipping Act was passed. In its general scope and purpose, as well as in its terms, that act closely parallels the Interstate Commerce Act; and we cannot escape the conclusion that Congress intended that the two acts, each in its own field, should have like interpretation, application, and effect. It follows that the settled construction in respect of the earlier act must be applied to the later one, unless, in particular instances, there be something peculiar in the question under consideration, or dissimilarity in the terms of the act relating thereto, requiring a different conclusion.\n The decisions of this court which deal with the subject under the Interstate Commerce Act are fully reviewed by the court below in an able and carefully drawn opinion. It is enough for us here to refer to a few illustrative cases. In Great No. Ry. Co. v. Merchants' Elev. Co., \n259 \nU.S. 285, 291\n, 42 S. Ct. 477, the general rule and an exception to it are considered. The immediate question there at issue concerned merely the legal construction of an interstate tariff, no question of fact, either as an aid to the construction, or in any other respect, and no question of administrative discretion, being involved. It was held that the issue was within the jurisdiction of the courts without preliminary \n\n[284 U.S. 474, 482]\n\u00a0\n resort to the Commission. But the distinction between that case and one where preliminary resort to the Commission is necessary was definitely stated. Such resort, it was said, must be had where a rate, rule, or practice is attacked as unreasonable or as unjustly discriminatory, and also where it is necessary, in the construction of a tariff, to determine upon evidence the peculiar meaning of words or the existence of incidents alleged to be attached by usage to the transaction. In all such cases, the uniformity which it is the purpose of the Commerce Act to secure could not be obtained without a preliminary determination by the Commission. Preliminary resort to the Commission 'is required because the enquiry is essentially one of fact and of discretion in technical matters; and uniformity can be secured only if its determination is left to the Commission. Moreover, that determination is reached ordinarily upon voluminous and conflicting evidence, for the adequate appreciation of which acquaintance with many intricate facts of transportation is indispensable; and such acquaintance is commonly to be found only in a body of experts. But what construction shall be given to a railroad tariff presents ordinarily a question of law which does not differ in character from those presented when the construction of any other document is in dispute.'\n In Board v. Great Northern Ry., \n281 \nU.S. 412\n, 50 S. Ct. 391, an interlocutory injunction had been granted by a federal District Court of three judges in a suit assailing intrastate railroad rates as working undue and unreasonable discrimination against interstate commerce. The order granting the injunction was reversed on the ground that the District Court was without power to entertain the suit in advance of a determination of the question by the Interstate Commerce Commission.\n'The inquiry,' we said (pages 421, 422 of 281 U. S., 50 S. Ct. 391, 393), 'would necessarily relate to technical and intricate matters of fact, \n\n[284 U.S. 474, 483]\n\u00a0\n and the solution of the question would demand the exercise of sound administrative discretion. The accomplishment of the purpose of Congress could not be had without the comprehensive study of an expert body continuously employed in administrative supervision. Only through the action of such a body could there be secured the uniformity of ruling upon which appropriate protection from unreasonable exactions and unjust discriminations must depend.'\n\n So the rule has been applied where recovery was sought by a shipper for unreasonable and excessive freight rates not found to be unreasonable by the Commission, Texas & Pac. Ry. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co., \n204 \nU.S. 426\n, 27 S. Ct. 350, 9 Ann. Cas. 1075, where the question was as to the reasonableness of the carrier's practice in distributing cars, Midland Valley R. R. v. Barkley, \n276 \nU.S. 482\n, 48 S. Ct. 342; where the reasonableness of a particular practice of routing was involved, Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. Solum, \n247 \nU.S. 477, 483\n, 38 S. Ct. 550; where the continuance of service on an industrial track was assailed as unduly discriminatory, Western & Atlantic v. Public Comm., \n267 \nU.S. 493, 497\n, 45 S. Ct. 409; and where an action was brought under section 7 of the Anti-Trust Act (15 USCA  15), based upon an alleged conspiracy among carriers to fix rates, Keogh v. C. & N. W. Ry. Co., \n260 \nU.S. 156\n, 43 S. Ct. 47. In the case last cited, it was pointed out (page 163 of 260 U. S., 43 S. Ct. 47, 50) that if a shipper were permitted to recover under the Anti-Trust Act, the amount recovered might, like a rebate, operate to give him a preference over his trade competitors. 'Uniform treatment would not result, even if all sued, unless the highly improbable happened, and the several juries and courts gave to each the same measure of relief.'\n That the Shipping Act covers the dominant facts alleged in the present case as constituting a violation of the Anti-Trust Act is clear. Section 14 (46 USCA  812) prohibits retaliation by a common carrier by water against any shipper by resort \n\n[284 U.S. 474, 484]\n\u00a0\n to discriminating or unfair methods because the shipper has patronized another carrier; and section 14a (46 USCA  813) confers power upon the Board to determine the question. The latter section also confers similar power on the Board in respect of any combination, agreement, or understanding involving transportation of passengers or property between foreign ports, deferred rebates, or any other unfair practice designated in section 14. Section 16 (46 USCA  815) makes it unlawful for any such carrier, alone or in conjunction with another, to give any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person, locality, or description of traffic, or to subject any such person, locality, or traffic to undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage in any respect, or to allow any person to obtain transportation for property at less than the regular rates by any unjust or unfair device or means. Section 17 (46 USCA  816) prohibits any charge or rate unjustly discriminatory between shippers or ports, etc., and gives the Board authority to alter the same to the extent necessary to correct the discrimination or prejudice, and to order the carrier to discontinue. Section 22 (46 USCA  821) authorizes any person to file with the Board a complaint, setting forth any violation of the act by a common carrier by water, and asking reparation for the injury. Copy of the complaint is to be furnished to the carrier, who is required to satisfy the complaint or answer it in writing. If not satisfied, the Board is authorized to investigate the case and make such order as it deems proper, and the Board may direct payment of full reparation for the injury caused by such violation. The Board is also authorized, upon its own motion, except as to orders for the payment of money, to investigate any violation of the act. We need not pursue the analysis further. These and other provisions of the Shipping Act clearly exhibit the close parallelism between that act and its prototype, the Interstate Commerce Act, and the applicability to both of like principles of construction and administration. \n\n[284 U.S. 474, 485]\n\u00a0\n The act is restrictive in its operation upon some of the activities of common carriers by water, and permissive in respect of others. Their business involves questions of an exceptional character, the solution of which may call for the exercise of a high degree of expert and technical knowledge. Whether a given agreement among such carriers should be held to contravene the act may depend upon a consideration of economic relations, of facts peculiar to the business or its history, of competitive conditions in respect of the shipping of foreign countries, and of other relevant circumstances, generally unfamiliar to a judicial tribunal, but well understood by an administrative body especially trained and experienced in the intricate and technical facts and usages of the shipping trade, and with which that body, consequently, is better able to deal. Compare Chicago Board of Trade v. United States, \n246 \nU.S. 231, 238\n, 38 S. Ct. 242; United States v. Hamburgh-American S. S. Line (D. C.) 216 F. 971.\n A comparison of the enumeration of wrongs charged in the bill with the provisions of the sections of the Shipping Act above outlined conclusively shows, without going into detail, that the allegations either constitute direct and basic charges of violations of these provisions, or are so interrelated with such charges as to be, in effect, a component part of them; and the remedy is that afforded by the Shipping Act, which to that extent supersedes the anti-trust laws. Compare Keogh v. C. & N. W. Ry. Co., supra, 260 U. S. at page 162, 43 S. Ct. 47, 49. The matter therefore is within the exclusive preliminary jurisdiction of the Shipping Board. The scope and evidence purpose of the Shipping Act, as in the case of the Interstate Commerce Act, is demonstrative of this conclusion. Indeed, if there be a difference, the conclusion as to the first-named act rests upon stronger ground, since the decisions of this court compelling a preliminary resort to the Commission \n\n[284 U.S. 474, 486]\n\u00a0\n were made in the face of a clause in section 22 of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA  22) that nothing therein contained should in any way abridge or alter existing common-law or statutory remedies, but that the provisions of the act were in addition to such remedies (Mitchell Coal Co. v. Penna. R. R. Co., \n230 \nU.S. 247, 256\n, 33 S. Ct. 916); a clause that finds no counterpart in the Shipping Act.\n There is nothing in section 15 of the Shipping Act (46 USCA  814) which militates against the foregoing views. That section requires that agreements between carriers, or others subject to the act, in respect of a number of enumerated matters, or 'in any manner providing for an exclusive, preferential, or cooperative working arrangement,' shall be filed immediately with the Board; and that the term 'agreement' shall include understandings, conferences, and other arrangements. Thereupon, the Board is authorized to disapprove, cancel, or modify any such agreement, 'whether or not previously approved by it,' which it finds to be unjustly discriminatory or unfair as between carriers, shippers, etc., 'or to operate to the detriment of the commerce of the United States, or to be in violation of this Act.' But a failure to file such an agreement with the Board will not afford ground for an injunction under section 16 of the Clayton Act (15 USCA  26) at the suit of private parties, whatever, in that event, may be the rights of the government, since the maintenance of such a suit, being predicated upon a violation of the anti-trust laws, depends upon the right to seek a remedy under those laws; a right which, as we have seen, does not here exist. If there be a failure to file an agreement as required by section 15, the Board, as in the case of other violations of the act, is fully authorized by section 22, supra (46 USCA  821), to afford relief upon complaint or upon its own motion. Its orders, in that respect, as in other respects, are then, under section 31 (46 USCA  830), for the first time, open to a judicial proceeding to enforce, suspend, or set them aside in accordance, generally, with the rules and limita- \n\n[284 U.S. 474, 487]\n\u00a0\n tions announced by this court in respect of like orders made by the Interstate Commerce Commission.\n It is said that the agreement referred to in the bill of complaint cannot legally be approved. But this is by no means clear. In the first place, while the allegations of the bill must be taken as true upon the motion to dismiss, they still are subject to challenge by pleading and proof if the motion be denied. We cannot assume that, in a proceeding before the Board in which the whole case would be open, similar allegations will not be denied or met by countervailing affirmative averments. In any event, it reasonably cannot be thought that Congress intended to strip the Board of its primary original jurisdiction to consider such an agreement and 'disapprove, cancel, or modify' it, because of a failure of the contracting parties to file it as section 15 requires. A contention to that effect is clearly out of harmony with the fundamental purposes of the act, and specifically with the provision of section 22 authorizing the Board to investigate any violation of the act upon complaint or upon its own motion and make such order as it deems proper. And whatever may be the form of the agreement, and whether it be lawful or unlawful upon its face, Congress undoubtedly intended that the Board should possess the authority primarily to hear and adjudge the matter. For the courts to take jurisdiction in advance of such hearing and determination would be to usurp that authority. Moreover, having regard to the peculiar nature of ocean traffic, it is not impossible that, although an agreement be apparently bad on its face, it properly might, upon a full consideration of all the attending circumstances, be approved or allowed to stand with modifications.\n Petitioner contends that the Shipping Board has already determined that an agreement similar to the one here involved is unlawful under the Shipping Act, Eden Mining Co. v. Bluefields Fruit & S. S. Co., 1 U. S. S. B. 41, \n\n[284 U.S. 474, 488]\n\u00a0\n and therefore that the courts may take jurisdiction of the case without further preliminary resort to the Board. In support of this contention, we are referred to Mitchell Coal Co. v. Penna. R. R. Co., supra (see page 257 of 230 U. S., 33 S. Ct. 916, 920), and National Pole Co. v. Chicago & N. W. Ry. Co. (C. C. A.) 211 F. 65, 72. Without stopping to consider the general principle thus invoked, it is enough to say that the Eden Case did not involve this agreement or these parties, and it was decided after a full hearing upon issue joined. Here we have only the allegations of the bill before us. If there be a formal written agreement, it is not set out; and it is pleaded, apparently, only according to the pleader's conception of its legal effect. There is at present no answer, and the question before us arises upon a motion to dismiss, which admits the facts, so far as they are well pleaded, only for the sake of the argument. What might be disclosed by an answer and upon a hearing, we do not know and are not permitted to conjecture. It may be, for aught that now appears, that in an original proceeding before the Board, the allegations upon which petitioner relies may not be sustained, or may be so qualified as to render the Eden decision entirely inapplicable. Whatever might be the rule to be applied under other circumstances, we are of opinion that in the state of the present record the ordinary primary jurisdiction of the Board has not been superseded by its decision in the Eden Case. To hold otherwise would be to create the doubtful, and perhaps dangerous, precedent that a decision of the Board in respect of one agreement definitely establishes that the rule of that decision must, without more, be applied to all other agreements alleged to be of a similar character, although it may turn out upon investigation that the allegations are not warranted, or the facts and circumstances of and surrounding the transaction are so wholly different as to afford ground for a different result.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","160":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v.

S. Code,  482 and 483 (19 USCA  482, 483)) and prayed for a decree of forfeiture.\n Thereupon, the Commercial Credit Company, Inc., the holder of a chattel mortgage, filed an intervening petition alleging that its lien had been created in good faith; that it was innocent of any participation in the wrongful use of the cars; and that by force of title 2, section 26, of the National Prohibition Act (27 USCA  40), it should have an award of the possession. The District Court dismissed the intervening claim and adjudged a forfeiture, holding that sections 3061 and 3062 of the Revised Statutes were unrepealed by title 2, section 26, of the National Prohibition Act, and permitted the forfeiture of articles illegally employed in the importation of intoxicating liquors. United States v. One Fargo Truck, 46 F.(2d) 171.

Ed. -, sustains the position of the government that vehicles employed in the unlawful importation of intoxicating liquors may be seized under the Tariff Act and the provisions of the Revised Statutes ancillary thereto. All that remains is to determine whether these vehicles were so employed. The cars subjected to forfeiture in No. 574 were the same that had brought the contraband merchandise from beyond \n\n[286 U.S. 63, 67]\n\u00a0\n the Mexican border. The cars libeled in this proceeding were laden with the liquors, for all that the evidence shows, on this side of the border line.\n The difference is not one that exacts differing relief. The circumstantial evidence justifies a finding that the cars, wherever laden, were implements or links in a continuous process of carriage from Mexico into Texas. This was unlawful importation as well as unlawful transportation.

I., for the United States.\n Mr. Hugh Satterlee, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent filed returns in respect of capital stock taxes for the years ending June 30 in 1923, 1924, and 1925 under section 1000 of the Revenue Act of 1921 (42 Stat. 294) and section 700 of the Revenue Act of 1924 (26 USCA  223 note).1 The first two reported taxes \n\n[285 U.S. 191, 192]\n\u00a0\n due. In the other respondent claimed to be an insurance company taxable under section 246 (42 Stat. 262 and 26 USCA  1006 note) and consequently exempt from the capital stock tax. It made returns and paid income taxes for the calendar years 1921 to 1925 inclusive. In February, 1926, respondent paid under protest the capital stock taxes. It made application for refund, and, that being denied, brought this action in the District Court for Eastern New York to recover the amounts so exacted. The parties submitted the case on an agreed statement of facts. The court gave judgment for the United States. 41 F.(2d) 793. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. 50 F.(2d) 107.\n The question is whether, during the periods for which the capital stock taxes were paid, respondent was an insurance company taxable only under section 246.\n Respondent was organized in 1906 under article 5 of the New York Insurance Law (Laws N. Y. 1892, c. 690,  170 et seq., as amended). It was formed to examine and guarantee title to real estate, to lend money on real estate mortgages, and to guarantee such mortgages as to payment of principal and interest and to do the work generally of a title insurance company. It is under the supervision of the state superintendent of insurance, subject to the laws applicable to title and credit guaranty corporations, and maintains the required guaranty fund.\n Its business has always consisted of issuing two kinds of contracts: ( 1) Those in which it merely guarantees title and (2) those in which it guarantees (a) title to real estate covered by a mortgage and (b) payment of principal and interest of the debt. Preliminary to the issue of title insurance policies first mentioned, respondent prepared abstracts and made examination of the title. Its charges were based upon a scale dependent upon the amounts of the policies and included fees for examina- \n\n[285 U.S. 191, 193]\n\u00a0\n tions, searches, and other service incident to the transaction. Policies guaranteeing both title and payment of such mortgage debts were issued substantially as follows. When respondent received an application for a loan, it made an appraisal of the property and an examination of the title. Upon its approval of the application, it received from the borrower his bond and mortgage and paid him the amount of the bond less charges for services incidental to title insurance and also for inspection and appraisal of the property. The fee covering title insurance was made a condition of every loan. Respondent did not charge any lending fee.\n It sold the loans at face value and delivered to the purchaser of each a mortgage guaranty, or, in case of the sale of part of a loan, a participation certificate. By every such guaranty or certificate, the purchaser appointed respondent his agent to collect principal and interest of the loan, and the latter guaranteed (1) the mortgage to be a valid first lien upon a good and marketable title in fee, (2) payment of principal when collected and in any event within 12 months after maturity, and (3) payment of interest at a rate usually one-half of 1 per cent. less than that specified in the bond. The difference was called premium. Generally about two months elapsed between the making of loans and their sale. The interest for that period was retained by respondent and constituted a part of its gross income.\n It never held nor sold mortgages that were not acquired and guaranteed as above stated and never guaranteed other than those controlled by it. Its expenses were not assigned to its different classes of business, and its assets were used indiscriminately in connection with all its activities.

Bowers v. Lawyers Mortgage Co., \n285 \nU.S. 182\n, 52 S. Ct. 350, 76 L. Ed. -. The amounts received as compensation for insuring title, for guaranteeing that mortgages are first liens, and for guaranteeing payment, constitute the larger part of respondent's income. And, when there are added the fees and charges for examination of title, appraisals, and other services incident to its insurance business, the total properly assignable to that business amounts to more than 75 per cent. of all respondent's income. Undeniably insurance is its principal business. Indeed, it does not appear that any substantial part of its transactions was not connected with or the outgrowth of insurance. The admitted facts clearly show that in the tax years above mentioned respondent was an 'insurance company' within the meaning of that phrase as commonly understood and as used in the Revenue Acts of 1921 and 1924. It was taxable under section 246 and therefore exempt from capital stock taxes.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 1000 of the Act of 1921 is the same as section 700 of the Act of 1924.

C., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question for decision is whether the sum of $261,811.42 paid to the state of California for inheritance taxes should have been deducted from the gross estate of the decedent before calculating the federal estate tax under the Revenue Act of 1916 (39 Stat. 756), as amended.\n On April 25, 1917, Rosa von Zimmermann died in California, a German alien enemy, leaving a net estate valued at $1,927,610.88. Her will was probated there. Her executors, who were citizens of that state, paid in 1918 to the United States an estate tax of $144,889.78, and to California for inheritance taxes the sum of $261,811.42. In the same year, the Alien Property Custodian served notice and demand upon the executors to convey and pay over to him all interest, in the estate, of the residuary legatees, who were likewise German alien enemies. In 1922, the executors, having rendered a final account and turned over the residue of the estate to the Alien Property Custodian, were discharged. After March 4, 1923, the effective date of the Winslow Act, 42 Stat. 1511, c. 285, a claim for refund was filed with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue by Barnim Kombst and the other resid- \n\n[286 U.S. 424, 426]\n\u00a0\n uary legatees. One of the grounds assigned was that the sum paid to California by way of an inheritance tax should have been deducted from the gross estate before calculating the federal estate tax. Subsequently, the Alien Property Custodian filed a like claim. The Commissioner rejected both claims. Thereupon, the legatees and the Alien Property Custodian brought this action in the Court of Claims to recover the amount alleged to have been wrongfully exacted. The court sustained their contention, and allowed recovery of $23,563.03, with interest. 52 F.(2d) 1030. Certiorari was granted, \n285 \nU.S. 532\n, 52 S. Ct. 407, 76 L. Ed. -. The government contends that the sum paid to California was not deductible; and that, even if it should have been deducted, there can be no recovery, because the claim for refund was not made within the period allowed by law.\n The Revenue Act of 1916,  203(a)(1), under which the excise tax is laid, does not allow as a deduction from the gross estate a sum paid by way of succession tax, as distinguished from an estate tax. \n1\n Leach v.

Wm. C. Wolfe, of Orangeburg, S. C., and John P. Grace, of Charleston, S. C., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Section 211 of the Criminal Code (18 USCA  334) declares unmailable 'every obscene, lewd, or lascivious, and every filthy book, pamphlet, picture, paper, letter, writing, print, or other publication of an indecent character'; and provides that 'whoever shall knowingly deposit, or cause to be deposited, for mailing or delivery' any such unmailable matter 'shall be fined not more than $5,000, or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.'\n Under this statute Limehouse was indicted in the federal court for Eastern South Carolina. The indictment contained thirty counts, each charging the unlawful deposit of 'a certain filthy letter and writing in a certain post office.' Each set forth verbatim a separate letter. The letters contained much foul language; charged the addressees or persons associated with them with sexual immorality, and in some cases charged miscegenation and similar practices. They were coarse, vulgar, disgusting, indecent; and unquestionably filthy within the popular meaning of that term. On the ground that no letter was obscene, lewd, or lascivious within the meaning given to those terms in Swearingen v. United States, \n161 \nU.S. 446\n, 16 S. Ct. 562, the District Court sustained a demurrer and quashed the indictment. The case is here by direct appeal under the Criminal Appeals Act, as amended. \n1\n We are of opinion that the judgment should be reversed. \n\n[285 U.S. 424, 426]\n\u00a0\n In Swearingen v. United States, decided in 1896, the indictment was under Revised Statutes,  3893 (18 USCA  334), which made unmailable only 'obscene, lewd, or lascivious' matter. This Court, being of opinion that those words should be given the meaning attributed to them at common law in prosecutions for criminal libel, directed that the judgment of conviction be reversed, because the language used was not 'calculated to corrupt and debauch the minds and morals of those into whose hands it might fall' and induce sexual immorality. 161 U. S. at page 451, 16 S. Ct. 562, 564. The indictment here under review contains no reference to 'obscene, lewd, or lascivious.' The charge is of depositing 'a certain filthy letter.' It is brought under the amendment to section 3893 of the Revised Statutes made by section 211 of the Criminal Code, Act of March 4, 1909, c. 321, 35 Stat. 1088, 1129 (18 USCA  334), which inserted the words, 'and every filthy.' Now the clause reads 'every obscene, lewd, or lascivious, and every filthy, book, ... letter.'\n The lower court failed to recognize that the amendment introduced, not merely a word, but a phrase. Disregarding the collocation of the words, it treated the amended clause as if it had read 'obscene, lewd, lascivious, or filthy'; and then, applying the doctrine of noscitur a sociis, gave to 'filthy' the meaning attributed in the Swearingen Case to the words 'obscene, lewd, or lascivious.' Thus, the court emptied the amendment of all meaning. We think that it is a more natural reading of the clause to hold that by the amendment Congress added a new class of unmailable matter- the filthy. \n2\n The let- \n\n[285 U.S. 424, 427]\n\u00a0\n ters here in question plainly relate to sexual matters. We have no occasion to consider whether filthy letters of a different character fall within the prohibition of the Act.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS thinks the judgment should be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Acts of March 2, 1907, c. 2564, 34 Stat. 1246 (18 USCA  682); February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 936, 938 (28 USCA  225, 345); January 31, 1928, c. 14, 45 Stat. 54 (28 USCA  861a, 861b); and April 26, 1928, c. 440, 45 Stat. 466 (28 USCA  861b). \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] For the legislative history of the amendment, see Senate Doc.

Shea, of Boston, Mass., on the brief), for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellee was indicted under section 1114(b) of the Revenue Act of 1926, 1 the charge being attempts to evade taxes for 1926 and 1927 by falsely understating taxable income. In bar of the action he pleaded that the face of the indictment showed the offenses were committed more than three years prior to the return of a true bill. The plea was sustained and the indictment quashed, on the ground that the period of limitations is fixed by the first clause of section 1110(a) of the act2, and not, as the appellant contended, in the proviso thereof. The basis of this ruling was that the offense defined by use of the words 'evade or defeat' does not involve defrauding, or attempting to defraud, within the intent of the proviso.\n The appellant contends fraud is implicit in the concept of evading or defeating; and asserts that attempts to obstruct or defeat the lawful functions of any department of the government (Haas v. Henkel, \n216 U.S. 462\n, 479-480, 30 S. Ct. 249, 17 Ann. Cas. 1112), or to cheat it out of money to which it is entitled \n\n[285 U.S. 518, 521]\n\u00a0\n (Capone v. United States (C. C. A.) 51 F.(2d) 609, 615, 76 A. L. R. 1534) are attempts to defraud the United States, if accompanied by deceit, craft, trickery, or other dishonest methods or schemes, Hammerschmidt v. United States, \n265 \nU.S. 182, 188\n, 44 S. Ct. 511. Any effort to defeat or evade a tax is said to be tantamount to and to possess every element of an attempt to defraud the taxing body.\n We are required to ascertain the intent of Congress from the language used and to determine what cases the proviso intended to except from the general statute of limitations applicable to all offenses against the internal revenue laws. Section 1114(a), 26 USCA  1265, makes willful failure to pay taxes, to make return, to keep necessary records, or to supply requisite information, a misdemeanor; and section 1114(c), 26 USCA  1267 provides that willfully aiding, assisting, procuring, counselling, or advising preparation or presentation of a false or fraudulent return, affidavit, claim, or document shall be a felony. Save for that under consideration, these are the only sections in the Revenue Act of 1926 defining offenses against the income tax law. There are, however, numerous statutes expressly making intent to defraud an element of a specified offense against the revenue laws. \n3\n Under these, an indictment failing to aver that intent would be defective; but under section 1114(b) such an averment would be surplusage, for it would be sufficient to plead and prove a willful attempt to evade or defeat. Compare United States v. Noveck, \n271 \nU.S. 201, 203\n, 46 S. Ct. 476, 477.\n As said in the Noveck Case, statutes will not be read as creating crimes or classes of crimes unless clearly so intended, and obviously we are here concerned with one meant only to fix periods of limitation. Moreover, the concluding clause of the section, though denominated a proviso, is an excepting clause, and therefore to be nar- \n\n[285 U.S. 518, 522]\n\u00a0\n rowly construed. United States v. McElvain, \n272 \nU.S. 633, 639\n, 47 S. Ct. 219. And, as the section has to do with statutory crimes, it is to be liberally interpreted in favor of repose, and ought not to be extended by construction to embrace so-called frauds not so denominated by the statutes creating offenses. United States v. Hirsch, \n100 U.S. 33\n; United States v. Rabinowich, \n238 U.S. 78\n, 87-88, 35 S. Ct. 682; United States v. Noveck, supra; United States v. McElvain, supra.

The case comes here by appeal under the provisions of section 238 of the Judicial Code, as amended by the Act of February 13, 1925, U.S. Code title 28,  345 (28 USCA  345); U.S. Code title 18,  682 (18 USCA  682).\n First. The contention seems to be that the proviso makes it necessary to read section 8 as substantively prohibiting unreasonable variations in the weight, measure, or numerical count of the quantity and contents of any package from that marked on the outside of the package, and that the test thereby indicated is so indefinite and uncertain that it fails to fix any ascertainable standard of guilt, or afford a valid definition of a crime.

Co., \n269 \nU.S. 385\n, 46 S.Ct. 126, and other decisions of this Court are relied upon.\n We are of opinion that the construction thus sought to be put upon the act cannot be sustained; and therefore, other considerations aside, the cases cited do not apply. The substantive requirement is that the quantity of the contents shall be plainly and conspicuously marked in terms of weight, etc. We construe the proviso simply as giving administrative authority to the Secretaries of the Treasury, Agriculture, Commerce, and Labor to make rules and regulations permitting reasonable variations from the hard and fast rule of the act and establishing tolerances and exemptions as to small packages, in accordance with section 3 thereof. \n1\n This construction avoids the doubt which otherwise might arise as to the constitutional point, and therefore is to be adopted if reasonably possible.

We find nothing in the terms of the act to require a division of the proviso so that the power of regulation will apply to the establishment of tolerances and exemptions, but not to reasonable variations. We think both are included. As to this, there would be no room for doubt if it were not for the presence of a comma after the word 'permitted,' or the absence of one after the word 'established.' Inserting the latter, the proviso would read, 'That reasonable variations shall be permitted, and tolerances and also exemptions as to small packages shall be established, by rules and regulations. ...' Punctuation marks are no part of an act. To determine the intent of the law, the court, in construing a statute, will disregard the punctua- \n\n[287 U.S. 77, 83]\n\u00a0\n tion, or will repunctuate, if that be necessary, in order to arrive at the natural meaning of the words employed.

Voelker (C.C.A.) 129 F. 522, 526, 527, 70 L.R.A. 264.\n Our attention is called to the fact that the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, in reporting the bill which afterwards became the act in question (H.R. 850, 62d Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 2-4), agreed with the view that the authority to make rules and regulations was confined to the establishment of tolerances and exemptions, and that the Senate Committee on Manufactures (S.R. 1216, 62d Cong., 3d Sess., pp. 2-4) reported to the same effect. In proper cases, such reports are given consideration in determining the meaning of a statute, but only where that meaning is doubtful. They cannot be resorted to for the purpose of construing a statute contrary to the natural import of its terms. Railroad Commission of Wisconsin v. C., B. & Q.R.R.

There can be no construction where there is nothing to construe.' The same rule is recognized by the English courts. In King v. Commissioners, 5 A. & E. 804, 816, Lord Denman, applying the rule, said that the court was constrained to give the words of a private act then under consideration an effect which probably was 'never contemplated by those who \n\n[287 U.S. 77, 84]\n\u00a0\n obtained the act, and very probably not intended by the Legislature which enacted it. But our duty is to look to the language employed, and construe it in its natural and obvious sense.' See, also, United States v. Lexington Mill Co., \n232 \nU.S. 399, 409\n, 34 S.Ct. 337, L.R.A. 1915B, 774; Caminetti v. United States, \n242 \nU.S. 470, 485\n, 37 S.Ct. 192, L.R.A. 1917F, 502, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 1168\n\n\n Moreover, the practical and long-continued construction of the executive departments charged with the administration of the act and with the duty of making the rules and regulations therein provided for has been in accordance with the view we have expressed as to the meaning of the section under consideration. The rules and regulations, as amended on May 11, 1914, deal with the entire subject in detail under the recital, '(i) The following tolerances and variations (italics supplied) from the quantity of the contents marked on the package shall be allowed: ...' Then follows an enumeration of discrepancies due to errors in weighing which occur in packing conducted in compliance with good commercial practice; due to differences in capacity of bottles and similar containers, resulting from unavoidable difficulties in manufacture, etc.; or in weight due to atmospheric differences in various places, etc. These regulations, which cover variations as well as tolerances and exemptions, have been in force for a period of more than eighteen years, with the silent acquiescence of Congress. If the meaning of the statutory words was doubtful, so as to call for a resort to extrinsic aid in an effort to reach a proper construction of them, we should hesitate to accept the committee reports in preference to this contemporaneous and long-continued practical construction of the act on the part of those charged with its administration. Such a construction, in cases of doubtful meaning, is accepted unless there are cogent and persuasive reasons for rejecting it. See, for example, United States v. Johnston, \n124 \nU.S. 236, 253\n, 8 S.Ct. 446. \n\n[287 U.S. 77, 85]\n\u00a0\n Second. The contention that the act contravenes the provisions of the Constitution with respect to the separation of the governmental powers is without merit. That the legislative power of Congress cannot be delegated is, of course, clear. But Congress may declare its will, and, after fixing a primary standard, devolve upon administrative officers the 'power to fill up the details' by prescribing administrative rules and regulations. That the authority conferred by the act now under review in this respect does not transcend the power of Congress is not open to reasonable dispute. The effect of the provision assailed is to define an offense, but with directions to those charged with the administration of the act to make supplementary rules and regulations allowing reasonable variations, tolerances, and exemptions, which, because of their variety and need of detailed statement, it was impracticable for Congress to prescribe. The effect of the proviso is evident and legitimate, namely, to prevent the embarrassment and hardship which might result from a too literal and minute enforcement of the act, without at the same time offending against its purposes. The proviso does not delegate legislative power, but confers administrative functions entirely valid within principles established by numerous decisions of this court, of which the following may be cited as examples: Buttfield v. Stranahan, \n192 \nU.S. 470, 496\n, 24 S.Ct. 349; Plymouth Coal Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n232 \nU.S. 531, 542\n, 34 S.Ct. 359; United States v. Grimaud, \n220 \nU.S. 506\n, 31 S.Ct. 480, and authorities reviewed.\n Judgment reversed.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, Mr. Justice STONE, and Mr. Justice CARDOZO concur in the result on the ground that the statute, as punctuated, reads as its legislative history shows Congress intended it to read, and that, so read, it is sufficiently definite to satisfy constitutional requirements. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 3 provides that the Secretaries named 'shall make uniform rules and regulations for carrying out the provisions ... of this title . ...' 21 USCA  3. \n\n\n\n\n","166":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v.

The case was heard upon the petition and answer. On December 22, 1931, the trial court entered judgment denying the petition. An appeal was promptly taken to the Court of Appeals of the District. That court \n\n[286 U.S. 6, 27]\n\u00a0\n certified a question pursuant to section 239 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  346). This Court granted joint motions of the parties to bring up the entire record and to advance the cause.\n On December 3, 1930, the President of the United States transmitted to the Senate the nomination of George Otis Smith to be a member of the Federal Power Commission for a term expiring June 22, 1935. On December 20, 1930, the Senate, in open executive session, by a vote of 38 to 22, with 35 Senators not voting, advised and consented to the appointment of Smith to the office for which he had been nominated. On the same day, the Senate ordered that the resolution of confirmation be forwarded to the President. 1 This order was entered late in the evening of Saturday, December 20th; and still later on the same day the Senate adjourned to January 5, 1931. On Monday, December 22, 1930, the Secretary of the Senate notified the President of the United States of the resolution of confirmation, the communication being delivered by the official messenger of the Senate. \n2\n Subsequently, \n\n[286 U.S. 6, 28]\n\u00a0\n and on the same day, the President signed and, through the Department of State, delivered to Smith a commission purporting to appoint him a member of the Federal Power Commission and designating him as chairman thereof. Smith then, on the same day, took the oath of office and undertook forthwith to discharge the duties of a commissioner.\n On January 5, 1931, which was the next day of actual executive session of the Senate after the date of confirmation, a motion to reconsider the nomination of Smith was duly made by a Senator who had voted to confirm it, and also a motion to request the President to return the resolution of confirmation which had passed into his possession. Both motions were adopted and the President was notified in due course. On January 10, 1931, the President informed the Senate by a message in writing that he had theretofore appointed Smith to the office in question, after receiving formal notice of confirmation, and that, for this reason, he refused to accede to the Senate's request. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[286 U.S. 6, 29]\n\u00a0\n Thereafter, a motion was made and adopted in the Senate directing the Executive Clerk to place on the Executive Calendar the 'name and nomination of the said George Otis Smith.' Subsequently, on February 4, 1931, the President pro tempore of the Senate put to the Senate the question of advice and consent to the appointment of Smith, and a majority of the Senators voted in the negative. Notification of this action was sent to the President. On the following day, February 5, 1931, the Senate by resolution requested the district attorney of the District of Columbia to institute in its Supreme Court proceedings in quo warranto to test Smith's right to hold office; and, \n\n[286 U.S. 6, 30]\n\u00a0\n pursuant to that request, this proceeding was filed on May 4, 1931. As the officials of the Department of Justice were committed by an opinion of the Attorney General (36 Op. Attys. Gen. 382) to a conclusion adverse to the position taken by the Senate, consent to the institution of the proceeding was conditioned upon the Senate's employing its own counsel and upon the understanding that officials of the Department of Justice would not support the petitioner.\n No fact is in dispute. The sole question presented is one of law. Did the Senate have the power, on the next day of executive session, to reconsider its vote advising and consenting to the appointment of George Otis Smith, although meanwhile, pursuant to its order, the resolution of consent had been communicated to the President, and thereupon the commission had issued, Smith had taken the oath of office and had entered upon the discharge of his duties? The answer to this question depends primarily upon the applicable Senate rules. These rules are numbers XXXVIII and XXXIX. \n4\n The pivotal provisions are paragraphs 3 and 4 of Rule XXXVIII, which read:\n'3. When a nomination is confirmed or rejected, any Senator voting in the majority may move for a reconsideration on the same day on which the vote was taken, or on either of the next two days of actual executive session of \n\n[286 U.S. 6, 31]\n\u00a0\n the Senate; but if a notification of the confirmation or rejection of a nomination shall have been sent to the President before the expiration of the time within which a motion to reconsider may be made, the motion to reconsider shall be accompanied by a motion to request the President to return such notification to the Senate. Any motion to reconsider the vote on a nomination may be laid on the table without prejudice to the nomination, and shall be a final disposition of such motion.'\n\n'4. Nomination confirmed or rejected by the Senate shall not be returned by the Secretary to the President until the expiration of the time limited for making a motion to reconsider the same, or while a motion to reconsider is pending unless otherwise ordered by the Senate.'\n\n The contention on behalf of the Senate is that it did not advise and consent to the appointment of George Otis Smith to the office of member of the Federal Power Commission, because, by action duly and regularly taken upon reconsideration in accordance with its standing rules, it refused such consent, and gave to the President formal notice of its refusal.\n The argument is that the action of the Senate in assenting to the nomination of Smith on December 20, 1930, and ordering that the President be notified, was taken subject to its rules and had only the effect provided for by them; that the rules empowered the Senate, in plain and unambiguous terms, to entertain, at any time prior to the expiration of the next two days of actual executive session, a motion to reconsider its vote advising and consenting to the appointment, although it had previously ordered a copy of the resolution of consent to be forwarded forthwith to the President; that the Senate's action cannot be held to be final so long as it retained the right to reconsider; that the Senate did not by its order of notification waive its right to reconsider or intend that the President should forthwith commission Smith; that the \n\n[286 U.S. 6, 32]\n\u00a0\n rules did not make the right of reconsideration dependent upon compliance by the President with its request that the resolution of consent be returned; that the rules were binding upon the President and all other persons dealing with the Senate in this matter; that, as the President was charged with knowledge of the rules, his signing of the commission prior to the expiration of the period within which the Senate might entertain a motion to reconsider had no conclusive legal effect; and that the nominee who had not been legally confirmed could not by his own acts in accepting the commission, taking an oath of office, and beginning the discharge of his duties, vest himself with any legal rights.\n Counsel for the Senate assert that a survey of the historical development of the rules of the Senate relating to reconsideration confirms its present interpretation of the rules; and that the interpretation is further confirmed by the multitudinous instances appearing in the Executive Journal of the Senate in which the President, at the Senate's request, returned resolutions, both of confirmation and of rejection. \n5\n We are of opinion that the Senate's contention is unsound. \n\n[286 U.S. 6, 33]\n\u00a0\n First. The question primarily at issue relates to the construction of the applicable rules, not to their constitutionality. Article 1,  5, cl. 2, of the Constitution provides that 'each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings.' In the United States v. Ballin, \n144 \nU.S. 1, 5\n, 12 S. Ct. 507, 509, the Court said: 'Neither do the advantages or disadvantages, the wisdom or folly, of ... a rule present any matters for judicial consideration. With the courts the question is only one of power. The constitution empowers each house to determine its rules of proceedings. It may not by its rules ignore constitutional restraints or violate fundamental rights, and there should be a reasonable relation between the mode or method of proceeding established by the rule and the result which is sought to be attained. But within these limitations all matters of method are open to the determination of the house, and it is no impeachment of the rule to say that some other way would be better, more accurate, or even more just.' Whether, if the rules of the Senate had in terms reserved power to reconsider a vote of advice and consent under the circumstances here presented, such reservation would be effective as against the President's action, need not be considered here.\n As the construction to be given to the rules affects persons other than members of the Senate, the question presented is of necessity a judicial one. Smith asserts that he was duly appointed to office, in the manner prescribed by the Constitution. See Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch, 137, 155, 156. The Senate disputes the claim. In deciding the issue, the Court must give great weight to the Senate's present construction of its own rules; but so far, at least, as that construction was arrived at subsequent to the events in controversy, we are not concluded by it.\n Second. Obviously, paragraph 3 of Senate Rule XXXVIII contemplates circumstances under which the Senate may still reconsider a vote confirming or rejecting \n\n[286 U.S. 6, 34]\n\u00a0\n a nomination, although notification of its original action has already been sent to the President. Otherwise, the provision for a motion to request the return of a resolution would be meaningless. But paragraph 4 of the same rule contemplates that normally such notification shall be withheld, until the expiration of the time limited for making a motion to reconsider, and, if a motion be made, until the disposition thereof; for it declares that notification shall be so withheld 'unless otherwise ordered by the Senate.' In this case the Senate did so order otherwise; and the question is as to the meaning and effect of this special procedure.\n Smith urges that upon receipt of a resolution of advice and consent, final upon its face, the President is authorized to complete the appointment; and that a request to return the resolution can have no effect unless it is received prior to the signing of the commission; that, if this were not true, the notification would not authorize the President to do anything until the expiration of the reconsideration period, and hence would be futile; or it would purport to authorize him to make an appointment defeasible upon reconsideration and reversal of the Senate's action, and hence would violate a constitutional requirement of unconditional assent. We do not understand counsel for the appellant to urge that an appointment so defeasible may be made, and we have, therefore, no occasion to consider the constitutional objections, advanced on Smith's behalf, to a construction permitting such action. Nor need we consider whether the President might decline to accede to a request to return the Senate's resolution if he received it before making the appointment. The question at issue is whether, under the Senate's rules, an order of notification empowers the President to make a final and indefeasible appointment, if he acts before notice of reconsideration; or whether, \n\n[286 U.S. 6, 35]\n\u00a0\n despite the notification, he is powerless to complete the appointment until two days of executive session shall have passed without the entry of a motion to reconsider.\n Third. The natural meaning of an order of notification to the President is that the Senate consents that the appointment be forthwith completed, and that the appointee take office. This is the meaning which, under the rules, a resolution bears when it is sent in normal course after the expiration of the period for reconsideration. Notification before that time is an exceptional procedure, which may be adopted only by unanimous consent of the Senate. \n6\n We think it a strained and unnatural construction to say that such extraordinary, expedited, notification signifies less than final action, or bears a different meaning than notification sent in normal course pursuant to the rules.\n It is essential to the orderly conduct of public business that formality be observed in the relations between different branches of the government charged with concurrent duties; and that each branch be able to rely upon definite and formal notice of action by another. \n7\n The construction urged by the Senate would prevent the President from proceeding in any case upon notification of advice and consent, without first determining through unofficial \n\n[286 U.S. 6, 36]\n\u00a0\n channels whether the resolution had been forwarded in compliance with an order of immediate notification or by the Secretary in the ordinary course of business; for the resolution itself bears only the date of its adoption. If the President determined that the resolution had been sent within the time limited for making a motion to reconsider, he would have then to inform himself when that period expired. If the motion were made, he would be put upon notice of it by receipt of a request to return the resolution. But, under the view urged by the Senate, that reconsideration may proceed, even though the resolution be not returned, he would receive no formal advice as to the disposition of the motion, save in the case of a final vote of rejection or confirmation. \n8\n The uncertainty and confusion which would be engendered by such a construction repel its adoption.\n The Senate has offered no adequate explanation of the meaning of an order of immediate notification, if it has not the meaning which Smith contends should be attached to it. Its counsel argues that the practice of ordering such notification developed at a time when the Senate passed upon nominations in closed session; and that the order may have been simply a means of furnishing the President with information, not available through public channels, concerning the probable attitude of the chamber prior to final action. It is suggested that the President might thereby be enabled to muster support for a nominee at first rejected, or to withdraw the nomination before final rejection. But the explanation has no application to a notification of a favorable vote. Nor is it \n\n[286 U.S. 6, 37]\n\u00a0\n credible that the Senate by unanimous vote would adopt a procedure designed merely to permit the exertion of influence upon a majority to change a decision already made. The construction urged is a labored one. It should not be adopted unless plainly required by the history of the rules and by the meaning which the Senate and the Executive Department in practice have given them.\n Fourth. We find nothing in the history of the rules which lends support to the contention of the Senate; and much in their history to the contrary. The present rules relating to the reconsideration of votes confirming or rejecting nominations are substantially those of March 25, 1868. The earlier history is this: Prior to April 6, 1867, no rule had dealt specifically with reconsideration of votes concerning nominations. A resolution adopted February 25, 1790, provided generally that, 'when a question has been once made and carried in the affirmative or negative, it shall be in order for any member of the majority to move for a reconsideration of it.' In 1806, two limitations were attached to this provision: First, that, 'no motion for the reconsideration of any vote shall be in order, after a bill. Resolution, message, report, amendment, or motion, upon which the vote was taken, shall have gone out of the possession of the Senate, nor after the usual message shall have been sent from the Senate, announcing their decision'; and, second, that no such motion shall be in order 'unless made on the same day in which the vote was taken, or within the three next days of actual session of the Senate thereafter.' \n9\n In 1818, a resolution was adopted 'that in future, all nominations approved, or definitively acted on by the Senate, be by the Secretary returned to the President of the United States, from day \n\n[286 U.S. 6, 38]\n\u00a0\n to day, as such proceedings may occur, any rule or usage to the contrary notwithstanding.'\n These rules remained in force until 1867.10 Under them, the Senate decided by unanimous vote in 1830, in the earliest of the precedents cited by the parties, that it was without power to reconsider its rejection of the nomination of Isaac Hill as Second Comptroller of the Treasury, 'because the President had been notified.' No request appears to have been made in that case for the return of the resolution of rejection. Subsequently, however, it became the practice for the President, upon request, to return resolutions of rejection or confirmation, as a matter of comity; and the Senate thereupon reconsidered its action, despite the question under its rules whether reconsideration was in order. Between 1830, the time of Hill's case, and April 5, 1867, about 160 such \n\n[286 U.S. 6, 39]\n\u00a0\n cases occurred. But several occurring at the close of the period show clearly the limits of the practice. In two cases, the President declined to return the resolution on the ground that the commission had already issued; and the Senate acceded to the refusal. \n11\n In another, the resolution was returned, but with the statement that a commission had issued; and the Senate appears to have taken no further action. \n12\n And on April 3, 1867, in the case of A. C. Fisk the Senate upheld a decision of the chair that a motion to reconsider a vote of confirmation was out \n\n[286 U.S. 6, 40]\n\u00a0\n of order after the President had been notified, and before the resolution had been returned.\n Three days thereafter decisive changes were made in the rules relating both to reconsideration and to notification of the President. \n13\n On April 6, 1867, the rule concerning reconsideration was modified so as to except specifically motions to reconsider votes upon a nomination from the general prohibition of any such motion where the paper announcing the Senate's decision had gone out of its possession; and the present provision was added, that 'a motion to reconsider a vote upon a nomination shall always, if the resolution announcing the decision of the Senate has been sent to the President, be accompanied by a motion requesting the President to return the same to the Senate.' At the same time, it was provided that 'all nominations approved or definitely acted on by the Senate shall be returned by the Secretary on the next day after such action is had, unless otherwise ordered by the Senate.'\n These changes in the rules, not only met the situation which had arisen in Fisk's case, but gave explicit sanction to the long-standing practice of requesting the President to return resolutions upon nominations and thereafter reconsidering them. Counsel for the Senate argue that, in addition, they completely reversed the practice theretofore established in respect to reconsideration after notification of the President; that, by divorcing the period for reconsideration from the normal time for notifying the President, they showed an intention that the power to reconsider should be unaffected by the transmittal of no- \n\n[286 U.S. 6, 41]\n\u00a0\n tification or by the President's action thereon. In a case occurring shortly after the new rules were adopted, however, the Senate Committee on the Judiciary clearly showed its understanding that no such change had taken place. Noah L. Jeffries was nominated for Register of the Treasury and confirmed and the President was notified. To a subsequent request for the return of the resolution the President replied that a commission had already issued. The Committee on the Judiciary, to which the matter was referred, expressed the opinion that the Senate had power to reconsider its vote, but gave as its reason that the request to return the resolution had in fact been received before the commission was signed. \n14\n\u00a0\n\n[286 U.S. 6, 42]\n\u00a0\n The basis for the argument drawn from the rules of 1867, however, was clearly destroyed a year later, when the rule for notification was further altered, and given virtually its present form. The new rule, adopted March 25, 1868, provided that 'nominations approved or definitely acted on by the Senate shall not be returned by the Secretary of the Senate to the President until the expiration of the time limited for making a motion to reconsider, or while a motion to reconsider is pending, unless otherwise ordered by the Senate.' No material changes have since been made, either in this rule or in that respecting reconsideration. \n15\n\u00a0\n\n[286 U.S. 6, 43]\n\u00a0\n Read in the light of the preceding rules and the practice under them, the meaning of the rules thus established is, in our opinion, free from doubt. Prior to 1867, it had been continuously recognized that the President was authorized to commission a nominee upon receiving notification of the advice and consent of the Senate, and that the signing of a commission cut short the power of reconsideration. The Senate so concedes. No explicit change in this respect was made either in the rules of 1867 or of 1868. The inference that no change was intended is strengthened by the fact that under the latter rules, for the first time, the sending of notification ordinarily coincided with the lapse of power in the Senate to reconsider its action, under any circumstances. The proviso, 'unless otherwise ordered by the Senate,' made possible the sending of notification before the expiration of the period provided for reconsideration. But there is no indication that the Senate intended thereby to introduce a complete departure from past practice. The natural inference is to the contrary. The proviso for immediate notification must be read in connection with the clause permitting motions to request the return of a resolution, which would be in order only in cases in which the Senate had acted under the proviso. A motion to request the return of a resolution was a familiar device, employed by the Senate on repeated occasions. There is no reason to suppose that such a motion was now intended to have a different effect than that which, by common understanding, it had had in the past. The common understanding had been that a motion to request the return of a resolution was without effect if the President before receiving it had completed the appointment. \n\n[286 U.S. 6, 44]\n\u00a0\n Fifth. This construction of the rules is confirmed by the precedents in the Senate arising since 1868. In all cases in which no commission had yet issued, the Executive has honored the request of the Senate for a return of its resolution, in accordance with the invariable practice from the beginning. 16 In the only instances, prior to the case at bar, in which the Senate had occasion to consider the effect, under the present rules, of the signing of the commission before receipt of its request, it indicated an understanding that the power to reconsider was gone. \n17\n\u00a0\n\n[286 U.S. 6, 45]\n\u00a0\n In those two cases the President wrote informing the Senate of the issuance of a commission, and no further action was taken by it.\n Attention is called, however, to other cases in which it is contended that the President returned the resolution in spite of the intervening signing of a commission, and that the Senate reconsidered its action. Sixteen cases arising after 1868 are cited. \n18\n The value of most of these \n\n[286 U.S. 6, 46]\n\u00a0\n cases as precedents is questioned by Smith, and also by the Attorney General and the Solicitor General in the brief filed by them amici curiae. In none of the cases it there any indication that the Senate was informed of the fact of the signing of the commission, if in fact the commission was signed. Therefore, none of those cases furnish an authoritative construction by the Senate of its own rules made prior to the events culminating in the present litigation. They amount, at most, only to evidence of the construction placed upon the rules by the Executive Department. The weight of many of the cases, as such evidence, is further lessened by the circumstance that the records do not disclose beyond dispute that a commission had actually been signed by the President before receipt of the Senate's request for return of its resolution. \n19\n All the cases but one arose between 1870\n\n\n\n\n[286 U.S. 6, 47]\n\u00a0\n and 1889, nine of them in the administrations of President Grant and President Hayes. Each of these Presidents on occasion refused to accede to similar requests on the ground that a commission had already been issued. \n 20\n\u00a0\n\n Perhaps the most satisfactory explanation of the instance cited on behalf of the Senate is that the Executive Department has not always treated an appointment as complete upon the mere signing of a commission. 21 Compare Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch, 137; United States v. Le Baron, 19 How. 73, 78. Even in the view most favorable to the Senate's contention they fall far short of \n\n[286 U.S. 6, 48]\n\u00a0\n clear recognition of the power, never heretofore asserted by the Senate itself, to reconsider a vote of confirmation, after an appointee has actually assumed office and entered upon the discharge of his duties. We are unable to regard any of the cases as of sufficient weight to overcome the natural meaning of the causes. \n22\n\u00a0\n\n Sixth. To place upon the standing rules of the Senate a construction different from that adopted by the Senate itself when the present case was under debate is a serious and delicate exercise of judicial power. The Constitution commits to the Senate the power to make its own rules; and it is not the function of the Court to say that another rule would be better. A rule designed to insure due deliberation in the performance of the vital function of advising and consenting to nominations for public office, moreover, should receive from the Court the most sympathetic consideration. But the reasons, above stated, against the Senate's construction seem to us compelling. We are confirmed in the view we have taken by the fact that, since the attempted reconsideration of Smith's confirmation, the Senate itself seems uniformly to have treated the ordering of immediate notification to the Pres- \n\n[286 U.S. 6, 49]\n\u00a0\n ident as tantamount to authorizing him to proceed to perfect the appointment. \n23\n\u00a0\n\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of the District is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The terms of the resolution were: 'Resolved, That the Senate advise and consent to the appointment of the above named person to the office named agreeably to his said nomination.' Upon the announcement of the vote, the President pro tempore stated: 'The Senate advises and consents to the nomination and the President will be notified.' No objection being made, or further proceedings having been had, in the Senate with reference to said consent or the notification thereof, the following order was entered by the Secretary of the Senate in usual course upon the Executive Journal of the Senate for January 20, 1930: 'Ordered, that the foregoing resolution of confirmation be forwarded to the President of the United States.'\n Further action being had in Executive Session on the same day with reference to other nominations, there was entered on the Journal for that day the following order: 'Ordered, that all resolutions of confirmation this day agreed to be forwarded forthwith to the President of the United States.' \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The terms of the communication were: 'In executive session, Senate of the United States, Saturday, December 20, 1930. Resolved, that the Senate advise and consent to the appointment of the following-named persons to the offices named agreeably to their respective nominations:\n Federal Power Commission,\n'George Otis Smith, to be a member for the term expiring June 22, 1935.\n\n'Frank R. McNinch, to be a member for the term expiring June 22, 1934.\n\n'Marcel Garsaud, to be a member for the term expiring June 22, 1932.\n\n'Attest:\n\n'(Signed) Edwin P. Thayer, Secretary.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The message of the President read as follows:\n'To the Senate of the United States:\n\n'I am in receipt of the resolution of the Senate dated January 5, 1931-\n\n\"That the President of the United States be respectfully requested to return to the Senate the resolution advising and consenting to the appointment of George Otis Smith to be a member of the Federal Power Commission, which was agreed to on Saturday, December 20, 1930.'\n\n'I have similar resolution in respect to the appointment of Messrs. Claude L. Draper and Col. Marcel Garsaud.\n\n'On December 20, 1930, I received the usual attested resolution of the Senate, signed by the Seretary of the Senate, as follows:\n\n'Resolved, That the Senate advise and consent to the appointment of the following-named person to the office named agreeably to his nomination:\n\n'Federal Power Commission.\n\n'George Otis Smith, to be a member of the Federal Power Commission.\n\n'I have similar resolution in respect to Colonel Garsaud and Mr. Draper.\n\n'I am advised that these appointments were constitutionally made, with the consent of the Senate formally communicated to me, and that the return of the documents by me and reconsideration by the Senate would be ineffective to disturb the appointees in their offices. I cannot admit the power in the Senate to encroach upon the Executive functions by removal of a duly appointed executive officer under the guise of reconsideration of his nomination.\n\n'I regret that I must refuse to accede to the requests.\n\n'Herbert Hoover.\n\n'The White House, January 10, 1931.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Rule XXXIX provides: 'The President of the United States shall, from time to time, be furnished with an authenticated transcript of the executive records of the Senate, but no further extract from the Executive Journal shall be furnished by the Secretary, except by special order of the Senate; and no paper except original treaties transmitted to the Senate by the President of the United States, and finally acted upon by the Senate, shall be delivered from the office of the Secretary without an order of the Senate for that purpose.' The transcript of executive records relating to action by the Senate on nominations, furnished to the President under this rule, appears to consist only of copies of resolutions of confirmation or rejection. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] At the argument in the Supreme Court of the District, the parties joined in submitting a pamphlet containing a list of precedents for the reconsideration by the Senate of a vote confirming or rejecting a nomination after notification of the President of its action thereon; and this pamphlet was filed with the opinion of that court. Before entry of the order denying the petition, the parties, by stipulation, submitted additional information in regard to facts concerning nomination, confirmation, and the issuance of commissions in special cases, as shown by the Senate Executive Journal, by records of the Executive Offices of the White House, and in certain instances by departmental records. The stipulation was made part of the record in the case in the Supreme Court. In accordance with agreement of counsel, both the pamphlet and the stipulation were printed as one document by the clerk of the Court of Appeals.\n Unless otherwise indicated, the references in the succeeding footnotes are drawn from this material. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The practice of the Senate seems to be to treat the ordering of immediate notification to the President as, in effect, a suspension of the rules requiring unanimous consent. See, e. g., 74 Cong. Rec., pt. 2, pp. 1748-1749, 1937, 2066; Id., pt. 3, p. 3393; Cong. Rec., 72d Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 3782, 3881. \n[\nFootnote 7\n] Paragraph (2) of Senate Rule XIII, dealing with reconsideration of measures which have been sent to the House of Representatives, contains a provision for a motion to request to return of a measure similar to that of rule XXXVIII in respect to nominations. No precedent has been called to the Court's attention indicating that this provision would be construed as permitting the Senate to proceed to a reconsideration, even though the House declined to honor its request. \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Thus, the motion to reconsider might be withdrawn, or tabled, or, when put to a vote, might fail, in any of which events the nomination would stand as confirmed, without further notice to the President. If the motion prevailed, the nomination would stand as originally made by the President, but no notice of that fact would reach him unless it were again finally acted upon. \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] This rule was altered in 1820 by limiting the time for making a motion to reconsider to two days, and by striking out the words 'nor after the usual message shall have been sent from the Senate.' \n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] In 1792, on January 27, the Senate in executive session ordered, 'that the President of the United States be furnished with an authenticated transcript of the executive records of the Senate, from time to time'; and 'that no executive business, in future, be published by the Secretary of the Senate.' The latter provision remained in force until June 18, 1929, when it was resolved that all such business should be transacted in open session. The former provision is still in force, although modified by subsequent rules. See note 4, supra. The first such modification was the resolution of March 27, 1818, mentioned in the text, making special provision for immediate notification of the President concerning action upon nominations. On January 5, 1829, it was 'Resolved, That no paper, sent to the Senate by the President of the United States, or any executive officer, be returned, or delivered from the office of the Secretary, without an order of the Senate for that purpose.'\n On February 18, 1843, the Senate adopted the following resolution: 'That nominations made by the President to the Senate, and which are neither approved nor rejected during the session at which they are made, shall not be acted upon at any succeeding session without being again made by the President, and that such shall hereafter be the rule of the Senate.' This resolution is in substance incorporated in present rule XXXVIII, paragraph (6). \n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] These were the nominations of John H. Goddard, in 1864, for justice of the peace for Washington county, district of Columbia, and of Westley Frost, in 1867, as assessor of internal revenue for the Twenty- First district of Pennsylvania. In the Goddard Case, President Lincoln advised the Senate simply that the resolution was sent to the Department of State prior to receipt of the request for its return, and that 'a commission in accordance therewith (was) issued to Mr. Goddard on the same day, the appointment being thus perfected, and the resolution becoming a part of the permanent records of the Department of State.' No further proceedings are recorded in the Senate Executive Journal. In the Frost Case, after a similar reply, Senator Sherman offered a resolution that 'the Secretary of the Treasury be requested to recall the commission ... and that the President be requested to return to the Senate the action of the Senate in the appointment. ...' This resolution was rejected by a vote of 14 to 23. \n[\nFootnote 12\n] In the case of Joseph K. Barnes, nominated as Medical Inspector General in 1864, President Lincoln returned the resolution of confirmation, but 'respectfully called' the attention of the Senate to certain circumstances, including the execution and delivery of a commission before the making of the motion to reconsider. The author of the motion to reconsider asked, and had leave, to withdraw it.\n In the case of H. H. Smith, nominated as Secretary of the Territory of New Mexico, in 1867, President Johnson returned the resolution of confirmation, together with a report of the Secretary of State that 'the commission was made out and sent to the Executive Mansion for signature, and has not been returned.' It is not clear that a commission did, in fact, issue. No further proceedings are recorded in the Journal. \n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] These changes were apparently prompted by certain of the incidents just referred to. The resolution presented by Senator Sherman in the Frost Case, supra, note 11, was rejected on April 1, 1867. The amended rules were adopted, April 6, 1867, on motion of Senator Fessenden, who had appealed to the Senate from the decision of the chair in the Fisk Case. \n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] The President returned the resolution, with an accompanying report of the Secretary of the Treasury. The report stated 'that in the ordinary transaction of business the commission was issued on the 14th instant by the State Department, and was received at this Department on the 15th instant. General Jeffries had legally qualified and entered upon the discharge of the duties of his office prior to the receipt of the Senate resolution of the 14th instant, which, under these circumstances, is herewith returned.' The Committee on the Judiciary reported in part as follows: 'It ... appears that before Mr. Jeffries had been qualified or commissioned as required by law precedent to his entering upon the discharge of his functions under his permanent appointment the President of the United States, in whom the sole right of appointment, subject to the approval of the Senate, is vested by the Constitution, had received notice from the Senate that it had not finally acted upon the question of advising and consenting to the nomination, and withdrawing its resolution of assent to that appointment which had been transmitted to the President on the same day; and the committee are, therefore, of the opinion that the Senate may now lawfully reconsider its vote advising and consenting to the appointment if it shall see proper cause therefor. In this view of the case a majority of the committee were of opinion that it was inexpedient to enter upon an inquiry as to the matter of fact whether the issuing of the commission in this case and the qualification of the officer in question was hastened for any cause out of the usual course of business.' The only evidence concerning the subsequent history of the case is that during the same session, some five months later, Mr. Jeffries was nominated for another office, and rejected.\n In the case of Samuel M. Pollock, confirmed as brigadier general by brevet, on April 8, 1867, the President, on April 11, complied with a request to return the resolution sent him on April 10, and the Senate later rejected the nomination. The records of the War Department show April 11, 1867, as the date of a commission to Samuel M. Pollock. The entry is marked in red ink, 'Cancelled (rejected by the Senate).' Counsel for Smith, and the Attorney General and Solicitor General in their brief amici curiae, question whether a commission was in fact issued in this case. See note 19, infra. \n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] The phrase 'approved or definitely acted on' was changed in 1877 to 'confirmed or rejected,' and as so changed the rule still stands as paragraph 4 of rule XXXVIII. The rule on reconsideration was also given its present wording in 1877, when the material affecting nominations was taken out of the general provision relating to reconsideration in rule 20 and placed in a separate rule. The only changes of substance were the extension of the period for reconsideration to two days of 'actual executive session,' and the addition of the sentence: 'Any motion to reconsider the vote on a nomination may be laid on the table without prejudice to the nomination, and shall be a final disposition of such motion.' At the same time there was added, as a separate rule, the following, now paragraph 5 of rule XXXVIII: 'When the Senate shall adjourn or take a recess for more than thirty days, all motions to reconsider a vote upon a nomination which has been confirmed or rejected by the Senate, which shall be pending at the time of taking such adjournment or recess, shall fall; and the Secretary shall return all such nominations to the President as confirmed or rejected by the Senate, as the case may be.' \n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] The list of precedents incorporated in the record includes some 170 cases of nominatings, arising since March 25, 1868, in which motions to reconsider and request the return of the resolution were entered. In almost all the cases the Senate Executive Journal records affirmatively that the President complied with the request. In a few instances the fact of such return is not recorded, although the Senate proceeded with the reconsideration. In no case, except the two referred to in the text, does it affirmatively appear that the President declined to return the resolution. In no case since the earliest precedent listed, in 1830, is there a record of refusal to honor the request on any other ground than that a commission had been signed and the appointment perfected. \n[\nFootnote 17\n] In the case of J. C. S. Colby, nominated as consul at Chin Kiang, the Senate on December 17, 1874, voted to confirm and ordered that the President be notified forthwith. On December 21 a motion to reconsider was entered and the return of the resolution was requested. President Grant replied: 'Mr. Colby's commission was signed on the 17th day of December, and upon inquiry at the Department of State it was found that it had been forwarded to him by mail before the receipt of the resolution of recall.' There is no evidence of further action on the part of the Senate.\n Morris Marks was confirmed as collector of Interal Revenue for the District of Louisiana on June 6, 1878. On June 11 a motion to reconsider was entered and the return of the resolution requested. President Hayes wrote: 'In reply I would respectfully inform the Senate that upon the receipt of the notice of confirmation the commission of Mr. Marks was signed and delivered to him, on the 8th instant.' The Senate Executive Jornal records the fact that this message was read, but contains no reference to any subsequent proceedings in the case. \n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] The cases of Lewis A. Scott, originally confirmed on June 7, 1870, as postmaster at Lowville, N. Y.; John W. Bean, confirmed as first lieutenant on January 11, 1872; James F. Legate, confirmed as Governor of Washington Territory on January 26, 1872; George Nourse, confirmed as register of the Linkville Land Office, Oregon, June 5, 1872; Alva A. Knight, confirmed as United States Attorney for the Northern District of New York, January 21, 1873; Belle C. Shumard, confirmed as deputy postmaster at Ft. Smith, Ark., February 6, 1873; Peter C. Shannon, confirmed as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Dakota Territory, March 17, 1873; E. Raymond Bliss, confirmed as deputy postmaster at Columbus, Miss., March 18, 1973; John W. Clark, confirmed as deputy postmaster at Montpelier, Vt., March 20, 1873; William H. Tubbs, confirmed as postmaster at New London, Conn., December 20, 1878; Joseph H. Durkee, confirmed as Marshal of the Northern District of Florida, June 30, 1879; Laban J. Miles, confirmed as Indian agent at Osage Agency, Indian Territory, February 15, 1883; George W. Pritchard, confirmed as United States Attorney for the Territory of New Mexico, February 19, 1883; Thomas H. Reeves, confirmed as Indian agent, Quapau Agency, Indian Territory, April 9, 1884; Edwin I. Kursheedt, confirmed as Marshal for the Eastern District of Louisiana, March 27, 1889; and William Plimley, confirmed as Assistant Treasurer, March 10, 1903.\n In the Bean, Legate, Nourse, and Kursheedt cases, the Senate Executive Journal does not record whether or not the President returned the resolution, as requested. The President withdrew the nomination of Mr. Legate, on his own request, before the Senate had proceeded further than to debate the motion to reconsider. The Reeves and Plimley nominations were also withdrawn. In the Scott, Knight, and Miles cases the motion to reconsider was withdrawn after return of the resolution; in the Durkee case it was tabled; and in the Bliss and Pritchard cases, when put to a vote, it failed. In the Clark case no further proceeding is recorded after the return of the resolution. In the Shannon and Tubbs cases the nominee was again confirmed; in the Shumard, Bean, Nourse, and Kursheedt cases, the Senate adopted the motion to reconsider, and either recommitted the nomination or placed it upon the calendar. Only in the last six cases did the Senate in fact exercise the power to reconsider.\n It is conceded Smith that, in the cases of Legate, Shumard, and Plimley, a commission had in fact been signed by the President at the time he received and acceded to the request for return of the resolution. In the remaining cases the evidence of signing of the commission rests mainly upon entries of dates in the records of the executive offices of the White House. In the Knight and Miles cases there are also copies of the commission in the records of the respective departments. The entry of the date of commission in the Tubbs case appears to have been erased, although it is still legible. Those in the Reeves and Kursheedt cases are scratched or crossed out. See note 19, infra. \n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] The contention of Smith, in which the Attorney General and Solicitor General concur, is that the dates relied on in the White House records are the dates which the commissions bore, but not necessarily those on which they were signed. The practice in the executive offices in this respect appears not to have been uniform. Thus, in certain instances pointed out in the brief amici curiae, taken from a later period, it appears affirmatively, under the heading 'Remarks,' that the commission was actually signed at a date subsequent to that entered under the hearing 'Commissioned.' On the other hand, in the Plimley case, supra, note 18, and in the Colby and Marks cases, supra, note 17, other evidence indicates that the signature was in fact made on the date entered in the White House records. It appears to be the practice for the appropriate department to prepare the commission in all respects, including the date, upon receipt of notification of confirmation, and thereafter to present it to the Executive to be signed. This practice creates the possibility of disparity between the date of signing and the date of appearing on the commission. \n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] In the Colby and Marks cases, respectively, supra, note 17. The most recent case, which is urged as strongly supporting the Senate's contention, is that of William Plimley. President Roosevelt nominated Plimley in 1903 for Assistant Treasurer of the United States. His commission was made out and signed, and a letter notifying him of his appointment and inclosing an official bond was placed in the mails. Notice of a motion to reconsider the vote of confirmation having been received at the White House, the chief of the division of appointments ordered the letter extracted from the mails, and the President returned and resolution and subsequently withdrew the nomination. \n[\nFootnote 21\n] Thus, it will be noted in both the Colby and Marks cases, supra, note 17, that the commission had been either placed in the mails or delivered, and that the message of the President placed emphasis on these facts. \n\n[\nFootnote 22\n] In addition to the Senate precedents above discussed, counsel for the Senate cite various decisions from state courts relating to reconsideration by state and municipal deliberative bodies. People ex rel. MacMahon v. Davis, 284 Ill. 439, 120 N. E. 326, 2 A. L. R. 1650; Witherspoon v. State ex rel. West, 138 Miss. 310, 103 So. 134; Wood v. Cutter, 138 Mass. 149; Crawford v. Gilchrist, 64 Fla. 41, 59 So. 963, Ann. Cas. 1914B, 916; Dust v. Oakman, 126 Mich. 717, 86 N. W. 151, 86 Am. St. Rep. 574. None of these cases, however, presented the question here at issue of the effect upon the power to reconsider of an intervening notification of confirmation sent to an appointing officer, and of the signing by that officer of a commission. It is therefore unnecessary to examine the reasoning upon which they were decided. \n\n[\nFootnote 23\n] Thus in the confirmation of Judge Louie W. Strum, Senator Fletcher in seeking unanimous consent 'to waive the rule about two subsequent executive sessions,' and notify the President of the Senate's action, gave as his reason that 'this judge is very much needed, and has been for some months.' 74 Cong. Rec., pt. 7, pp. 6489-6490. Notification was ordered on December 21, 1931, of votes confirming nominations to the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Board of Mediation upon the statement of Senator Couzens that otherwise 'those gentlemen ... can not hold office until after two executive sessions shall have been held.' Cong. Rec., 72d Cong., 1st Sess., December 21, 1931, p. 1003. Again, on December 22, 1931, on the confirmation of Robert B. Adams as engineer in chief of the Coast Guard, Senator Copeland stated that 'that man's appointment expired on the 18th of December, and it is very important that he be immediately put on duty.' Notification was ordered. Id., p. 1131. On February 1, 1932, notification was ordered of the confirmation of certain appointees to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation Board, upon the statement of Senator Robinson that 'it is believed that there is necessity for the board to function immediately.' Id., p. 3071. See, also, Id., pp. 3415, 3582, 3881. \n\n\n\n\n","167":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v.

Judicial Code,  238, U. S. Code, title 28,  345 ( 28 USCA  345).\n In February, 1920, a bill was filed by the government under section 4 of the Act of July 2, 1890 (c. 647, 26 Stat. 209, \n\n[286 U.S. 106, 110]\n\u00a0\n U. S. Code, title 15,  4 (15 USCA  4)), known as the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, against the five leading meat packers in the United States to dissolve a monopoly. The packers joined as defendants were Swift & Co., Armour & Co., Wilson & Co., the Morris Packing Company, and the Cudahy Packing Company, together with their subsidiaries and also their chief officers. The charge was that by concert of action the defendants had succeeded in suppressing competition both in the purchase of live stock and in the sale of dressed meats, and were even spreading their monopoly into other fields of trade. They had attained this evil eminence through agreements apportioning the percentages of live stock to which the members of the combinations were severally entitled; through the acquisition and control of stockyards and stockyard terminal railroads; through the purchase of trade papers and journals whereby cattle raisers were deprived of accurate and unbiased reports of the demand for live stock; and through other devices directed to unified control. 'Having eliminated competition in the meat products, the defendants next took cognizance of the competition which might be expected' from what was characterized as 'substitute foods.' To that end, so it was charged, they had set about controlling the supply of 'fish, vegetables, either fresh or canned, fruits, cereals, milk, poultry, butter, eggs, cheese and other substitute foods ordinarily handled by wholesale grocers or produce dealers.' Through their ownership of refrigerator cars and branch houses as well as other facilities, they were in a position to distribute 'substitute foods and other unrelated commodities' with substantially no increase of overhead. Whenever these advantages were inadequate, they had recourse to the expedient of fixing prices so low over temporary periods of time as to eliminate competition by rivals less favorably situated. Through these and \n\n[286 U.S. 106, 111]\n\u00a0\n other devices there came about in the view of the government an unlawful monopoly of a large part of the food supply of the nation. The prayer was for an injunction appropriate to the case exhibited by the bill.\n The defendants consented to dismemberment, though answering the bill and traversing its charges. With their answer there was filed a stipulation which provided for the entry of a decree upon the terms therein set forth, and provided also that the decree 'shall not constitute or be considered as an adjudication that the defendants, or any of them, have in fact violated any law of the United States.' The decree entered on February 27, 1920, enjoined the defendants from maintaining a monopoly and from entering into or continuing any combination is restraint of trade and commerce. In addition, they were enjoined both severally and jointly from ( 1) holding any interest in public stockyard companies, stockyard terminal railroads, or market newspapers, (2) engaging in, or holding any interest in, the business of manufacturing, selling or transporting any of 114 enumerated food products (principally fish, vegetables, fruit, and groceries), and 30 other articles unrelated to the meat packing industry; ( 3) using or permitting others to use their distributive facilities for the handling of any of these enumerated articles, (4) selling meat at retail, ( 5) holding any interest in any public cold storage plant, and (6) selling fresh milk or cream. No injunction was granted in respect of the sale or distribution of poultry, butter, cheese, and eggs, though these had been included in the bill among the substitute foods which the defendants were seeking to engross. The decree closed with a provision whereby jurisdiction of the cause was retained for the purpose of taking such other action or adding at the foot such other relief 'as may become necessary or appropriate for the carrying out and enforcement' thereof, 'and for the purpose of entertaining at \n\n[286 U.S. 106, 112]\n\u00a0\n any time hereafter any application which the parties may make' with reference thereto.\n The expectation would have been reasonable that a decree entered upon consent would be accepted by the defendants and by those allied with them as a definitive adjudication setting controversy at rest. The events that were to follow recount a different tale. In April, 1922, the California Co- operative Canneries Corporation filed an intervening petition alleging that the effect of the injunction was to interfere with the performance by Armour & Co. of a contract by which Armour had agreed to buy large quantities of California canned fruit, and praying that the decree be vacated for lack of jurisdiction. Leave to intervene was granted by the Court of Appeals of the District, which ordered 'that such further proceedings thereupon be had as are necessary to determine the issue raised.' In November, 1924, motions for like relief were made by Swift and by Armour, their subsidiaries and officers. The motions were denied by the Supreme Court of the District, and thereafter were considered by this Court, which upheld the consent decree in the face of a vigorous assault. Swift & Co. v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 311\n, 48 S. Ct. 311. In the meantime, however, an order had been made on May 1, 1925, by the Supreme Court of the District at the instance of the California Canneries whereby the operation of the decree as a whole was suspended 'until further order of the court to be made, if at all, after a full hearing on the merits according to the usual course of chancery proceedings' see United States v. California Canneries, \n279 \nU.S. 553, 555\n, 49 S. Ct. 423, 424. This order of suspension remained in force till May, 1929, when a decision of this court swept the obstacle aside. United States v. California Canneries, supra.\n The defendants and their allies had thus been thwarted in the attempt to invalidate the decree as of the date of its entry, and again the expectation would have been reasonable that there would be acquiescence in its restraints. \n\n[286 U.S. 106, 113]\n\u00a0\n Once more the expectation was belied by the event. The defendants, or some of them, discovered, as they thought, that, during the years that had intervened between the entry of the decree and its final confirmation, conditions in the packing industry and in the sale of groceries and other foods had been transformed so completely that the restraints of the injunction, however appropriate and just in February, 1920, were now useless and oppressive. The discovery or supposed discovery had its fruit in the proceeding now before us. On April 12, 1930, the defendants Swift & Co. and Armour & Co. and their subsidiaries, being no longer under the shelter of an order suspending the injunction, filed a petition to modify the consent decree and to adapt its restraints to the needs of a new day. The prayer was that the petitioners be permitted (1) to own and operate retail meat markets; (2) to own stock in stockyard companies and terminal railroads; (3) to manufacture, sell, and deal in the 144 articles specified in paragraph fourth of the decree, which for convenience will be spoken of as 'groceries'; (4) to use or permit others to use their distributive facilities in handling such commodities; and one of the defendants Swift & Co., asked, in addition, that the defendants be permitted to hold interests in public cold-storage warehouses and to sell fresh milk and cream. Of the five defendants named in the original suit, one Morris & Co., sold out to Armour & Co. in 1923, and discontinued business. The two other defendants, Wilson and Cudahy, did not join in the petition to modify the decree, but stated in open court that they would consent to such modification as the court might order, provided it be made applicable to the defendants equally. All the requests for modification were denied except Nos. 3 and 4, of which 4 is merely ancillary to 3 and calls for no separate consideration. The modification in respect of No. 3 gave permission to deal at wholesale \n\n[286 U.S. 106, 114]\n\u00a0\n in groceries and other enumerated commodities, but maintained the injunction against dealing in them at retail. In every other respect, the decree of February 27, 1920, was continued in force as originally entered. The modifying decree, which was entered January 31, 1931, is the subject of this appeal.\n We are not doubtful of the power of a court of equity to modify an injunction in adaptation to changed conditions, though it was entered by consent. The power is conceded by the government, and is challenged by the interveners only. We do not go into the question whether the intervention was so limited in scope and purpose as to withdraw this ground of challenge, if otherwise available. Standing to make the objection may be assumed, and the result will not be changed. Power to modify the decree was reserved by its very terms, and so from the beginning went hand in hand with its restraints. If the reservation had been omitted, power there still would be by force of principles inherent in the jurisdiction of the chancery. A continuing decree of injunction directed to events to come is subject always to adaptation as events may shape the need. Ladner v. Siegel, 298 Pa. 487, 494, 495, 148 A. 699, 68 A. L. R. 1172; Emergency Hospital v. Stevens, 146 Md. 159, 126 A. 101; Larson v. Minn. N. Electric Ry. Co., 136 Minn. 423, 162 N. W. 523; Lowe v. Prospect Hill Cemetery Ass'n, 75 Neb. 85, 106 N. W. 429, 108 N. W. 978. The distinction is between restraints that give protection to rights fully accrued upon facts so nearly permanent as to be substantially impervious to change, and those that involve the supervision of changing conduct or conditions and are thus provisional and tentative. Ladner v. Siegel, supra. The result is all one whether the decree has been entered after litigation or by consent. American Press Ass'n v. United States (C. C. A.) 245 F. 91. In either event, a court does not abdicate its power to revoke or modify its mandate, if satisfied that what it has been \n\n[286 U.S. 106, 115]\n\u00a0\n doing has been turned through changing circumstances into an instrument of wrong. We reject the argument for the interveners that a decree entered upon consent is to be treated as a contract and not as a judicial act. A different view would not help them, for they were not parties to the contract, if any there was. All the parties to the consent decree concede the jurisdiction of the court to change it. The interveners gain nothing from the fact that the decree was a contract as to others, if it was not one as to them. But in truth what was then adjudged was not a contract as to any one. The consent is to be read as directed toward events as they then were. It was not an abandonment of the right to exact revision in the future, if revision should become necessary in adaptation to events to be.\n Power to modify existing, we are brought to the question whether enough has been shown to justify its exercise.\n The defendants, controlled by experienced business men, renounced the privilege of trading in groceries, whether in concert or independently, and did this with their eyes open. Two reasons, and only two, for exacting the surrender of this adjunct of the business, were stated in the bill of complaint. Whatever persuasiveness the reasons then had is theirs with undiminished force today.\n The first was that, through the ownership of refrigerator cars and branch houses, as well as other facilities, the defendants were in a position to distribute substitute foods and other unrelated commodities with substantially no increase of overhead. There is no doubt that they are equally in that position now. Their capacity to make such distribution cheaply by reason of their existing facilities is one of the chief reasons why the sale of groceries has been permitted by the modified decree, and this in the face of the fact that it is also one of the chief reasons why the decree as originally entered took the privilege away. \n\n[286 U.S. 106, 116]\n\u00a0\n The second reason stated in the bill of complaint is the practice followed by the defendants of fixing prices for groceries so low over temporary periods of time as to eliminate competition by rivals less favorably situated.\n Whether the defendants would resume that practice if they were to deal in groceries again, we do not know. They would certainly have the temptation to resume it. Their law overhead and their gigantic size, even when they are viewed as separate units, would still put them in a position to starve out weaker rivals. Mere size, according to the holding of this court, is not an offense against the Sherman Act unless magnified to the point at which it amounts to a monopoly (United States v. United States Steel Corp., \n251 \nU.S. 417\n, 40 S. Ct. 293, 8 A. L. R. 1121; United States v. International Harvester Co., \n274 \nU.S. 693, 708\n, 47 S. Ct. 478), but size carries with it an opportunity for abuse that is not to be ignored when the opportunity is proved to have been utilized in the past. The original decree at all events was framed upon that theory. It was framed upon the theory that, even after the combination among the packers had been broken up, and the monopoly dissolved, the individual units would be so huge that the capacity to engage in other forms of business as adjuncts to the sale of meats should be taken from them altogether. It did not say that the privilege to deal in groceries should be withdrawn for a limited time, or until the combination in respect of meats had been effectually broken up. It said that the privilege should be renounced forever, and this whether the units within the combination were acting collectively or singly. The combination was to be disintegrated, but relief was not to stop with that. To curb the aggressions of the huge units that would remain, there was to be a check upon their power, even though acting independently, to wage a war of extermination against dealers weaker than themselves. We do not turn aside to inquire whether some of these restraints upon separate as distinguished from joint action could have been opposed with success if the de- \n\n[286 U.S. 106, 117]\n\u00a0\n fendants had offered opposition. Instead, they chose to consent, and the injunction, right or wrong, became the judgment of the court. Groceries and other enumerated articles they were not to sell at all, either by wholesale or by retail. Even the things that they were free to sell meats and meat products, they were not to sell by retail. The court below annulled the restraint upon sales of groceries by wholesale, but retained the prohibition in respect of sale by retail both for groceries and for meats. The one prohibition equally with the other was directed against abuse of power by the individual units after the monopoly was over; and the death of the monopoly, the breaking up of the combination, if an adequate reason for terminating one of them, is an adequate reason for terminating both.\n We have said that the defendants are still in a position, even when acting separately, to starve out weaker rivals, or at least that the fear of such abuses, if rational in 1920, is still rational today. The meat monopoly has been broken, for the members now compete with one another. The size of the component units is substantially unchanged. In 1929, the latest year for which any figures are furnished by the record, the sales made by Swift and Armour, each, amounted to over a $1,000,000,000; those made by all the defendants together to over $2,500,000,000; and those made by their thirteen chief competitors to only $407,000,000. Size and past aggressions induced the fear in 1920 that the defendants, if permitted to deal in groceries, would drive their rivals to the wall. Size and past aggressions leave the fear unmoved today. Changes there have been that reduce the likelihood of a monopoly in the business of the sale of meats, but none that bear significantly upon the old-time abuses in the sale of other foods. The question is not whether a modification as to groceries can be made without prejudice to the interests of producers of cattle on the hoof. The question is whether it can be made without prejudice \n\n[286 U.S. 106, 118]\n\u00a0\n to the interests of the classes whom this particular restraint was intended to protect. Much is made in the defendants' argument of the rise of the chain stores to affluence and power, and especially of chains for the sale of groceries and other foods. Nothing in that development eradicates the ancient peril. Few of the chain stores produce the foods they have for sale, and then chiefly in special lines. Much, indeed most, of what they offer, they are constrained to buy from others. They look to the defendants for their meats, and, if the ban of this decree is lifted, they will look to the defendants for other things as well. Meats and groceries today are retailed at the same shops, departments of a single business. The defendants, the largest packers in the country, will thus hold a post of vantage, as compared with other wholesale grocers, in their dealings with the chains. They will hold a post of vantage in their dealings with others outside the chains. When they add groceries to meats, they will do so, they assure us, with substantially no increase of the existing overhead. Thus in the race of competition they will be able by their own admission to lay a handicap on rivals overweighted at the start. The opportunity portunity will be theirs to renew the war of extermination that they waged in years gone by.\n Sporadic instances of unfair practices even in the meat business are stated in the findings to have occurred since the monopoly was broken, practices as to which the defendants' officers disclaim responsibility or knowledge. It is easy to make such excuses with plausibility when a business is so huge. They become less plausible when the size of the business is moderate. Responsibility is then centered in a few. If the grocery business is added to the meat business, there may be many instances of unfair pressure upon retailers and others with the design of forcing them to buy from the defendants and not from rival grocers. Such at any rate was the rationale of the decree of 1920. Its restraints, whether just or excessive, \n\n[286 U.S. 106, 119]\n\u00a0\n were born of that fear. The difficulty of ferreting out these evils and repressing them when discovered supplies an additional reason why we should leave the defendants where we find them, especially since the place where we find them is the one where they agreed to be.\n There is need to keep in mind steadily the limits of inquiry proper to the case before us. We are not framing a decree. We are asking ourselves whether anything has happened that will justify us now in changing a decree. The injunction, whether right or wrong, is not subject to impeachment in its application to the conditions that existed at its making. We are not at liberty to reverse under the guise of readjusting. Life is never static, and the passing of a decade has brought changes to the grocery business as it has to every other. The inquiry for us is whether the changes are so important that dangers, once substantial, have become attenuated to a shadow. No doubt the defendants will be better off if the injunction is relaxed, but they are not suffering hardship so extreme and unexpected as to justify us in saying that they are the victims of oppression. Nothing less than a clear showing of grievous wrong evoked by new and unforeseen conditions should lead us to change what was decreed after years of litigation with the consent of all concerned.\n The case comes down to this: The defendants has abused their powers so grossly and persistently as to lead to the belief that, even when they were acting separately, their conduct should be subjected to extraordinary restraints. There was the fear that even when so acting they would still be ready and able to crush their feebler rivals in the sale of groceries and kindred products by forms of competition too ruthless and oppressive to be accepted as fair and just. Wisely or unwisely, they submitted to these restraints upon the exercise of powers that would normally be theirs. They chose to renounce what they might otherwise have claimed, and the decree of a court confirmed the renunciation and placed it beyond recall. \n\n[286 U.S. 106, 120]\n\u00a0\n What was then solemnly adjudged as a final composition of an historic litigation will not lightly be undone at the suit of the offenders, and the composition held for nothing.\n The decree should be reversed and the petitions dismissed.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND and Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration and decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER (dissenting).\n The facts on which the District Supreme Court allowed modification of parts of the 1920 consent injunction are set forth in its findings prepared in accordance with Equity Rule 70 1\/2 (28 USCA  723). They are discussed and amplified in a painstaking opinion contained in the record. I think they are sustained by the evidence and are sufficient to support the decree.\n Conditions affecting competition in the lines of business carried on by defendants have changed since 1920. Indeed the government, after the introduction of evidence by appellees, formally stipulated that they 'are in active competition with each other' etc. \n1\n The facts nega- \n\n[286 U.S. 106, 121]\n\u00a0\n tive any suggestion that danger of monopolistic control now exists. Each of the principal packers has suffered discouraging operating losses. One of them, retiring from business, sold its plants to another. The purchaser, in order to avoid failure, was compelled to refinance and has not earned reasonable profits in any year. Another, being embarrassed, passed into the hands of a receiver, was subsequently adjudged bankrupt and later reorganized. Only two have continued also to sustain themselves. It is shown without dispute that defendants' earnings, whether considered in relation to sales or to the worth of property invested, are low and substantially less than those of others carrying on the same lines of business. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n Since 1920 the manufacture and distribution of food have grown greatly and to a large extent have come to \n\n[286 U.S. 106, 122]\n\u00a0\n be carried on by integrated concerns in strong hands, which have taken over and are handling many products from the sources of production to consumers. More and more, meat-formerly distributed through shops selling little if anything else-is sold in stores carrying groceries and other articles of food. The diversification of the business of defendants permitted by the modification of the injunction is in harmony with present legitimate tendencies in the business of producing and selling meat, groceries and other articles of food. In all branches of such activities there is strong and active competition. The use by defendants of their employees and facilities for the sale and distribution of groceries as well as meat would not give them any undue advantage over their competitors. Under present conditions the relief granted below would not enable them to inflict the evils of monopoly upon any part of the food industry. The denial of that relief makes against competition intended to be preserved by the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. Defendants should be permitted more efficiently to use their help and equipment to lessen their operating expenses. That makes for lower prices, and so is in the public interest.\n The wholesale grocers, represented here by objecting interveners, are not entitled to the court's protection against the competition of nonmembers or of defendants carrying on separately and competing actively. They may not avoid the burden of sustaining themselves in a free and open market by protestation of fear that, if allowed to engage in the grocery business at all, defendants will unfairly compete in violation of the federal anti-trust laws. If and whenever shown necessary for the protection of the commerce safeguarded by the original decree, the government may have the modified provisions restored or new ones added.\n There is nothing in the original complaint that makes for reversal here. The government's allegations were denied by answer. The decree was entered without evi- \n\n[286 U.S. 106, 123]\n\u00a0\n dence or findings pursuant to a written stipulation between the government and the defendants expressly providing that 'this stipulation shall not constitute or be considered as an admission, and the rendition or entry of the decree, or the decree itself, shall not constitute or be considered as an adjudication that the defendants, or any of them, have in fact violated any law of the United States.' And that provision was in exact words incorporated in and made a part of the decree. Thus the government consented to, and the court adopted, this provision quite as much as the defendants consented to the other parts of the decree.\n The fact that defendants thereafter applied to have the decree vacated upon grounds directed only to the power of the court to enter it ought not to be regarded as militating against them or their good faith- particularly when it is recalled that this court when reviewing that proceeding, deemed the questions presented of sufficient importance to call for their argument a second time. \n276 \nU.S. 311\n, 48 S.

Gen., for the United States.\n Mr. Milton R. Kroopf, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The schooner Ruth Mildred was licensed to engage in the cod and mackerel fisheries. On March 1, 1928, she was observed by the Coast Guard in Long Island Sound headed for New York. She was trailed by a patrol boat till she docked in the East River. The master admitted to the customs officers that his vessel was carrying intoxicating liquors, and upon the search that followed a stock of liquors was discovered. A libel of information was thereafter filed against the vessel praying a decree of forfeiture for breach of the navigation laws (R. S.  4377, U. S. Code, title 46,  325 (46 USCA  325)) in carrying on a business not permitted by the license. The master intervened in the suit, and pleaded that the remedy under section 26 of title 2 of the National Prohibition Act (27 USCA  40) was exclusive of any other. The District Court, upholding that defense, dismissed the libel (47 F.(2d) 336), and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 56 F.(2d) 590. The case is here on a writ of certiorari granted on the petition of the Government.\n Our decision in General Motors Acceptance Corporation et al. v. United States of America, \n286 \nU.S. 49\n, 52 S. Ct. 468, 76 L. Ed. -, would require a reversal of this judgment if the vessel had been seized for unlawful importation in violation of the tariff act. Even more \n\n[286 U.S. 67, 69]\n\u00a0\n plainly that result must follow where the basis of the seizure is a breach of the navigation acts growing out of a departure by the vessel from the conditions of her license. Contrast with the decision below the decision of the same court in United States v. American Motor Boat K-1231, 54 F.(2d) 502. By section 4377 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Code, title 46,  325 ( 46 USCA  325)): 'Whenever any licensed vessel ... is employed in any other trade than that for which she is licensed, ... such vessel with her tackle, apparel, and furniture, and the cargo, found on board her, shall be forfeited.' The Ruth Mildred was licensed for the fishing trade and not for any other. She would have been subject to forfeiture if her cargo had been wheat or silk or sugar. In a suit under this statute, her guilt was not affected, was neither enlarged nor diminished, by the fact that the cargo happened to be one of intoxicating liquors. The government made out a case of forfeiture when there was proof that the cargo was something other than fish. Forfeiture under section 26 of title 2 of the National Prohibition Act is one of the consequences of a successful criminal prosecution of a personal offender, and is ancillary thereto. Forfeiture under the Revised Statutes,  4377, for breach of the navigation laws, is strictly in rem, and is not dependent upon a preliminary adjudication of personal guilt. United States v. Stowell, \n133 \nU.S. 1, 16\n, 17 S., 10 S. Ct. 244. In brief, the basis of the charge of guilt directed against this vessel is not a breach of the National Prohibition Act nor any movement of transportation, lawful or unlawful. It is the act of engaging in a business other than the fishing trade in contravention of a license.\n The decree should be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","169":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUTAH POWER & LIGHT CO. v.

Barber, of Boise, Idaho, for appellees.\n\n\n[286 U.S. 165, 175]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the court.\n The Utah Power & Light Company is a Maine corporation doing business in the states of Idaho, Utah, and Wyoming, under the laws of those states. The corporation is a public utility engaged in generating, transmitting, and distributing electric power and energy for barter, sale, and exchange to consumers in each of these three states, and in interstate commerce among them. The present suit was brought to enjoin the enforcement of an act of the Idaho Legislature, levying a license tax on the manufacture, generation, or production, within the state, for barter, sale, or exchange, or electricity and electrical energy. Laws of Idaho 1931 (Extraordinary session), c. 3.\n Section 1 of the act provides that any individual, corporation, etc., engaged in the generation, manufacture, or production of electricity and electrical energy, by any means, for barter, sale, or exchange, shall, at a specified time, render a statement to the commissioner of law enforcement of all electricity and electrical energy generated, manufactured, or produced by him or it in the state during the preceding month, and pay thereon a license tax of one-half mill per kilowatt hour, 'measured at the place of production.' Sections 2, 3, and 4 provide for the time and method of payment of the tax, and the furnishing of appropriate information. Section 4 further requires the producer to maintain, at the point or points of production, suitable instruments for measuring the electricity or electrical energy produced. Section 5, which is the subject of a distinct attack, provides: 'All electricity and electrical energy used for pumping water for irrigation purposes to be used on lands in the State of Idaho is exempt from the provisions of this Act, except in cases where the water so pumped is sold or rented \n\n[286 U.S. 165, 176]\n\u00a0\n to such irrigated lands. Provided, the exemption here given shall accrue to the benefit of the consumer of such electricity or electrical energy. Provided further that the full amount of such license tax which would have been due from such producers of electricity and electrical energy, if such exemptions had not been made, shall be credited annually for the year in which the exemptions are made on the power bill to the consumer by the producer of such electricity and electrical energy, furnishing such power, and such producer shall include a statement of the amount of electricity and electrical energy exempted by this section, furnished by it for the purpose of pumping water for irrigation purposes on lands in the State of Idaho, to the commissioner of Law Enforcement of the State of Idaho as a part of the statement required by Section 1 of this Act, together with a statement of the credits made on the power bills to the consumers of such electricity and electrical energy for the pumping of water for irrigation to be used on lands in the State of Idaho.'\n Section 8 imposes a penalty for any violation of the act, or failure to pay the license tax provided for therein when due, in the sum of three times the amount of the unpaid or delinquent tax, to be recovered by civil action. Section 11 provides that if any section or provision of the act be adjudged unconstitutional or invalid, such adjudication shall not affect the validity of the act as a whole, or of any section or provision thereof not specifically so adjudged unconstitutional or invalid.\n After the filing of the complaint, an interlocutory injunction was granted ((D. C.) 52 F.(2d) 226); and, thereafter, appellees answered. Upon the evidence reported by a master, to whom the case had been referred, the court below (composed of three judges as required by law) made findings of fact and conclusions of law and entered a final decree dissolving the interlocutory injunction and \n\n[286 U.S. 165, 177]\n\u00a0\n requiring appellant to pay the tax in question with interest, but without any penalties which might have accrued during the pendency of the suit. (C. C. A.) 54 F.(2d) 803. This appeal followed.\n The validity of the act under the Federal and State Constitutions is assailed upon four grounds: (1) That it imposes a direct burden on interstate commerce in violation of clause 3,  8, art. 1 of the Federal Constitution; (2) that it denies appellant the equal protection of the laws and deprives it of property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and of a corresponding provision of the State Constitution (article 1,  13), in that section 5 of the act compels the appropriation and payment of money by appellant for the benefit of private individuals, and that, section 5 being unconstitutional, the act as a whole must fall; (3) that the act violates section 16, art. 3 of the State Constitution, which provides that every act shall embrace but one subject and matters properly connected therewith, which subject shall be expressed in the title; (4) that the act is so uncertain and ambiguous in specified particulars that its enforcement is left to arbitrary administrative action without a legislative standard, and thus violates the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n First. Appellant contends that the tax is not one on manufacture or production or on the extraction of a product of nature, but on the transfer or conveyance of energy in nature from its source to its place of use; that in part appellant's system consists of generating stations in Idaho and transmission lines across the boundary into Utah, and thence to various consumers, the combined action to which constitutes an operation in interstate commerce; that the energy is brought to the consumers in Utah directly from its source in the water fall; that thus the generator is an instrumentality of interstate commerce; that the process of generation is simultaneous and interdependent with \n\n[286 U.S. 165, 178]\n\u00a0\n that of transmission and use, and, because of their inseparability, the whole is interstate commerce; that since the intent of the act is to tax the whole business and no provision is made for the separate determination of interstate and intrastate business, the act, in burdening interstate commerce, is void in its entirety.\n On the other hand, appellees say that the tax is laid upon the generation of electrical energy as a distinct act of production, and without regard to its subsequent transmission; that the process of generation is one of converting mechanical energy into electrical form; that the resulting change is substantial and is a change in the physical charactistics of the energy in respect to voltage, current, and character as alternating or direct current, according to the design of the mechanical generating devices; that the process of conversion is completed before the pulses of energy leave the generator in their flow to the transformer; that the tax is measured by the amount of electrical energy generated, without regard to its subsequent transmission; that such transmission is subsequent to, and separable from, generation, and, in effect, corresponds to the transportation of goods after their manufacture; that the generation of the electrical energy is local, and only its transmission is in interstate commerce; that since the tax is imposed in respect of generation, it is not invalidated by reason of any intent on the part of the producer to transport across state lines.\n In the light of what follows, we find it unnecessary to state or consider the claims of the parties as to the effect of the interposition of the transformer between the generator and the places of consumption.\n From the foregoing greatly abbreviated but, for present purposes, we think sufficient statement of the views of the respective parties, it is apparent that in the last analysis the question we are called upon to solve is this: Upon the facts of the present case, is the generation of electrical energy, like manufacture or production gener- \n\n[286 U.S. 165, 179]\n\u00a0\n ally, a process essentially local in character and complete in itself; or is it so linked with the transmission as to make it an inseparable part of a transaction in interstate commerce? From the strictly scientific point of view, the subject is highly technical; but in considering the case, we must not lose sight of the fact that taxation is a practical matter, and that what constitutes commerce, manufacture, or production is to be determined upon practical considerations.\n Electrical energy has characteristrics clearly differentiating it from the various other forms of energy, such as chemical energy, heat energy, and the energy of falling water. Appellant here, by means of what are called generators, converts the mechanical energy of falling water into electrical energy. Thus, by the application of human skill, a distinct product is brought into being and transmitted to the places of use. The result is not merely transmission; nor is it transmission of the mechanical energy of falling water to the places of consumption; but it is, first, conversion of that form of energy into something else, and, second, the transmission of that something else to the consumers. While conversion and transmission are substantially instantaneous, they are, we are convinced, essentially separable and distinct operations. The fact that to ordinary observation there is no appreciable lapse of time between the generation of the product and its transmission does not forbid the conclusion that they are, nevertheless, successive and not simultaneous acts.\n The point is stressed that in appellant's system electricity is not stored in advance, but produced as called for. The consumer in Utah, it is said, by merely turning a switch, draws directly from the water fall in Idaho, through the generating devices, electrical energy which appears instantaneously at the place of consumption. But this is not precisely what happens. The effect of turning the switch in Utah is not to draw electrical energy directly \n\n[286 U.S. 165, 180]\n\u00a0\n from the water fall, where it does not exist except as a potentiality, but to set in operation the generating appliances in Idaho, which thereupon receive power from the falling water and transform it into electrical energy. In response to what in effect is an order, there is production as well as transmission of a definite supply of an article of trade. The manufacture to order of goods and their immediate shipment to the purchaser furnishes a helpful analogy, notwithstanding the fact that there the successive steps from order to delivery are open to physical observation, while here the succession of events is chiefly a matter of inference; although inference which seems unavoidable. The process by which the mechanical energy of falling water is converted into electrical energy, despite its hidden character, is no less real than the conversion of wheat into flour at the mill.\n The apparent difficulty in perceiving the analogy arises principally from the fact that electrical energy is not a substance; at least in common meaning. It cannot be bought and sold as so many ounces or pounds, or so many quarts or gallons. It has neither length, breadth, nor thickness. But that it has actual content of some kind is clear, since it is susceptible of mechanical measurement with the necessary certainty to permit quantitative units to be fixed for purposes of barter, sale, and exchange. However lacking it may be in body or substance, electrical energy, nevertheless, possesses many of the ordinary tokens of materiality. It is subject to known laws; manifests definite and predictable characteristics; may be transmitted from the place of production to the point of use and there made to serve many of the practical needs of life.\n We think, therefore, it is wholly inaccurate to say that appellant's entire system is purely a transferring device. On the contrary, the generator and the transmission lines perform different functions, with a result comparable, so \n\n[286 U.S. 165, 181]\n\u00a0\n far as the question here under consideration is concerned, to the manufacture of physical articles of trade and their subsequent shipment and transportation in commerce. Appellant's chief engineer, although testifying that generation is a part of the process of transferring energy, said on cross-examination that in the process of generation there is a 'conversion of the mechanical energy in the turbine shaft into a different form of energy, that is electrical energy. It must be converted into electrical energy before it can be transmitted. ... This process of transformation is complete at the generator, and you have a greater amount of energy there, capable of doing a greater amount of mechanical work, at the generator than you do after transmitting it into Utah.' The evidence amply sustains the conclusion that this transformation must take place as a prerequisite to the use of the electrical product, and that the process of transferring, as distinguished from that of producing, the electrical energy, begins not at the water fall, but definitely at the generator, at which point measuring appliances can be placed and the quantum of electrical energy ascertained with practical accuracy.\n The various specific objections to the findings made below, and the failure to adopt others suggested by appellant, become immaterial in view of our conclusions. We are satisfied, upon a consideration of the whole case, that the process of generation is as essentially local as though electrical energy were a physical thing; and to that situation we must apply, as controlling, the general rule that commerce does not begin until manufacture is finished, and hence the commerce clause of the Constitution does not prevent the state from exercising exclusive control over the manufacture. Cornell v. Coyne, \n192 \nU.S. 418, 428\n, 429 S., 24 S. Ct. 383. 'Commerce succeeds to manufacture, and is not a part of it.' United States v. E. C. Knight Co., \n156 \nU.S. 1, 12\n, 15 S. Ct. 249, 253. \n\n[286 U.S. 165, 182]\n\u00a0\n Without regard to the apparent continuity of the movement, appellant, in effect, is engaged in two activities; not in one only. So far as it produces electrical energy in Idaho, its business is purely intrastate, subject to state taxation and control. In transmitting the product across the state line into Utah, appellant is engaged in interstate commerce, and state legislation in respect thereof is subject to the paramount authority of the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution. The situation does not differ in principle from that considered by this court in Oliver Iron Mining Co. v. Lord, \n262 \nU.S. 172\n, 43 S. Ct. 526. There the state of Minnesota had imposed an occupation tax on the business of mining ores. The tax was assailed as being in conflict with the commerce clause. It appeared that substantially all the ores there in question were mined for delivery to consumers outside the state; and that the ores passed practically at once after extraction into the channels of interstate commerce. The greater part of the ores came from open pit mines, to which empty cars were run and there loaded; the ores being severed from their natural bed by means of steam shovels and lifted directly into the cars. When loaded, these cars were promptly returned to the railroad yards from which they came and were there put into trains and continued their interstate journey. The several steps follows in such succession that there was practical continuity of movement from the severance of the ores to the end of their journey in another state. Upon these facts the court held that the commerce clause was not infringed.\n'The ore does not enter interstate commerce,' it was said, page 179 of 262 U. S., 43 S. Ct. 526, 529, 'until after the mining is done, and the tax is imposed only in respect of the mining. No discrimination against interstate commerce is involved. The tax may indirectly and incidentally affect such commerce, \n\n[286 U.S. 165, 183]\n\u00a0\n just as any taxation of railroad and telegraph lines does, but this is not a forbidden burden or interference.'\n\n In Hope Natural Gas Co. v. Hall, \n274 \nU.S. 284\n, 47 S. Ct. 639, this court considered an act of the state of West Virginia imposing a tax upon the production, among other things, of natural gas. The chief business of the Hope Gas Company was the production and purchase of natural gas in West Virginia, and the continuous and uninterrupted transportation of it through pipe lines into adjoining states, where it was sold, delivered, and consumed. Most of it passed into interstate commerce by continuous movement from the wells where it originated. Interpreting and following the decision of the state court, it was held that the tax was to be computed upon the value of the gas at the well, and that if, thereafter, executive officers should fix values upon an improper basis appropriate relief would be afforded by the courts. The tax was sustained as not involving an infringement of the commerce clause of the Constitution.\n In the light of what we have said respect of the character of the product here involved, the manner of its production, and the relation of such production to its interstate transmission, these cases in principle clearly control the present case, and render further discussion or citation of authorities unnecessary.\n Second. The attack upon section 5 of the act, which is copied on a preceding page, is based upon the contention that it does not grant an exemption but has the effect of laying a tax for the benefit of favored consumers, that is to say, of selected private persons; and that the enforcement of the section in respect of allowances of credits by the producer to the favored consumers will result in taking the money of the former and giving it to the latter. A further contention is that section 5 is an inseparable part of the act, and, being unconstitutional, and entire act must fall \n\n[286 U.S. 165, 184]\n\u00a0\n with it. In support of the latter point, the grounds stated are that the legislative history discloses as a matter of fact that the act would not have been passed had section 5 not been included; and that it is apparent on the face of the act itself that the provisions of the section are essential and inseparable parts of the act as an entirety. It will shorten our consideration of the first point if we begin by disposing of the second point as to the question of separability.\n The claim that the legislative history discloses that the act would not have passed without section 5 seems to rest entirely upon the fact that a bill for a similar act, but which did not contain the challenged section, failed of passage; but that, upon section 5 being included, the act thereafter was passed. The bill first introduced did not come to a vote, but was withdrawn from consideration by unanimous consent. That it would have been rejected if put to a vote rests upon mere supposition. There is no real ground for an opinion one way or the other. Courts are not justified in resting judgment upon a basis so lacking in substance.\n Nor do we think the inseparability of the section from the rest of the act appears from the face of the legislation. The act itself (section 11) provides that an adjudication that any provision of the act is unconstitutional shall not affect the validity of the act as a whole, or of any other provision or section thereof. While this declaration is but an aid to interpretation and not an inexorable command (Dorchy v. Kansas, \n264 \nU.S. 286, 290\n, 44 S. Ct. 323), it has the effect of reversing the common-law presumption, that the Legislature intends an act to be effective as an entirety, by putting in its place the opposite presumption of divisibility; and this presumption must be overcome by considerations that make evident the inseparability of the provisions or the clear probability that the Legislature would not have been satisfied with the statute unless it \n\n[286 U.S. 165, 185]\n\u00a0\n had included in invalid part. Williams v. Standard Oil Co., \n278 \nU.S. 235, 241\n, 242 S., 49 S. Ct. 115, 60 A. L. R. 596.\n It fairly may be assumed that the Idaho Legislature, in making this declaration, had in mind every provision of the act, including section 5. The primary object of the statute under review, plainly, is to raise revenue. The exemption made by section 5 and the provisions for carrying that exemption into effect are secondary. We find no warrant for concluding that the Legislature would have been content to sacrifice an important revenue statute in the event that relief from its burdens in respect of particular individuals should become ineffective. On the contrary, it seems entirely reasonable to suppose that, if the Legislature had expressed itself specifically in respect of the matter, it would have declared that the tax, being the vital aim of the act, was to be preserved even though the specified exemptions should fall for lack of validity. Field v. Clark, \n143 \nU.S. 649, 696\n, 697 S., 12 S. Ct. 495; People ex rel. Alpha P. C. Co. v. Knapp, 230 N. Y. 48, 60-63, 129 N. E. 202.\n In the light of these conclusions, section 5, in respect of the constitutional question, stands apart from the remainder of the act, and is to be considered accordingly. The court below followed the decision of the state Supreme Court (Williams v. Baldridge, 48 Idaho, 618, 284 P. 203), in holding that section 5 granted an exemption ultimately for the benefit of the consumers of electrical power for irrigation purposes on lands within the state. It seems to us plain that the purpose of the act was to relieve the producer from liability for the tax pro tanto, and to pass on to the irrigation consumers the benefit thereof to the extent, and only to the extent, of the savings effected through the exemption. There is nothing to suggest that the Legislature intended to cast any additional burden upon the producer or require him to yield to the irrigation consumers anything beyond the equivalent of the exemption. The irrigation of even private lands in the arid region is a matter of public concern ( Clark v. Nash, \n198 \nU.S. 361\n, 25 S. Ct. 676, 4 Ann. Cas. 1171), \n\n[286 U.S. 165, 186]\n\u00a0\n and we are of opinion that an exemption of the character here involved is not precluded by the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Compare Louisville Gas & Electric Co. v. Coleman, \n277 \nU.S. 32, 40\n, 48 S. Ct. 423.\n The provisions in respect of the allowance of credits to the consumers by the producer present a question of more difficulty. If these provisions embody nothing more than a method of accounting to make sure that the irrigation consumers shall not bear, in whole or in part, the burden of the tax from which the producer is exempt, they would seem to be without fault. If by contruction or in application they result in taking from the producer more than the sum of the exemption, a different question would arise. The Supreme Court of Idaho thus far has not construed section 5 in respect of the provisions now under consideration. The point was presented but reserved in Williams v. Baldridge, supra, page 631 of 48 Idaho, 284 P. 203. It does not appear that appellant is presently in any such danger of an unconstitutional application of these provisions of the statute as to entitle it to invoke a decision here upon the question, and the rule is well settled that 'a litigant can be heard to question a statute's validity only when and so far as it is being or is about to be applied to his disadvantage.' Dahnke-Walker Milling Co. v. Bondurant, \n257 \nU.S. 282, 289\n, 42 S. Ct. 106, 108; Oliver Iron Mining Co. v. Lord, supra, pages 180, 181 of 262 U. S., 43 S. Ct. 526; Jeffrey Mfg. Co. v. Blagg, \n235 \nU.S. 571, 576\n, 35 S. Ct. 167; Gorieb v. Fox, \n274 \nU.S. 603, 606\n, 47 S. Ct. 675, 53 A. L. R. 1210. Primarily, the construction of these provisions of the statute is for the state Supreme Court, and we cannot assume in advance that such a construction will be adopted, or such an application made of the provisions, as to render them obnoxious to the Federal Constitution. In Plymouth Coal Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n232 \nU.S. 531, 544\n, 545 S., 546, 34 S. Ct. 359, 363, Mr. Justice Pitney pointed out that: '... In cases other than such as arise under the contract clause of the Constitution, it is the appropriate \n\n[286 U.S. 165, 187]\n\u00a0\n function of the court of last resort of a state to determine the meaning of the local statutes. And in exercising the jurisdiction conferred by  237, Judicial Code (28 USCA  344) it is proper for this court rather to wait until the state court has adopted a construction of the statute under attack than to assume in advance that a construction will be adopted such as to render the law obnoxious to the Federal Constitution.'\n This was said in a case brought for review from the Supreme Court of a state, but the same doctrine was recognized in Arizona Employers' Liability Cases, \n250 \nU.S. 400, 430\n, 39 S. Ct. 553, 6 A. L. R. 1537, which came here on error to a federal district court.\n Third. Section 16, art. 3, of the Idaho Constitution provides: 'Every act shall embrace but one subject and matters properly connected therewith, which subject shall be expressed in the title.' Appellant contends that the act now under review contains two subjects: (a) The levy of a license tax on electrical energy generated in the state; and (b) a subsidy ( section 5) in favor of irrigation pumping users. The purpose of the constitutional provision, as this court said in Posados v. Warner, B. & Co ., \n279 \nU.S. 340, 344\n, 49 S. Ct. 333, 334, 'is to prevent the inclusion of incongruous and unrelated matters in the same measure and to guard against inadvertence, stealth and fraud in legislation. ... The courts disregard mere verbal inaccuracies, resolve doubts in favor of validity, and hold that, in order to warrant the setting aside of enactments for failure to comply with the rule, the violation must be substantial and plain.' We cannot agree with the claim that the violation here is substantial and plain. The statute levies a license tax and creates an exemption therefrom in specified cases. This exemption, although it inures to the benefit of third persons, and whether it be constitutional or not, is obviously a matter properly connected with the subject-matter of the act. It is nothing more than a limitation upon the generality of the tax. The Supreme Court of \n\n[286 U.S. 165, 188]\n\u00a0\n Idaho has laid down the proper rule in Pioneer Irrigation Dist. v. Bradley, 8 Idaho, 310, 68 P. 295, 101 Am. St. Rep. 201, to the effect that the purpose of the constitutional provision is to prevent the inclusion in title and act of two or more subjects diverse in their nature and having no necessary connection; but that if the provisions relate directly or indirectly to the same subject, have a natural connection therewith, and are not foreign to the subject expressed in the title, they may be united. Following this rule, we are of opinion that the objection is untenable.\n It is further said that the subject of the act is not expressed in the title, since the title purports to levy a license tax on electricity and electrical energy generated, etc., for barter, sale, or exchange, while the act requires payment of a tax upon such electricity and electrical energy generated, etc., in the state of Idaho for any purpose and measured at the place of production. The point made is that a tax on energy generated specifically for barter, sale, or exchange, and a tax on all energy generated or producted in the state are entirely different things. The force of the contention depends upon the construction of the act. We are of opinion, as will appear more fully under the next heading, that the act, in harmony with the title, imposes a tax only upon the energy which is generated for barter, sale, or exchange.\n Fourth. Appellant contends that the act is so uncertain and ambiguous as to require arbitrary administrative action without a legislative standard, and thus take appellant's property without due process of law. The uncertainties said to exist are: (1) That it cannot be determined whether the tax is levied on all electrical energy generated or produced, or only on such as is generated or produced for barter, sale or exchange; and (2) that, if the latter be the true construction, the act affords no guide for the determination of what electrical energy in fact is generated for barter, sale or exchange; but by fixing the \n\n[286 U.S. 165, 189]\n\u00a0\n place and method of measurement it excludes the possibility of a determination of that matter. The same uncertainties are said to exist in respect of section 5.\n We think the act is reasonably open to the construction that the tax is to be measured by the kilowatt hours generated or produced for barter, sale, or exchange. The purpose, as manifested by the title, is to levy a tax 'on electricity and electrical energy generated, manufactured or produced in the State of Idaho for barter, sale or exchange.' The act itself in terms applies to those engaged in the production of electricity and electrical energy in the state of Idaho 'for barter, sale or exchange.' The producer is required to render a statement and pay a license 'on all such electricity and electrical energy so generated, manufactured or produced, measured at the place of production.' Considering these provisions and, in connection therewith, the title and the general scope and purpose of the act, the intent to impose the tax only in respect of energy generated for barter, sale, or exchange is sufficiently clear.\n The limitation of the tax to electrical energy generated only for barter, sale, or exchange obviously requires that in determining the amount so generated there be excluded from the computation all electrical energy generated for other purposes. In other words, the intent of the act being to levy a tax only in respect of electrical energy generated for the purposes named, it becomes necessary, in order to effectuate the intention, to deduct from the amount produced and measured at the generator such amounts as are generated for appellant's own use, or otherwise than for the specified purposes. We think this view is not precluded by the provision in section 1 of the act that the tax is levied in respect of the electrical energy generated, 'measured at the place of production'; nor by the further provision in section 4 that the producer shall maintain at the point of production suitable appliances \n\n[286 U.S. 165, 190]\n\u00a0\n for measuring the electrical energy produced. Since the tax applies not to all electrical energy generated, and therefore not to all measured at the point of production, but only to such as is produced for barter, sale, or exchange, it necessarily follows that other factors than the basic measurement at the generator must be taken into consideration. That is, to put the matter concretely, the amount of the initial production must first be ascertained by measurement at the place of production, and from that there must be taken amounts used by the producer or consumed in effecting transmission (including so-called line or system losses), or disposed of otherwise than by barter, sale, or exchange; the remainder only being subject to the tax. The record shows that the ascertainment of these necessary factors is practicable; testimony being to the effect that the flow of energy passing any point in the transmission system, as well as the amount delivered at any point on the system, can be measured with fair accuracy if proper instruments be attached. Neither the validity of the tax nor its certainty is affected because it may be necessary to ascertain, as an element in the computation, the amounts delivered in another jurisdiction. See American Mfg. Co. v. St. Louis, \n250 \nU.S. 459, 463\n, 39 S. Ct. 522; Hope Natural Gas Co. v. Hall, supra.\n It is said that the Commissioner, who administers the act has not provided for these deductions or the means for determining them. But the Commissioner must administer the act as it is construed, and it is not to be supposed that he will not now properly do so. Undoubtedly, the administration of an act like this one is attended with some difficulty. Measurements and calculations are more or less complicated. Absolute precision in either probably cannot be attained; but that is so to a greater or less degree in respect of most taxing laws. If, for example, absolute exactness of determination in respect of net income, deductions, valuation, losses, obsolescence, \n\n[286 U.S. 165, 191]\n\u00a0\n depreciation, etc., were required in cases arising under the federal income tax law, it is safe to say that the revenue from that source would be much curtailed. The law, which is said not to require impossibilities, must be satisfied, in many of its applications, with fair and reasonable approximations. Compare Smith v. Illinois Bell Tel. Co., \n282 \nU.S. 133, 150\n, 51 S. Ct. 65; Story Parchment Co. v. Paterson Parchment Paper Co., \n282 U.S. 555\n, 563-566, 51 S. Ct. 248; Commonwealth v. People's Five Cents Savings Bank, 5 Allen (87 Mass.) 428, 436.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","170":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWASHINGTON FIDELITY NAT. INS. CO. v.

Wilmer Latimer, all of Washington, D.C., for petitioner. \n\n[287 U.S. 97, 98]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. W. Gwynn Gardiner and George A. Maddox, both of Washington, D. C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent sued in the municipal court of the District of Columbia to recover the amount of an insurance policy issued by petitioner December 12, 1927, on the life of her husband who died May 22, 1929. The policy was delivered to the insured, and all premiums were paid in the District of Columbia where he lived. Adequate proof of death, plaintiff's demand for payment and defendant's refusal to pay were conceded. The policy contained these provisions: 'This Policy constitutes the entire agreement between the Company and the Insured and the holder and owner hereof. ... If the Insured ... is not in sound health on the date hereof ... the Company may declare this Policy void. ...' Section 657 of the District Code (Act of March 3, 1901, 31 Stat. 1294, as amended by Act of June 30, 1902, 32 Stat. 534 (D.C. Code, 1929, T. 5,  183)) provides: 'Each life insurance company, benefit order and association doing a life insurance business in the District of Columbia shall deliver with each policy issued by it a copy of the application made by the insured so that the whole contract may appear in said application and policy, in default of which no defense shall be allowed to such policy on account of anything contained in, or omitted from, such application.' The company did not deliver with the policy or otherwise a copy of an application therefor. Indeed, there was no evidence that any had been made. Defendant offered evidence to show that, at the date of the issue of the policy, the insured was not in sound health. Plaintiff objected on the ground that no copy of the application \n\n[287 U.S. 97, 99]\n\u00a0\n was delivered with the policy. The court, relying on the statute, sustained the objection, and refused to permit defendant to interpose that defense and gave judgment for plaintiff. The Court of Appeals affirmed. 56 F. (2d) 300.\n The sole question is whether section 657 was rightly construed.\n The Court of Appeals assumed as a matter of common knowledge that life insurance policies are issued on written applications, and that in this case one had been made by the insured. Without deciding whether that assumption is warranted, we shall consider the case as if it were shown that the assured applied in writing for the insurance in question. In the absence of a statute forbidding it, contracts of insurance may be made orally. Relief Fire Ins. Co. v. Shaw, \n94 U.S. 574\n. There is no such prohibition in the District of Columbia. In section 657 the word 'policy' and the phrase 'a copy of the application' plainly indicate that writings are meant (Trustees of the First Baptist Church v. Brooklyn Fire Ins. Co., 19 N.Y. 305, 308), and that the statute does not extend to oral applications. The construction generally put upon enactments like the one before us indicates that the principal if not the only purpose is that, if there be an application, a copy of it shall be attached to or otherwise delivered with the policy, so that the documents showing the entire agreement shall be made available to the insured. \n1\n That serves to guard the insured against misunderstanding as to his contract, and, in case of controversy with the company, to protect him against sur- \n\n[287 U.S. 97, 100]\n\u00a0\n prise, inconvenience, and danger of injustice liable to arise where the policy does not contain the entire agreement and refers for parts of it to applications or other papers. That purpose is reflected clearly by the clause that, in default of the required delivery of a copy of the application, no defense shall be allowed to such policy on account of anything 'contained in, or omitted from, such application.' And the barring of such defenses is the only consequence declared to result.\n Here the policy definitely declares that it constitutes the entire agreement between the parties. The defense interposed is based solely on one of its provisions, and has no relation to the application. The section does not require written applications to be made or declare that, where one is made but not delivered with the policy, there shall be no defense based on the provisions of the policy itself. And no reason is suggested in support of a construction of the section that would prevent defense based on a provision of the policy, even though a similar or the same provision were contained in an application. As this policy expressed the entire agreement, defendant, notwithstanding its failure to deliver a copy of the application, was entitled to interpose such defenses as would have been open to it if no application had been made. MacKinnon & Co. v. Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 89 Iowa, 170, 173, 56 N.W. 423; Imperial F. Ins. Co. v. Dunham, 117 Pa. 460, 473, 12 A. 668, 2 Am.St.Rep. 686. It follows that section 657 furnishes no support for the refusal of the trial court to permit defendant to show that the insured was not in sound health when the policy was issued.\n Judgment reversed.\n Mr. Justice STONE.\n If an insurance policy is issued on written application and the company fails to deliver a copy of it to the in- \n\n[287 U.S. 97, 101]\n\u00a0\n sured, along with the policy, the district statute, in terms, provides that 'no defense shall be allowed to such policy on account of anything contained in, or omitted from, such application.' In this case it does not appear that there was any written application, and, as the defense was based on a clause contained in the policy, which purported to embody the 'whole contract,' no case was presented calling for the application of the statute, or which would enable a court to say just what force should be given to its prohibition in a case where the written application, not delivered with the policy, is in evidence. For that reason the case should be reversed if it is not for other reasons, to be dismissed.\n I think it should be dismissed. The certiorari was granted upon a petition which set forth as grounds for its allowance that the court below, in construing the prohibition of the statute, had 'decided erroneously a question of general importance, and that the decision 'is in conflict with all decisions in other jurisdictions involving similar statutes and therefore tends to unsettle the law.' Upon the briefs and the argument, the statutes of many states were quoted, prescribing the legal consequences of the failure of the insurer to deliver to the insured, with the policy, a copy of the written application. Most of them provide only that in such cases the application is not to be considered a part of the policy or received in evidence in a suit brought upon it. None contain language like that of the present statute prohibiting any defense on the policy 'on account of anything contained in or omitted from' the application, and we have been cited to no decision of any court outside the District of Columbia in which that language or any resembling it has been considered.\n It thus appears that the construction of the statute which we were asked to review is not in the case, and, even if it were, it is of local significance only. The conflict of \n\n[287 U.S. 97, 102]\n\u00a0\n decisions asserted is not shown. Plainly the question is not of such general interest or importance as under the rules and practice of this Court warrants its review upon certiorari. For these reasons, it is the duty of this court to dismiss the writ as improvidently granted. Tyrrell v. District of Columbia, \n243 \nU.S. 1\n, 37 S.Ct. 361; Southern Power Co. v. Public Service Co., \n263 \nU.S. 508\n, 44 S.Ct. 164; Houston Oil Co. v. Goodrich, \n245 \nU.S. 440\n, 38 S.Ct. 140; Layne & Bowler Corp. v. Western Well Works, \n261 \nU.S. 387\n, 43 S.Ct. 422; Furness, Withy & Co. v. Yang-Tsze Insurance Association, \n242 \nU.S. 430\n, 37 S.Ct. 141.\n If the writ is not to be dismissed and the case is to be decided on the construction of the statute, the Court's reversal of the judgment, in the absence of the application which, for purposes of decision, it assumes to exist, can only proceed on the ground that under no circumstances could a defense based on a clause in the policy itself be said to be one 'on account of anything contained in or omitted from the application.' With that conclusion I am unable to agree. The defense here was that the insured was not in sound health at the date of the policy. Petitioner sought to establish it by showing that the state of health of the insured, then deceased, had been bad for several years before the policy was issued. If the written application were before the Court and revealed that the insured had been asked about his condition of health and had either answered fully and truthfully, or not at all, it would show, I think, that the defense, within the very meaning and purpose of the statute, was 'on account' of something 'contained in or omitted from the application,' and that the petitioner was precluded from making it.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS concurs in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] MacKinnon & Co. v.

PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION OF KANSAS(1932)\nNo. 337\nArgued: January 14, 1932Decided: February 29, 1932\n\n\n\n\n[285 U.S. 119, 120]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Robert D. Garver, of Kansas City, Mo., and Robert Stone, of Topeka, Kan., for appellant.\n\n\n[285 U.S. 119, 121]\n\u00a0\n Mr. E. H. Hatcher, of Topeka, Kan., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellant, a West Virginia corporation, owns and operates a distribution system for natural gas in Eldo \n\n[285 U.S. 119, 122]\n\u00a0\n rado, Kan. August 17, 1920, rates for supplying local consumers were fixed by order of the court of industrial relations of the state of Kansas, the body then vested with authority in the premises. July 30, 1929, the company filed application with the Public Service Commission, one of the appellees, for an increase, averring that the existing rates were insufficient to produce a fair return, and asking an investigation and the establishment of such as would be just and equitable.\n When the order of 1920 was made the appellant was purchasing gas, delivered at the city gate, from Cities Service Gas Company, and still obtains its supply from the same company. The current price is forty cents per thousand cubic feet, which is paid under a day-to-day verbal contract. This rate was originally established by the Public Utilities Commission of Kansas in March, 1923, but its order in that behalf was subsequently rescinded, for the reason that Cities Service Gas Company is an interstate carrier and not subject to regulation by the state. The forty-cent rate, therefore, is not fixed pursuant to the order or leave of any public authority.\n Cities Service Gas Company is the owner and operator of interstate pipe lines, and sells natural gas therefrom to various distributing companies. The present corporate relation between appellant and Cities Service Gas Company isas follows: The common stock of appellant is owned by Gas Service Company, the capital stock of which is in turn owned by Cities Service Company. The common stock of Cities Service Gas Company is owned by Empire Gas & Fuel Company, a controlling interest in the capital stock of which is owned by Cities Service Company. In 1923, when the forty- cent rate was put into effect, the distributing companies, including the appellant, were not affiliated with the pipe line company, but in the following years Gas Service Company has acquired control of the appellant and other local distributing com- \n\n[285 U.S. 119, 123]\n\u00a0\n panies which are dependent on the pipe line for their supply of natural gas.\n Appellant submitted to the commission a valuation of the property, on which a fair return should be earned. The showing was that there were no net earnings on this value, but an annual loss of approximately $40,000. The total expenses of operation and maintenance of the property for the year ending November 30, 1930, according to the evidence, were $283,049.07, of which far the largest item, $176,260.32, was for gas purchased. In view of these facts, the commission insisted that, in order to determine the reasonableness of the requested increase in retail charges, inquiry must be made as to the propriety of the forty-cent rate. The company declined to make any showing with respect thereto, claiming that the commission was bound to allow it as a proper element of cost in fixing the new retail scale. The commission dismissed the proceeding. The appellant then filed a bill in the district court to restrain the further enforcement of the order of August 17, 1920, or the existing rates thereby established, and to enjoin the commission from interfering with the charging of reasonable rates until such time as some lawful authority, acting in conformity with law, should approve a new schedule, and to prevent the commission, its members and representatives, from instituting or prosecuting in any court or tribunal proceedings to litigate any of the matters involved in the hearings before the commission. After answer by the appellees, the matter was heard before a court of three judges, constituted as required by section 266 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  380), on the pleadings and proofs submitted, and the bill was dismissed on the ground that the appellant had not exhausted its remedy before the commission. Thereupon this appeal was taken.\n First. The appellant asserts that the rate charged by the pipe line company for gas delivered at the city gate is an interstate rate and not the subject of regulation by any \n\n[285 U.S. 119, 124]\n\u00a0\n state authority. The soundness of this contention is conceded by the appellees. But the appellant argues that any inquiry by the state commission into the reasonableness of this charge amounts to an indirect attempt at regulation, an effort on the part of the state to circumvent the paramount federal authority over interstate commerce, and hence an attempt to do by indirection what is forbidden by the Federal Constitution. The appellees disclaim any intent to control rates charged for interstate service, but say that, as the commission's function is to set reasonable rates for the intrastate service rendered by appellant in the city of Eldorado, this necessarily requires a determination of the question whether the price paid for the gas distributed is fair and reasonable. To this end the commission insists upon its authority to make such investigation as will satisfy it upon this point.\n Having in mind the affiliation of buyer and seller and the unity of control thus engendered, we think the position of the appellees is sound, and that the court below was right in holding that, if appellant desired an increase of rates, it was bound to offer satisfactory evidence with respect to all the costs which entered into the ascertainment of a reasonable rate. Those in control of the situation have combined the interstate carriage of the commodity with its local distribution in what is in practical effect one organization. There is an absence of arms' length bargaining between the two corporate entities involved, and of all the elements which ordinarily go to fix market value. The opportunity exists for one member of the combination to charge the other an unreasonable rate for the gas furnished, and thus to make such unfair charge in part the basis of the retail rate. The state authority whose powers are invoked to fix a reasonable rate is certainly entitled to be informed whether advantage has been taken of the situation to put an unreasonable burden \n\n[285 U.S. 119, 125]\n\u00a0\n upon the distributing company, and the mere fact that the charge is made for an interstate service does not constrain the commission to desist from all inquiry as to its fairness. Any other rule would make possible the gravest injustice, and would tie the hands of the state authority in such fashion that it could not effectively regulate the intrastate service which unquestionably lies within its jurisdiction.\n The principles applicable in a rate investigation, where similar corporate relationship existed, were recently announced in Simith v. Illinois Bell Telephone Co., \n282 \nU.S. 133, 152\n, 153 S., 51 S. Ct. 65, and no purpose would be served by repetition or elaboration of what was there said.\n Second. It was shown that, in proceedings in the state courts of Kansas and in the United States District Court for Kansas, the forty-cent wholesale rate had quite recently been held reasonable with respect to sales at the gates of other cities. The decisions in those cases were put in evidence before the commission, and the contention is that these constituted at least a prima facie case for the propriety of the same rate at the city gate of Eldorado. The city, though a party to this proceeding, was not such in the cases mentioned. Obviously it is not bound by the findings made with respect to other cities and towns. Nor is the commission so bound, for it is admitted that the reasonableness of the rate as respects Eldorado was not in issue in the earlier cases. How much weight the commission should give to these adjudications we need not here determine. What we do hold is that they do not make a prima facie case in support of the charge under attack.\n Third. The appellant adverts to the fact that in its bill of complaint are included a number of averments not denied by the appellees. In brief, these are that the company does not own or produce any natural gas; that the only source of supply for the city of Eldorado is the main \n\n[285 U.S. 119, 126]\n\u00a0\n of the Cities Service Gas Company; that no supply at a lower price can be obtained from any other source; that the same rate is being charged to other distributing companies along the lines of the Cities Service Gas Company, and was being charged by another independent pipe line to another city; that an ineffectual effort had been made to find local gas available to Eldorado; and that appellant had attempted to get a lower rate from Cities Service Gas Company, but could not do so. It is urged that, as these averments were uncontradicted, they constitute, when taken with the facts previously stated, a prima facie case for the reasonableness of the rate charged. This might well be true were it not for the fact of unity of ownership and control of the pipe line and the distribution system. An averment of negotiation and effort to procure a reduction in the wholesale rate means little in the light of the fact that the negotiators are both acting in the same interest-that of the holding company which controls both. All of these facts so averred in the pleadings would be far more persuasive with respect to the propriety of the rate if the parties were independent of each other and dealing at arms' length. Where, however, they constitute but a single interest, and involve the embarkation of the total capital in what is in effect one enterprise, the elements of double profit and of the reasonableness of inter-company charges must necessarily be the subject of inquiry and scrutiny before the question as to the lawfulness of the retail rate based thereon can be satisfactorily answered.\n Fourth. The argument is made that the proofs demanded by the commission will involve an extensive and unnecessary valuation of the pipe line company's property and an analysis of its business, and that this burden should not be thrown upon appellant. Whether this is so we need not now decide. It is enough to say that, in view of the relations of the parties and the power implicit \n\n[285 U.S. 119, 127]\n\u00a0\n therein arbitrarily to fix and maintain costs as respects the distributing company which do not represent the true value of the service rendered, the state authority is entitled to a fair showing of the reasonableness of such costs, although this may involve a presentation of evidence, which would not be required in the case of parties dealing at arms' length and in the general and open market, subject to the usual safeguards of bargaining and competition.\n The judgment of the court below was right, and it is\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] No written opinion filed in court below. \n\n\n\n\n","172":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWISCONSIN v.

Bryan, of Alexandria, Va., amici curiae.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Under the reapportionment pursuant to the act of June 18, 1929 ( chapter 28, 46 Stat. 21, 26, 27,  22 (2 USCA  2a)), Mississippi is entitled to seven Representatives in Congress, instead of eight as theretofore. The Legislature of Mississippi by an Act known as House Bill No. 197, Regular Session 1932, c. 136, divided the state into seven congressional districts. The complainant, alleging that he was a citizen of Mississippi, a qualified elector under its laws, and also qualified to be a candidate for election as Representative in Congress, brought this suit to have the redistricting act of 1932 declared invalid and the restrain the defendants, state officers, from taking proceedings for an election under its provisions. The alleged grounds of invalidity were that the act violated article 1,  4, and the Fourteenth Amendment, of the Constitution of the United States, and section 3 of the Act of Congress of August 8, 1911 (chapter 5, 37 Stat. 13 (2 USCA  3)). Defendants moved to dismiss the bill (1) for want of equity, (2) for lack of equitable jurisdiction to grant the relief asked, (3) because on the facts alleged the complainant was not entitled to have his name placed upon \n\n[287 U.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n the election ballot as a candidate from the state at large, and (4) because the decree of the court would be inefficacious. The District Court, of three judges, granted an interlocutory injunction, and, after answer, which admitted the material facts alleged in the bill and set up the same grounds of defense as the motion to dismiss together with a denial of the unconstitutionality of the challenged act, the court on final hearing, on bill and answer, entered a final decree making the injunction permanent as prayed. Defendants appeal to this Court. U.S.C. tit. 28,  380 (28 USCA  380).\n The District Court held that the new districts, created by the redistricting act, were not composed of compact and contiguous territory, having as nearly as practicable the same number of inhabitants, and hence failed to comply with the mandatory requirements of section 3 of the Act of August 8, 1911. Sections 3 and 4 of that act (2 USCA  3, 4) are as follows:\n'Sec. 3. That in each State entitled under this apportionment to more than one Representative, the Representatives to the Sixty-third and each subsequent Congress shall be elected by districts composed of a contiguous and compact territory, and containing as nearly as practicable an equal number of inhabitants. The said districts shall be equal to the number of Representatives to which such State may be entitled in Congress, no district electing more than one Representative.\n\n'Sec. 4. That in case of an increase in the number of Representatives in any State under this apportionment such additional Representative or Representatives shall be elected by the State at large and the other Representatives by the districts now prescribed by law until such State shall be redistricted in the manner provided by the laws thereof and in accordance with the rules enumerated in section three of this Act; and if there be no change in the number of Representatives from a State, the Representatives thereof shall be elected from the districts now \n\n[287 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n prescribed by law until such State shall be redistricted as herein prescribed.'\n\n The act of August 8, 1911, as its title states, was an act 'For the apportionment of Representatives in Congress among the several States under the Thirteenth Census'; that is, the census of 1910. The first section of the act fixed the number of the House of Representatives and apportioned that number among the several states. Its second section related to the allotment of Representatives to the territories of Arizona and New Mexico. 2 USCA  2. The third and fourth sections expressly applied to the election of Representatives to which the state was entitled 'under this apportionment'; that is, under the apportionment under the act of 1911 pursuant to the census of 1910. Substantially the same provisions are found in prior reapportionment acts, the requirements as to compactness, contiguity, and equality in population in the new districts in which Representatives were to be elected under the new apportionment being addressed in each case to the election of Representatives 'under this apportionment'; that is, the apportionment made by the particular act. Act of June 25, 1842, c. 47,  2, 5 Stat. 491; Act of February 2, 1872, c. 11,  2, 17 Stat. 28; Act of February 25, 1882, c. 20,  3, 22 Stat. 5, 6; Act of February 7, 1891, c. 116,  3, 4, 26 Stat. 735, 736; Act of January 16, 1901, c. 93,  3, 4, 31 Stat. 733, 734.\n The act of June 18, 1929, however, in providing for the reapportionment under the Fifteenth Census (none having been made under the Fourteenth Census), omitted the requirements as to the compactness, contiguity, and equality in population, of new districts to be created under that apportionment. It did not carry forward those requirements as previous apportionment acts had done. There was, it is true, no express repeal of sections 3 and 4 of the act of 1911 and, as the act of 1929 did not deal with the subject, it contained no provision inconsistent with \n\n[287 U.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n the requirements of the act of 1911. Smiley v. Holm, \n285 \nU.S. 355, 373\n, 52 S.Ct. 397. No repeal was necessary. The requirements of sections 3 and 4 of the act of 1911 expired by their own limitation. They fell with the apportionment to which they expressly related. The inquiry is simply whether the act of 1929 carried forward the requirements which otherwise lapsed. The act of 1929 contains no provision to that effect. It was manifestly the intention of the Congress not to re-enact the provision as to compactness, contiguity, and equality in population with respect to the districts to be created pursuant to the reapportionment under the act of 1929\n\n\n This appears from the terms of the act, and its legislative history shows that the omission was deliberate. The question was up, and considered. The bill which finally became the act of 1929 was introduced in the first session of the Seventieth Congress and contained provisions similar to those of sections 3 and 4 of the act of 1911. H.R. 11,725; Cong. Rec., 70th Cong., 1st Sess., vol. 69, p. 4054. At the second session of the Seventieth Congress, the House of Representatives, after debate, struck out these provisions. Cong. Rec., 70th Cong., 2d Sess., vol. 70, pp. 1496, 1499, 1584, 1602, 1604. The bill passed in the House of Representatives in that form (Id. p. 1605), and, although reported favorably to the Senate without amendment (Id. 1711), did not pass at that session. The measure as to reapportionment was reintroduced in the Senate in the first session of the Seventy-First Congress in the form in which it had passed the House of Representatives, and had been favorably reported to the Senate in the preceding Congress; that is, without the requirements as to compactness, contiguity, and equality in population, which had been deleted in that Congress. S. 312, 71st Cong., 1st Sess., Cong. Rec. vol. 71, pp. 254, 2450. And, when, after the passage of this bill in the Senate, it was before the House of Representatives, and an effort was made to amend \n\n[287 U.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n the bill so as to make applicable the requirements of section 3 of the act of 1911 with respect to the districts to be created under the new apportionment, the amendment failed. The point of order was sustained that, as the pending bill did not relate to redistricting of the states by their Legislatures, the amendment was not germane. Cong. Rec., 71st Cong., 1st Sess., vol. 71, pp. 2279, 2280, 2363, 2364, 2444, 2445. The bill was then passed without the requirements in question. Cong. Rec., 71st Cong., 1st Sess., vol. 71, p. 2458.\n There is thus no ground for the conclusion that the act of 1929 re- enacted or made applicable to new districts the requirements of the act of 1911. That act in this respect was left as it has stood, and the requirements it had contained as to the compactness, contiguity and equality in population of districts did not outlast the apportionment to which they related.\n In this view, it is unnecessary to consider the questions raised as to the right of the complainant to relief in equity upon the allegations of the bill of complaint, or as to the justiciability of the controversy, if it were assumed that the requirements invoked by the complainant are still in effect. See Ex parte Bakelite Corporation, \n279 \nU.S. 438, 448\n, 49 S.Ct. 411. Upon these questions the Court expresses no opinion.\n The decree is reversed and the cause is remanded to the District Court with directions to dismiss the bill of complaint.\n It is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, Mr. Justice STONE, Mr. Justice ROBERTS, and Mr. Justice CARDOZO are of opinion that the decree should be reversed and the bill dismissed for want of equity, without passing upon the question whether section 3 of the Act of August 8, 1911 (2 USCA  3), is applicable. That question was not presented by the \n\n[287 U.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n pleadings or discussed in either of the opinions delivered in the District Court. 1 F.Supp. 134. It was not mentioned in the jurisdictional statement filed under Rule 12 (28 USCA  354) or in the briefs of the parties filed here. So far as appears, all the members of the lower court and both parties have assumed that section 3 is controlling. \n\n\n\n","174":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWOOLFORD REALTY CO. v.

In March, 1928, the two corporations \n\n[286 U.S. 319, 325]\n\u00a0\n filed a consolidated income tax return for 1927 under section 240 of the Revenue Act of 1926. Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, 46 (26 USCA  993). During 1927, the petitioner had a net taxable income of $36,587.62, and Piedmont had suffered during the same year a net loss of $453.80. Before its affiliation with the petitioner, it had suffered other and greater losses. Its net loss in 1925 was $43,478.25, and in 1926 $410.82, a total for the two years of $43,889.07. In the assessment of the tax for 1927, the Commissioner deducted from the petitioner's net income for that year the loss of $453.80 suffered by its affiliated corporation in the course of the same year. The consolidated net taxable income as thus adjusted was $36,133.82, on which a tax of $5,026.22 was assessed and paid. On the other hand, the Commissioner refused to deduct the Piedmont losses suffered in 1925 and 1926 before the year of affiliation. The deductions, if allowed, would have wiped out the tax. A refund having been refused, the petitioner brought this suit against the collector to recover the moneys paid. The District Court sustained a demurrer to the petition, 44 F.( 2d) 856, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, 53 F.(2d) 821. The case is here on certiorari, \n284 \nU.S. 615\n, 52 S. Ct. 209, 76 L. Ed. -.\n Section 240(a) of the Revenue Act of 1926 provides that 'corporations which are affiliated within the meaning of this section may, for any taxable year, make separate returns or, under regulations prescribed by the Commissioner with the approval of the Secretary, make a consolidated return of net income for the purpose of this chapter, in which case the taxes thereunder shall be computed and determined upon the basis of such return.'\n Section 240(b) provides that 'in any case in which a tax is assessed upon the basis of a consolidated return, the total tax shall be computed in the first instance as a unit and shall then be assessed upon the respective affiliated corporations in such proportions as may be agreed upon among them, or, in the absence of any such agree- \n\n[286 U.S. 319, 326]\n\u00a0\n ment, then on the basis of the net income properly assignable to each. ... ' (26 USCA  993(a, b).\n The general principal underlying the income tax statutes, ever since the adoption of the Sixteenth Amendment, has been the computation of gains and losses on the basis of an annual accounting for the transactions of the year. Burnet v. Sanford & Brooks Co., \n282 \nU.S. 359, 363\n, 51 S. Ct. 150. A taxpayer who seeks an allowance for losses suffered in an earlier year must be able to point to a specific provision of the statute permitting the deduction, and must bring himself within its terms. Unless he can do this, the operations of the current year must be the measure of his burden.\n The only section of the Revenue Act that made allowance in 1927 for the losses of earlier years was section 206(b), 26 USCA  937(b), upon which this controversy hinges. Its provisions are as follows:\n'If, for any taxable year, it appears upon the production of evidence satisfactory to the commissioner that any taxpayer has sustained a net loss, the amount thereof shall be allowed as a deduction in computing the net income of the taxpayer for the succeeding taxable year (hereinafter in this section called 'second year') and if such net loss is in excess of such net income (computed without such deduction), the amount of such excess shall be allowed as a deduction in computing the net income for the next succeeding taxable year ( hereinafter in this section called 'third year'); the deduction in all cases to be made under regulations prescribed by the commissioner with the approval of the Secretary.'\n\n Under that section of the statute, the losses suffered by the Piedmont Company in 1925 might have been deducted from its net income in 1926, and might thereafter, if not extinguished, have been deducted to the extent of the excess from its net income in 1927, the year in which its shares were acquired by the petitioner. But \n\n[286 U.S. 319, 327]\n\u00a0\n the Piedmont Company did not have any net income in 1927. Its operations for that year resulted in a loss. There was therefore nothing from which earlier losses could be deducted, for the net income without any such deductions was still a minus quantity. The tax for the year was nothing, and the losses of other years could not serve to make it less. The petitioner would have us hold that the minus quantities for all the years should be added together, and the total turned over by the company suffering the loss as an allowance to be made to the company realizing the gain. In that view of the statute, a net loss for a taxable year becomes, for the purpose of determining the burdens of affiliated corporations, though not for any other, the equivalent of a net income, and deductions which the statute has said shall be made only from net income may, none the less, by some process of legerdemain, be subtracted from the loss.\n There are two fundamental objections to this method of computation. In the first place, an interpretation of net income, by which it is also a net loss, involves the reading of the words of the statute in a strained and unnatural sense. The metamorphosis is too great to be viewed without a shock. Certainly the average man suffering a net loss from the operations of his business would learn with surprise that, within the meaning of the Congress, the amount of his net loss was also the amount of his net income. 'The popular or received import of words furnishes the general rule for the interpretation of public laws.' Maillard v. Lawrence, 16 How. 251, 261; Old Colony R. R. v. Commissioner, \n284 \nU.S. 552, 560\n, 52 S. Ct. 211. In the second place, the statute has given notice to the taxpayer that the aggregate of minus quantities is not to be turned over as a credit to an affiliated company, but is to be used in another way. If the loss for the first year is more than the income for the second, the excess is to be carried over to a third year, and deducted from the net \n\n[286 U.S. 319, 328]\n\u00a0\n income, if any, returnable for that year, at which time the process of carrying over is to end. Cf. Report of Senate Committee in charge of the Revenue Act of 1924, Senate Report No. 398, 68th Congress, 1st Session, p. 20. Obviously, the direction to apply the excess against the income of a later year is inconsistent with a purpose to allow it to an affiliated company as an immediate deduction from income of the current year. Adherence to the one practice excludes adherence to the other. Cf. Treasury Regulations 69 promulgated under the Act of 1926, arts. 634, 635, 1622. The fact is not to be ignored that each of two or more corporations joining (under section 240) in a consolidated return is none the less a taxpayer. Commissioner v. Ginsburg Co. (C. C. A.) 54 F.(2d) 238, 239. By the express terms of the statute, section 240(b), the tax when computed is to be assessed, in the absence of agreement to the contrary, upon the respective affiliated corporations 'on the basis of the net income properly assignable to each.' 'The term 'taxpayer' includes any person ... subject to a tax imposed by this Act.' Revenue Act of 1921,  2(9), 42 Stat. 227. A corporation does not cease to be such a person by affiliating with another.\n The petitioner insists that a construction of 206(b), excluding the allowance of past losses except as a set-off against the income of the company sustaining them, is inconsistent with the accepted construction of section 234 of the same act (26 USCA  986) whereby the deductions there enumerated are made from the net income exhibited by the consolidated return without reference to their origin in the business of one company or another. Section 234 provides that in computing the net income of corporations subject to a tax there shall be allowed as deductions: '(1) All the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business. ... (2) All interest paid or accrued within the taxable year on its indebtedness. ... (3) Taxes paid \n\n[286 U.S. 319, 329]\n\u00a0\n or accrued within the taxable year. ... (4) Losses sustained during the taxable year and not compensated for by insurance or otherwise. ... (5) Debts ascertained to be worthless and charged off within the taxable year.' The points of difference between the allowances under section 206(b) upon the one hand and those under section 234 upon the other are important and obvious. The deductions allowable under section 234 represent expenses paid or accrued or losses suffered during the same taxable year covered by the return. They are thus included in the net income according to the fundamental concept of such income reflected in the statute, instead of falling within an exception which, irrespective of its precise extension, is a departure from the general scheme. Even more decisive is the consideration that there is nothing in section 234 prohibiting the allowance by one unit of its current losses and expenses as a deduction for the benefit of the affiliated group, nor any statement that the use to be made of them shall follow other lines. On the other hand, section 206(b) provides, as we have seen, that the excess of loss remaining over the current net income of the taxpayer who has suffered it shall be carried over into the next year, and, if need be, into a third, and thereafter disregarded. Subtle arguments have been addressed to us in support of the contention that the loss of one affiliated company suffered in earlier years may be allocated to the other without infraction of the rule that the loss shall be carried forward. They are not lacking in plausibility, but we cannot hold that they comport with the directions of the statute, 'if we take words in their plain popular meaning, as they should be taken here.' United States v. Kirby Lumber Co., \n284 \nU.S. 1, 3\n, 52 S. Ct. 4.\n Doubt, if there can be any, is not likely to survive a consideration of the mischiefs certain to be engendered by any other ruling. A different ruling would mean that a prosperous corporation could buy the shares of one that \n\n[286 U.S. 319, 330]\n\u00a0\n had suffered heavy losses and wipe out thereby its own liability for taxes. The mind rebels against the notion that Congress in permitting a consolidated return was willing to foster an opportunity for juggling so facile and so obvious. Submission to such mischiefs would be necessary if the statute were so plain in permitting the deduction as to leave no room for choice between that construction and another. Expediency may tip the scales when arguments are nicely balanced. True, of course, it is that in a system of taxation so intricate and vast as ours there are many other loopholes unsuspected by the framers of the statute, many other devices whereby burdens can be lowered. This is no reason, however, for augmenting them needlessly by the addition of another. The petitioner was prosperous in 1927, and so far as the record shows for many years before. Piedmont was unfortunate in 1927, and unfortunate in the years preceding. The petitioner, affiliating in 1927, has been allowed the loss suffered by Piedmont though the business of that year as a permissible deduction from the consolidated balance. What it claims is a right to deduct the losses that were suffered in earlier years when the companies were separate. To such an attempt the reaction of an impartial mind is little short of instinctive that the deduction is unreasonable and cannot have been intended by the framers of the statute. Analysis of the sections shows that there is no gap between what they wrote and what in reason they must have meant.\n The petitioner refers us to the Revenue Act of 1928 (45 Stat. 791, 835) and to Treasury Regulations adopted thereunder as supporting its position. These provisions were adopted after the liability for the tax of 1927 had accrued, and they can have little bearing upon the meaning to be given to statutes then in force. The Revenue Act of 1928,  141(b), 26 USCA  2141, protects against unfair evasions in \n\n[286 U.S. 319, 331]\n\u00a0\n the making of consolidated returns by increasing the discretionary power of the Commissioner in prescribing regulations. 'The Commissioner, with the approval of the Secretary, shall prescribe such regulations as he may deem necessary in order that the tax liability of an affiliated group of corporations making a consolidated return and of each corporation in the group, both during and after the period of affiliation, may be determined, computed, assessed, collected, and adjusted in such manner as clearly to reflect the income and to prevent avoidance of tax liability.' Under the authority so conferred the Commissioner has adopted the following regulation (Treasury Regulations 75, art. 41), applicable only to the taxable year 1929, and to taxable years thereafter:\n'A net loss sustained by a corporation prior to the date upon which its income is included in the consolidated return of an affiliated group (including any net loss sustained prior to the taxable year 1929) shall be allowed as a deduction in computing the consolidated net income of such group in the same manner, to the same extent, and upon the same conditions as if the consolidated income were the income of such corporation; but in no case in which the affiliated status is created after January 1, 1929, will any such net loss be allowed as a deduction in excess of the cost or the aggregate basis of the stock of such corporation owned by the members of the group.'\n\n The provision in this regulation limiting the deductions to the cost or value of the stock will make it profitless hereafter to purchase stock for the purpose of gaining the benefit of deductions in excess of what is paid.\n In holding that the Piedmont losses of 1925 and 1926 were properly excluded from the consolidated return, we are in accord with the preponderance of authority in the other federal courts.
