States Supreme Court\nADAMS EXP CO. v. COM. OF KENTUCKY(1907)\nNo. 332\nArgued: Decided: May 13, 1907\n\n\n\n Messrs. Lawrence Maxwell, Jr., E. F. Trabue, and Joseph S. Graydon for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. N. B. Hays and Charles H. Morris for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case differs from the preceding in the fact that it was tried by the court without a jury. In all other respects it is \n\n[206 U.S. 138, 139]\n\u00a0\n substantially the same. There was the same averment in the indictment; and, more than that, there was an express stipulation made between counsel, pending the trial, in these words:\n'It is further agreed at this point that the whisky about which the witness testified was delivered by the Adams Express Company and received by it in its office in Cincinnati in the usual course of business as a common carrier, and carried by it to Barbourville, Kentucky, by the method commonly known as C. O. D.'\n\n There is nothing, therefore, to distinguish this case in principle from the preceding, and the same judgment will be entered in this as in that.\n Mr. Justice Harlan dissents. \n\n\n\n","1":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nADAMS EXP CO. v. COM. OF KENTUCKY(1907)\nNo. 331\nArgued: Decided: May 13, 1907\n\n\n\n On February 17, 1904, a grand jury returned into the circuit court of Laurel county, Kentucky, an indictment against Joe Newland and the Adams Express Company, charging that 'the said Joe Newland and the Adams Express Company, the latter being a partnership engaged in and carrying on the business of a common carrier of packages, goods, wares, and merchandise, by the method known as express . . . did, in Laurel county, Kentucky, on the 17th day of February, 1904, unlawfully and wilfully carry for and deliver to George Meece a parcel, package, shipment, and quantity of intoxicating, spirituous, vinous, and malt liquors . . . to be and which was paid for on delivery at East Bernstadt in said Laurel county, same being at the time a shipment commonly known and called C. O. D. shipments , . . . said shipment and delivery being made and done at the time by said Joe Newland and said Adams Express Company in the usual course of business of said Adams Express Company.' \n\n[206 U.S. 129, 130]\n\u00a0\n Subsequently the action was dismissed as to Newland, and, on a plea of not guilty, the case was tried before a jury and resulted in a verdict finding the company guilty and fixing the fine at $60. The instructions of the court were as follows:\n'Gentlemen of the July: 1. If you shall believe from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant, Adams Express Company, is a copartnership, formed of persons whose names and number were unknown to the grand jury that found this indictment, and who lived out of the state of Kentucky, but are doing business in the state of Kentucky and in Laurel county, Kentucky, and under the firm name and style of 'Adams Express Company,' and that the said Adams Express Company, in this county and within twelve months next before the finding of the indictment herein, knowingly delivered to the witness, George Meece, spirituous, vinous, or malt liquors in quantities of less than 5 gallons at the time mentioned by the witness, and received the pay therefor, and that said company received any pay whatever for its service in that behalf, then you should find the defendant guilty and fix its punishment at any fine not less than $60.00 nor more than $100.00, in your discretion, according to proof.\n\n'2. The court says to the jury that if they shall believe from the evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the agent or agents of the defendant's company that accepted, received, transported, or delivered the package mentioned in evidence by the witness Meece, knew, or might, by the exercise of such care as persons of ordinary prudence are accustomed to use in the ordinary transactions of life, have known the contents of the package delivered to the witness, then the defendant company is chargeable with such knowledge, and should be held to know the contents of such package.'\n\n Judgment was entered on the verdict, which was affirmed by the court of appeals of the state, 27 Ky. L. Rep. 1096, 87 S. W. 1111, and from that court the case was \n\n[206 U.S. 129, 131]\n\u00a0\n brought here on writ of error. The act under which the prosecution was had is subsec. 4 of  2557b, Kentucky Statutes, 1903, commonly called the 'C. O. D.' law, which is part of the general local option law as amended in 1902, and which reads:\n'All the shipments of spirituous, vinous, or malt liquors, to be paid for on delivery, commonly called 'C. O. D. shipments' into any county, city, town, district, or precinct where said act is in force, shall be unlawful and shall be deemed sales of such liquors at the place where the money is paid or the goods delivered; the carrier and his agents selling or delivering such goods shall be liable jointly with the vendor thereof.'\n\n Messrs. Lawrence Maxwell, Jr., E. F. Trabue, and Joseph S. Graydon for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[206 U.S. 129, 133]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. N. B. Hays and Charles H. Morris for defendant in error.\n\n\n[206 U.S. 129, 135]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n The testimony showed that the package, containing a gallon of whisky, was shipped from Cincinnati, Ohio, to George Meece, at East Bernstadt, Kentucky. The transaction was therefore one of interstate commerce, and within the exclusive jurisdiction of Congress. The Kentucky statute is obviously an attempt to regulate such interstate commerce. This is hardly questioned by the court of appeals, and is beyond dispute under the decisions of this court.\n In Vance v. W. A. Vandercook Co. \n170 \nU.S. 438, 444\n, 42 S. L. ed. 1100, 1103, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 674, 676, Mr. Justice White, delivering the opinion of the court, said:\n'Equally well established is the proposition that the right to send liquors from one state into another, and the act of sending the same, is interstate commerce, the rugulation whereof has been committed by the Constitution of the United States to Congress, and, hence, that a state law which denies such a right, or substantially interferes with or hampers the same, is in conflict with the Constitution of the United States.'\n\n In Rhodes v. Iowa, \n170 \nU.S. 412, 426\n, 42 S. L. ed. 1088, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 664, 669, it was held that the Wilson act [26 Stat. at L. 313 chap. 728, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3177] 'was not intended to and did not cause the power of the state to attach to an interstate commerce shipment, whilst the merchandise was in transit under such shipment, and until its arrival at the point of destination and delivery there to the consignee.'\n The court of appeals sustained the judgment upon these facts: Meece testified that he had not ordered the whisky; that he was not expecting any from Cincinnati, but, on going with his brother to the company's office at East Bernstadt, was told that it was there awaiting him; that he requested the agent to hold it until the succeeding Saturday, when he would come, pay for and take it away; and that on that day he did so, paying $3.85 for the whisky, the express charges \n\n[206 U.S. 129, 136]\n\u00a0\n having been prepaid at Cincinnati. The court held that, by reason of the retention of the package by the agent, the company ceased to hold it as carrier, and had become a mere bailee or warehouseman; that, therefore, the statute, as applied to the transaction, was not a regulation of commerce; and, further, that, as Meece had not ordered the whisky, there was no contract for the sale of it in Cincinnati, but only by the company at East Bernstadt, in Kentucky; that while there was no testimony showing that the company's agent at Cincinnati knew that the whisky had not been ordered by Meece, yet its agent in Kentucky was so informed, and, therefore, the company was possessed, through its agent, of knowledge that there was no interstate transaction, and, with that knowledge, sold the whisky to Meece. But that the agent consented to hold the whisky until Saturday did not destroy the character of the transaction as one of interstate commerce is settled by the recent case of Heyman v. Southern R. Co. \n203 U.S. 270\n, 51 L. ed. 178, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 104. In that case whisky had been forwarded to a party in Charleston, South Carolina, and after its arrival at Charleston was placed in the warehouse of the railroad company by its agent, and there seized by constables, asserting their right so to do under the dispensary law of South Carolina. The point was made and sustained by the supreme court of the state of Georgia, in which state an action had been brought against the company for the value of the goods, that when the goods were placed in the warehouse the carrier was thenceforward liable only as a warehouseman. In passing upon this contention we said (p. 276, 51 L. ed. p. 178, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 107):\n'As the general principle is that goods moving in interstate commerce cease to be such commerce only after delivery and sale in the original package, and as the settled rule is that the Wilson law was not an abdication of the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce, since that law simply affects an incident of such commerce by allowing the state power to attach after delivery and before sale, we are not concerned with whether, under the law of any particular state, the \n\n[206 U.S. 129, 137]\n\u00a0\n liability of a railroad company as carrier ceases and becomes that of a warehouseman on the goods reaching their ultimate destination, before notice and before the expiration of a reasonable time for the consignee to receive the goods from the carrier. For, whatever may be the divergent legal rules in the several states concerning the precise time when the liability of a carrier as such in respect to the carriage of goods ends, they cannot affect the general principle as to when an interstate shipment ceases to be under the protection of the commerce clause of the Constitution, and thereby comes under the control of the state authority.'\n\n With reference to the testimony as to the knowledge by the company of the fact that the whisky had not been ordered by the consignee, it is sufficient to say that the averment in the indictment is that the express company was engaged in the business of a common carrier of packages, etc., and that the shipment and delivery were made and done in the usual course of its business. This excludes necessarily the assumption that the transaction was one of sale by the express company at East Bernstadt, and of course the company was under no obligation to offer testimony in support of that which the state admitted to be the fact.\n We do not mean to intimate that an express company may not also be engaged in selling liquor in a state, contrary to its laws, or that the fact that the consignee did not order a shipment might not be evidence for a jury to consider upon the question whether the company was not, in addition to its express business, also selling liquor contrary to the statutes. It is enough to hold, as we do, that under the averments of this indictment such testimony is immaterial. It is, of course, a question of fact whether a carrier is confining itself strictly to its business as a carrier, or participating in illegal sales. The consignor alone may be trying to evade the statute. He may forward the liquors in the expectation that the consignee will, when informed of their arrival, take and pay for them. So the fact that there is no previous order by the consignee \n\n[206 U.S. 129, 138]\n\u00a0\n may not be conclusive of the carrier's wrongdoing, but still it is entitled to consideration in determining that question.\n Much as we may sympathize with the efforts to put a stop to the sales of intoxicating liquors in defiance of the policy of a state, we are not at liberty to recognize any rule which will nullify or tend to weaken the power vested by the Constitution in Congress over interstate commerce.\n The judgment of the Court of Appeals of Kentucky is reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Mr. Justice Harlan dissents. \n\n\n\n","2":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nALLEN v. U S(1907)\nNo. 192\nArgued: Decided: February 25, 1907\n\n\n\n Messrs. Charles Calvert Lancaster and Herbert E. Smith for appellant.\n Assistant Attorney General Van Orsdel, Special Assistant Attorney Ashford, and Solicitor General Hoyt for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a claim made by a commissioner of the United States circuit court for services rendered between January 29, 1886, \n\n[204 U.S. 581, 582]\n\u00a0\n and January 20, 1892, charges for which were disallowed by the officers of the Treasury Department. It is necessary to state only the items and matters now in controversy. Item 1, so far as disallowed by the court of claims, is for drawing complaints which charged offenses under the Revised Statutes, title 'Crimes' (70) chap. 7 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3711) ( Crimes against the Elective Franchise and Civil Rights of Citizens) and upon which warrants never were served 'because inquiry developed no offense had been committed.' The disallowed portion of item 2 is for drawing jurats to similar complaints of which the same facts were true. Item 11 is for certifying complaints for offenses under said chap. 7, the claimant being the chief supervisor of elections, to whom, he, as commissioner, certified the complaints. Item 20 is for filing and entering similar complaints, in civilrights proceedings, where the warrants were returned unexecuted by the marshal. Item 23 is for drawing depositions for complaints in similar proceedings, where 'no warrant issued as the result of scrutiny of lists of voters by commissioner and inquiries at residences.' These are the disallowed claims brought here by this appeal.\n By Rev. Stat.  1986, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1265, district attorneys and others mentioned are to be paid for their services under the provisions for enforcing said chap. 7 'the same fees as are allowed to them for like services in other cases.' The sentence then goes on: 'and where the proceedings are before a commissioner he shall be entitled to a fee of ten dollars for his services in each case, inclusive of all services incident to the arrest and examination.' It is established and admitted that this fee is not earned (because there is not a 'case' within the meaning of the section) unless there be an arrest and an examination. Southworth v. United States, \n151 \nU.S. 179, 185\n, 38 S. L. ed. 119, 121, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 274, \n161 U.S. 639\n, 40 L. ed. 835, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 694. And again, it is plain that the fee, when it is earned, covers all services; as sufficiently appears from the contrast to the allowance of the usual fees to others in the earlier part of the same sentence and from the final words of the entitling clause. These two propositions granted, it seems to us not \n\n[204 U.S. 581, 583]\n\u00a0\n to need argument to conclude that unless the fee is earned the commissioner gets no other. This section having supplanted the usual provisions of  823, 828 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 632, 635),  847 for the cases to which it refers, cannot be held to leave open a resort to  847 when the conditions attached to the substituted compensation are not fulfilled. This disposes of all items except 11, which stands on a different ground. As to that a few words are enough. By Rev. Stat.  2027, it was the claimant's duty as commissioner to forward the original complaint, etc. to the chief supervisor for the judicial district. As he was supervisor as well as commissioner this section merely required a change in the character of his custody. No certificate was necessary, and if the complaints were certified it can have been only for the purpose of charging fees. But further, if that duty had been added to the others in connection with cases covered by  1986, the mere fact that the addition was by a later statute would not break in upon the rule established by  1986, that the compensation for all the services was entire.\n The first item is not for the whole service of drawing the complaints. It admits the receipt of 15 cents per folio and demands 5 cents more on the strength of cases decided after the claimant had been paid upon his former account. United States v. Ewing, \n140 U.S. 142\n, 35 L. ed. 388, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 743; United States v. Barber, \n140 U.S. 164\n, 35 L. ed. 396, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 749. These cases being decisions under Rev. Stat.  847, are not in point. But, if that be in any way material, they had the effect of inducing the applicant to open his account. The present is called a new account in argument, to be sure. But it is hard to conceive a more distinct opening than the demand of money in addition to sums received at the time as full payment for indivisible items. On the claimant's own view of his rights, there were not two charges for each folio, one for 15 cents and another for 5. He asserted one indivisible right on which he had been paid 15 cents in full, and he now said that that was not enough. The United States, by way of counterclaim to this attempt \n\n[204 U.S. 581, 584]\n\u00a0\n to get additional pay, demanded the sums already paid to the claimant contrary to the principle that we have laid down, and the court of claims allowed an offset of $3,120, found to have been paid by mistake, against the larger sum that it found due to the claimant. We see no reason to doubt the right of the United States, or the legality of its asserting that right by counterclaim. Wisconsin C. R. Co. v. United States, \n164 U.S. 190\n, 41 L. ed. 399, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 45; United States v. Burchard, \n125 U.S. 176\n, 31 L. ed. 662, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 832; McElrath v. United States, \n102 U.S. 426\n, 26 L. ed. 189. It is urged that the account was approved by the United States circuit court. The account was approved, 'subject to revision by the accounting officers of the United States Treasury' only. On the findings on which the case comes before us this qualified apporval has no weight. One portion of the counterclaim is for dates later than the filing of the claim. But, in view of the broad language of the statutes ( 'all set-offs, counterclaims, claims for damages, whether liquidated or unliquidated, or other demands whatsoever,' Rev. Stat.  1059, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 734, clause 'second;' act of March 3, 1887, chap. 359,  1, 24 Stat. at L. 505, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 752, clause 'second'), we are of opinion that it properly was allowed with the rest.\n The case was elaborately argued at the bar, and is discussed at length in printed briefs. We have esamined all the details of the latter, but do not deem it necessary to add more to the careful consideration that the case received in the court of claims.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","3":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nAMERICAN EXP CO. v. COM. OF KENTUCKY(1907)\nNo. 583\nArgued: Decided: May 13, 1907\n\n\n\n Messrs. Edmund F. Trabue, Lawrence Maxwell, Jr., John C. Doolan, Attilla Cox, Jr., and Joseph S. Graydon for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. N. B. Hays and Charles H. Morris for defendant in error. \n\n[206 U.S. 139, 140]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case, like the two preceding, was a prosecution of the express company for a violation of the Kentucky statute in respect to 'C. O. D.' shipments. It was tried in the circuit court before a jury, which returned a verdict of guilty, and fixed the penalty at $100 fine, which verdict was sustained and judgment entered thereon by the circuit court. The company appealed to the court of appeals, which affirmed the judgment (30 Ky. L. Rep. 207, 97 S. W. 807), and thereupon the case was brought here on writ of error.\n The consignee testified that he did not give an order for the shipment, while there was testimony on behalf of the consignor that such an order was filed with it in the name of the consignee, and the shipment made upon that order. The brief of the attorney general in the court of appeals, after referring to the testimony of a witness on behalf of the company, said:\n'It will appear from his evidence that he resides in Cincinnati, Ohio, and is manager for a wholesale liquor firm located in said city; that on March 21st, 1905, he received an order filed as an Exhibit 'X' from Richard Graham of Hodgensville, Kentucky, for an order of whisky to be sent C. O. D., for the delivery of which the warrant herein was issued against the appellant company; that upon this order the whisky in question was shipped to said Graham at Hodgensville, Kentucky, and delivered to him and the charges therefor paid to the appellant company, who returned the same to the said house or firm in Cincinnati, Ohio. There is no proof to show that the express company had any knowledge or information as to the contents of said package so delivered, and there is nothing to show any notice to it whatever of the contents of said package.\n\n ... * *\n'We, however, desire the court to pass upon the question, \n\n[206 U.S. 139, 141]\n\u00a0\n in order that the many complications growing out of transactions similar to this may be simplified, and the multitude of litigations growing out of the same lessened, whether or not a company similar to the appellant can legally accept the price for whisky shipped into a local option district contrary to law, thus constitute itself a collecting agency for one who is, under the shield of interstate commerce, protected and permitted to ship whisky into such districts. We are of opinion that an express company has no inherent right under the laws of this state or under the protection of interstate commerce to assume a duty not required of it, as a common carrier, and to do that which is in violation of the laws of this state. Because we believe that this record in its present shape does not show that the appeal from the police court to the circuit court of Larue county was properly and legally taken, and for the further reason that the express company has no right, in violation of law, to accept the price in a local option district of whisky shipped C. O. D., we ask that the judgment be affirmed.'\n\n In view of the concession and contention of the attorney general we are of the opinion that there is nothing to substantially distinguish this case from the preceding. The same judgment, therefore, will be rendered in this case as in those.\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan, dissenting:\n I do not think that these are cases of legitimate interstate commerce. They show only devices or tricks by the express company to evade or defeat the laws of Kentucky relating to the sale of spirituous, vinous, or malt liquors. I dissent from the opinion and judgment in each case. \n\n\n\n","4":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nAMERICAN R. CO. OF PORTO RICO v. CASTRO(1907)\nNo. 151\nArgued: Decided: February 25, 1907\n\n\n\n Julio P. Castro, defendant in error, was plaintiff in the court below, and the plaintiff in error, the American Railroad Company, a New York corporation doing business in Porto Rico, was defendant. The action was commenced by the filing of a complaint in the office of the clerk of the court at Mayaguez, Porto Rico. Damages in the sum of $15,000 were prayed, because of the alleged negligent killing of the daughter of the plaintiff by a train of the company, whilst she, with other persons, was attempting to pass, in a vehicle, over the railroad of the defendant, at a point where it intersected a public highway leading from the town of San German to the town of Mayaguez.\n A demurrer to the complaint was filed, and also the following plea to the jurisdiction of the court\n'Defendant, in the above-entitled action, comes now, by its attorney, F. H. Dexter, and objects to the jurisdiction \n\n[204 U.S. 453, 454]\n\u00a0\n of this court to try this cause under the terms and provisions of  670 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 545), for the reason that all terms of this court held in the city of Mayaguez, under and by virtue of the terms and provisions of the act of April 12, 1900 [31 Stat. at. L. 77, chap. 191], creating a civil government in Porto Rico, and particularly the present term, at which the above cause is set for trial, is a special term of this court, and, therefore, this court is without jurisdiction to try the issues in this cause by a jury.\n\n'Wherefore, defendant prays for an order either dismissing this cause or transferring the same for trial at a regular term of this court to be held at either San Juan or Ponce.'\n\n After the entry of an order overruling the demurrer and the plea to jurisdiction, an answer was filed and the case was tried by a jury. A verdict was rendered in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of $1,600. The objection to jurisdiction was renewed in a motion to arrest the judgment, and, after the overruling thereof, a bill of exceptions was settled by the trial judge, containing exceptions taken during the trial to the admission and rejection of evidence and to instructions given and refused. The case was then brought to this court.\n Messrs. Frederic D. McKenney, Francis H. Dexter, and John Spalding Flannery for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Frederick L. Cornwell for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice White:\n\n Mr. Justice White, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n By the act of April 12, 1900 (31 Stat. at L. 85, chap. 191), the general rule governing the right of this court to review by writs of error or appeal final decisions of the district court of the United States for Porto Rico was made as to amount \n\n[204 U.S. 453, 455]\n\u00a0\n to conform to that obtaining as to the territories of the United States, viz., $5,000. As this case does not involve the requisite jurisdictional amount, it follows that the right of review does not exist unless the case is within the provision of the statute conferring jurisdiction to review in this court 'in all cases where . . . an act of Congress is brought in question and the right claimed thereunder is denied.'\n It has been settled that where, in the course of litigation pending in the court just referred to, a party asserts a right under an act of Congress, the act 'is brought in question,' and when the right so claimed is denied the case can be brought here. Serralles v. Esbri, \n200 U.S. 103\n, 50 L. ed. 391, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 176; Rodriguez v. United States, \n198 U.S. 156\n, 49 L. ed. 994, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 617; Crowley v. United States, \n194 U.S. 466\n, 48 L. ed. 1078, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 731.\n It is undoubted that the plea to the jurisdiction filed and insisted upon below asserted on the record a right under an act of Congress, which right was denied. But, in harmony with the rule which governs where a right under the Constitution, etc., of the United States is asserted in a case which is brought to this court from a state court, and in accord with the same rule which also governs cases originally brought in a court of the United States (New Orleans Waterworks Co. v. Louisiana, \n185 U.S. 336\n, 46 L. ed. 936, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 691, and cases cited; Newburyport Water Co. v. Newburyport, \n193 U.S. 561\n, 48 L. ed. 795, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 553), we are of opinion that the mere assertion of a Federal right and its denial do not justify our assuming jurisdiction where it indubitably appears that the Federal right asserted is frivolous, that is, without color or merit. We think the case at bar is of this character.\n As appears in the Revised Statutes, it has been the uniform practice of Congress to fix both the time and place for holding sessions of the district and circuit courts of the United States, which, for convenience of expression, have been styled the regular terms of court. Rev. Stat.  572, 658, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 464, 530. Upon the district judge has also been conferred the power of designating the time and place of holding special terms of the dis- \n\n[204 U.S. 453, 456]\n\u00a0\n trict court, in which any business might be transacted which might be disposed of at a regular term. Id.  581, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 477. The asserted application to the district court of Porto Rico of the provision as to special terms of the circuit courts is that upon which was rested the claim of statutory right to exemption from a trial of the cause by jury at Mayaguez, which was denied by the court below, and forms the basis for the contention that this court must exercise jurisdiction to pass upon the assigned errors. The section reads as follows:\n'Sec. 670. At any special term of a circuit court in any district in Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, North Carolina, Virginia, and Wisconsin any business may be transacted which might be transacted at any regular term of such court. At any special term of a circuit court in any other district it shall be competent for the court to entertain jurisdiction of, and to hear and decide, all cases in equity, cases in error or on appeal, issues of law, motions in arrest of judgment, motions for a new trial, and all other motions, and to award executions and other final process, and to do and transact all other business and direct all other proceedings in all causes pending in the circuit court, except trying any cause by a jury, in the same way and with the same effect as the same might be done at any regular session of said court.'\n\n The application of this section, it is contended, results from the concluding words of the following portion of  34 of the act of April 12, 1900\n\n\n'The district court of the United States for Porto Rico . . . shall have, in addition to the ordinary jurisdiction of district courts of the United States, jurisdiction of all cases cognizant in the circuit courts of the United States, and shall proceed therein in the same manner as a circuit court.'\n\n'Rev. Stat.  670 is to be interpreted in the light of  669 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 545), reading as follows:\n\n'Section 669. In the districts not mentioned in the five preceding sections [California, Oregon, Nevada, Kentucky, In- \n\n[204 U.S. 453, 457]\n\u00a0\n diana, Tennessee, North Carolina, Virginia, and Wisconsin being the districts mentioned] the presiding judge of any circuit court may appoint special sessions thereof, to be held at the places where the regular sessions are held.'\n\n Keeping in mind that the substantially uniform rule stated in Rev. Stat.  664 to 669 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 543-545) requires the holding of special terms of a circuit court at the place where the regular sessions are authorized to be held, it follows that a special term of a circuit court of the United States, as the expression is employed in Rev. Stat.  670, is a session ordered for the disposal of business, supplementary to a regular term, and to be held at the place fixed by Congress for holding such regular term. When the plain result of the legislation just referred to is noted it is apparent that there is no color whatever for the pretension that Rev. Stat.  670 had any possible application to the term at which this case was tried. That term was held under authority conferred by that portion of  34 of the act of April 12, 1900, where, referring to the district court of Porto Rico, it was provided:\n'Regular terms of said court shall be held in San Juan, commencing on the second Monday in April and October of each year, and also at Ponce on the second Monday in January of each year, and special terms may be held at Mayaguez at such other stated times as said judge may deem expedient.'\n\n On the face of this provision it is apparent that it was the intention of Congress to authorize the holding of sessions of the court at Mayaguez at times to be specially designated by the district judge. It cannot be said that the word 'special' in the act was intended to affix to the terms authorized by Congress to be held at Mayaguez the character of special terms, as contradistinguished from regular terms, within the purview of Rev. Stat.  670, without reducing the statute to an absurdity, for unless the act authorized the holding of regular terms at Mayaguez it would be impossible to conceive of the holding of special terms at that place in the sense of Rev. Stat.  670. What the provision in question plainly \n\n[204 U.S. 453, 458]\n\u00a0\n meant was that regular terms should be held at Ponce and San Juan at the times fixed by Congress in the statute and that the same character of term might be held at Mayaguez at a time to be specially designated by the district judge.\n Dismissed for want of jurisdiction. \n\n\n\n","5":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nAMERICAN SMELTING & REFINING CO. v. PEOPLE OF STATE OF COLORADO(1907)\nNo. 143\nArgued: Decided: January 7, 1907\n\n\n\n\n[204 U.S. 103, 104]\n\u00a0\n The writ of error in this case brings up for review the judgment of the supreme court of Colorado, which affirmed the judgment of the trial court, forfeiting the right of the plaintiff in error, hereinafter called the corporation, to do business as a foreign corporation within the state until a certain tax therein adjudged to be due should be paid. The corporation refused to pay the tax, and thereupon, at the instance of the district attorney and the attorney general of the state, a proceeding in the nature of quo warranto against the corporaction was commenced for the purpose of obtaining a forfeiture of the franchise of the corporation for its failure to pay the 'annual state corporation license tax.' The defense set up that the tax was a violation of the Federal Constitution as impairing the obligation of a contract, and in other particulars named. Upon the trial the court found that there was due to the state of Colorado the sum of $4,000, being the amount of the annual tax due by reason of the statute, which was held valid. A decree was thereupon entered, forfeiting the right of the corporation to do business within the limits of the state of Colorado until the tax was paid, and it was 'absolutely and wholly deprived of all rights and privileges within the state of Colorado until such tax is paid.' Upon appeal to the supreme court of the state this judgment was affirmed, and the corporation then sued out this writ of error.\n The corporation was incorporated April 4, 1899, in New Jersey, and it is permitted by its articles of incorporation to do business in other states, and to carry on a general ore reduction, milling, mining, and other business mentioned in such \n\n[204 U.S. 103, 105]\n\u00a0\n articles. On April 28, 1899, it duly made application to the proper state authorities of Colorado for permission to enter and transact business in that state, under the laws thereof. At this time its capital stock was $65, 000,000, divided into shares of the par value of $100 each. Subsequently, and on April 8, 1901, its capital stock was increased to $100,000,000, and the certificate of such increase was duly filed in Colorado. Section 499 ( Mills' Annotated Statutes of Colorado), after making provision for the performance of certain conditions by a foreign corporation entering the state, continued: 'And such corporation shall be subjected to all the liabilities, restrictions, and duties which are or may be imposed upon such corporations of like character organized under the general laws of this state, and shall have no other or greater powers.' Section 500 of the same statute provided that a foreign corporation must file in the office of the secretary of state a copy of its charter, or, if incorporated under a general corporation law, a copy of such certificate of incorporation, and such general corporation law, duly certified. Section 1 of chapter 51 of the Session Laws of Colorado for 1897 provided that every foreign corporation should pay to the secretary of state, for the use of the state, a fee of $10 if the capital stock did not exceed $50,000. If in excess of that sum the corporation was to pay 'the further sum of 15 cents on each and every thousand dollars of such excess, and a like fee of 15 cents on each thousand of the amount of each subsequent increase of stock. The said fee shall be due and payable upon the filing of certificate of incorporation, articles of association, or charter of said incorporation, joint stock company, or association, in the office of the secretary of state; and no such corporation, joint stock company, or association shall have or exercise any corporate powers or be permitted to do any business in this state until the said fee shall have been paid; and the secretary of state shall not file any certificate of incorporation, articles of association, charter, or certificate of the increase of capital stock, or certify or give any certificate to \n\n[204 U.S. 103, 106]\n\u00a0\n any such corporation, joint stock company, or association, until said fee shall have been paid to him.' By  10 of chapter 52 of the Session Laws of Colorado for 1901 it was provided that no foreign corporation could 'exercise any corporate power or acquire or hold any real or personal property, franchises, rights, or privileges, or do any business or prosecute or defend in any suit, in this state, until it shall have received from the secretary of this state a certificate setting forth that full payment has been made by such corporation, joint stock company, or association of all fees and taxes prescribed by law to be paid to the secretary of state, and every such corporation, joint stock company, or association shall pay to the secretary of state for each such certificate a fee of $5.'\n In accordance with the provisions of  1 of the Laws of 1897, above mentioned, the corporation paid, upon filing its certificate, April 28, 1899, to the secretary of state, for the use of the state, $9,792.50 on its original capitalization; and on May 17, 1901, the further sum of $5, 250 upon its increase of capital stock to $100,000,000. Thereupon the secretary of state issued a certificate, stating the filing of the proper papers with him, and further stating that 'pursuant to the provisions of  10 of said act (1901) I hereby certify that the said company has made full payment of all fees prescribed by law to be paid to the secretary of state and due at the time of the issuing of this certificate, and is hereby authorized to exercise any corporate powers provided for by law.' This was given under the hand and official seal of the secretary of state, and was dated on the 21st day of May, 1901. There were at this time no other statutes providing for the payment of any charges, fees, or taxes for coming into and doing business in the state of Colorado.\n The corporation, upon entering the state in 1899 under its permission to enter and transact business therein, immediately commenced to erect a plant for the purpose of carrying on its business as a corporation, and before the commence- \n\n[204 U.S. 103, 107]\n\u00a0\n ment of these proceedings it had invested for that purpose in the state sums amounting to more than $5,000,000. At the time the corporation was permitted to enter and carry on its business in the state the statute of Colorado provided that the term of life of corporations formed under the laws of that state should be twenty years. After the corporation had been doing business for some three years, and on March 22, 1902, the legislature of Colorado passed an act in relation to taxes. Colo. Sess. Laws 1902, pp. 43, 160, etc.\n Section 64 of that act provided that all domestic corporations should thereafter and on or before the 1st day of May of each year, or at the time of obtaining such charter or certificate of incorporation, pay 'an annual state corporation license tax,' to the auditor of the state, of 2 cents upon each $1,000 of its capital stock.\n Section 65 provides that every foreign corporation which had theretofore obtained 'the right and privilege to transact and carry on business within the limits of the state of Colorado shall, in addition to the fees and taxes now provided for by law, and as a condition precedent to its right to do any business within the limits of this state, pay annually . . .' a state license tax of 4 cents upon each $1,000 of its capital stock.\n Section 66 provided that every corporation which should fail to pay the tax provided for in  64 and 65 (supra should forfeit its right to do business within the state until the tax was paid, and should be deprived of all rights and privileges, and the fact of such failure might be pleaded as an absolute defense to any and all actions, suits, or proceedings, in law or in equity, brought or maintained by or on behalf of such corporations, in any court of competent jurisdiction within the limits of the state, until such tax was paid.\n This corporation refused to pay, and the state, through its district attorney and attorney general, commenced this suit for the purpose of forfeiting its right to remain in that state unless and until it paid the money under the statute of 1902. \n\n[204 U.S. 103, 108]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Thomas Thacher, Charles W. Waterman, Joel F. Vaile, and William W. Field for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[204 U.S. 103, 109]\n\u00a0\n Mr. N. C. Miller for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Peckham:\n\n\n[204 U.S. 103, 111]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n It is conceded that the corporation has paid all its indebtedness for taxes or otherwise to the state of Colorado, except the amount demanded under the above-mentioned law of 1902, and that it has obeyed all the laws of the state with that exception. It is urged, however, upon the part of the corporation, that, by its admission into the state, with its right to do business therein by the payment of the amount of money required for such purpose under the then-existing law, a contract between the state and itself was thereby made that it should be permitted to remain therein during the term of life which the state by law allowed to corporations created by it (which was twenty years), without being again subjected to further exactions of money for what it had once paid for, viz., the right to remain and transact business in that state. Undoubtedly, if the corporation violated the laws of the state properly applicable to it, or if otherwise it gave just cause for its expulsion, it could not insist upon such a contract as a defense.\n It is also conceded on behalf of the corporation that it is not entitled to any exemption from taxes which the state of Colorado can properly impose upon persons or corporations within her borders.\n Having obtained permission to enter the state and do business as above mentioned, the question, aside from that of the \n\n[204 U.S. 103, 112]\n\u00a0\n extent of the term, is whether any contract between the state and the corporation arose under these laws and the facts above mentioned.\n In 1899, when this (foreign) corporation applied for a permit to enter and do business in the state, the laws of Colorado only granted such application on the payment of a certain fee named in the statute of 1897, which was payable upon filing its certificate of incorporation in the office of the secretary of state of Colorado, and until that payment was made and the certificate filed no such corporation was permitted to have or exercise any corporate powers, nor was it permitted to do any business in the state. Section 30 of the act of 1901 provided that, upon payment of all taxes, etc., due under the law, the secretary of state was to issue a certificate acknowledging the fact, for which the corporation was to pay a stated fee; and until the certificate was received from the secretary of state by the corporation it should not exercise any corporate powers or do any business in the state, as provided for by the act of 1897\n\n\n The result of these statutes was that the foreign corporation, upon filing the proper papers and paying the statutory fees and obtaining the certificate to that effect from the secretary of state, obtained the right to enter and do business in Colorado. The act of 1901 did not increase the amount of the exaction for entering and doing business in the state, but simply provided for a certificate, acknowledging payment, from the secretary, and it imposed the payment of a small fee for such certificate. The right obtained was a right to enter the state and do business therein as a corporation. It was also subject by statute to the liabilities, restrictions, and duties which were or might thereafter be imposed upon domestic corporations of like character. Domestic corporations at that time had the right to a corporate existence of twenty years.\n These provisions of law, existing when the corporation applied for leave to enter the state, made the payment required, \n\n[204 U.S. 103, 113]\n\u00a0\n and received its permit, amounted to a contract that the foreign corporation so permitted to come in the state and do business therein, while subjected to all, should not be subjected to any greater, liabilities, restrictions, or duties than then were or thereafter might be imposed upon domestic corporations of like character.\n A provision in a statute of this nature subjecting a foreign corporation to all the liabilities, etc., of a domestic one of like character must mean that it shall not be subjected to any greater liabilities than are imposed upon such domestic corporation. The power to impose different liabilities was with the state at the outset. It could make them greater or less than in case of a domestic corporation, or it could make them the same. Having the general power to do as it pleased, when it enacted that the foreign corporation, upon coming in the state, should be subjected to all the liabilities of domestic corporations, it amounted to the same thing as if the statute had said the foreign corporations should be subjected to the same liabilities. In other words the liabilities, restrictions, and duties imposed upon domestic corporations constitute the measure and limit of the liabilities, restrictions, and duties which might thereafter be imposed upon the corporation thus admitted to do business in the state. It was not a mere license to come in the state and do business therein upon payment of a sum named, liable to be revoked or the sum increased at the pleasure of the state, without further limitation. It was a clear contract that the liabilities, etc., should be the same as the domestic corporation, and the same treatment in that regard should be measured out to both. If it were desired to increase the liabilities of the foreign, it could only be done by increasing those of the domestic, corporation at the same time and to the same extent.\n Such being the contract, how long was it to last? Only until the state chose to alter it? Or was it to last for some definite time, capable of being ascertained from the terms of the statutes as they then existed? It seems to us that the \n\n[204 U.S. 103, 114]\n\u00a0\n only limitation imposed is the term for which the corporation would have the right to continue in the state as a corporation. One of the restrictions as to domestic corporations is that which limits their corporate life to twenty years, unless extended as provided by law. The same restriction applies to the foreign corporation. Iron Silver Min. Co. v. Cowie, 31 Colo. 450, 72 Pac. 1067. Counsel for the state concedes that the corporation was admitted for a period of twenty years, but subject to the power of the state to tax. Curing that time, therefore, the contract lasts. This is the only legitimate, and we think it is the necessary, implication arising from the statute.\n This is not an exemption from taxation, it is simply a limitation of the power to tax beyond the rate of taxation imposed upon a domestic corporation. Instead of such a limitation the act of 1902, already referred to, imposes a tax or fee upon or exacts from the foreign corporation double the amount which is imposed upon or exacted from the domestic one. The latter is granted the right to continue to do business upon the annual payment of 2 cents upon each $1,000 of its capital stock, while the former must pay 4 cents for the same right. This cannot be done while the right to remain exists. It is a violation of the obligation of an existing valid contract. Home of the Friendless v. Rouse, 8 Wall. 430, 19 L. ed. 495.\n Nor is this a case where the power given by the state Constitution to the general assembly to alter, amend, or annul a charter is applicable. The act does not alter the charter or annul or amend it. It simply increases the taxation which, up to the time of its enactment, had been imposed on all foreign corporations doing business in the state.\n A discussion as to the name or nature of the tax imposed by the act of 1902, or the former acts, is wholly unimportant with reference to the view we take of this case. After the payment of the money and the receipt of the permit to enter and do business in the state the corporation could not, as we \n\n[204 U.S. 103, 115]\n\u00a0\n have said, be thereafter further taxed than was the domestic one. The tax on the latter under that act is the same in substance and effect as that upon the foreign corporation, but it is for only one half thereof in amount. The domestic must pay 'an annual state corporation license tax,' while the foreign corporation must pay 'a state license tax' annually. The means of enforcing payment are not different, and such means are stated in  66 of the act of 1902.\n Whatever be the name or nature of the tax, it must be measured in amount by the same rate as is provided for the domestic institution, and, if the latter is not taxed in that way, neither can the state thus tax the foreign corporation.\n It is unnecessary to refer to the many cases cited by both parties hereto. Some of them refer to the question as to the nature of such a tax, while others decide, upon the facts appearing in them, whether there was a contract or not. As already stated, the name of the tax or its kind is not important so long as it is plain that the act of 1902 increases the liabilities of the foreign corporation over those which obtain in that of the domestic. And in regard to the cases of contract, while the principle that a contract may arise from a legislative enactment has been reiterated times without number, it must always rest for its support in the particular case upon the construction to be given the act, and in this case we are not greatly aided by the former cases regarding taxation and legislative contract. We may, however, refer to the following out of many cases regarding contracts as to taxation: Miller v. New York, 15 Wall. 478, 21 L. ed. 98; New York, L. E. & W. R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n153 U.S. 628\n, 38 L. ed. 846, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 952; Powers v Detroit, G. H. & M. R. Co. \n201 U.S. 543\n, 50 L. ed. 860, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 556.\n Holding that the act of 1902 impaired the obligation of the contract existing between the corporation and the state, and is therefore void as to the corporation, it becomes unnecessary to decide the other questions discussed at the bar.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of Colorado is reversed \n\n[204 U.S. 103, 116]\n\u00a0\n and the case remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice Harlan, Mr. Justice Holmes, and Mr. Justice Moody dissent. \n\n\n\n","6":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nAMERICAN TOBACCO CO. v.

The painting was the work of an English artist, W. Dendy Sadler. The defendant in error claimed to be the owner of a copyright taken out under the law of the United States.\n The judgment was rendered under authority of  4965, as amended March 2, 1985 ([28 Stat. at L. 965, chap. 194] U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3414).\n In January, 1894, by agreement between the artist and Werckmeister, the defendant in error, it was agreed that the painting should be finished by March 1, and then sent to Werckmeister to be photographed and returned to Sadler in time to \n\n[207 U.S. 284, 286]\n\u00a0\n exhibit at the Royal Academy in 1894. The painting was sent to Werckmeister at Berlin, where it was received on March 8, 1894, and was returned to Sadler in London on March 22, 1894. On April 2, 1894, the artist Sadler executed and delivered the following instrument:\n I hereby transfer the copyright in my picture 'Chorus' to the Photographische Gesellschaft, Berlin (The Berlin Photographic Company ), for the sum of 200. London, April 2, 1894\n\n\n (Signed) W. Dendy Sadler.\n Werckmeister was a citizen of the German Empire, doing business in Berlin, Germany, under the trade name of 'Photographische Gesellechaft,' and did business in New York city under the name of the 'Berlin Photographic Company.'\n The Photographische Gesellschaft of Berlin, by letter dater March 31, 1894, received on April 16, 1894, deposited the title and description of the painting and a photograph of the same in the office of the Librarian of Congress, the intention being to obtain a copyright under the act of Congress. [Rev. Stat. 4956] U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3407. After the painting was returned to London it was exhibited by Sadler at the exhibition of the Royal Academy at London, and was there on exhibition for about three months; the exhibition opening the first Monday of May and closing the first Monday of August, 1894. The exhibition was opened to the public on week days, from 8 A. M. to 7 P. M. upon the payment of the admission fee of 1 shilling, and during the last week was open evenings, the entrance charge being 6 pence. There was a private view for the press on May 2, and on May 3 up to 1 o'clock, and the remainder of the day was for the Royal private view. There was also a general private view on May 4. The members and the associate members of the Royal Academy and the artists exhibiting at the exhibition and their families were entitled at all times to free admission, and they, as well as the public, visited the exhibition in large numbers.\n During the time that the painting was shown at the exhibition it was not inscribed as a copyright, nor were any words \n\n[207 U.S. 284, 287]\n\u00a0\n thereon indicating a copyright, nor on the substance on which it was mounted, nor on the frame, as required by the copyright act ([18 Stat. at L. 78, chap. 301] U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3411), if the original painting is within the requirements of the law in this respect.\n The painting, while on exhibition, was for sale at the Royal Academy, but with the copyright reserved, which reservation was entered in the gallery sale book. The bylaws of the Royal Academy provided 'that no permission to copy works on exhibition shall on any account be granted.' The reasons for the by-law, as it appears upon minutes of the Academy, are as follows:\n'That so much property in copyright being intrusted to the guardianship of the Royal Academy, the council feel themselves compelled to disallow, in future, all copying within their walls from pictures sent for exhibition.'\n\n The photogravures of the painting were placed on sale in June, 1894, or in the autumn of 1894; those photogravures were inscribed with the notice of copyright.\n Mr. Sadler, the artist, afterwards, in October, 1899, sold the painting to a Mr. Cotterel, residing in London, England, since which time, so far as has been shown, it has been hanging in the dining room of the house of that gentleman.\n On June 20, 1902, Werckmeister commenced an action, by the service of a summons, against the American Tobacco Company, plaintiff in error, and on the same day a writ of replevin was issued out of the circuit court of the United States for the southern district of New York, directed to the marshal of the same district, requiring him to replevin the chattels described in an annexed affidavit. Under the writ the marshal seized upon the premises of the American Tobacco Company 203 pictures. On July 23, 1902, Werckmeister caused another writ of replevin to issue out of the same court, directed to the marshal of the western district of New York, under which writ the marshal seized 993 pictures.\n An amendment to the complaint set forth the seizure of the pictures. The copies seized were adjudged to be forfeited to the plaintiff, Werckmeister, and to be of the value of $1,010. \n\n[207 U.S. 284, 288]\n\u00a0\n The judgment rendered in the circuit court was taken upon error to the United States circuit court of appeals and there affirmed. 76 C.

A copyright, as the term imports, involves the right of publication and reproduction of works of art or literature. A copyright, as defined by Bouvier's Law Dictionary, Rawles's edition, volume 1, p. 436, is: 'The exclusive privilege, secured according to certain legal \n\n[207 U.S. 284, 291]\n\u00a0\n forms, of printing, or otherwise multiplying, publishing, and vending copies of certain literary or artistic productions.' And further, says the same author, 'the foundation of all rights of this description is the natural dominion which everyone has over his own ideas, the enjoyment of which, although they are embodied in visible forms or characters, he may, if he chooses, confine to himself or impart to others.' That is, the law recognizes the artistic or literary productions of intellect or genius, not only to the extent which is involved in dominion over and ownership of the thing created, but also the intangible estate in such property which arises from the privilege of publishing and selling to others copies of the thing produced.\n There was much contention in England as to whether the common law recognized this property in copyright before the statute of Anne; the controversy resulting in the decision in the House of Lords in the case of Donaldson v. Becket, 4 Burr, 2408, the result of the decision being that a majority of the judges, while in favor of the commonlaw right, held the same had been taken away by the statute. See Wheaton v. Peters, 8 Pet. 591- 656, 8 L. ed. 1055-1079; Holmes v. Hurst, \n174 U.S. 82\n, 43 L. ed. 904, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 606.\n In this country it is well settled that property in copyright is the creation of the Federal statute passed in the exercise of the power vested in Congress by the Federal Constitution in article 1,  8, 'to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.' See 8 Pet. 591, supra; Banks v. Manchester, \n128 \nU.S. 244, 252\n, 32 S. L. ed. 425, 428, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 36; Thompson v. Hubbard, \n131 \nU.S. 123, 151\n, 33 S. L. ed 76, 86, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 710.\n Under this grant of authority a series of statutes have been passed, having for their object the protection of the property which the author has in the right to publish his production, the purpose of the statute being to protect this right in such manner that the author may have the benefit of this property for a limited term of years. These statutes should be given a fair and reasonable construction with a view to effecting such purpose. \n\n[207 U.S. 284, 292]\n\u00a0\n The first question presented in oral argument and upon the briefs involves the construction of  4962 as amended (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3411), which is as follows:\n'That no person shall maintain an action for the infringement of his copyright unless he shall give notice thereof by inserting in the several copies of every edition published, on the title page or the page immediately following, if it be a book; or if a map, chart, musical composition, print, cut, engraving, photograph, painting, drawing, chromo, statue, statuary, or model or design intended to be perfected and completed as a work of the fine arts, by inscribing upon some visible portion thereof, or of the substance on which the same shall be mounted, the following words, viz.: 'Entered according to act of Congress, in the year _____, by A. B. in the office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington;' or, at his potion, the word 'copyright,' together with the year the copyright was entered, and the name of the party by whom it was taken out, thus: 'Copyright 18--, by A. B.\"\n\n It is the contention of the plaintiff in error that the original painting was not inscribed as required by the act, and therefore no action can be maintained, and it is insisted that the inscription upon the photogravures offered for sale is not sufficient.\n It must be admitted that the language of the statute is not so clear as it might be, nor have the decisions of the courts been uniform upon the subject. In Werckmeister v. Pierce & B. Mfg. Co. 63 Fed. 445, Judge Putnam held that the failure to inscribe the copyright notice upon the original painting did not affect the copyright. That judgment was reversed by the circuit court of appeals for the first circuit by a divided court. 18 C. C. A. 431, 33 U. S. App. 399, 72 Fed. 54.\n In the case of Werckmeister v. American Lithographic Co. 142 Fed. 827, Judge Holt reached the same conclusion as Judge putnam and in the case at bar the circuit court of appeals for the second circuit approved of the reasoning of Judges Putnam and Holt and disagreed with the majority of \n\n[207 U.S. 284, 293]\n\u00a0\n the judges of the circuit court of appeals for the first circuit.\n Looking to the statute, it is apparent that if read literally the words 'inscribed on some visible portion thereof,' etc., apply to the antecedent terms 'maps, charts, musical composition, print, cut, engraving, photograph, painting.' etc., and the words of the first part of the sentence, requiring notice to be inserted in the several copies of every edition published, apply literally to the title page or the page immediately following, if it be a book.\n But in construing a statute we are not always confined to a literal reading, and may consider its object and purpose, the things with which it is dealing, and the condition of affairs which led to its enactment, so as to effectuate rather than destroy the spirit and force of the law which the legislature intended to enact.\n It is true, and the plaintiff in error cites authorities to the proposition, that where the words of an act are clear and unambiguous they will control. But, while seeking to gain the legislative intent primarily from the lenguage used, we must remember the objects and purposes sought to be attained.\n We think it was the object of the statute to require this inscription, not upon the original painting, map, photograph, drawing, etc., but upon those published copies concerning which it is designed to convey information to the public which shall limit the use and circumscribe the rights of the purchaser.\n As we have seen, the purpose of the copyright law is not so much the protection of the possession and control of the visible thing, as to secure a monopoly having a limited time, of the right to publish the production which is the result of the inventor's thought.\n We have been cited to no case, nor can we find any direct authority in this court upon the question. But the opinion of Mr. Justice Miller in Burrow-Giles Lithographic Co. v. Sarony, \n111 U.S. 53\n, 28 L. ed. 349, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 279, is pertinent. The court there considered whether Congress had the constitutional right to protect photographs and negatives by copyright, and the second assignment of \n\n[207 U.S. 284, 294]\n\u00a0\n error relates to the sufficiency of the words 'Copyrighted 1892 by N. Sarony,' when the copyright was the property of Napoleon Sarony. In treating this question the learned judge used this very suggestive language (111 U. S. p. 55):\n With regard to this latter question, it is enough to say that the object of the statute is to give notice of the copyright to the public, by placing upon each copy, in some visible shape, the name of the author, the existence of the claim of exclusive right, and the date at which this right was obtained.'\n If the contention of the plaintiff in error be sustained the statute is satisfied only when the original map, chart, etc., or painting is inscribed with the notice, and this is requisite whether the original painting is ever published or not. We think this construction ignores the purpose and object of the act, which Mr. Justice Miller has said, in the language just quoted, is to give notice of the copyright to the public,- that is, to the persons who buy or deal with the published thing.\n It is insisted that there is reason for the distinction in the statute between books, and maps, charts, paintings, etc., in that a book can only be published in print and becomes known by reading, while paintings, drawings, etc., are published by inspection and observation.\n It may be true that paintings are published in this way, but they are often sold to private individuals and go into private collections, whilst the copies, photographs, or photogravures, may have a wide and extended sale.\n It would seem clear that the real object of the statute is not to give notice to the artist or proprietor of the painting or the person to whose collection it may go, who need no information, but to notify the public who purchase the circulated copies of the existing copyright, in order that their ownership may be restricted.\n There does not seem to be any purpose in requiring that an original map, chart, or painting shall be thus inscribed, while there is every reason for requiring the copies of editions pub- \n\n[207 U.S. 284, 295]\n\u00a0\n lished to bear upon their face the notice of the limited property which a purchaser may acquire therein.\n This construction of the statute which requires the inscription upon the published copies is much strengthened by the review of the history of copyright legislation which is contained in Judge Putnam's opinion in Werckmeister v. Pierce & B. Mfg. Co. 63 Fed. 445; that legislation, before the statute of 1874, in which paintings were for the first time introduced, shows the uniform requirement of notice upon copies. The apparent incongruities in the statute, in the light of its history, have grown up from enlarging the scope of the law from time to time by the introduction of new subjects of copyright and engrafting them on the previous statutes. The same argument which requires original paintings to be inscribed would apply to all other articles in the same class in the present law, as maps, charts, etc., which were formerly classed with books, so far as requiring notice upon copies is concerned.\n Such original maps and charts, etc., may and usually do remain in the possession of the original makers, and there is no necessity of any notice upon them, but the copyright is invalid, as the plaintiff in error insists, unless the original is itself inscribed with the notice of copyright.\n For the learned counsel for plaintiff in error says: 'If the painting or like article is ripe for copyright, it is ripe for the inscription of the notice. The statute requires the inserting of notice in published things only in respect to published editions of books. The term 'published' is not used in connection with paintings, statutes, and the like.' And it is urged there can be no such thing as an 'edition' of a painting, and copies of published editions are the only copies mentioned in the statute. But this phrase survives from former statutes, which dealt only with books, maps, charts, etc. When paintings and other things not capable of publication in 'editions' were introduced into the statute, the language was not changed so as to be technically accurate in reference to the new subjects of copyright. \n\n[207 U.S. 284, 296]\n\u00a0\n But the sense and purpose of the law was not changed by this lack of verbal accuracy, and we think, while the construction contended for may adhere with literal accuracy and grammatical exactness to the language used, it does violence to the intent of Congress in passing the law, and that the requirement of 'inscription upon some visible portion thereof' should be read in connection with the first part of the sentence, which requires notice to be inserted in the several copies of every edition published, on the title page if it be a book, upon some visible portion of the copy if it be a map, chart, painting, etc.\n As we have said in the beginning, the statute is not clear. But read in the light of the purpose intended to be effected by the legislation, we think its ambiguities are best solved by the constructions here given, and that the circuit court of appeals made no error in this respect.\n Again, it is contended that under the facts stated Werckmeister was but the licensee of Sadler, and, as such, not within the terms of the statute ( 4952, as amended 1891 [26 Stat. at L. 1106, chap. 565], U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3406), which is as follows:\n'The author, inventor, designer, or proprietor of any book, map, chart, dramatic or musical composition, engraving, cut, print, or photograph or negative thereof, or of a painting, drawing, chromo, statue, statuary, and of models or designs intended to be perfected as works of the fine arts, and the executors, administrators, or assigns of any such person, shall, upon complying with the provisions of this chapter, have the sole liberty of printing, reprinting, publishing, completing, copying, executing, finishing, and vending the same, and, in the case of dramatic composition, of publicly performing or representing it or causing it to be performed or represented by others, and authors or their assigns shall have the exclusive right to dramatize and translate any of their works for which copyright shall have been obtained under the laws of the United States.'\n\n But we think the transfer in this case accomplished what it \n\n[207 U.S. 284, 297]\n\u00a0\n was evidently intended to do,-a complete transfer of the property right of copyright existing in the picture. There is no evidence of any intention on the part of Sadler to retain any interest in this copyright after the sale to Werckmeister; and when the painting was offered for sale at the Royal Academy it was with a reservation of the copyright.\n It would be giving an entirely too narrow construction to this instrument to construe it to be a mere license or personal privilege, leaving all other rights in the assignor. That it was the purpose of the parties to make a complete transfer is shown by the instrument executed, when read in the light of the attendant circumstances.\n In this connection it is argued that under the statute above quoted ( 4952, as amended March 3, 1891) an author cannot, before publication, assign the right or privilege of taking a copyright independent of the 'transfer of the copyrightable thing itself,' and it is contended that the terms 'author,' 'inventor,' 'designer,' refer to the originator of the book, may, chart, painting, etc., and that the term 'proprietor' refers to the person who has a copyrightable thing made for him under such circumstances as to become the proprietor; as, for instance, one who causes a digest to be compiled or a picture to be painted.\n But we think this statute must be construed in view of the character of the property intended to be protected. That it was intended to give the right of copyright to others than the author, inventor, or designer is conclusively shown in the use of the terms 'proprietor' and 'assigns' in the statute.\n It seems clear that the word 'assigns' in this section is not used as descriptive of the character of the estate which the 'author, inventor, designer, or proprietor' may acquire under the statute, for the 'assigns' of any such person, as well as the persons themselves, may, 'upon complying with the provisions of this chapter,' have the sole liberty of printing, publishing, and vending the same. This would seem to demonstrate the intention of Congress to vest in 'assigns,' before copyright, the same privilege of subsequently acquiring complete \n\n[207 U.S. 284, 298]\n\u00a0\n statutory copyright as the original author, inventor, designer, or proprietor has. Nor do we think this result is qualified because the statute gives to assigns, together with the right of publishing, vending, etc., the right of 'completing, executing, and finishing' the subject- matter of copyright.\n And a strond consideration in construing this statute has reference to the character of the property sought to be protected. It is not the physical thing created, but the right of printing, publishing, copying, etc., which is within the statutory protection. While not, in all respects, analogous, this proposition finds illustration in Stephens v. Cady, 14 How. 528, 14 L. ed. 528, in which it was held, where the copyright for a map had been taken out under the act of Congress, a sale upon execution of the copperplate engraving from which it was made did not pass the right to print and sell copies of the map. Mr. Justice Nelson, delivering the opinion of the court, said:\n'But, from the consideration we have given to the case, we are satisfied that the property acquired by the sale in the engraved plate, and the copyright of the map secured to the author under the act of Congress, are altogether different and independent of each other, and have no necessary connection. The copyright is an exclusive right to the multiplication of the copies, for the benefit of the author or his assigns, disconnected from the plate, or any other physical existence. It is an incorporeal right to print and publish the map; or, as said by Lord Mansfield in Millar v. Taylor, 4 Burr. 2396, 'a property in notion, and has no corporeal tangible substance.\"\n\n And the same doctrine was thus stated by Mr. Justice Curtis in Stevens v. Gladding, 17 How. 447, 15 L. ed. 155:\n'And upon this question of the annexation of the copyright to the plate it is to be observed, first, that there is no necessary connection between them. They are distinct subjects of property, each capable of existing, and being owned and transferred, independent of the other.'\n\n While it is true that the property in copyright in this country is the creation of statute, the nature and character of the \n\n[207 U.S. 284, 299]\n\u00a0\n property grows out of the recognition of the separate ownership of the right of copying from that which inheres in the mere physical control of the thing itself, and the statute must be read in the light of the intention of Congress to protect this intangible right as a reward of the inventive genius that has produced the work. We think every consideration of the nature of the property and the things to be accomplished supports the conclusion that the statute means to give to the assigns of the original owner of the right to copyright an article the right to take out the copyright secured by the statute, independently of the ownership of the article itself.\n It is further contended that the exhibition in the Royal Gallery was such a publication of the painting as prevents the defendant in error from having the benefit of the copyright act. This question has been dealt with in a number of cases, and the result of the authorities establishes, we think, that it is only in cases where what is known as a general publication is shown, as distinguished from a limited publication under conditions which exclude the presumption that it was intended to be dedicated to the public, that the owner of the right of copyright is deprived of the benefit of the statutory provision.\n Considering this feature of the case, it is well to remember that the property of the author or painter in his intellectual creation is absolute until he voluntarily parts with the same. One or many persons may be permitted to an examination under circumstances which show no intention to part with the property right, and it will remain unimpaired.\n The subject was considered and the cases reviewed in the analogous case of Werckmeister v. American Lithographic Co. 68 L.R.A. 591, 134 Fed. 321,1 in a full and comprehensive opinion by the late Circuit Judge Townsend, which leaves little to be added to the discussion.\n The rule is thus stated in Slater on the Law of Copyright and Trade Marks p. 92):\n'It is a fundamental rule that to constitute publication there must be such a dissemination of the work of art itself \n\n[207 U.S. 284, 300]\n\u00a0\n among the public as to justify the belief that it took place with the intention of rendering such work common property.'\n\n And that author instances as one of the occasions that does not amount to a general publication the exhibition of a work of art at a public exhibition where there are bylaws against copies, or where it is tacitly understood that no copying shall take place, and the public are admitted to view the painting on the implied understanding that no improper advantage will be taken of the privilege.\n We think this doctrine is sound and the result of the best-considered cases. In this case it appears that paintings are expressly entered at the gallery with copyrights reserved. There is no permission to copy; on the other hand, officers are present who rigidly enforce the requirements of the society that no copying shall take place.\n Starting with the presumption that it is the author's right to withhold his property, or only to yield to a qualified and special inspection which shall not permit the public to acquire rights in it, we think the circumstances of this exhibition conclusively show that it was the purpose of the owner, entirely consistent with the acts done, not to permit such an inspection of his picture as would throw its use open to the public. We do not mean to say that the public exhibition of a painting or statue, where all might see and freely copy it, might not amount to publication within the statute, regardless of the artist's purpose or notice of reservation of rights which he takes no measure to protect. But such is not the present case, where the greatest care was taken to prevent copying.\n It is next objected that the form of action in this case was the ordinary action for replevin under the New York Code, and as the plaintiff did not have the right of property or possession before the beginning of this action, no such action would lie. Whether this action was the one in the nature of replevin for the seizures of the plates and copies indicated in the case of Bolles v. Outing Co. \n175 U.S. 266\n, 44 L. ed. 157, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 94, we do not find it necessary to determine. After verdict, and upon motion for \n\n[207 U.S. 284, 301]\n\u00a0\n a new trial, plaintiff in error, defendant below, moved to set aside the verdict 'on the ground that replevin, under the statutes of the state of New York, is not an appropriate remedy or a lawful and legal remedy for taking possession of the alleged incriminating sheets or pictures, and that the proceedings taken in that behalf by the plaintiff were illegal and invalid, and that the plaintiff cannot avail of any benefit of that proceeding, and the introduction in evidence of the replevin proceedings was an error.' The motion was denied and exception duly taken.\n The learned counsel for the plaintiff in error admits that this question was not formally raised until the defendant's motion for a new trial, but maintains that the same question was raised by the objection to admission in evidence of the replevin proceedings by the marshal for western and southern districts of New York, respectively.\n Examining this record, it is perfectly apparent that no objection was made to the form of the action until it was embodied after verdict, in the motion for a new trial. Upon the admission of the writ of replevin, addressed to the marshal of the western district of New York, and affidavit, the objection stated was 'on the ground that the process of replevin that was executed by the marshal in Buffalo was an invasion of defendant's constitutional right, was an unwarrantable search, an illegal act, and nothing done under it, or information obtained by virtue of it, can be used in evidence against defendant under the 4th and 5th Amendments of the United States Constitution.'\n The same objection was made when the writs of replevin, affidavit, and return were offered in evidence concerning the southern district of New York, and it was said: 'Defendant's counsel objects on the same grounds as stated to the introduction of the stipulation; namely, that the papers constitute an illegal proceeding, an invasion of the defendant's constitutional right, as provided by the 4th and 5th Amendments, and plaintiff cannot avail of them as evidence in this case, on account of their illegality.' \n\n[207 U.S. 284, 302]\n\u00a0\n The argument which followed, could it be assumed to broaden the objection, was far from complaining of the form of action as such, but rested upon the Constitution and the character of the seizure of the goods, of which it was maintained the plaintiff was not entitled to possession until after a judgment of forfeiture.\n The record shows that the objection to the form of the remedy was first taken in any adequate way upon the motion for a new trial, when it was too late.\n In conclusion, it was suggested rather than argued that the constitutional rights of the plaintiff in error were violated by the seizure of the goods, and reference was made to the 4th and 5th Amendments. We think we need only refer in this connection to Adams v. New York, \n192 U.S. 585\n-597, 48 L. ed. 575-580, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 372, and Hale v. Henkel, \n201 U.S. 43\n, 50 L. ed. 652, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 370.\n Finding no error in the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals, the same is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 69 C. C.

GERMAN NAT BANK(1907)\nNo. 56\nArgued: Decided: December 2, 1907\n\n\n\n\n[207 U.S. 270, 271]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Edward B. Peirce for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n\n[207 U.S. 270, 272]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John Fletcher, W. C. Ratcliffe, Moore, Smith, & Moore, and Smead & Powell for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[207 U.S. 270, 273]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a suit brought by the defendant in error, hereafter called the plaintiff, for the failure of the railroad company, hereafter called the defendant, to deliver cotton in accordance with the terms of bills of lading issued by the railroad and held by the plaintiff as indorsee. The cotton in question was purchased by the alphin & Lake Cotton Company, and shipped over the defendant's road to El Dorado, Arkansas, mainly from Bernice, Louisiana. The Bank of Bernice, having made advances, took the bills of lading as shipper and sent them, with drafts on the purchaser, to the Bank of Little Rock. The Bank of Little Rock, wishing to reduce the account of the Alphin & Lake Cotton Company, these bills subsequently were transferred to the plaintiff as security for an advance. The bills of lading bore the words 'Consigned to S\/O. % Compress E1 Dorado, Ark. Notify Alphin & Lake Cotton Co.' They also contained a notice that the liability of the railroad as a common carrier ended on the arrival of the cotton at the station of delivery, and that, unless removed by the consignees within twenty-four hours, the cotton might be removed and \n\n[207 U.S. 270, 274]\n\u00a0\n stored by the railroad at owner's risk and expense in a warehouse of its choice.\n The only place at which the cotton could be stored at E1 Dorado, and the place at which all the cotton coming over the railroad was delivered, was a compress company of which Lake, a member of the purchasing company, was president. The railroad, on the arrival of this cotton, followed its custom and handed the cotton over to the compress company. It is stated by the supreme court of Arkansas, whose decision we are asked to review, that the delivery was made at once, for account of Alphin & Lake Cotton Company, with no further directions and without mention of the restriction to shipper's order, on the supposition that it belonged to the Alphin & Lake Cotton Company. The bills of lading were outstanding, and were not asked for as a condition of the bailment. In the defendant's answer it is admitted that the cotton was not delivered to the plaintiff, on demand some weeks later, and while it is alleged that the delivery to the compress company was made to it as agent for the holders of the bills of lading, it is alleged also that the Alphin & Lake Cotton Company was the owner of the cotton and thereafter took possession of it, sold it, and received the proceeds.\n The judge before whom the case was tried directed a verdict for the plaintiff, and, on exceptions, the supreme court of the state affirmed the judgment of the trial court. 77 Ark. 482, 113 Am. St. Rep. 160, 92 S. W. 522.\n The statutes of Arkansas enact that such bills of lading may be transferred by indorsement and delivery of the same, with the effect of conveying a valid title to or lien upon the produce for which they are given, and forbids the delivery of such produce except on surrender and cancelation of the bills of lading, with a proviso exempting documents having the words 'not negotiable' on their face. A violation of the enactment is made criminal and severely punished, and it is provided that any person aggrieved may recover all damages sustained by reason of such violation. Kirby's Digest,  530, 531. It is \n\n[207 U.S. 270, 275]\n\u00a0\n argued that the case could not have been withdrawn from the jury, or the judgment upheld, except on the assumption that these sections of the statutes were valid, that they invalidated the stipulation in the bills of lading for a right to store, and overrode the directions contained in them, and that the plaintiff made out a case on the undisputed fact that the cotton was delivered to the compress without a surrender of the bills of lading. It is argued further that the sections, so far as they bear on these transactions, are repugnant to the Constitution, article 1,  8, as an unauthorized attempt to regulate commerce among the states, and this is the error relied upon here, although by no means the only one assigned.\n But, according to the well-settled doctrine of this court with regard to cases coming from state courts, unless a decision upon a Federal question was necessary to the judgment, or in fact was made the ground of it, the writ of error must be dismissed. And even when an erroneous decision upon a Federal question is made a ground, if the judgment also is supported upon another which is adequate by itself, and which contains no Federal question, the same result must follow, as a general rule. Moreover, ordinarily this court will not inquire whether the decision upon the matter not subject to its revision was right or wrong. Murdock v. Memphis, 20 Wall. 590, 22 L. ed. 429; Hale v. Akers, \n132 U.S. 554\n, 33 L. ed. 442, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 171; Leathe v., Thomas, Nov. 11, 1907 [\n207 U.S. 93\n, ante, 30, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 30]. Therefore, if we should be of opinion, as we are, that the supreme court rested its judgment upon principles of common law as it understood them, we should go no farther, although that court also upheld and relied upon the statute, whether, in our opinion, its views were right or wrong.\n It will have been noticed that under the answer there was only a very narrow issue of fact possible, although there was one.\n There was an issue as to whether the delivery to the compress company was not a delivery to it as agent for the holders of the bills of lading. If that was as the defendant alleged, it might be that the contract was fulfilled and the defendant discharged, unless the statute made a change. But, on the evi- \n\n[207 U.S. 270, 276]\n\u00a0\n dence, there was hardly room for argument or doubt. There was no real question that the cotton was handed over at once, and not in the exercise of the stipulated right after twenty-four hours, that no directions about delivery were given to the compress company, and that the persons handling the cotton at E1 Dorado thought that it belonged to the Alphin & Lake Cotton Company, or acted as if it did. Both sides asked the judge to direct a verdict, and evidently regarded the questions as mainly questions of law. While it may be that the judge would not have felt technically justified in directing the jury to find for the plaintiff, but for his views on the effect of the statute, the supreme court seems to have thought the facts indisputable, and stated them categorically with no hint of hesitation or doubt.\n Whether the supreme court was warranted in assuming the facts to be as it set them forth is no concern of ours. The important thing is that it was at pains to state them, and that it can have had no purpose in doing so other than to establish a liability under the contract at common law. If the statute imposed liability for delivery without a surrender of the bills of lading, whether the contract was performed or not, there was no need to go into these details. It is true that the court refers to and upholds the statute, but it does so after stating the duties and liabilities of the carrier at common law, and says more than once that the relevant enactment is for the enforcement of duties already existing; that is, it would seem, that it is only declaratory so far as this case is concerned. The court treats the contract itself as requiring a delivery to shipper's order, and only upon a production of the bills of lading properly indorsed. Its concluding words are, 'under the contract, as shown by the bills of lading, it was relieved of liability on account of the storage, but not of the failure to deliver according to law.' Whether the analysis of the contract was correct or not, and whether or not there were other grounds of common law upon which the defendant ought to have escaped, are matters upon which we cannot speculate. When we see \n\n[207 U.S. 270, 277]\n\u00a0\n that the opinion of the court upon the constitutional question first appearing in that opinion was not necessary to its judgment upon the case, we have nothing more to do.\n Writ of error dismissed. \n\n\n\n","8":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nARMSTRONG v. ASHLEY(1907)\nNo. 122\nArgued: Decided: January 21, 1907\n\n\n\n\n[204 U.S. 272, 273]\n\u00a0\n This suit was brought in the supreme court of the District of Columbia by the appellant, who is the ancillary receiver for the New South Building & Loan Association of New Orleans, Louisiana, hereinafter called 'the company,' against the owners of the real property described in the bill, to establish an equitable lien upon the property for the value of improvements placed thereon with money which the company loaned to one Bradshaw for that purpose, Bradshaw claiming to be the owner at the time. After hearing, the bill was dismissed on its merits by the trial court, and the decree of dismissal was affirmed by the court of appeals of the District. The opinions of both courts are to be found in 22 App. D. C. 368. The receiver has appealed here.\n The title to the property, which consisted of certain numbered lots in square number 939 in Washington, had been in dispute some time prior to 1891. During the year 1889, 1890, or 1891 one Aaron Bradshaw, acting, as alleged, as agent of one John H. Walter, who claimed to have acquired the title of George Walker, entered upon and took forcible possession of the lots in question, and proceeded to erect a small brick structure on the corner lot, whereby to continue to hold possession. \n\n[204 U.S. 272, 274]\n\u00a0\n The respondents herein claim to be the owners of these lots, and in the latter part of 1891 they or their grantors commenced four actions of ejectment in the supreme court of the District to recover possession of separate and undivided interests in the designated 'ink-lot' number 1, and subsequently, by proper amendments, other lots in the same square, comprising the property involved herein, were included in the declarations in those actions. A statement of facts regarding the title to these various lots may be found in Bradshaw v. Ashley, 14 App. D. C. 485, and in this court, upon review of that decision, in \n180 \nU.S. 59, 60\n, 45 S. L. ed. 423, 428, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 297, where the expression 'ink-lot' is explained as referring to certain ink numbers on a map of the lots in square 939, on file in one of the public offices of the city, and which also had pencil numbers on it, which were different. In that litigation the Ashleys, the respondents herein, finally established their right to the possession of the property, and obtained judgment to that effect against Bradshaw, defendant in the ejectment actions, in the supreme court of the District some time in 1897, and in this court in 1901. These respondents were thereupon placed in possession of the property, including these lots.\n While the litigation in these ejectment actions was pending, and some years before judgment therein, Bradshaw, while defending them, became a stockholder in the company in order to obtain a loan from it, and succeeded, in October, 1893, in borrowing $20,000 from the company, secured by a deed of trust upon the property in litigation in the actions in ejectment other than ink-lot 1 above mentioned. The deed was duly recorded and the money was to be used for the construction of buildings, which were subsequently placed on these lots. The money was advanced to Bradshaw by the company in instalments, the last being in April, 1894\n\n\n It was obtained from the company by means, as alleged, of a fraudulent combination between Bradshaw and one Walter, the president of the local board of directors of the \n\n[204 U.S. 272, 275]\n\u00a0\n company at Washington (who claimed to have been the owner at one time of the property, but whose title, whatever it was, had been acquired by Bradshaw), together with the local attorney of the company in this District. The local attorney, in carrying out the alleged fraud, sent a defective so-called 'chain of title,' which, nevertheless, had been accepted by the local board of the company in Washington. It omitted certain tax and other deeds under which the respondents claimed title in themselves. This defective paper was continued by other examiners of the title, but was not revised by them. The certificate regarding the title was sent, with the defective chain of title, to the company in New Orleans by the local attorney about May 26, 1893. The certificate approved the application for the loan, but such loan was not acted upon favorably at that time. Subsequently, in October, 1893, the loan was made, the company, as is stated, relying upon the certificate of the local attorney for the period which it covered, and the certificate of the other examiner for the time thereafter passing until the making of the loan. The company has insisted that it acted at all times in good faith and made its advances upon the security of the trust deed, which it supposed was perfectly good. The trial court found that before the money was paid to Bradshaw, upon the security of this trust deed, the company was aware, through its general attorney in New Orleans, of the fact that a suit in equity had ( theretofore, in 1890, and before the ejectment actions) been brought by the Ashleys against Bradshaw, Walter, and others, in which the plaintiffs therein claimed ownership of these lots, and wherein they asked for an injunction to restrain the defendants from setting up any title to them. The bill on file in the equity suit showed a common source of title to all the lots mentioned therein, which included the lots here in question. The attorney also knew that, although the suit had been dismissed, yet it was only for want of prosecution, and was 'without prejudice.' The New Orleans attorney wrote to the Washington attorney, who \n\n[204 U.S. 272, 276]\n\u00a0\n then had charge of the matter, calling his attention to these facts. No notice seems to have been taken of the letter, but the certificate of title by the examiner was given after its receipt. The company insists that during all the time it made advances to Bradshaw under the deed of trust it was ignorant of the existence of these ejectments actions, and at any rate did not know that they covered other than the corner lot, as described in the declarations before they were amended, and the amendments they were ignorant of, because, as is alleged, the clerk of the court in which the actions were pending had not properly kept the books so as to show the amendments and their nature, although they had been filed. The corner lot was not one of the lots upon which the buildings were erected.\n The trial court, in the opinion delivered, said that the complainant charged the defendants with knowledge of the advances made by the company to Bradshaw towards the erection of the buildings; but to this allegation the defendants interposed, in their answer (which was under oath) a positive denial. They admitted that, although wholly ignorant of the source from which the money came to construct the houses, yet, soon after learning that one Childs, a contractor, was engaged in their construction, they notified him in writing, January 4, 1894, that he had been represented to them as a contractor and builder of the houses for which the ground had been broken, and which houses were then in course of erection, and he was thereby notified that if he, his agents or employees, entered upon the grounds, they would be held liable for trespassing thereon, as they (defendants herein) were the owners of the lots, and had not given him or anyone else, the right or permission to enter thereon for the erection of houses or any purpose whatever, and that, as the improvements were not made with their authority, they would not be responsible for any liability contracted by Mr. Bradshaw.\n The defendants, in their answer, also allege that it was not until in or about February, 1895, that defendants, or any of \n\n[204 U.S. 272, 277]\n\u00a0\n them, learned of the advances made by the company or of the existence of the deed of trust. The trial court, in its opinion, stated that although 'there is no evidence contradicting either of these denials, nor of actual knowledge possessed by the defendants of the matters thus denied, still it seems to me there is evidence in the record that facts might readily have been ascertained by them from which they might well have learned at an earlier time of the building and of the source from which the money employed was derived.' While not finding that the defendants had actual knowledge of the advances made by the company, the court did impute knowledge of certain conveyances made to Bradshaw, and of the existence of the deed of trust to the company at earlier dates than those assigned in the answer, February, 1895. And in relation to an offer of compromise the joint answer alleged that after that time, viz., about May 31, 1895, during negotiations for the compromise of the differences between the parties, Mr. H. F. Beardsley, one of the defendants, wrote to the attorneys representing the company, in behalf of himself and his associates, offering to sell to the company the lots upon which the houses then were 'at their present market value or price, said value not to exceed the price at which similar lots (unimproved) in the same or contiguous squares are offered for sale. Upon the payment of said price, or sum, we will convey our title to them by deed or quitclaim, or make a building agreement to so convey upon the determination of the pending suits, or a deed in escrow, as counsel shall advise. We will hold this offer open until the 1st of July next.' This offer was not accepted, but there is nothing stating what, if any, objections were made to it.\n Bradshaw had, in 1894, defaulted in his payments of amounts due for his stock in the company, which he had taken in order to procure his loan. Thereafter some arrangements were attempted between him and the company in regard to making his payments, but they fell through, and nothing could be done in the way of collecting anything on the mortgage or \n\n[204 U.S. 272, 278]\n\u00a0\n deed of trust for the reason that the ejectment actions resulted unfavorably. The company, in 1899, became embarrassed and went into the hands of a receiver in New Orleans, and the same person was appointed ancillary receiver in this District, and brought this with leave of the court.\n The court of appeals held that Bradshaw was an occupant of the premises in bad faith, with the fullest possible knowledge of the rights and claims of the appellees, and that it could not be supposed that the grantee of an occupant in bad faith could have any better right than his grantor had.\n Some other facts are stated in the course of the opinion.\n Messrs. George H. Lamar and Blair Lee for appellant. \n\n[204 U.S. 272, 279]\n\u00a0\n Mr. J. J. Darlington for appellees.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Peckham:\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The foregoing facts show that Bradshaw, if he were plaintiff, would have no cause of action against the defendants, based upon any allegation that he was permitted by them to build on what he thought was his own land, while the defendants stood by and did not interfere to prevent it, although knowing that the land was not his, and claiming title themselves. At all times Bradshaw had knowledge that not only was his title denied, but that these defendants were asserting, to the best of their ability, in actions of ejectment against him, the right to the possession of, and title to, the property in question. Under such circumstances it would simply be at his own risk that he expended money on what might turn out to be other people's property, and which he knew was so claimed. His attitude in the matter would seem to have been that, if he \n\n[204 U.S. 272, 280]\n\u00a0\n could successfully defend the ejectment actions, he could then pay the loan he had obtained from the company; while, if he should prove unsuccessful in the defense, it would be the company's misfortune.\n The company now insists that the money was obtained from it through the fraud of Bradshaw and others, as stated. But before coming to the question of what duty the defendants owed to the company, it may be well to examine for a moment the position of the company in the transaction leading up to its loan to Bradshaw. It is true, the company asserts that it has acted in good faith throughout the whole matter. Upon examining its position one fact is apparent and uncontradicted: Befroe the execution of the deed of trust, and, of course, before the advance of any of the moneys by the company to Bradshaw, the company was aware, through its general attorney in New Orleans, that a suit in equity had been commenced about March 1, 1890, by the Ashleys against Bradshaw and others, wherein they alleged their claim of ownership of the property, which included the lots in question in this case, and in which the plaintiffs sought to enjoin the defendants from setting up any title thereto. It appeared that there was a common source of title to all the lots mentioned in the bill. The bill charged fraudulent and illegal acts on the part of Bradshaw, Walter, and other confederates, in undertaking to seize possession of the lots there claimed to belong to the plaintiffs therein (the defendants in this suit), and specifically described the status of the parties then existing, and denied to Walter and Bradshaw any ownership or right to the possession of the lots. The facts regarding this equity suit were presented by the general attorney for the company, in New Orleans, to the local attorney of the company in this District, and the fact that the bill had been dismissed only for want of prosecution, and without prejudice, was specially called to the attention of the local attorney. No action seems to have been taken regarding the contents of that letter by the local attorney after its receipt other than \n\n[204 U.S. 272, 281]\n\u00a0\n to certify to the title, nor does the general attorney seem to have inquired further about the facts. The bill was, of course, on file in the clerk's office, and it showed the contention as to the title between these defendants and Bradshaw and his associates. With this knowledge, therefore, it is impossible to say that the company was ignorant of the fact of the existence of a question as to the title of Bradshaw to the premises on which he was seeking to obtain this loan. The dismissal of the bill without prejudice, for want of prosecution, would not be evidence that the title of Bradshaw was good or that the controversy had been settled. It certainly was a warning of the existence of a question as to the title, and it was, at any rate, notice enough to start the company upon some investigation of the facts as to the actual condition of the controversy respecting it. And at this time the ejectment actions had been brought and were pending. The declarations in those actions were then on file in the clerk's office of the supreme court of the District, and showed the actions were originally brought to recover possession of 'ink-lot' 1. It is true that while that particular lot did not include the premises upon which the buildings were subsequently erected, yet the source of title to all the lots was the same. Some months before the deed of trust was executed amendments to these declarations, which did include those lots, had been made and were on file in the clerk's office among the papers in those actions.\n Actual knowledge of the fact of the existence of the ejectment actions in regard to ink-lot 1 is, however, denied by the company, and a like denial is made in regard to the amendments to the declarations. The local attorney had knowledge of them, or ought to have had. But, so long as the company had knowledge of the equity suit and the contents of the bill therein, there was enough to put the company on inquiry as to the state of the title. If, under such facts, the company loaned the money, it showed its willingness to take the risk of the validity and sufficiency of the title of Bradshaw. \n\n[204 U.S. 272, 282]\n\u00a0\n The company denied knowledge of the amended declarations because of the alleged defect in the manner of keeping the books in the clerk's office, wherein the ejectment actions were entered, but no statement was made on the page of the docket devoted to those actions of the existence of amendments to the declarations. The amendments were, however, duly filed in the clerk's office, and the alleged failure of the clerk to properly index the amendments was no answer to the failure on the part of the searcher to examine the files for the purpose of seeing the papers in existence in the actions. In this matter we agree with the opinion of the court of appeals, in holding that the respondents here were in nowise responsible for the alleged failure of the clerk to make additions to the docket or index book. Nor is there any evidence that the persons acting for the company were in any way misled by such failure, to the company's detriment.\n The company also insists that it ought not to be charged with any knowledge of any fact which was known only by Walter and the local attorney. The company asserts, first, that Walter and the local attorney were not its agents; and, in any event, by reason of their fraud, knowledge by the company should not be imputed to it because of the knowledge of its agents. The company asserts that Walter was simply the president of its local board, composed of the stockholders in the company residing or to be found in Washington, and that his action was not the action of an agent under such circumstances. It also asserts the same thing in regard to the local attorney, and denies liability for their acts. We think the position cannot be maintained. The president and attorney were directors of the local board and had to be directors before they could hold either office, and the local directors had to be approved by the board of the main office. It was to this local board that the application was first to be made for a loan, and it was to be approved by it and transmitted at once to the main office, signed by the president, secretary, and attorney of the local board on a form furnished by the \n\n[204 U.S. 272, 283]\n\u00a0\n association to applicants for a loan. Transactions of a local nature were put in charge of the local attorney, who represented the company at his locality, and loans were consummated by him and papers sent to him by the company for such action as was necessary for the completion of a loan. The knowledge of the attorney and of the president of the board in regard to a matter coming within the sphere of their duty, and acquired while acting in regard to the same, and sending to the company in New Orleans their report which it was their duty to make, must be imputed to the company. The fact that those agents committed a fraud cannot alter the legal effect of their acts or of their knowledge with respect to the company in regard to third parties who had no connection whatever with them in relation to the perpetration of the fraud, and no knowledge that any such fraud had been perpetrated. There is no pretense of any evidence that the defendants had any connection with these alleged frauds, and no pretense that they had any knowledge of their existence, if they did exist. In such case the rule imputing knowledge to the company by reason of the knowledge of its agent remains.\n But, even if it be assumed that the company had no more than a knowledge of the equity suit and its dismissal without prejudice, it simply shows that the company was willing to take the risk of the title, although confessedly questionable\n Upon these facts we cannot see that the defendants can be held liable to the plaintiff on account of any failure of duty on defendants' part. If the buildings were being erected by Bradshaw, there was certainly no duty on the part of defendants to notify him of their title to the property, and we cannot see that there was any such duty resting upon the defendants to endeavor to find out through what sources Bradshaw obtained the money to erect the buildings, and to inform the person who was loaning the money that the defendants claimed the property as theirs.\n Assuming, even, that the company made the loan in the bona fide belief that Bradshaw had title, and that the claims \n\n[204 U.S. 272, 284]\n\u00a0\n of the defendants to the ownership of the lots were not well founded, and also that no knowledge of the agents of the company in Washington could properly be imputed to it, and we still have the fact that the company loaned its money with knowledge of the equity suit and of the allegations of the bill therein regarding the title of the defendants and the lack of any title in Bradshaw. Imputing no knowledge to the company other than it actually possessed, the same course should be taken with the defendants. In that case we have their sworn denial, unaffected with any proof to the contrary, that they had any actual knowledge of the existence of the deed of trust or of any connection of the company with Bradshaw, or of any advances made by it to Bradshaw, until February, 1895 (long after all the moneys had been advanced), and, even in regard to Bradshaw himself, they notified the contractor early in January, 1894, that they owned the property and they would not be responsible for any expenditures made by Bradshaw, and that if the contractor went on he would be regarded as a trespasser.\n There is no finding that Bradshaw was insolvent, or that the defendants had any knowledge of it if he were insolvent, and hence there is nothing to lead to the assumption that the defendants knew the buildings could only be erected by Bradshaw with borrowed money, and nothing to show any duty on the part of defendants to take active steps and make a search to endeavor to find out who was loaning him money, and on what security. And this is the contention on the part of the complainant. We think it must be regarded as an extraordinary contention and an unreasonable application of the doctrine of constructive notice. This is the language used by the court of appeals, and it properly describes the situation. Certainly constructive notice cannot be applied to the owner of property in regard to the existence of a mortgage thereon, placed there by someone who did not own such property. The owner of real estate is under no obligation whatever to watch the records to see whether someone who \n\n[204 U.S. 272, 285]\n\u00a0\n does not own his property has assumed to place a mortgage upon it or convey it by deed to some third person. The defendants knew Bradshaw was in possession and they saw buildings being erected on the lots. Were they to assume that Bradshaw was borrowing the money, and that they must, therefore, go to work to find out from whom he was borrowing, and notify him of the facts? They in fact knew nothing of the deed of trust, but, by imputing knowledge, the claim is made that a duty founded upon such imputed, but not upon any actual, knowledge, rested upon defendants, for the failure to discharge which the defendants ought to be held liable.\n No case has been called to our attention which in any degree resembles the claim made by the company herein. The man who actually erected the buildings knew all about the state of the title, and that it was contested by the defendants in the most earnest and emphatic manner in their actions of ejectment to recover the lots. The evidence fails to show that the company was, before the money was advanced, entirely innocent of any knowledge on its part which would lead to doubt as to the ownership of the property by Bradshaw. But, even its actual good faith, in the popular sense, cannot charge the defendants with the duty of active investigation to discover from what source Bradshaw obtained the money to build. The simple facts are that the defendants were in possession of the property when this suit was commenced, and they ask no aid from a court of equity to place them in possession. They had recovered it in their actions at law, and a court of equity will not, even in the case of a bona fide improver, grant active relief in such a case. 2 Story, Eq.

We find no cases in opposition to the result we have arrived at.\n The decree of the court below is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","9":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nARTHUR v. TEXAS & P R CO(1907)\nNo. 176\nArgued: January 24, 1907Decided: February 25, 1907\n\n\n\n\n[204 U.S. 505, 506]\n\u00a0\n The plaintiffs in error, who were plaintiffs below, filed their complaint against the railway company in the circuit court of the United States for the western district of Arkansas, Texarkana division. The case arose under the laws of the United States, as the defendant was incorporated under an act of Congress passed March 3, 1871 [16 Stat. at L. 573, chap. 122], which act was amended by one passed May 2, 1872 [17 Stat. at L. 59, chap. 132], among other things changing the name of the corporation to that under which it was sued in this case. Upon the trial the court directed a verdict for the defendant, which was affirmed by the circuit court of appeals (139 Fed. 127), and the plaintiffs have come here by writ of error.\n The action was to recover damages against the defendant for loss by fire of 50 bales of cotton, which were burned at Texarkana, Texas, September 19, 1900, and which the plaintiffs allege had been duly delivered to the defendant at that place, under a through bill of lading for transportation to Utica, New York. In the third clause of the conditions stated in the bill of lading was a provision 'that neither the Texas & Pacific Railway Company nor any connecting carrier handling said cotton shall be liable for damages to or destruction of said cotton by fire.' In the fifth clause of the bill of lading it was provided that 'each carrier over whose road the cotton is to be carried hereunder shall have the privilege, at its own cost, to compress the same for greater convenience in handling and forwarding, and shall not be responsible for deviation or unavoidable delays in procuring such compression.'\n Although the cotton was destroyed by fire, plaintiffs alleged that they were not concluded by the fire clause, which they allege was void 'because (1) said bill of lading was executed by said plaintiffs under duress; (2) said provision is unreason- \n\n[204 U.S. 505, 507]\n\u00a0\n able; and (3) was without a consideration.' The freight rates charged in the bill were the regular rates for the shipment of cotton over all lines of railway between Texarkana and Utica, New York, and no option was given to said plaintiffs, as they allege in their complaint, to receive any other form of bill of lading than that exempting the defendant from liability for loss of the cotton by fire, and plaintiffs allege they did not assent thereto.\n It was also alleged that the place where the cotton was stored after its delivery to the railway company by the plaintiffs was not a safe place, being on the platform of the Union Compress Company; that the platform was not inclosed, and that there was no proper provision made to prevent the destruction of the cotton by fire, and that the cotton was at such place exposed to the sparks of passing engines, and that the employees of the Union Compress Company, which was the agent of the defendant, neglected to care for the cotton, which caught fire from sparks from a passing engine and was destroyed, September 19, 1900, whereby defendant became liable to the plaintiffs in the sum of $2,605, the value of the cotton. The defendant, by answer, put in issue all the allegations as to negligence by its own servants or by the servants or agents of the compress company, and also denied that the plaintiffs had ever delivered the cotton to the railway company; and alleged that at the time it was destroyed it was in the possession and control of the compress company, which was not its agent, and over which it had no control.\n Upon the trial evidence was given tending to prove the following facts: The plaintiffs, with offices at Texarkana, were extensive buyers of cotton, which they purchased in the surrounding country and had it transported to that place as a place of concentration, where it might be classified and subsequently transported to the East and other parts of the country by the railroads.\n The Union Compress Company was an independent corporation, doing business at Texarkana, as a compressor of cotton, \n\n[204 U.S. 505, 508]\n\u00a0\n which it compressed for the various railroads having tracks at that place. The compress company had a platform on its own land of about 400 x 600 feet, upon which cotton was delivered from wagons and from railroad cars, and the receipt of the cotton was acknowledged by the compress company, From this platform cotton was loaded on the respective cars of the different railroads, the tracks of which surrounded the platform on three of its sides. This platform was within the state of Texas. Substantially all the cotton received at Texarkana was received at this platform. The local platform of the defendant company was not calculated to receive cotton for shipment by the company, on account of its small size, and the defendant's agent testified that he would not know what to do with cotton if offered at this platform, except to send it to the platform of the compress company. When cotton was placed on the platform of the compress company it did not then compress it, but it remained there until further orders were given, as herein stated. After delivery on the platform, and after the shipper had procured the written acknowledgment of the receipt of the cotton by the compress company, the practice was for the shipper, when he was ready to have it shipped, to go to the railway company, and, upon the surrender of the receipts of the compress company to the agent of the railway company, the shipper would receive from such agent a bill of lading for the cotton, which acknowledged its receipt by the company and the place and person it was consigned to, and the shipper had nothing further to do in regard to the cotton. He issued no orders for compressing it, and was not allowed to route it by any particular route. He would identify the cotton covered by the bill and give the destination point of the cotton and the name of the consignee, and there his right ended. The railroad company, when it received from the shipper the compress company's receipt, and gave its bill of lading to the shipper, took the receipts of the compress company and gave them up, and directed the company to \n\n[204 U.S. 505, 509]\n\u00a0\n compress the cotton and obtain insurance upon it covering the responsibility of the railroad company, and load it into cars to be designated by the railroad company's agent. It was a general understanding between the railroad company and the compress company that when the former delivered the cotton receipts to the compress company it was to compress the cotton, obtain the insurance, and give the policies to the agent of the railway company, and ship the cotton on the cars pointed out by the railway company's agent. There is no evidence that the compress company ever compressed cotton at the orders of the shipper, or charged him for the storage of the cotton on the platform. The compressing was in fact done by the compress company for the railway company, for its convenience, by its direction, and at its cost. While the cotton was being compressed the compress company was not under the control of the railway company in matters relating to the mode and manner of compressing, nor were the employees of the compress company under any control by the railway company, but the compress company followed the orders of the railway company when to compress and where to load the cotton after compressing.\n This customary way of doing business was followed with regard to the cotton in question. It was received on the platform of the compress company from plaintiffs, and receipts given for it to them. These receipts were taken on September 17, 1900, to the agent of the railway company, who thereupon signed and delivered a bill of lading to plaintiffs, acknowledging the receipt of the cotton to be transported to Utica, New York, at named rates. The agent of the railway company then took these receipts which plaintiffs had handed to him, and delivered them to the compress company, and gave written instructions, signed by such agent, to the compress company on a form customarily used, and which ran thus: 'I have this day issued on your compress receipts bill of lading to W. A. Arthur & Company for 50 bales of cotton (marks, number of bales, and total weight given). Do- \n\n[204 U.S. 505, 510]\n\u00a0\n mestic. Compress and ship the above cotton,' as stated in directions. The compress company, when its own receipts were delivered to it by the railway company's agent, in accordance with its general custom, caused this cotton to be insured for the benefit of the defendant company and in the name of that company, and delivered the policies to the agent of the railway company, who forwarded them to division headquarters at Dallas, Texas. The compress company paid for the insurance under the direction of the railway company.\n It was while the cotton was still on the platform, and not yet compressed, that it was burned.\n The order adopted by the Texas state railroad commission, which was put in evidence, reads as follows:\n'Thirteenth. When cotton is tendered to railroad companies upon compress platform, which is situated on the track of such railroad companies, it shall be the duty of the railroad companies to take charge of and receipt for such cotton in the same manner and on the same terms as they would receive and receipt for cotton when taken at its own depot or platform erected for such transactions; provided, however, that the shipper or the compress company shall, in such cases, assume the additional risk of insurance involved by such act of the railroad company.'\n\n The rule of the defendant was also put in evidence, and reads as follows:\n'Rule Eleven. When cotton is tendered this company upon a compress platform which is situated on the track of this company, agent shall take charge of and receipt for such cotton in the same manner and on the same terms as he would receive and receipt for the cotton if tendered him at this company's depot platform or other places assigned by it for such transactions; provided, however, that the shipper or the compress company shall, in such cases, assume the additional risk of insurance involved by such act of this company.' \n\n[204 U.S. 505, 511]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William H. Arnold, James K. Jones, and James K. Jones, Jr., for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n\n\n[204 U.S. 505, 513]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Daivd D. Duncan and John F. Dillon for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Peckham: \n\n[204 U.S. 505, 514]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The plaintiffs, in order to avoid the obstacle in the agreement in the third clause of the bill of lading, providing that defendant was not to be liable for damages to the cotton by fire, contend, as set up in the complaint, that the clause in the bill of lading was received under duress, and that it was unreasonable and without consideration. These contentions have been answered and overruled, upon much the same evidence, in the case of Cau v. Texas & P. R. Co. \n194 U.S. 427\n, 48 L. ed. 1053, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 663, and need not be further discussed.\n With the fire clause in force, it became necessary for the plaintiffs, in maintaining their action, to show that defendant had received the cotton, and that it was destroyed through the negligence of the defendant or its agents, as the exemption would not apply to a case of damage occurring through such negligence. Bank of Kentucky v. Adams Exp. Co. \n93 U.S. 174\n, 23 L. ed. 872. We are of opinion, after carefully reading the record, that there was evidence enough to be submitted to the jury upon the question of negligence in the care of the cotton while on the platform.\n This leaves the questions whether there was a delivery of the cotton to the railway company, and whether the compress \n\n[204 U.S. 505, 515]\n\u00a0\n company, at the time of the fire, was the agent of the railway company as to that cotton.\n Upon the evidence in this case, was there a delivery? The evidence showed that the cotton was not delivered on the platform by the plaintiffs for the purpose of being compressed for them by the compress company. The order to compress was subsequently given by the railway company. That company had no other place of the delivery of the cotton to it than at this platform, but, as there were three companies with tracks at the platform, with either one of which the shipper might contract for the transportation of the cotton, it cannot be held that there was, at the time of the delivery of the cotton at the platform, a delivery to the defendant, especially as the compress company itself acknowledged the receipt of the cotton. But when these receipts were handed by the plaintiffs to the defendant's agent, who took them and issued a bill of lading to the plaintiffs, the constructive possession and the entire control of the cotton passed to the defendant. It could then, if so minded, have taken the cotton and loaded it on cars and taken it away without having had it compressed. It was, however, compressed by its own order, given in writing to the compress company, and for its own convenience, and at its own cost, and the insurance was obtained by its direction by the compress company, in the name of the defendant and for its benefit, and such policies were delivered to the defendant and sent by its agent to Dallas. Most probably the cost of compression and insurance was paid by the plaintiffs in the rate paid by them for the transportation of the cotton, as that cost was one of the factors which may be supposed to have entered into the rate of freight charged by the defendant; but the total sum paid for transportation by plaintiffs left the matter with defendant to compress and insure if it saw fit, which it probably would think fit to do in all cases, as an ordinary business precaution. The fact that in getting the cotton compressed the railway chose to have it done by an independent con- \n\n[204 U.S. 505, 516]\n\u00a0\n tractor, over whose acts it had no control while the cotton was being compressed, and the fact that it would other the compress company, after compressing, to load the cotton on cars selected by defendant's agent, did not in any way affect the fact that the cotton had been received by the railway company, and that it was thereafter subject to its full control. The defendant could not devest itself of the responsibility of due care by leaving the cotton to be compressed and loaded by the compress company. The latter company was, while so acting, the agent of the defendant, chosen by it, and, as scuh, the defendant was responsible for any lack of proper care of the cotton by the compress company. Bank of Kentucky v. Adams Exp. Co. supra.\n It is urged that the case cited does not cover the facts herein, because in the reported case the attempt was to secure the immunity of the defendant express company from the consequences of the negligence of the railroad in doing the very thing that the express company had agreed to do, viz., transport the money; while in the case before us the negligence of the compress company (assuming there was such) was not in transporting the cotton, which the railway company had agreed to do, but in caring for it while awaiting compression. We see no difference, in fact, which would lead to a different result.\n The compression was done for the convenience of the railroad company, after the company had received the cotton, and before the actual transportation had commenced. In order to enable it the more conveniently to do the work of transportation it cannot devest itself of its obligation to exercise due care while the cotton is in the control of the compress company, although the latter is an independent contractor, and not under the immediate control of the railway company while doing the work of compression in its behalf. There would be no justice in such holding, and we are clear it would violate the general rule that the carrier, after the freight has been received by it, must be regarded as liable, \n\n[204 U.S. 505, 517]\n\u00a0\n at least, for the negligence of its own servants, and also for that of the servants of an independent contractor, employed by it to do work upon the freight for its own convenience and at its own cost.\n In California Ins. Co. v. Union Compress Co. \n133 U.S. 387\n, 33 L. ed. 730, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 365, the question was simply as to the liability of the insurance company on a policy of insurance against fire, issued by it to the Union Compress Company upon cotton in the possession of the compress company for compression, and which belonged to divers other parties. The policy insured the cotton for the plaintiff while 'in bales, their own or held by them in trust or on commission.' The defense was that, as the compress company did not own the cotton, and the beneficiaries under the policy were its owners, that no interest of any carrier was covered by the policy. The court held that the railway companies were beneficiaries under the policy, because they had an insurable interest in the cotton, and to that extent were its owners, and that it was held in trust for them by the plaintiff. The railway company had issued bills of lading upon the surrender of the receipts of the compress company. It was held that where the original depositors of the cotton had surrendered to the railroad companies the receipts which they had taken from the compress company, that those companies became substituted in the relation to the compress company which before had been held by the depositors of the cotton; that the railroad companies thus became the beneficiaries of the trust so far as the compress company was concerned, because they thus became the persons to whom that company owed the duty of bailment, and the persons entitled to demand possession of the property from the plaintiff. The policy also contained a provision that it should be void if there were any change in the possession of the insured property, and the defendants insisted that there was such a change, caused by the signing of the bill of lading by the railway companies in return for the receipts given by the compress company upon the de- \n\n[204 U.S. 505, 518]\n\u00a0\n posit of the cotton with the latter company, although no actual change had taken place, and the cotton still remained in the custody of the compress company. It was, however, held that the railway companies, in acquiring the receipts of the compress company and issuing bills of lading for the cotton, took only constructive possession of it, and the plaintiff retained actual physical possession of it, and did not lose any element of possession necessary to give it the right to effect the insurance for its own benefit and as bailee or agent for the protection of the railway companies, although the railroad companies' was the right to ultimate possession, which passed to them by the original deposit of the cotton receipts given by the plaintiff.\n The question of whether there had been a change of possession within the meaning of that expression as used in the insurance policy is entirely different from that of whether immediate control of the cotton passed to the railway company by virtue of the delivery of the bill of lading in this case, so as to render the company liable for any neglect by it or its agent in regard to the subsequent care of the cotton. In the case at bar, not only was there a constructive possession by the railway company, but that company assumed full control of the cotton, and gave directions to the compress company what to do with it.\n In St. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co. \n139 U.S. 223\n, 35 L. ed. 154, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 554, the question was also in regard to insurance, the insurance company endeavoring to collect from the defendant what it had paid to the owners of the cotton. In that case the cotton, which had been destroyed by fire, was in the possession of the compress company, and the railway company had never given any bill of lading for it. The insurance companies had issued policies upon and delivered them to the owners of the cotton, and when the cotton had been destroyed by fire the companies paid the losses and claimed that the railway company was liable under the contract which the company had made with the compress \n\n[204 U.S. 505, 519]\n\u00a0\n company to receive the cotton and transport it over its railroad across the Arkansas river to the press of the compress company in Argenta, a distance of a mile and a half. The insurance companies insisted that, by the failure of the railway company, under its contract with the compress company, to transport this cotton as fast as it came in, the amount of the cotton became so great as to constitute a public nuisance, as it was piled up in the compress company's warehouse and overflowed into the adjoining streets. This court held that, as there had been no bills of lading issued by the railway company for the cotton which had been destroyed, the failure of the railway company to furnish sufficient transportation for the cotton to the compress company, while it may have been a breach of the contract between the railway company and the compress company, yet such breach created no liability in contract or tort to the owners or insurers of the cotton or to any other person. The court, at page 237, L. ed. at page 158, Sup. Ct. Rep. at page 558, said: 'This cotton, certainly, was in the exclusive possession and control of the compress company. The railway company had not assumed the liability of a common carrier, or even of a warehouseman, with regard to it; had given no bills of lading for it; had no custody or control of it and no possession of it, actual or constructive, and had no hand in placing or keeping it where it was.'\n In speaking of the issuing of bills of lading by the railway company for certain other cotton and what effect it had upon the rights of the parties, in the case then under consideration, the court said, page 238, L. ed. page 159, Sup. Ct. Rep. page 558:\n'There is nothing else in the case which has any tendency to show that the railway company had or exercised any control or custody of the cotton, or of the place where it was kept by the compress company, before it was put upon the cars by that company. The railway company evidently neither considered itself, nor was considered by the compress company, as having assumed any responsibility for the care or custody of the cotton, until it had been insured in its behalf and loaded \n\n[204 U.S. 505, 520]\n\u00a0\n upon its cars. The evidence warranted, if it did not require, the inference that the bills of lading were issued merely for the convenience of all parties, and with no intention of making any change in the actual or the legal custody of the cotton until it was so loaded.'\n\n Such is not the case here.\n In Missouri P R. Co. v. McFadden, \n154 U.S. 155\n, 38 L. ed. 944, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 990, the case was decided upon the facts therein stated, which were that it was understood both by the carrier and the shipper that the cotton was not to be delivered at the time the bills of lading were issued, the cotton at that time being in the hands of the compress company, which compress company was the agent of the shipper, it being the intention of the parties at the time the bills of lading were issued that the cotton should remain in the hands of the compress company, the agent of the shipper, for the purpose of being compressed. These allegations were made in the answer of the company, which was excepted to, and their truth was therefore admitted. The trial court had, nevertheless, held the company liable for the loss of the cotton. This court said (page 160, L. ed. page 946, Sup. Ct. Rep. page 991): 'The case presents the simple question of whether a carrier is liable on a bill of lading for property which, at the time of the signing of the bill, remained in the hands of the shipper for the purpose of being compressed for the shipper's account, and was destroyed by fire before the delivery to the carrier had been consummated.' The court held that, under such circumstances, there was no liability on the part of the common carrier, because it had never had the cotton delivered to it, the issuing of the bill of lading being subject to the intention of the parties, and the cotton remaining in the hands of the compress company as agent of the shipper.\n The facts in the case at bar are totally different.\n Stress was laid in the argument before us upon the fact that, under the 13th rule of the Texas railroad commission, the defendant was bound to sign the bill of lading when the receipts of the compress company were presented \n\n[204 U.S. 505, 521]\n\u00a0\n to the railway company, and that, therefore, the defendant cannot be held to have become liable by virtue of the delivery of the bill of lading in question upon such a purely arbitrary order. It is also urged that the 11th rule of the defendant, which is set up in the foregoing statement, and which is to the same effect as the order of the railroad commission, was adopted simply pursuant to that order, and, therefore, no liability attaches from the bill of lading issued under the circumstances of this case. We think the argument is not sound. The rule of the Texas commission applies to a case when the cotton is tendered to the railway company, although at the time it is upon the compress company's platform. Now, if the railway company did not regard the rresentation of these receipts as in fact a tender to the railway company of the cotton in question, or if it were not a valid tender of the cotton, it could have refused to sign the bill of lading. The same may be said of rule 11 of the company itself. The company evidently regarded the cotton as tendered them, and issued the bill in acknowledgment of the fact of such tender.\n We think the evidence in this case made out a delivery to and acceptance by the railway company of the cotton in question, and that the compress company had the actual custody of the cotton as the agent of the railway company, and the question of whether the persons in whose custody it was at the time of the fire were guilty of negligence was a question which should have been submitted to the jury.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals and that of the Circuit Court should be reversed and the case remanded to the Circuit Court with directions to set aside the verdict and to grant a new trial.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","10":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nATLANTIC COAST LINE R.

A sketch showing the situation of the railway tracks at and relating to the place with which the controversy is concerned was annexed by the court below to its opinion, and that sketch is reproduced to aid in clearness of statement. [See next page.]\n For years prior to October, 1903, the Coast Line operated daily an interstate train from Richmond, Virginia, through North Carolina to Florida. This train, known as No. 39, moved over the main track from Richmond to Wilson, North Carolina, thence by the track designated as the cutoff via Selma and Fayetteville to Florida. The train (No. 39) was scheduled to reach Selma at 2:50 in the afternoon and to leave at 2:55. The Southern Railway owned or controlled a road in North Carolina which crossed the Coast Line main track at Goldsboro and the cut-off track at Selma. On this road there was operated daily a train from Goldsboro via Raleigh to Greensboro, North Carolina, at which point connection was made with the main track of the Southern road. This Southern \n\n[206 U.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\n of the connection made with the Norfolk train at Rocky Mount, and would disarrange the running time of the train south of Selma, and disturb connections which that train made with other roads south of that point. However, it was pointed out that as train No. 39 did not originate at Richmond, but was a through train, made up at New York, carried from thence to Washington by the Pennsylvania, and from Washington to Richmond by the Richmond, Fredericksburg, & Potomac, that negotiations would be put on foot with those roads with an endeavor to secure an acceleration of the time of the departure of the train from New York and Washington, so as thereby to enable an earlier departure from Richmond. On the 11th of October the change of time became operative and the connection at Selma was broken.\n A complaint having been lodged with the corporation commission because of the inconvenience to the public thereby occasioned, both the Southern and Coast Line were notified that a hearing would be had concerning the subject on the 29th. On that day the railways, through their officials, appeared. The Southern represented that its change in time was because it was absolutely dangerous to operate its train at the speed required by the previous schedule, and, indeed, that the lengthened schedule was yet faster than desired. The Coast Line reiterated the impossibility of changing the schedule of train No. 39 from Richmond to Selma unless there was a change between New York and Richmond. It stated that there was to be a meeting in Washington on November 6 of the representatives of various roads in the South, and that it hoped, as the result of that meeting, to so arrange that No. 39 would be scheduled for delivery at Richmond at an earlier hour, thus enabling its time to Selma to be advanced. The commission continued the subject for further consideration. On November 9 the superintendent of the Coast Line advised the corporation commission that at the meeting in Washington it had been impossible to obtain an earlier departure of the train from New York and Washington, but that the Pennsyl- \n\n[206 U.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n vania still had the matter under consideration. Finally, in answer to urgent requests from the commission, by a letter of November 13 and telegram of November 14, the Coast Line informed the corporation commission that it regretted it could make no change in its schedule of train No. 39 because the Pennsylvania railroad had definitely expressed its inability to make any change in the hour of departure of the train from New York, as to do so would be incompatible with the duties which the Pennsylvania railroad owed to the public, to other roads, and to its contracts concerning the transportation of the mail and express matter. Thereupon the corporation commission entered the following order:\n'Whereas, the convenience of the traveling public requires that close connection be made between the passenger trains on the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad and the Southern Railway at Selma daily in the afternoon of each day;\n\n'And whereas, it appears that such close connection is practicable:\n\n'It is ordered that the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad arrange its schedule so that the train will arive at Selma at 2:25 P. M. each day instead of 2:50 P. M., as the schedule now stands.\n\n'It is further ordered that if the Atlantic Coast Line trains have passengersen route for the Southern Railway, and are delayed, notice shall be given to the Southern Railway, and that the Southern Railway shall wait fifteen minutes for such delayed trains upon receipt of such notice.\n\n'This order shall take effect December 20, 1903.'\n\n The Southern, on receipt of the order, expressed its intention to comply. The Coast Line addressed to the commission a letter protesting against the order, and requesting its withdrawal, and asking for a further hearing. The letter making this request reviewed the previous correspondence. It pointed out that the connection at Selma had been a very old one and that its breaking was solely caused by the act of the Southern in changing the time of its train. It declared that the Coast Line at once, on hearing of the intention of the Southern to make \n\n[206 U.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n the change, urgently requested that road not to do so. On this subject the letter said:\n'On October 6th, I further advised the Southern Railway that if their train was scheduled to leave Selma at 2:25 P. M. this would break the connection with our No. 39, and stated to them that the connection was a most important one, being the principal outlet for passengers en route from eastern Carolina to Raleigh and other points on their line, and that we hoped that they could see their way clear not to disturb the connection, as it was impossible for us to get No. 39 to Selma at an earlier hour than the present schedule, owing to the inability of northern connections to deliver the train to us at Richmond any sooner.'\n\n Proceeding to point out the failure of the negotiations with the Pennsylvania, and recapitulating the previous statements concerning the rapidity of the schedule of No. 39 between Richmond and Selma, the exacting nature of its work and connections, the absolute impossibility of making it faster was insisted upon. Indeed, there was annexed to the letter a report of the time of No. 39 at Selma for a period of nearly five months, showing that the train had rarely made its connection at Selma.\n The commission, after a hearing afforded officials of the Coast Line, suspended its prior order and fixed a day for a rehearing of the whole subject, both roads being notified to that effect. Upon the new hearing the matter was taken under advisement. On January 16 the commission stated the facts and its conclusions deduced therefrom. As to the operation of the two trains, their connection at Selma, the importance of this connection to the public, and the breaking of the connection by the change of schedule, the facts found were identical with those above previously recited. In addition it was found that the Coast Line train No. 39 from Richmond to Selma was not only a through train, but also operated as a local train between Richmond and Selma, making all local stops, and daily handling, in consequence, one or two extra express cars. It was found in accordance with the official time sheets of the running of the \n\n[206 U.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n train that it had arrived at Selma on schedule time only twice between August 1, 1903, and January 11, 1904. Considering the branch lines as marked on the sketch, and the trains operated thereon and connecting with the main track at Rocky Mount, it was found:\n a. That a train was operated from Plymouth to Rocky Mount, which left in the morning at 7:30 and arrived at Rocky Mount at 10:35, where it remained until 3:55 in the afternoon, when it returned to Plymouth.\n b. That the road also operated a train from Spring Hope on the westerly side of the main track to Rocky Mount, leaving Spring Hope at 11: 20 in the morning, arriving at Rocky Mount at 12:10 in the afternoon, and leaving there at 4, arriving at Spring Hope at 4:45. The commission concluded as follows:\n'Assuming that the statements made by the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company are true,-that it was, for the past five months, impossible for them to bring No. 39 to Selma by schedule time, to wit, 2: 50 P. M., more than twice, and that this train was more than ten minutes late every day except twenty-four,-we must conclude that it is impracticable to require them to make a faster schedule and place this train at Selma at 2:25 P. M. instead of 2:50 P. M.; and therefore this much of the former order is revoked and annulled; but the commission is of the opinion that it is practicable, and that the convenience of the traveling public requires, that the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company furnish transportation for passengers from Rocky Mount to Selma after 12: 50 P. M. and by or before 2:25 P. M. each day; that this can be done by extending the run of the Plymouth train to Selma instead of having it lie over at Rocky Mount as now, or by extending the run of the Spring Hope train to Selma instead of having it lie over at Rocky Mount as now. The distance from Plymouth to Rocky Mount is 69 miles, and from Spring Hope to Rocky Mount is 19 miles, and from Rocky Mount to Selma 42 miles; or by providing a separate train for the service.\n\n'And it is therefore ordered that the Atlantic Coast Line \n\n[206 U.S. 1, 13]\n\u00a0\n Railroad Company furnish transportation for passengers from Rocky Mount to Selma after 12:50 P. M. and by or before 2:25 P. M. each day.\n\n'It is further ordered that the Southern Railway hold its train No. 135 at Selma fifteen minutes if, for any reason, the Atlantic Coast Line train connecting at that point is delayed.\n\n'It is further ordered that this order take effect on and after the 26th day of January, 1904.'\n\n Before the date fixed for the taking effect of this order the Coast Line filed five grounds of exception to its validity and prayed another hearing. The first asserted the impossibility of making the connection from Rocky Mount to Selma between the hours fixed by the commission by an extension of the run of either of the branch trains referred to in the order which the commission had rendered. The reasons principally relied upon to sustain the first exception were the inadequate character of the motive power of the branch road trains for operation on the main track, the speed at which the train would be obliged to travel, and the congested condition of the business on the main track during the hours when the train from either of the branch roads would be obliged to use the main track for the purpose of making the connection. The second exception denied the possibility of making the connection by a special train from Rocky Mount to Selma within the time indicated, and besides asserted that such a train could not be operated without an actual loss. The power of the commission to compel the performance of 'services without compensation to the company' was denied, and it was alleged that a taking of property without due process of law, in violation of the state Constitution and the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States would result from enforcing the order. The third exception denied the power of the commission, under the state law, to order the company to put on an extra train between Rocky Mount and Selma, and the fourth in effect reiterated the same ground. The fifth exception challenged the validity of the order as unreasonable, unjust, and arbitrary, and \n\n[206 U.S. 1, 14]\n\u00a0\n beyond the power of the commission to render, because ample and sufficient accommodations for passengers desiring to connect at Selma with the Southern road were afforded by the Coast Line, entirely irrespective of the connection which had formerly existed between train No. 39 of the Coast Line and train No. 135 of the Southern. The trains thus relied upon as showing a wholly adequate service for the purposes stated were eight in number, and, as enumerated in the exception, are stated in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n After a new hearing at which further testimony was taken, the corporation commission in substance adhered to its former view and reiterated its previous ruling. In its findings of fact it pointed out the importance of the connection at Selma, the admissions to that effect made by the railroad and the fact that \n\n[206 U.S. 1, 15]\n\u00a0\n that connection afforded the principal means of travel between the eastern and western parts of the state. The grounds relied upon in the exception to show that an extension of the run of either of the local trains from Rocky Mount to Selma, as previously ordered, was impracticable, were reviewed and found to be without foundation. The trains which it was alleged afforded adequate means for connection between the western and eastern part of the state, irrespective of the connection formerly existing at Selma by train No. 39, were analyzed, and as a matter of fact the service afforded by these trains was held to be wholly inadequate. Thus, for example, whilst it was found that the first train relied upon- the one from Rocky Mount to Goldsboro, arriving there at 6:50 in the morning-made a connection with a Southern Railway train moving from Selma via Raleigh to Greensboro, it was pointed out that it was inadequate because the train had no connection at its point of departure, Rocky Mount, with any incoming train over the large area covered by the branch roads, which area, it was stated, embraced a population of four hundred thousand people. Hence it was found that, to use that train, any person in the territory covered by the branch roads would be obliged to leave home the day before and pass the night at Rocky Mount. The fourth train relied upon, that is, a connection made by Coast Line No. 39 at Selma under the new schedule with a later train over the Southern road for Raleigh, was found to be but a connection with a Southern freight train, having no passenger car, but only a caboose. The trains under the second, third, and sixth headings, connecting at Goldsboro or Selma in the afternoon and night, were found to make a connection only with a slow train over the Southern road, doing a mixed passenger and freight business, and which made no adequate connection beyond Raleigh to the west. The objection to suggested route No. 8, that is, via Weldon, and thence by the Seaboard Air Line to Raleigh and points further west, was decided to be that it was a longer route, more costly, and uncertain as to connections. The remaining suggested \n\n[206 U.S. 1, 16]\n\u00a0\n routes were in effect disposed of upon similar considerations to those above adverted to.\n Considering the operation of an extratrain from Rocky Mount to Selma or the extension of the run of one of the branch trains as directed in the previous order, and the objection that a loss would be entailed in the operating expenses for such train or trains, the commission treated that fact as immaterial, because it found as a matter of fact that the total receipts of the Coast Line in North Carolina, taken from business in that state, were sufficiently remunerative, and therefore that even if the train was operated at a loss, as that loss would not reduce the total earnings below what was an adequate remuneration for the whole business, the order would not take the property of the road without due process of law. Summing up its conclusions, the commission said:\n'The commission is of the opinion that the facilities given heretofore by the Atlantic Coast Line Company to the traveling public should not be lessened; that the connection furnished passengers from the Washington branch, the Norfolk & Carolina branch, the Plymouth branch, and the Nashville branch with No. 135, Southern Railway passenger train at Selma, and also for all points between Rocky Mount and Selma, for nearly ten years, should be restored; that if this cannot be done by the Atlantic Coast Line train No. 39, as formerly, on account of this train being heavier, containing usually one or more extra express cars, and in all usually ten or more cars, and on account of increase in business between Richmond and Selma, which necessitates longer stops, then other facilities should be furnished by the Atlantic Coast Line Company; that this connection, which was the principal outlet for passengers from eastern Carolina to Selma and other Southern Railway points for the last ten years, instead of being abandoned should be made permanent and certain; and that this result be accomplished by carrying out the order heretofore made in this court. It is ordered, therefore, that the exceptions be, and they are hereby, overruled.' \n\n[206 U.S. 1, 17]\n\u00a0\n The Coast Line, as authorized by statute, appealed to the superior court of Wake county, city of Raleigh, and the case was there tried de novo before a court and jury. The jury, under the instructions of the court, considered and responded to the eight questions, which follow:\n\n'1. Is it practicable for train No. 39 of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, due to arrive at Selma at 2:50 P. M. to make connection at Selma with train No. 135, westbound, of the Southern Railway, due to leave Selma at 2:25 P. M.?\n\n'Answer. No.\n\n'2. Is it practicable to make said connection by extending the run of the Plymouth train daily from Plymouth to Selma and return, and, if so, what would be the additional expense?\n\n'Answer. No.\n\n'3. Is it practicable to make said connection by the use of the Spring Hope train, and, if so, what would be the additional expense?\n\n'Answer. No.\n\n'4. In order to make such connection would defendant company have to run an additional train on its main line from Rocky Mount to Selma?\n\n'Answer. Yes.\n\n'5. Is it practicable for said train to safely run the schedule prescribed in plaintiff's order, having due regard to the number of trains and number of stops, on defendant's main line from Rocky Mount to Selma?\n\n'Answer. Yes.\n\n'6. What would be the daily cost of operating such train from Rocky Mount to Selma and return?\n\n'Answer. $40.00.\n\n'7. What would be the probable daily receipts from such train?\n\n'Answer. $25.00.\n\n'8. Is it reasonable and proper that, for convenience of the traveling public, the defendant company should be required to make such connection? \n\n[206 U.S. 1, 18]\n\u00a0\n 'Answer. Yes.'\n\n The answers to the first four questions were the result of peremptory instructions by the court, and the responses to the last four were deduced by the jury from the testimony submitted to its consideration.\n The court granted the prayer of the Atlantic Coast Line to that effect, and rendered judgment on the verdict in its favor. The corporation commission was held to be without power 'to interfere with the right of railway companies to regulate for themselves the time and manner in which passengers and property should be transported,' provided only such companies complied with the existing statutory direction 'to run one passenger train at least each way over its line every week day.' On appeal the supreme court of North Carolina reversed the judgment. The facts found by the corporation commission were reiterated and it was held that error had been committed by the court below in instructing the jury to give a negative response to the first three propositions. Indeed, it was declared that the only essential proposition submitted to the jury was the eighth, which required it to be determined whether the connection at Selma was necessary for the public convenience. Treating the facts found by the commission as sustaining the conclusion reached by that body, it was decided that the commission had power to make the order, and that the exercise of the authority was not repugnant either to the Constitution of the United States or of the state. Notwithstanding the finding of facts made concerning the means by which the connection at Selma was to be performed, the court construed the order of the commission as not having been solely based upon the means of performance referred to in the findings, and as embracing not only a choice of the methods referred to therein, but any other which the Coast Line might choose to adopt, provided only it accomplished the purpose of the order. But whilst thus, from one point of view, treating the order of the commission so as to render it unnecessary to pass upon the particular methods for mak- \n\n[206 U.S. 1, 19]\n\u00a0\n ing the connection at Selma referred to in the findings, the court yet reviewed the means of performance therein stated. In doing so it was decided that although to execute the order of the commission it might be imperative for the Coast Line to operate at a pecuniary loss a new train from Rocky Mount to Selma, or the extension, with like result, of the movement of one or the other of the branch trains from Rocky Mount to Selma, no violation of any right of the Coast Line protected by the Constitution of the United States or of the state would arise. This was based upon the finding by the court that the average net earning of the railroad from its business in North Carolina was of such a character that an adequate remuneration would remain after allowing for any possible loss which might arise from operating either of the trains in question. 137 N. C. 14, 49 S. E. 191.\n All the assignments of error challenge the correctness of the decision below on the ground of its repugnancy to the due process or equal protection clauses of the 14th Amendment. The elementary proposition that railroads, from the public nature of the business by them carried on and the interest which the public have in their operation, are subject, as to their state business, to state regulation, which may be exerted either directly by the legislative authority or by administrative bodies endowed with power to that end, is not and could not be successfully questioned, in view of the long line of authorities sustaining that docrine. \n2\n Accepting this \n\n[206 U.S. 1, 20]\n\u00a0\n general rule, the assignments of error rest upon the hypothesis that the order which the court below enforced was so arbitrary and unreasonable in its character as to transcend the limits of regulation, and to be in effect a denial of due process of law, or a deprivation of the equal protection of the laws.\n As the public power to regulate railways and the private right of ownership of such property coexist and do not the one destroy the other, it has been settled that the right of ownership of railway property, like other property rights, finds protection in constitutional guaranties, and, therefore, wherever the power of regulation is exerted in such an arbitrary and unreasonable was as to cause it to be in effect not a regulation, but an infringement upon the right of ownership, such an exertion of power is void because repugnant to the due process and equal protection clauses of the 14th Amendment. \n3\n The result, therefore, is that the proposition relied upon is well founded if it be that the order which the court below enforced was of the arbitrary and unreasonable character asserted.\n In coming to consider the question just stated it must be borne in mind that a court may not, under the guise of protecting private property, extend its authority to a subject of regulation not within its competency, but is confined to ascertaining whether the particular assertion of the legislative power to regulate has been exercised to so unwarranted a degree as, in substance and effect, to exceed regulation, and to be equivalent to a taking of property without due process of law, or a denial of the equal protection of the laws. We shall not, in analyzing the case, undertake to review in their order the \n\n[206 U.S. 1, 21]\n\u00a0\n ten propositions of error found in the record and reproduced in the briefs of counsel, as each proposition, although numbered separately, but reiterates grounds of error to be found in the others. In other words, the various grounds of error are so interblended in the several propositions as to render it impossible to treat one as distinct from the other. All the grounds, however, which the propositions assert as establishing the arbitrary and unreasonable character of the order complained of may be embraced under four general headings, which we proceed to dispose of.\n\n 1. \nThat the order was arbitrary and unreasonable, because beyond the scope of the authority delegated to the corporation commission by the state law.\n As this proposition involves no Federal question, and is concluded by the judgment entered below, we put the subject out of view. And, although not cognate to this proposition, to clear the way for the consideration of the substantial issues, we also put aside the suggestion made in argument, that, as the Southern Railway, by its change of schedule, originally rendered the connection at Selma impossible, therefore that road should have been compelled to restore the connection by a modification of the schedule or schedules of the trains by it operated. We put this suggestion aside because it does not seem to have been seriously urged in the court below, and besides is so directly refuted by the findings that we think it requires no further notice.\n\n 2. \nThe order was arbitrary and unreasonable, because, when properly considered, it imposed upon the Coast Line a duty foreign to its obligation to furnish adequate facilities for those traveling upon its road.\n This rests upon the assumption that, as the order was based not upon the neglect of the Coast Line to afford facilities for travel over its own road, but because of the failure to furnish facilities to those traveling on the Coast Line who desired also to connect with and travel on the Southern road, therefore the order was in no just sense a regulation of the business \n\n[206 U.S. 1, 22]\n\u00a0\n of the Coast Line. This reduces itself to the contention that, although the governmental power to regulate exists in the interest of the public, yet it does not extend to securing to the public reasonable facilities for making connection between different carriers. But the proposition destroys itself, since at one and the same time it admits the plenary power to regulate, and yet virtually denies the efficiency of that authority. That power, as we have seen, takes its origin from the quasi public nature of the business in which the carrier is engaged, and embraces that business in its entirety; which, of course, includes the duty to require carriers to make reasonable connections with other roads, so as to promote the convenience of the traveling public. In considering the facts found below as to the connection in question, that is, the population contained in the large territory whose convenience was subserved by the connection, and the admission of the railroad as to the importance of the connection, we conclude that the order in question, considered from the point of view of the requirements of the public interest, was one coming clearly within the scope of the power to enforce just and reasonable regulations.\n\n 3. \nThat the facilities afforded the public by the railroad were of such a character as to demonstrate that the extra burden which would result from the compliance with the order was wholly arbitrary and unreasonable.\n This rests upon the assumption that as there were several existing daily connections between trains of the Coast Line and those of the Southern at Selma, which might be availed of by those desiring to travel from eastern to western North Carolina and beyond, and as, besides, the proof established that another connection operating the same result was afforded by way of Weldon and the Seaboard Air Line to Raleigh and thence further west, therefore it was both arbitrary and unreasonable to superadd an unnecessary connection. Conceding, as must be done, that the nature and extent of the existing facilities furnished by a carrier for the public convenience are \n\n[206 U.S. 1, 23]\n\u00a0\n essential to be considered in determining whether an order directing an increase of such facilities is just and reasonable, and that the deficiency of facilities must clearly appear to justify an order directing the furnishing of new and additional facilities, we think the proposition here relied on to be without merit. Its error arises from assuming that adequate facilities were afforded at Selma or via Weldon and the Seaboard without reference to the order complained of. In view of the facts as to the connections at Selma and the Weldon route, found by the commission and reiterated by the court, which we have previously stated, and which we accept, we cannot escape drawing for ourselves the conclusion deduced both by the commission and the court below that the connections relied on were wholly inadequate for the public convenience, and, therefore, a state of things existed justifying the order.\n\n 4. \nThat, however otherwise just and reasonable the order may have been, it is inherently unjust and unreasonable because of the nature of the burden which it necessarily imposes.\n This proposition is based on the hypothesis that the order, by necessary intendment, directed the Coast Line to operate an additional train, although such train could not be operated without a daily pecuniary loss. The premise upon which this proposition rests would seem to be irrelevant, since the court below, in one aspect of its opinion, treated the order of the commission as not requiring the operation of an extra train from Rocky Mount to Selma. Yet, as the facts found by the commission and which were affirmed by the court would indicate that it was considered that the operation of such train was the most direct and efficient means for making the ordered connection, and as the court considered and passed upon the duty of the railroad to comply with the order, even if to do so it became necessary to operate the extra train at a loss, we think the proposition relied upon is open and must be decided. The contention is that the fact that some loss would result from the requirement that the extra train be operated, in and of itself, conclusively establishes the unrea- \n\n[206 U.S. 1, 24]\n\u00a0\n sonableness of the order, and demonstrates that to give it effect would constitute a taking of property without due process of law, in violation of the 14th Amendment. Conclusive support for this contention, it is insisted, is afforded by the doctrine upheld in Smyth v. Ames, \n169 U.S. 466\n, 42 L. ed 819, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 418, and the cases which preceded that decision. The cases relied upon, however, only involved whether a general scheme of maximum rates imposed by state authority prevented the railroads from earning a reasonable compensation, taking into view all proper considerations as to the value of the property and the cost of operation, and, if so, whether the enforcement of rates so unreasonably low would be unjust and unreasonable, and, therefore, be confiscation,-that is, a taking of property without due process of law, in violation of the Constitution of the United States. The principle upon which the cases in question proceeded was thus summed up by Mr. Justice Harlan, delivering the opinion of the court in Smyth v. Ames, \n169 U.S. 526\n, 42 L. ed. 842, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 426:\n'A state enactment, or regulations made under the authority of a state enactment, establishing rates for the transportation of persons or property by railroad that will not admit of the carrier earning such compensation as, under all the circumstances, is just to it and to the public, would deprive such carrier of its property without due process of law, and deny to it the equal protection of the laws, and would, therefore, be repugnant to the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.'\n\n But this case does not involve the enforcement by a state of a general scheme of maximum rates, but only whether an exercise of state authority to compel a carrier to perform a particular and specified duty is so inherently unjust and unreasonable as to amount to the deprivation of property without due process of law or a denial of the equal protection of the laws. In a case involving the validity of an order enforcing a scheme of maximum rates, of course the finding that the enforcement of such scheme will not produce an adequate return for the operation of the railroad, in and of itself dem- \n\n[206 U.S. 1, 25]\n\u00a0\n onstrates the unreasonableness of the order. Such, however, is not the case when the question is as to the validity of an order to do a particular act, the doing of which does not involve the question of the profitableness of the operation of the railroad as an entirety. The difference between the two cases is illustrated in St. Louis & S. F. R. Co. v. Gill, \n156 U.S. 649\n, 39 L. ed. 567, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 484, and Minneapolis & St. L. R. Co. v. Minnesota, \n186 U.S. 257\n, 46 L. ed. 1151, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 900. But even if the rule applicable to an entire rate scheme were to be here applied, as the findings made below as to the net earnings constrain us to conclude that adequate remuneration would result from the general operation of the rates in force, even allowing for any loss occasioned by the running of the extra train in question, it follows that the order would not be unreasonable, even if tested by the doctrine announced in Smyth v. Ames and kindred cases.\n It is insisted that, although the case be not controlled by the doctrine of Smyth v. Ames, nevertheless the arbitrary and unreasonable character of the order results from the fact that to execute it would require the operation of a train at a loss, even if the result of the loss so occasioned would not have the effect of reducing the aggregate net earnings below a reasonable profit. The power to fix rates, it is urged, in the nature of things, is restricted to providing for a reasonable and just rate, and not to compelling the performance of a service for such a rate as would mean the sustaining of an actual loss in doing a particular service. To hold to the contrary, it is argued, would be to admit that a regulation might extend to directing the rendering of a service gratuitously or the performance of first one service and then another and still another, at a loss, which could be continued in favor of selected interests until the point was reached where, by compliance with the last of such multiplied orders, the sum total of the revenues of a railroad would be reduced below the point of producing a reasonable and adequate return. But these extreme suggestions have no relation to the case in hand. Let it be conceded that if a scheme of maximum rates was imposed by state authority, \n\n[206 U.S. 1, 26]\n\u00a0\n as a whole adequately remunerative, and yet that some of such rates were so unequal as to exceed the flexible limit of judgment which belongs to the power to fix rates, that is, transcended the limits of just classification, and amounted to the creation of favored class or classes whom the carrier was compelled to serve at a loss, to the detriment of other class or classes upon whom the burden of such loss would fall, that such legislation would be so inherently unreasonable as to constitute a violation of the due process and equal protection clauses of the 14th Amendment. Let it also be conceded that a like repugnancy to the Constitution of the United States would arise from an order made in the exercise of the power to fix a rate when the result of the enforcement of such order would be to compel a carrier to serve, for a wholly inadequate compensation, a class or classes selected for legislative favor, even if, considering rates as a whole, a reasonable return from the operation of its road might be received by the carrier. Neither of these concessions, however, can control the case in hand, since it does not directly involve any question whatever of the power to fix rates and the constitutional limitations controlling the exercise of that power, but is concerned solely with an order directing a carrier to furnish a facility which it is a part of its general duty to furnish for the public convenience. The distinction between an order relating to such a subject and an order fixing rates coming within either of the hypotheses which we have stated is apparent. This is so because, as the primal duty of a carrier is to furnish adequate facilities to the public, that duty may well be compelled, although, by doing so, as an incident some pecuniary loss from rendering such service may result. It follows, therefore, that the mere incurring of a loss from the performance of such a duty does not, in and of itself, necessarily give rise to the conclusion of unreasonableness, as would be the case where the whole scheme of rates was unreasonable, under the doctrine of Smyth v. Ames, or under the concessions made in the two propositions we have stated. Of course, the fact that the furnishing of a necessary \n\n[206 U.S. 1, 27]\n\u00a0\n facility ordered may occasion an incidental pecuniary loss is an important criteria to be taken into view in determining the reasonableness of the order, but it is not the only one. As the duty to furnish necessary facilities is coterminous with the powers of the corporation, the obligation to discharge that duty must be considered in connection with the nature and productiveness of the corporate business as a whole, the character of the services required, and the public need for its performance. A similar contention to the one we are considering was adversely passed upon in Wisconsin, M. & P. R. Co. v. Jacobson, \n179 U.S. 287\n, 45 L. ed. 194, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 115. That case involved the enforcement of an order of a state railroad commission directing a railroad company to acquire the necessary land and make a track connection for the purpose of affording facilities for the interchange of business with another road. The court, after holding that the order was not so unjust and unreasonable as to be repugnant to the Constitution of the United States, disposed of the contention that the order was void because compliance with it would necessitate the incurring of expense, by saying ( \n179 U.S. 302\n, 45 L. ed. 201, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 120):\n'Although to carry out the judgment may require the exercise by the plaintiff in error of the power of eminent domain, and will also result in some, comparatively speaking, small expense, yet neither fact furnishes an answer to the application of defendant in error.

WHARTON(1907)\nNo. 36\nArgued: November 5, 1907Decided: December 9, 1907\n\n\n\n The railroad company, plaintiff in error, brings the case here to review a judgment of the supreme court of the state of \n\n[207 U.S. 328, 329]\n\u00a0\n South Carolina, which granted a mandamus to compel the company to stop certain of its through trains running between Jersey City, New Jersey, and Tampa, Florida, at a station on its road called Latta, in the state of South Carolina, near the boundary line between that state and the state of North Carolina.\n Upon a request filed with him by the railroad commission of South Carolina, the attorney general of that state commenced these proceedings by filing a petition to obtain a mandamus directed to the company, compelling it to stop trains 32 and 35 at the station mentioned, pursuant to an order made by the railroad commission, after a hearing had been had before it.\n The company demurred to the petition, the demurrer was overruled, and the company given leave to answer, which it did, setting up several defenses, among others averring that sufficient accommodations were already furnished to the citizens of Latta, and those residing along the Latta Branch Railroad; that the trains mentioned, 32 and 35, were interstate commerce trains, running between New York and Tampa, Florida, and intermediate cities, and the southbound trains were compelled to run at a high rate of speed in order to make connections with the steamers to Havana from Tampa, and so as to make the through trip as fast as possible; that the northbound trains were companion or return trains, making an equally fast schedule time; that to stop them at stations like Latta would result in rendering it impossible for them to make schedule time and they would have to be abandoned as through fast trains; that they carried the United States mail and their trains were made up very largely of through passengers; that there were two competitors for this through travel, and that it would be impossible to keep up the trains in competition with these other railroads if stops were to be made other than those absolutely necessary. The answer also averred that in addition to a number of passenger trains of local character daily, there was also furnished the citizens of Latta the con- \n\n[207 U.S. 328, 330]\n\u00a0\n venience of a daily passenger train each way for through travel north and south other than trains 32 and 35, and it was averred that the order of the railroad commission of South Carolina was unreasonable and unnecessary, a direct burden upon interstate commerce, and therefore a violation of and in conflict with  8 of article 1 of the Constitution of the United States, giving Congress the power to regulate commerce.\n On the coming in of this answer an order was made referring all issues involved to a referee to take testimony thereon and report back as soon as convenient. Pursuant to such order evidence was taken before a referee and report made thereon to the supreme court, which decided that sufficient accommodations were not furnished to the citizens of Latta and along the Latta Branch Railroad by the plaintiff in error at its station in Latta; and the court thereupon made an order that the passenger trains 32 and 35 should stop when flagged at the Latta station, for the purpose of receiving and delivering passengers at that station, 'with the alternative right on your part to provide facilities substantially the same as those which would be afforded the citizens of Latta by stopping trains Nos. 32 and 35 on flag.'\n The testimony upon which this order was made is in the record and is substantially uncontradicted. It appears from that testimony that Latta is a small station in the state of South Carolina, near the northern boundary of the state, and on the road of the plaintiff in error, having a population, according to the last United States census, of 453. Clio is another small settlement in the same state, about 20 miles northwest of Latta, on what is termed the Latta Branch Railroad, having a population of 508, by the same census. Dunbar is a station between Latta and Clio, with a population, according to the same census, of 115. The country back of these stations is said to be a somewhat thickly-settled agricultural country. It is also said by witnesses for Latta that these places have increased somewhat in population since the last census.\n In addition to several local trains passing through Latta \n\n[207 U.S. 328, 331]\n\u00a0\n for stations along this road, or to and from Clio, there was one daily through train each way (Nos. 39 and 40), stopping at this station, and which carried passengers through to New York or Florida and intermediate stations, and they were equipped with first and second-class cars, through Pullman sleepers, mail, express, and baggage cars. The only objection to them was their want of speed; that they stopped so frequently they did not arrive at their destination as swiftly as trains 32 and 35. In addition trains 32 and 35 could be boarded at Florence, a station on the same road, distant about 15 or 20 miles south from Latta, or at Dillon, a station about 7 miles from Latta. The objection made by the people of Latta to this mode of getting these trains was, that if they were going north they rode south from Latta to Florence, and then boarded the train and went directly back over the same road from Florence to Latta, which they would not have to do if the train stopped at Latta. It also involved an additional cost of $1.42 above the price of a ticket from Latta to New York. If they preferred to take the train northbound at Dillon instead of Florence, then they had to drive from Latta to Dillon over what was described by a witness to be in winter 'one of the worst roads that ever was made a road.' It was also averred that, by stopping the southbound train (No. 35) at Latta, it could be there taken at 3 o'clock in the morning instead of going to Florence the night before and taking the train there at 4 o'clock A. M. the next day, and a close connection could also be made at Florence with Columbia (on a branch road) by taking train 35 at Latta at 3 A. M., so that a citizen could go to Columbia and return to Latta the same day, thus saving a hotel bill, which now had to be paid, as connections were so made that the journey could not be accomplished in one day. The people at Clio and the other stations on the Latta Branch Railroad were accommodated so that they could ride to Latta in time to have substantially the same conveniences in getting away from that station that the people living there had. The distance from Jersey City to Tampa is about 1,200 miles, and the trains \n\n[207 U.S. 328, 332]\n\u00a0\n 32 and 35 are among the fastest and longest continuous trains in the whole country, exceeding the distance from New York to Chicago. These trains rank with the very best trains run anywhere. They are placed on the road for the convenience of through travel, and could not be profitably run if they were slower trains.\n Messrs. P. A. Willcox, Frederic D. McKenney, Alexander Hamilton, George B. Elliott, F. L. Willcox, and Henry E. Davis for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[207 U.S. 328, 333]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. M. C. Woods and J. Fraser Lyon for defendants in error.\n\n\n\n[207 U.S. 328, 334]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The questions of the validity of state statutes and orders of state railroad commissions, directing the stoppage of through interstate trains, have frequently, within late years, been before this court. The last case is that of Mississippi R. Commission v. Illinois C. R. Co. \n203 U.S. 335\n, 51 L. ed. 209, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 90, where the prior cases are referred to. See also Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. North Carolina Corp. Commission, \n206 U.S. 1\n, 51 L. ed. 933, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 585.\n That any exercise of state authority, in whatever form manifested, which directly regulates interstate commerce, is repugnant to the commerce clause of the Constitution, is obvious. It hence arises that any command of a state, whether made directly or through the instrumentality of a railroad commission, which orders, or the necessary effect of which is to order, the stopping of an interstate train at a named station or stations, if it directly regulates interstate commerce, is void.\n It has been decided, however, that some orders which may cause the stoppage of interstate trains made by state authority may be valid if they do not directly regulate such commerce. Lake Shore & M. S. R. Co. v. Ohio, \n173 U.S. 285\n, 43 L. ed. 702, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 465. When, therefore, an order made under state authority to stop an interstate train is assailed because of its repugnancy to the interstate commerce clause, the question whether such order is void as a direct regulation of such commerce may be tested by considering the nature of the order, the character of the interstate commerce train to which it applies, and its necessary and direct effect upon the operation of such train. But the effect of the order as a direct regulation of interstate commerce may also be tested by considering the adequacy of the local facilities existing at the station or stations at which the interstate commerce train has been commanded to stop. True, inherently considered, whether there be adequate local facilities is not a Federal question, but in so far as the existence of such adequate local facilities is involved in the determination of the Federal \n\n[207 U.S. 328, 335]\n\u00a0\n question of whether the order concerning an interstate train does or does not directly regulate interstate commerce, that question for such purpose is open and may be considered by us. 203 U. S. supra.\n Without stopping to consider whether, in view of the character of the trains to which the order before us related, it would not result that the order complained of was a direct regulation of interstate commerce, and testing the subject by the local facilities at the station at which the trains were ordered to stop, we think the railroad company in this case has furnished such reasonable accommodations to the people at Latta as it can be fairly and properly called upon to give, and the order to stop these trains is, therefore, not a valid one.\n The term 'adequate or reasonable facilities' is not in its nature capable of exact definition. It is a relative expression, and has to be considered as calling for such facilities as might be fairly demanded, regard being had, among other things, to the size of the place, the extent of the demand for transportation, the cost of furnishing the additional accommodations asked for, and to all other facts which would have a bearing upon the question of convenience and cost. In this case the company furnishes eleven different trains a day by which the people of Latta can leave that place, and among them are the daily through trains 39 and 40, for the South and North, respectively. That the inhabitants of a place demand greater facilities than they have is not at all conclusive as to the reasonableness of their demand for something more. Fault is found here with the character of some of the local trains, in that the appointments thereof are not up to a sufficiently high standard. It is true that, included in these eleven trains, were some which were a combination of freight and passenger, and others which only ran between Latta and Clio, and those are described as dirty and without proper closets and drinking tanks. These deficiencies are remediable by other means than the stoppage of the two trains in question. It is to be remembered that these two places, Latta and Clio, had together a population, by the \n\n[207 U.S. 328, 336]\n\u00a0\n last census, of about a thousand. Two ordinary modern trains of the usual passenger coaches would comfortably transport the total population of these places. The number of people who are inconvenienced by the nonstoppage of these trains is, of course, comparatively quite small. One witness, who was in the hotel and general merchandise business at Latta, said that he sent a man or two every week to meet the fast train at Dillon, because they could not take it at Latta. Other witnesses said that the demand for those particular trains, 32 and 35, was quite frequent, as many as four people a week, while others said that the inconvenience of the through trains, 39 and 40, was on account of their not being fast trains, and hence were not so pleasant as the others, 32 and 35, and did not get them in to their destination as early as the latter trains did. The demand at Latta by people desiring to go to the termination of the road, either at New York or Tampa, would naturally be small. Some of the plaintiff's witnesses said that the demand for transportation at Latta was large, or quite large, and the inconvenience great; but a further examination of these witnesses showed that in specific details there was much lacking, and instances of inconvenience were really somewhat limited. But assuming that the number actually inconvenienced by the want of fast trains was ' quite large,' as said by some witnesses, it is perfectly evident the number would be small compared with the inconvenience of the much larger number of through passengers resulting from the stoppage of these trains at Latta and other similar stations in the state.\n To stop these trains at Latta, and other stations like it, which could bring equally strong reasons for the stoppage of the trains at their stations, would wholly change the character of the trains, rendering them no better in regard to speed than the other trains, 39 and 40, and would result in the inability of what had been fast trains to make their schedule time, and a consequent loss of patronage, also the loss of compensation for carrying the mails, which would be withdrawn from them, and the end would be the withdrawal of the trains, because of \n\n[207 U.S. 328, 337]\n\u00a0\n their inability to pay expenses. All these are matters entitled to consideration when the question of convenience and adequate facilities arises. There is no contradiction in the testimony that the company desires, so far as is fairly possible, to pay as much attention to the local demands as to the 'through' claims.\n Of course, it is not reasonable to suppose that the same facilities can be given to places of very small population that are supplied to their neighbors who live in much larger communities, and the defendants in error, it may be conceded, make no such demand. No one would assert that one daily train each way between New York and Philadelphia would furnish adequate facilities for the transportation of passengers. Twenty times that number of trains would be necessary, and yet one through train a day, each way, through so small a place as Latta to New York or Tampa would, in all probability, easily transport all the passengers desiring transportation between these places. Nevertheless, the fair needs of the locality for transportation, to other local points must be considered and provided for. This, as we think, has been done.\n Taking all the circumstances into consideration, as shown by uncontradicted evidence, we are of opinion that the judgment of the Supreme Court, directing a mandamus, was erroneous, and it is therefore reversed, and the case remanded to the Supreme Court of South Carolina for further proceedings therein not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","12":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBACHTEL v. WILSON(1907)\nNo. 446\nArgued: Decided: January 7, 1907\n\n\n\n The sole question in this case, as stated by counsel for plaintiff in error, is whether the following section of the statutes of Ohio contravenes  1 of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States:\n'Every president, director, cashier, teller, clerk, or agent of any banking company who shall embezzle, abstract, or wilfully misapply any of the moneys, funds, or credits of such company, or shall, without authority from the directors, issue or put forth any certificate of deposit, draw any order or bill of exchange, make any acceptance, assign any notes, bonds, drafts, or bills of exchange, mortgage, judgment, or decree, or shall make any false entry in any book, report, or statement of the company, with intent in either case to injure or defraud the company, or any other company, body politic or corporate, or any individual person, or to deceive any officer of the company, or any agent appointed to inspect the affairs of any banking company in this state, shall be guilty of an offense, and, upon conviction thereof, shall be confined in the peni- \n\n[204 U.S. 36, 37]\n\u00a0\n tentiary, at hard labor, not less than one year nor more than ten years.'

(Ohio) 6th ed.  3821-3885.\n\n Plaintiff in error, who was cashier of the Canton State Bank, a bank incorporated under the above 'free banking' act, was indicted in the court of common pleas of Stark county for a violation of this section. A demurrer to the indictment having been overruled, he, before arraignment, sued out a writ of habeas corpus in the circuit court of that county. Thereafter, the final judgment of the supreme court of the state in that proceeding having been adverse, he brought the case here on this writ of error.\n Mr. William A. Lynch for plaintiff in error. \n\n[204 U.S. 36, 38]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles C. Upham and John W. Craine for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Brewer:\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n Counsel predicate the unconstitutionality of this statute, not on its provisions standing by themselves, but on its relation to other statutes.\n On February 26, 1873 (70 Ohio Laws, 40), an act was passed in terms incorporating savings and loan associations, but with powers such as in fact authorized the carrying on of ordinary commercial banking. Under this statute a few institutions were organized. In 1880 a general incorporation law was enacted (Rev. Stat. Ohio 1880,  3235 and following), and under it many banks were formed. In addition the banking statistics of the state show that there are several banks owned by unincorporated stockholders, copartnerships, or individuals. Now, in no statute, save the free banking act, is there any \n\n[204 U.S. 36, 39]\n\u00a0\n section with provisions kindred to those in  30, above quoted, and the contention is that the plaintiff in error was denied the 'equal protection of the laws' guaranteed by the 14th Amendment, in that he was subject to prosecution and punishment for matters and things which, if done by a cashier of any similar institution, whether unincorporated or incorporated under the statutes of Ohio other than the free banking act, would not subject him to punishment. The cashiers of such other institutions are charged with duties substantially the same as those of this plaintiff in error, and yet the one may be punished for a violation of those duties and the others not. Can the state single out a few men and punish them for acts, when for like acts others are free from liability?\n No opinion was filed by the supreme court of the state, and we, therefore, are not advised of the grounds upon which that court held  30 valid; yet that court did hold it valid, and in the face of the same objections that are made to it here. If 'any banking company,' as found in the free banking act, is applicable to every banking institution, no matter under what statute organized, there is no violation of the equal protection of the laws. Counsel for plaintiff in error contend that the supreme court could not have given so broad a meaning to those words, because they are in a section treating of crimes, and the rule of strict construction, which is universal in respect to criminal statutes, forbids its extension to institutions other than those incorporated under the act of which it is a part; because the title of the original act, 'An Act to Authorize Free Banking,' limits the scope of the statute, and therefore the applicability of every section therein; and, further, that, as the free banking act, as originally passed, was only to be in force until the year 1872, it is improbable that a criminal provision of general application should be inserted in an act so limited in the matter of time. On the other hand, it is contended by the defendant in error that the words in  30, 'any banking company,' em- \n\n[204 U.S. 36, 40]\n\u00a0\n brace all banking institutions in the state of Ohio, whether incorporated under the free banking act or not, and this because the words themselves are broad and comprehensive, because there is no other provision in the statutes for punishing those who commit the offenses named in said section, and it cannot be supposed that the legislature intended that other like officials should be immune from punishment, and also because  30, both in the original act and also in the Revised Statutes, has no apparent connection with, in no way modifies or affects, any other sections, and might as well have been placed in the criminal code or by itself in the statutes.\n But we are not called upon to decide which is the correct interpretation. The supreme court of a state is the ultimate tribunal to determine the meaning of its local statutes. We are not to assume that that which seems more reasonable to us also seemed more reasonable to and was adopted by it. Before we can pronounce its judgment in conflict with the Federal Constitution it must be made to appear that its decision was one necessarily in conflict therewith, and not that possibly, or even probably, it was. It surely is not unworthy of consideration that the legislature, having before it the question of punishment for offenses committed by banking officers, having made provision therefor by one section in which it used the term 'any banking company,' may have believed that thereby it had included in its punitive provisions all banking institutions, and that a repetition of that section in other statutes was unnecessary. We do not decide that this was so, but we do hold that, in view of the silence of the supreme court, we are not justified in assuming that it held that it was not so.\n Further, if we assume that the supreme court was of the opinion that  30 was limited in its applicability to institutions incorporated under the free banking act, a question will then be whether the selection of officers of those institutions and subjecting them to punishment, when the officers of all other banking institutions, guilty of similar offenses, are \n\n[204 U.S. 36, 41]\n\u00a0\n not so subject, is a denial of the equal protection of the laws. The power of a state legislature to select certain individuals for the operation of a statute is not an arbitrary power, one that it can exercise without regard to any principle of classification. And yet there is a power of selection. The 14th Amendment was not designed to prevent all exercise of judgment by a state legislature of what the interests of the state require, and to compel it to run all its laws in the channels of general legislation. It may deem that social and business conditions, without penal legislation, afford ample protection to the public against wrongdoing by certain officials, while such legislation may be deemed necessary for like protection against wrongdoing by other officials charged with substantially similar duties. The duties of a county or city treasurer may be very like those of the treasurer of a charitable or business corporation, and yet if the legislature prescribed penalties for misconduct of the former, and none for similar misconduct of the latter, it would be giving the Amendment extreme force to make it efficient to overthrow the statute and thus relieve all treasurers from punishment. In short, the selection, in order to become obnoxious to the 14th Amendment, must be arbitrary and unreasonable; not merely possibly, but clearly and actually so. Carroll v. Greenwich Ins. Co. \n199 \nU.S. 401, 411\n, 50 S. L. ed. 246, 250, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 66. Would the singling out for punishment of the officers of the free banks be an arbitrary selection? The free banks, though they may be like other banking institutions, are not in all respects the same.\n But here, too, we are not called upon for an absolute decision, nor do we deem it necessary to determine whether there be such differences as will sustain the imposition of punishment of their officers, when none is cast upon the like officers of other banks. We only refer to these matters to indicate that there were at least two questions before the supreme court involving the validity of  30, one of which, at least, presents no matter of a Federal nature, and in respect to each of which something may be said one way \n\n[204 U.S. 36, 42]\n\u00a0\n and the other, and until it is shown what the supreme court did, in fact, decide, it is impossible to hold that the section, as construed by it, is in conflict with the Federal Constitution.\n Under those circumstances it is clear that we have no jurisdiction ( Johnson v. Risk, \n137 U.S. 300\n, 34 L. ed. 683, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 111, and cases cited in opinion), and the writ of error is dismissed. \n\n\n\n","13":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBACHTEL v.

Rice for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[204 U.S. 311, 313]\n\u00a0\n No counsel for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n This action involves the validity, under the Constitution \n\n[204 U.S. 311, 314]\n\u00a0\n of the United States, of the following sections of the Revised Statutes of the state of Idaho:\n'Sec. 1210. It is not lawful for any person owning or having charge of sheep to herd the same, or permit them to be herded, on the land or possessory claims of other persons, or to herd the same or permit them to graze within 2 miles of the dwelling house of the owner or owners of said possessory claim.\n\n'Sec. 1211. The owner or the agents of such owner of sheep violating the provisions of the last section, on complaint of the party or parties injured, before any justice of the peace for the precinct where either of the interested parties may reside, is liable to the party injured for all damages sustained; and, if the trespass be repeated, is liable to the party injured for the second and every subsequent offense in double the amount of damages sustained.'\n\n Defendants in error, under the provisions of those sections, brought this action in the justice's court of Little Camas precinct, Elmore county, state of Idaho, for the recovery of $100 damages, alleged to have accrued to them by the violation by plaintiff in error of the statutes, and obtained judgment for that sum. The judgment was successively affirmed by the district court for the county of Elmore, and the supreme court of the state. 81 Pac. 155. The case was then brought here.\n It was alleged in the complaint of defendants in error, who were plaintiffs in the trial court, that plaintiff in error caused his sheep, about three thousand in number, to be herded upon the public lands within 2 miles of the dwelling house of defendants in error. The answer set up that the complaint did 'not state a cause of action other than the violation of  1210 and 1211 of the Revised Statutes of the state of Idaho,' and that said sections were in violation of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. The specifications of the grounds of the unconstitutionality of those sections were, in the courts below, and are, \n\n[204 U.S. 311, 315]\n\u00a0\n in this court, (1) that plaintiff in error has an equal right to pasture with other citizens upon the public domain, and that, by imposing damages on him for exercising that right, he is deprived of his property without due process of law; (2) that a discrimination is arbitrarily and unlawfully made by the statutes between citizens engaged in sheep grazing on the public domain and citizens engaged in grazing other classes of stock.\n These grounds do not entirely depend upon the same considerations. The first denies to the state any power to limit or regulate the right of pasture asserted to exist; the other concedes such power, and attacks it only as it discriminates against the grazers of sheep. We speak only of the right to pasture, because plaintiff in error does not show that he is the owner of the land upon which his sheep grazed, and what rights owners of land may have to attack the statute we put out of consideration. New York ex rel. Hatch v. Reardon, \n204 U.S. 152\n, 51 L. ed. 415, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 188. But we may remark that the supreme court of Idaho said in Sweet v. Ballentyne, 8 Idaho, 431, 440, 69 Pac. 995: 'These statutes [ 1210, 1211, quoted above] were not intended to prevent owners from grazing sheep upon their own lands, although situated within 2 miles of the dwelling of another.' Is it true, therefore, even if it be conceded that there is right or license to pasture upon the public domain, that the state may not limit or regulate the right or license? Defendants in error have an equal right with plaintiff in error, and the state has an interest in the accommodation of those rights. It may even have an interest above such accommodation. The laws and policy of a state may be framed and shaped to suit its conditions of climate and soil. Illustrations of this power are afforded by recent decisions of this court. In Clark v. Nash, \n198 U.S. 361\n, 49 L. ed. 1085, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 676, a use of property was declared to be public which, independent of the conditions existing in the state, might otherwise have been considered as private. So also in Strickley v. Highland Boy Gold Min. Co. \n200 U.S. 527\n, 50 L. ed. 581, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 301. In the first case there was a recognition of the power of the state to deal with and accommodate its laws to the \n\n[204 U.S. 311, 316]\n\u00a0\n conditions of an arid country and the necessity of irrigation to its development. The second was the recognition of the power of the state to work out from the conditions existing in a mining region the largest welfare of its inhabitants. And again, in Offield v. New York, N. H. & H. R. CO. \n203 U.S. 372\n, 51 L. ed. 231, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 72, the principle of those cases was affirmed and applied to conditions entirely dissimilar, and it was declared that it was competent for a state to provide for the compulsory transfer of shares of stock in a corporation, the ownership of which stood in the way of the increase of means of transportation, and the public benefit which would result from that. Of pertinent significance is the case of Ohio Oil Co. v. Indiana, \n177 U.S. 190\n, 44 L. ed. 729, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 576. There a statute of the state of Indiana was attacked, which regulated the sinking, maintenance, use, and operation of natural gas and oil wells. The object of the statute was to prevent the waste of gas. The defendants in the action asserted against the statute the ownership of the soil and the familiar principle that such ownership carried with it the right to the minerals beneath and the consequent privilege of mining to extract them. The principle was conceded, but it was declared inapplicable, as ignoring the peculiar character of the substances-oil and gas-with which the statute was concerned. It was pointed out that those substances, though situated beneath the surface, had no fixed situs, but had the power of self-transmission. No one owner, it was therefore said, could exercise his right to extract from the common reservoir, in which the supply was held without, to an extent, diminishing the source of supply to which all the other owners of the surface had to exercise their rights. The waste of one owner, it was further said, caused by a reckless enjoyment of his right, operated upon the other surface owners. The statute was sustained as a constitutional exercise of the power of the state, on account of the peculiar nature of the right and the objects upon which it was exerted, for the purpose of protecting all of the collective owners. \n\n[204 U.S. 311, 317]\n\u00a0\n These cases make it unnecessary to consider the argument of counsel based upon what they deem to be the limits of the police power of a state, and their contention that the statute of Idaho transcends those limits. It is enough to say that they have fallen into the error exposed in Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Illinois, \n200 \nU.S. 561, 592\n, 50 S. L. ed. 596, 609, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 341. In that case we rejected the view that the police power cannot be exercised for the general well-being of the community. That power, we said, embraces regulations designed to promote the public convenience or the general prosperity, as well as regulations designed to promote the public health, the public morals, or the public safety. We do not enter, therefore, into the discussion whether the sheep industry is legitimate, and not offensive. Nor need we make extended comment on the 2- mile limit. The selection of some limit is a legislative power, and it is only against the abuse of the power, if at all, that the courts may interpose. But the abuse must be shown. It is not shown by quoting the provision which expresses the limit. The mere distance expressed shows nothing. It does not display the necessities of a settler upon the public lands. It does not display what protection is needed, not from one sheep or a few sheep, but from large flocks of sheep, or the relation of the sheep industry to other industries. These may be the considerations that induced the statutes, and we cannot pronounce them insufficient on surmise or on the barren letter of the statute. We may refer to Sifers v. Johnson, 7 Idaho, 798, 54 L.R.A. 785, 97 Am. St. Rep. 271, 65 Pac. 709, and Sweet v. Ballentyne, 8 Idaho, 431, 69 Pac. 995, for a statement of the practical problem which confronted the legislature and upon what considerations it was solved. We think, therefore, that the statutes of Idaho are not open to the objection that they take the property of plaintiff in error without due process of law, and pass to the consideration of the charge that they make an unconstitutional discrimination against the sheep industry.\n Counsel extend to this contention the conception of the police power which we have just declared to be erroneous, and \n\n[204 U.S. 311, 318]\n\u00a0\n enumerating the classes discriminated in favor of as cattle, horses, hogs, and even poultry, puts to question whether, in herding or grazing sheep, 'there is more danger to the public 'health, comfort, security, order, or morality,' than the classes of animals and fowls above enumerated.' 'What,' counsel asks, 'are the dangers to the public growing out of this industry that do not apply with equal force to the others? Does the herding or grazing of sheep necessarily, and because of its unwarrantable character, work an injury to the public? And, if dangerous in any degree whatever, are the other classes which are omitted and in effect excepted entirely free from such danger, or do such exceptions tend to reduce the general danger\" Contemplating the law in the aspect expressed in these questions, counsel are unable to see in it anything but unreasonable and arbitrary discrimination. This view of the power of the state, however, is too narrow. That power is not confined, as we have said, to the suppression of what is offensive, disorderly, or unsanitary. It extends to so dealing with the conditions which exist in the state as to bring out of them the greatest welfare of its people. This is the principle of the cases which we have cited.\n But the statutes have justification on the grounds which plaintiff in error urges as determinative, and on those grounds they were sustained by the supreme court of the state. They were deliberate enactments, made necessary by and addressed to the conditions which existed. They first ( 1875) had application only to three counties, while Idaho was a territory. They were subsequently extended to two other counties, and were made general in 1887. They were continued in force by the state Constitution. Sweet v. Ballentyne, supra. The court said in the latter case:\n'It is a matter of public history in this state that conflicts between sheep owners and cattle men and settlers were of frequent occurrence, resulting in violent breaches of the peace. It is also a matter of public history of the state that sheep are not only able to hold their own on the public ranges with other \n\n[204 U.S. 311, 319]\n\u00a0\n live stock, but will in the end drive other stock off the range, and that the herding of sheep upon certain territory is an appropriation of it almost as fully as if it was actually inclosed by fences, and this is especially true with reference to cattle. The legislature did not deem it necessary to prohibit the running at large of sheep altogether, recognizing the fact that there are in the state large areas of land uninhabited, where sheep can range without interfering with the health or subsistence of settlers or interrupting the public peace. The fact was also recognized by the legislature that, in order to make the settlement of our small isolated valleys possible, it was necessary to provide some protection to the settler against the innumerable bands of sheep grazing in this state.'\n\n And the court pointed out that it was not the purpose or effect of the statutes to make discriminations between sheep owners and owners of other kinds of stock, but to secure equality of enjoyment and use of the public domain to settlers and cattle owners with sheep owners. To defeat the beneficent objects of the statutes, it was said, by holding their provisions unconstitutional, would make of the lands of the state 'one immense sheep pasture.' And further: 'The owners of sheep do not permit them to roam at will, but they are under the immediate control of herders, who have shepherd dogs with them, and wherever they graze they take full possession of the range as effectually as if the lands were fences. . . . It is a matter of common observation and experience that sheep eat the herbage closer to the ground than cattle or horses do, and, their hoofs being sharp, they devastate and kill the growing vegetation wherever they graze for any considerable time. In the language of one of the witnesses in this case: 'Just as soon as a band of sheep passes over, everything disappears, the same as if fire passing over it.' It is a part of the public history of this state that the industry of raising cattle has been largely destroyed by the encroachments of innumerable bands of sheep. Cattle will not graze, and will not thrive, upon lands where sheep are grazed to any great extent.' \n\n[204 U.S. 311, 320]\n\u00a0\n These remarks require no addition. They exhibit the conditions which existed in the state, the cause and purpose of the statutes which are assailed, and vindicate them from the accusation of being an arbitrary and unreasonable discrimination against the sheep industry.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice Brewer and Mr. Justice Peckham dissent. dissent. \n\n\n\n","15":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBALLARD v. HUNTER(1907)\nNo. 123\nArgued: Decided: January 21, 1907\n\n\n\n\n[204 U.S. 241, 242]\n\u00a0\n This writ of error is prosecuted to review a judgment of the supreme court of Arkansas, sustaining the validity of a sale of the lands of plaintiffs in error for levee taxes.\n The state of Arkansas, by an act of its legislature passed February 15, 1893, created eight counties, or portions of eight counties, which constituted what was known as 'St. Francis basin,' a levee district, for the purpose of constructing and maintaining levees against the waters of the Mississippi river, and incorporated a board of directors, giving it power to 'levee the St. Francis front in Arkansas and to protect and maintain the same.' The board was also authorized, for the purpose of building, repairing, and maintaining the levee, to assess and levy annually a tax on all lands within the district, not exceeding 5 per cent of the increased value or betterment estimated to accrue from the protection given by the levee against floods from the river. The act prescribed that the landowners should determine upon the assessments and levy of the tax in a meeting called for that purpose upon notice by the board, and prescribed the procedure to be observed in the assessment and levy of the tax, and provided that the lands assessed should be entered upon the books, in convenient subdivisions, as surveyed by the United States government, with appropriate columns showing the names and residences of owners of the lands, and mortgages of record, if any, known to the assessors; and that no error in the description of the lands should invalidate the assessments, if sufficient description was given to ascertain where the land was situated. The assessment was made a lien upon the lands in the nature of a mortgage. \n\n[204 U.S. 241, 243]\n\u00a0\n Section 11 of the act was amended in 1895: As amended, it provided that a tax collector should be elected by the board of directors and be furnished a list of assessments for his county; that he should proceed to collect the assessments, and that if the assessments were not paid within thirty days a penalty of 25 per cent should at once attach for such delinquency. The board of directors was required to enforce the collection of the taxes by chancery proceedings in a court of the county in which the lands were situated, having chancery jurisdiction, and it was provided that the court should give judgment against the persons claiming to be the owners of the lands, if known to the board, for the amount of such assessments, interest, penalties, and costs. It was further provided that, if the ownership of any of the delinquent lands should be unknown to the board, the lands might be proceeded against 'as being owned by unknown owners;' that the judgment should provide for sale of the delinquent land for cash by a commissioner of a court after advertisement, as hereafter set out; and, further, that the proceedings and judgment should be in the nature of proceedings in rem, and it should be immaterial if the ownership of the lands should be incorrectly alleged; that the judgment should be enforced only as against the land, and not against any other property. All lands for each of the counties might be included in one suit, and all delinquent owners, including those unknown, might be made defendants, notice of the pendency of the suit to be given as against nonresidents of the county and unknown owners respectively by publication weekly, for four weeks prior to the day of the term of court on which final judgment should be entered for the sale of the land, in some newspaper published in the county where the suit might be pending. The form of notice which might be given is inserted in the margin. \n\n[204 U.S. 241, 244]\n\u00a0\n It was provided that where the owners were unknown that fact should be stated in the published notice, and against any defendant who resided in the county, and whose ownership appeared on the records, notice should be given by the service of personal summons of the court at least twenty days before the day on which the defendant was required to answer, as set out in the summons. And the suit should stand for trial at the first term of the court after the complaint should be filed, if said four weeks in the case of a nonresident or unknown defendant, or twenty days in case of resident defendants, should expire before the first day of the term or during the term of the court to which the suit was brought, unless a continuance be granted for good cause shown, within the discretion of the court, and such continuance for good cause shown might be granted as to part of the land or defendants without affecting the duty of the court to dispose finally of the others as to whom no continuances might be granted. And it was further provided that actual service of summons should be had when the defendant was in the county, or when there was an occupant upon the land. In all cases where notice had been properly given and where no answer had been filed, and the cause decided for the plaintiff, the court, by its decree, should grant the relief as prayed in the complaint, and should require the commissioner to sell the lands at the \n\n[204 U.S. 241, 245]\n\u00a0\n court-house door, at public outcry, for cash, after first having advertised such sale weekly for two weeks consecutively, and convey to the purchasers the lands sold, the titles of which should thereupon vest in the purchaser against all persons whomsoever, saving rights to infants and insane persons. The act contained the following:\n'Provided, that at any time within three years after the rendition of the final decree of the chancery court herein provided for, the owner of the lands may file his petition in the court rendering the decree, alleging the payment of the taxes on said lands for the year for which they were sold, and, upon the establishment of that fact, the court shall vacate and shall set aside said decree.'\n\n Section 2 of the act of 1895, amending the act of 1893, provided as follows:\n'That  13 of said act be amended so as to read as follows: Said suit shall be conducted in accordance with the practice and proceedings of chancery courts in this state. except as herein otherwise provided, and except that neither attorneys nor guardians ad litem, nor any provision of  5877 of Sandels & Hill's Digest of the Statutes of Arkansas, shall be required, and except that said suits may be disposed of on oral testimony, as in ordinary suits at law; and this law shall be liberally construed to give said assessment lists the effect of bona fide mortgages, for a valuable consideration, and a first lien upon said land as against all persons having an interest therein; Provided, That no informality or irregularity in holding the meetings or in the description or valuation of the lands, or in the names of the owners or the number of acres therein, shall be a valid defense to such action.' [Ark. Acts 1895, pp. 91, 92.]\n\n Suit was brought as provided for in the acts, and, in the complaint, plaintiff in error A. B. Ballard was made a defendant and named as a nonresident of Crittenden county, Arkansas, Josephine W. Ballard was not made a defendant. In the list of lands attached to and made part of the complaint the following appears: \n\n[204 U.S. 241, 246]\n\u00a0\n Township 4 North, Range 7 East.\n West half southeast quarter, section 32, T. 4 N. R. 7 E. 480 acres, assessed to A. B. Ballard--\n Taxes for 1895, $19.20\n Taxes for 1896, 19.20\n Taxes for 1897, 19.20\n West half northeast quarter, section 32, T. 4 N. R. 7 E. 80 acres, assessed to A. B. Ballard--\n Taxes for 1895, $3.20\n Taxes for 1896, 3.20\n Taxes for 1897, 3.20\n Northeast quarter, section 31, T. 4 N. R. 7 E. 160 acres, assessed to A. B. Ballard--\n Taxes for 1895, $6.40\n Taxes for 1896, 6.40\n A decree in due course passed against defendants. It designated the defendants who were duly served with summons, as shown by the return of the sheriff, and made default, and the defendants who were, as the decree recites, 'severally constructively summoned by publication in the newspaper published in Crittenden county, Arkansas, weekly, for four weeks before this day, proof of which has been previously filed herein, and all of the before-named defendants . . . having failed to plead, answer, or demur to the complaint of the plaintiff, the court, on motion of the attorney for the plaintiff, awards a decree pro confesso as to them in favor of the plaintiff for the amount of taxes, interest, penalty, and costs due for their said lands.' The court also found and recited the steps preceding the assessment of the taxes, the assessment of the same, and that 'all of said taxes on said lands of said defendants are yet wholly unpaid and are delinquent.' A lien was declared, and it was considered and adjudged that plaintiff recover from the defendants severally, to be enforced wholly against said lands, the amount of taxes, interest, penalty, and costs assessed, levied, and extended against the lands belonging to each of said defendants, respectively, for \n\n[204 U.S. 241, 247]\n\u00a0\n the years 1893, 1894, 1895, 1896, and 1897. A list of the lands was given, in which were the lands assessed against A. B. Ballard (described in the opinion). The lands were decreed to be sold, and it was also decreed that there should be allowed to the commissioner fees as follows:\n'For furnishing printer with list of lands to be advertised, five cents per tract, and for attending and making and reporting sale, twenty- five (25) cents per tract; and there shall be allowed to the printer for publishing said notice fifty (50) cents per tract, which fee shall be taxed as costs against each several tract, to be paid by the purchaser or person discharging said lien before sale, and the said commissioner shall report his proceedings hereunder to the next term of this court.'\n\n In the report of the commissioner of his proceedings under the decree he showed that he sold the lands in section 31 to A. Hackler and the lands in section 32 to C. W. Hunter, hereafter described.\n The sale was approved and the deeds made were also approved.\n At September term of the court, 1899, the following order was entered:\n'A. B. Ballard and Mrs. Josephine W. Ballard come by their solicitors and on their motion leave is given them to file herein their answer, motion, petition, and bill of review herein, and be made parties to this suit with reference to the N. E. 1\/4 of section 31, the southwest 1\/4 of section 32, and the south 1\/2 of the northwest 1\/4 of section 32, all in township 4 north, range 7 east, and the said pleading is ordered to be filed and they are made defendants and parties to this suit for the purposes set out in said pleadings.\n\n'And thereupon the said C. W. Hunter, by L. P. Berry, Esq., his attorney, enters his appearance herein and has ninety days given him within which to plead, answer, or demur herein.'\n\n It does not appear that A. Hackler or the board of directors of the levee district ever entered their appearance or were made parties to the proceeding. \n\n[204 U.S. 241, 248]\n\u00a0\n In compliance with the order, plaintiffs in error filed what is called in the record 'Answer to Motion of Ballard.' It commences as follows: 'To the Hon. E. D. Robertson, Chancellor:\n'The answer and motion of A. B. Ballard, who is a citizen of the state of Florida, residing at Tampa, and Mrs. Josephine W. Ballard, who is a citizen of the state of Georgia, residing at Atlanta, also to be taken and considered as a petition, under  5839-5843, Sandels & Hill's Digest, and as an original complaint, under  4197-4199 of same, and under  6120-6124 of same, and the amendments thereto, and as a bill of review under the chancery practice, as appears by the prayer herein.'\n\n It then sets out in detail the facts which constitute the basis of the assignment of errors in this court, presently given, as well as specifications of errors under the Constitution and statutes of the state. It prayed that the paper be considered in the several characters mentioned in its opening paragraph; that all the parties to the original suit be considered parties, including the purchasers at the sale; that the decree of the 14th of February, 1898, be 'reviewed, reversed, and vacated, and that the report of the sales and the sales be set aside and the deeds canceled.'\n The case was submitted on a statement of facts, by which it was agreed that plaintiffs in error were the owners of the land on the 21st day of December, 1897, and that their title appeared of record. That at that date they were, and continued to be, respectively, citizens of Florida and of Georgia, and that they would testify that they had no knowledge of the suit or its pendency, or that taxes for levee purposes had been levied prior to the date of the sale of their lands and the purchase thereof by Hunter or Hackler, or 'that any law on that subject had been enacted.' That the clerk of the court was allowed $1 for each of the deeds made in pursuance of the sale, and allowed the fees set out in the decree, and all said sums were taxed as costs and paid \n\n[204 U.S. 241, 249]\n\u00a0\n out of the proceeds of sale. That plaintiff in error made the tenders to Hunter and Hackler, respectively, as stated in 'their answer and motion filed herein on the 25th day of September, 1899, and in the manner and at the time stated and that the said C. W. Hunter and A. Hackler, respectively, refused to receive such tenders, and severally refused to state the amounts that they claimed they were entitled to receive in order to redeem the said tracts of land respectively.'\n It was also agreed that the record of the suit, including all orders, returns of officers, minutes of proceedings, etc., should be read in evidence, subject only to objections for irrelevancy and incompetency.\n The decree of the court, after reciting the submission of the case and upon what submitted, concluded as follows: 'The court orders that all the relief as prayed for in the said answer, motion, petition, and original complaint of the said A. B. Ballard and Josephine W. Ballard be and the same is hereby denied and refused, and that the said answer, motion, petition, and original complaint be and the same is hereby dismissed.'\n The supreme court of the state affirmed the decree.\n The errors assigned are that the supreme court erred in not decreeing that (1). The lands of plaintiffs in error were not properly described in the complaint. (2) and (3) In not decreeing that the sale was unlawfully made, for the reason that the lands of plaintiffs in error were sold as a whole and for taxes on the whole west one half of section 32, when plaintiffs in error did not own or claim the N. 1\/2 of the N. W. 1\/4 of that section. (4) The decree was void because the lands were sold for sums not legally chargeable thereon. (5) That the acts of 1893 and 1895 required a notice to be given to the owners of the lands proceeded against in the suit they provided for, and no sucn notice was given, and the sales were therefore unauthorized authorized and void. (6) The notice provided for by the act, assuming notice was given, was insufficient. It was not such a notice of the pendency of the suit as the act or the general law required to be given to the owners of lands resident in \n\n[204 U.S. 241, 250]\n\u00a0\n the state of Arkansas and Crittenden county, where the lands were located, and to persons owning lands there similarly circumstanced and subject to the same taxation, or persons having tenants on such lands. All such persons were entitled by said act and had personal service for at least twenty days before the rendition of the decree of sale. Plaintiffs in error, respectively citizens of Georgia and Florida, were allowed and given constructive service, if any were given, only by publication in a newspaper, published in Crittenden county, and only weekly for four weeks, the first notice being, and required to be, only four weeks before the rendition of the decree. Plaintiffs in error had no personal or other notice of the suit, and did not appear therein. They were denied thereby the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States and of Arkansas, and denied the equal protection of the laws within the state of Arkansas, and deprived of their property without due process of law, in violation of the Constitution of the United States, and the decree of sale and sales thereunder are void. (8) In not decreeing that the sales of the land of the plaintiffs in error were void and passed no title, because in the suit the laws of the state were violated in that (a) the complaint was deficient; (b) that there was no sufficient affidavit made and filed to support a warning order or order for notice to plaintiffs in error; (c) there was no sufficient proof of publication of warning order or notice filed or produced in court when decree of sale was made; (d) the decree of sale did not state, and the record did not show, the facts essential to the validity of the decree of sale as against plaintiffs in error or other lands. Thereby the plaintiffs in error, in violation of the Constitution of the United States, have been denied the benefit of such laws in this suit. (9) The decree of sale was rendered in violation of the laws of Arkansas requiring proof of evidence to support the allegations of the plaintiff as against plaintiffs in error, persons before the court only by a constructive service of process. And the decree was pronounced as based on an alleged order or decree pro \n\n[204 U.S. 241, 251]\n\u00a0\n confesso entered in the suit, not authorized by law, and so was rendered without due process of law, in violation of the Constitution of the United States.\n Messrs. William M. randolph, George Randolph, and Wassell Randolph for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n[204 U.S. 241, 253]\n\u00a0\n Mr. L. P. Berry for defendants in error.\n\n\n\n[204 U.S. 241, 254]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna, after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The assignments of error present the contention that plaintiffs in error have been deprived of their property without due process of law. One of them urges, in addition, the clauses of the 14th Amendment, which prohibit a state from making or enforcing any law which will abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States, and from depriving any person within her jurisdiction of the equal protection of the laws. Plaintiffs in error invoke those provisions against the statutes of Arkansas, because of the different manner and time of service of summons of the suit authorized by said statutes to enforce the payment of the levee taxes. It is contended that, by requiring personal service of summons upon resident owners or occupants of lands for at least twenty days before the rendition of the decree of sale, and providing for constructive service by publication upon nonresident owners of only four weeks, a discrimination is made between owners of lands, and that nonresident owners are thereby denied the rights secured to them by the Constitution of the United States. We have no doubt of the power of the state to so discriminate, nor do we think extended discussion is necessary. Personal service upon nonresidents is not always within the state's power. Its process is limited by its boundaries. Constructive service is at times a necessary resource. The land stands accountable to the demands of the state, and the owners are charged with the laws affecting it and the manner by which those demands may be enforced. Huling v. Kaw Valley R. & Improv. Co. \n130 U.S. 559\n, 32 L. ed. 1045, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 603. This accountability \n\n[204 U.S. 241, 255]\n\u00a0\n of the land and the knowledge the owners must be presumed to have had of the laws affecting it is an answer to the contention of the insufficiency of the service. Certainly it was not so insufficient that it can be said that a difference in the time allowed for such service was not the equivalent of that allowed to resident owners. Mixed with the contention is a charge that the notice to nonresidents did not comply with the act of 1893 or the general law of the state, but this is decided against plaintiffs in error by the supreme court of the state, and we accept its ruling.\n In passing upon the other contentions of plaintiffs in error we are brought to the consideration of what is due process of law. A precise definition has never been attempted. It does not always mean proceedings in court. Den ex dem. Murray v. Hoboken Land & Improv. Co. 18 How. 272, 15 L. ed. 372; McMillen v. Anderson, \n95 U.S. 37\n, 24 L. ed. 335. Its fundamental requirement is an opportunity for a hearing and defense, but no fixed procedure is demanded. The process or proceedings may be adapted to the nature of the case. Dent v. West Virginia, \n129 U.S. 114\n, 32 L. ed. 623, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 231; Lent v. Tillson, \n140 U.S. 316\n, 35 L. ed. 419, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 825; Hagar v. Reclamation Dist. No. 108, \n111 U.S. 701\n, 28 L. ed. 569, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 663; Iowa R. C. Co. v. Iowa, \n160 U.S. 389\n, 40 L. ed. 467, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 344.\n In Davidson v. New Orleans, \n96 U.S. 97\n, 24 L. ed. 616, a proposition was laid down which has since been quoted many times. The court said, at pages 104 and 105, L. ed. on pages 619 and 620: 'That whenever, by the laws of a state or by state authority, a tax, assessment, servitude, or other burden is imposed upon property for the public use, whether it be for the whole state or of some more limited portion of the community, and those laws provide for a mode of confirming or contesting the charge thus imposed, in the ordinary courts of justice, with such notice to the person or such proceeding in regard to the property as is appropriate to the nature of the case, the judgment in such proceedings cannot be said to deprive the owner of his property without due process of law, however obnoxious it may be to other objections.' And Mr. Justice Bradley, in a concurring opinion, said, on pages 107 and 108, L. ed. on pages 620 and 621, 'that, in judging what is 'due process of \n\n[204 U.S. 241, 256]\n\u00a0\n law,' respect must be had to the cause and object of the taking, whether under the taxing power, the power of eminent domain, or the power of assessment for local improvements, or none of these; and, if found to be suitable or admissible in the special case, it will be adjudged to be 'due process of law;' but if found to be arbitrary, oppressive, and unjust, it may be declared to be not 'due process of law.' Such an examination may be made without interfering with that large discretion which every legislative power has of making wide modifications in the forms of procedure in each case, according as the laws, habits, customs, and preferences of the people of the particular state may require.' See also Marchant v. Pennsylvania R. Co. \n153 U.S. 380\n, 38 L. ed. 751, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 894, and Holden v. Hardy, \n169 U.S. 366\n, 42 L. ed. 780, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 383.\n In Castillo v. McConnico, \n168 U.S. 674\n, 42 L. ed. 622, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 229, Prior decisins defining due process of law were applied to a law assessing taxes. The case involved the validity of a title derived from a tax sale made to enforce delinquent state taxes. The title thus acquired was assailed on the ground that the assessment upon which is was based was void because the property was not assessed in the name of its owner. The state law made the deed given in pursuance of the sale prima facie evidence of the fact that the property was subject to taxation and the fact that the taxes had not been paid, and conclusive evidence that the property had been assessed, the taxes levied, and the property advertised according to law; also that the property was adjudicated and sold, as stated in the deed, and all the prerequisites of the law were complied with, from the assessment up to and including the execution and registry of the deed. The state court sustained the sale. This court, in passing upon the contention that the assessment and sale constituted a taking of property without due process of law, went behind the presumptions created by the deed, considered the alleged defects in the assessment and the advertisement, and decided that a notice of thirty days by publication was due process of law. The court also decided that, although the statutes under which the assessment was made provided \n\n[204 U.S. 241, 257]\n\u00a0\n for the placing of the name of the owner on the assessment roll, where such name was known, they also provided that the property assessed should be described in the assessment roll; and, therefore, that the notice required by the statute was not addressed to each person assessed, but to all persons having property subject to taxation. It was held that the statute afforded both constructive and actual notice. 'It cannot be doubted,' it was said at page 681, L. ed. at page 625, Sup. Ct. Rep. at page 232, 'that, in the exercise of its taxing power, the state of Louisiana could have directed that the property subject to its taxing authority should be assessed without any reference whatever to the name of the owner; that is to say, by any such description and method as would have been legally adequate to convey either actual or constructive notice to the owner. As said in Witherspoon v. Duncan, 4 Wall. 217, 18 L. ed. 342: 'It is not the province of this court to interfere with the policy of the revenue laws of the state, nor with the interpretation given to them by their courts. Arkansas has the right to determine the manner of levying and collecting taxes, and can declare that the particular tract of land shall be chargeable with the taxes, no matter who is the owner or in whose name it is assessed and advertised, and that an erroneous assessment does not vitiate a sale for taxes.\" See also Turpin v. Lemon, \n187 U.S. 51\n, 47 L. ed. 70, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 20, and Leigh v. Green, \n193 U.S. 79\n, 48 L. ed. 623, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 390.\n In view of these principles let us examine the contentions of the plaintiffs in error.\n First. They charge that there is an incorrect description of the lands owned by plaintiffs in error in the original complaint and decree, in that they did not own all the lands described or sold. In the original transcript of the record there were apparently discrepancies between the lands assessed and those described in the decree. These discrepancies have been corrected by the return to a certiorari granted for that purpose, and it appears that the lands assessed and those decreed to be sold in section 32, T. 4 N., R. 7 E., were the W. 1\/2 and S. E. 1\/4, 480 acres, W. 1\/2 of N. E. 1\/4, 80 acres. Plaintiffs \n\n[204 U.S. 241, 258]\n\u00a0\n in error, however, allege that they owned only the S. W. 1\/4 and the S. 1\/2 of the N. W. 1\/4, and contend that the two tracts owned by them made up 240 acres, and the two tracts sold by the commissioner and conveyed to Hunter, embracing such 240 acres, made 480 acres. Thus, is is urged, the lands plaintiffs in error owned were sole to pay the levee taxes on land they did not own, and their lands were thereby taken without due process of law.\n This point was made in the complaint attacking the decree and sale, but was not passed on by the supreme court. Presumably the court regarded the point as precluded by the original decree, and not a ground upon which the decree could be attacked, and this is our view. What lands were properly assessed to Ballard and what lands he owned were facts to be alleged in the original suit and established by the proof there introduced or by admission through the default of the owners of the lands. If there was error it cannot be a ground of setting aside the decree if the court had acquired jurisdiction to render the decree. Error or irregularities in the suit do not take from it or its decree the attribute of due process. Central Land Co. v. Laidley, \n159 U.S. 103\n, 40 L. ed. 91, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 80; Iowa C. R. Co. v. Iowa, supra. It is only this aspect of the suit and decree with which we are concerned. No defense, therefore, which could have been made or rights which could have been taken care of in the suit can now be set up to impugn its decree.\n The statutes of the state under which the taxes were levied virtually make the land a party to the suit to collect the taxes. It is from the lands alone, and not from their owner, that the taxes are to be satisfied, and each acre bears its part. The burden or taxation could have been easily and definitely assigned by the court. Mistakes in ascribing the ownership of the lands did not increase the taxation, or cast that which should have been paid by one tract of land upon another tract. In Doyle v. Martin, 55 Ark. 37, 17 S. W. 346, it was held that it is no valid objection to a tax proceeding against land \n\n[204 U.S. 241, 259]\n\u00a0\n owned by one person that it was described, not separately, but as a portion of a larger tract owned by a different person. See also Minneapolis R. Terminal Co. v. Minnesota Debenture Co. 81 Minn. 66, 83 N. W. 485.\n Second. The fourth error assigned is that the lands were sold for sums not legally chargeable thereon. The illegal charges alleged are fees to the commissioner for furnishing the printer with a list of lands sold, fees to the commissioner for reporting the sale, and to the printer for publishing notice of sale. The comment we have made above applies to this assignment of error. The act under which the suit was brought provided that notice to those interested in the delinquent lands proceeded against should specify, among other things, that a final judgment would be entered, 'directing the sale of lands for the purpose of collecting said delinquent levee taxes, together with the payment of interest, penalty, and costs allowed by law.' It was for the court to determine, therefore, what costs were allowed by law, and an erroneous judgment of what the law allowed did not deprive the defendants in the suit of their property without due process of law. The supreme court, in passing on this objection, said: 'A decree of a court of competent jurisdiction is not subject to a collateral attack because lands were sold thereunder for illegal penalties and costs. Kelley v. Laconia Levee District, 74 Ark. 202, 85 S. W. 249, 87 S. W. 638; Johnson v. Hunter, 127 Fed. 219.' [74 Ark. 181, 85 S. W. 254.] And this decision is an answer to the other decisions of Arkansas cited by plaintiffs in error, to the effect that a sale for taxes, in excess of the amount due, or embracing costs not legally due, is void. And the case at bar is also distinguishable from the cases cited from this court. \n Third. The fifth assignment of error is based on the contention that the supreme court of the state erred in not \n\n[204 U.S. 241, 260]\n\u00a0\n deciding that plaintiffs in error were not given the notice required by the statutes of the state. This assignment of error is elaborately argued by counsel, but the distinction is not clearly made between the construction of the statutes and their effect as construed. What the statute required was for the supreme court to determine; whether, as determined, it constituted due process, is for us to decide. The case at bar does not come within Huntington v. Attrill, \n146 U.S. 657\n, 36 L. ed. 1123, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 224, or Scott v. McNeal, \n154 U.S. 34\n, 38 L. ed. 896, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1108, or the cases where the statute of a state was assailed as impairing the obligation of a contract. We come, then, to what was done in the suit which decreed the sale, and the discussion answers as well for the other assignments of error without specially enumerating them. The ultimate ground of all of them is that the proceedings were conducted without the notice to plaintiffs in error required by the demands of due process of law. In discussing the contention of plaintiffs in error, that they had been denied the equal protection of the laws by the different manner of service upon resident and nonresident owners of land, and the different times for appearance after service, we declared that it was competent for the state to make the distinction, and that the notice and time were adequate to give the plaintiffs in error the equal protection of the laws. They were also adequate to afford due process of law. And we will pass to the consideration eration of the other objections. The most important are the following: That there was no sufficient affidavit made and filed to support a warning order or order for notice to plaintiffs in error, and there was no proof of such order or notice filed or produced in court when the decree was rendered. Replying to these objections, the supreme court said:\n'3. The act provides that notice by publication shall be given to the defendants in suits instituted for the collections of levee taxes, who are nonresidents of the county where the suits are brought. The plaintiff in the complaint in the proceedings attacked in this suit stated who of the defendants \n\n[204 U.S. 241, 261]\n\u00a0\n therein were nonresidents of the county in which the proceedings were pending; and such complaint was sworn to. This was sufficient to authorize notice, by publication, without a separate affidavit to the same effect. It was held in Sannoner v. Jacobson, 47 Ark. 31, 14 S. W. 458, that an affidavit and complaint may be included in one instrument of writing, if it contains all the essentials of both. The complaint in the proceedings attacked contained the essentials of the affidavit and is sufficient to answer the same purpose. Johnson v. Hunter, supra.\n\n'4. The act under which the aforesaid proceedings were instituted does not require a warning order to be entered on record, or on the complaint; and, if it had, the proceedings could not be attacked collaterally, unless such entry was made jurisdictional, as it was in Gregory v. Bartlett, 55 Ark. 30, 17 S. W. 344, and it was not in this case. Clay v. Bilby, 72 Ark. 101, 78 S. W. 749.'\n\n The court held, therefore, that, under the laws of the state, an 'affidavit and complaint may be included in one instrument of writing, if it contains all the essentials of both.' And it was held that the complaint in the proceedings attacked did contain those essentials. If we could dispute with the supreme court at all upon the requirements of the laws of the state it would have to be on a clearer showing of error than is made in the case at bar. The statute provides that all or any part of the delinquent lands for a county may be included in the suit instituted in such county, and there may be included in the suit known and unknown owners; 'and notice of the pendency of such suit shall be given as against nonresident owners of the county and unknown owners, respectively,' by publication weekly. The time of publication is specified. The complaint showed that Ballard was the owner of the lands and that he was a nonresident of the county. It was said, however, that Josephine Ballard was not made a defendant in the suit, though the records of the county showed that she was an owner thereof. But the statute provided against \n\n[204 U.S. 241, 262]\n\u00a0\n such an omission. It provided that the proceedings and judgment should be in the nature of proceedings in rem, and that it should be immaterial that the ownership of the lands might be incorrectly alleged in the proceedings. We see no want of due process in that requirement, or what was done under it. It is manifest that any criticism of either is answered by the cases we have cited. The proceedings were appropriate to the nature of the case.\n It should be kept in mind that the laws of a state come under the prohibition of the 14th Amendment only when they infringe fundamental rights. A law must be framed and judged of in consideration of the practical affairs of man. The law cannot give personal notice of its provisions or proceedings to everyone. It charges everyone with knowledge of its provisions; of its proceedings it must, at times, adopt some form of indirect notice, and indirect notice is usually efficient notice when the proceedings affect real estate. Of what concerns or may concern their real estate men usually keep informed, and on that probability the law may frame its proceedings; indeed, must frame them, and assume the care of property to be universal, if it would give efficiency to many of its exercises. This was pointed out in Huling v. Kaw. Valley R. & Improv. Co. \n130 U.S. 559\n, 32 L. ed. 1045, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 603, where it was declared to be the 'duty of the owner of real estate, who is a nonresident, to take measures that in some way he shall be represented when his property is called into requisition; and, if he fails to get notice by the ordinary publications which have been usually required in such cases, it is his misfortune, and he must abide the consequences.' It makes no difference, therefore, that plaintiffs in error did not have personal notice of the suit to collect the taxes on their lands or that taxes had been levied, or knowledge of the law under which the taxes had been levied.\n Our attention is directed to the case of Johnson v. Hunter, decided by the circuit court of appeals for the eighth circuit, 147 Fed. 133, to establish that the verified complaint \n\n[204 U.S. 241, 263]\n\u00a0\n in the suit to collect the levee taxes was not sufficient to sustain the service by publication. The appellants in that case were complainants in the circuit court in a suit to quiet their title against sales under decrees made in suits prosecuted by the St. Francis levee district,-suits identical with that with which the case at bar is concerned. The court held that an affidavit, 'adapted to the terms of the levee act,' and placed on record in the suit, was a prerequisite to the issuance and publication of the prescribed warning order, and was strictly jurisdictional. A number of cases were cited. Considering the terms of the levee act, the court quoted the following provisions of  11 as amended February 15, 1893: 'And provided further, actual service of summons shall be had where the defendant is in the county or where there is an occupant upon the land.' 'The conditions are,' the court said, 'that the defendant must be a nonresident of the county, and must be absent therefrom, and that there must not be an occupant upon the land. If the defendant be a resident of the county, or be present therein, or if there be an occupant upon the land, actual service of a summons is required. . . . And a defendant may be a nonresident of the county and absent therefrom and yet the land be occupied by a tenant or other representative upon whom a summons can be served. If the land is so occupied the act plainly calls for such service. Banks v. St. Francis Levee District, 66 Ark. 490, 51 S. W. 830.' The court assented to the view that a complaint, properly verified, containing what was required to be set forth, would be a sufficient affidavit to sustain service by publication, but observed, that 'of the three concurring conditions, without the existence of which that mode of service was not permissible, the complaints alleged the existence of one, and were altogether silent in respect of the other two; that is, they stated that Johnson [the defendant] was a nonresident of the county, but did not state that he was not present therein or that there was not an occupant upon the lands.' \n\n[204 U.S. 241, 264]\n\u00a0\n Referring to the case of Memphis Land & Timber Co. v. St. Francis Levee District, 70 Ark. 409, 68 S. W. 242, and the decision of the supreme court of the state in the case at bar, it was said: 'In one the question actually considered was whether or not any affidavit for publication was necessary, rather than what it should contain, and in the other it was whether or not a verified complaint could perform the office of such an affidavit; but in neither does the court's attention appear to have been directed to the provision, 'and provided further, actual service of summons shall be had where the defendant is in the county or where there is an occupant upon the land.' In the arrangement of the act this provision is somewhat separated from the others which it is obviously designed to modify and restrain, and, in the absence of any controversy respecting it, it may well be that it was not observed by the court.' We cannot concur in the supposition. We think those cases can be better explained by a different supposition. In the case at bar plaintiffs in error are not in a position to make the objection. They do not assert that, though nonresidents of the county, they were present therein or that their lands were occupied by a tenant or other reprentatives, as was the case in Banks v. St. Francis Levee District, supra. They, on the contrary, assert, and make it a ground of relief under the Constitution of the United States, that, as nonresidents, they were discriminated against, in that the act of 1895 did not require the same notice to be given to nonresident owners as to resident owners or to persons owning and having tenants upon the land.\n Plaintiffs in error, it is true, allege that no 'sufficient affidavit of the plaintiff' was filed 'stating positively or sufficiently any one of the facts' required to be stated, and that the clerk did not make, on the complaint or otherwise, any warning order to plaintiffs in error, or to either of them, to appear in the suit as required, or which obliged them to appear therein or bound them by the proceedings which were had therein. But there was no allegation that either of them \n\n[204 U.S. 241, 265]\n\u00a0\n was in the county or that there was an occupant upon their lands. Not being defendants who were entitled to personal service, they cannot urge against the decree that they were not given personal service, or complain that the complaint was insufficient as an affidavit for service by publication, because it did not deny the existence of conditions which there is no pretense existed.\n Another assignment of error is that 'there was no sufficient proof of the publication of any warning order, or any notice to the plaintiffs in error, filed or produced in court when the decree of sale of their lands was rendered.' To this contention the supreme court replied: 'The act under which the aforesaid proceedings were instituted does not require a warning order to be entered on record or on the complaint, and, if it had, the proceedings could not be attacked collaterally unless such entry was made jurisdictional, as it was in Gregory v. Bartlett, 55 Ark. 30, 17 S. W. 344, and it was not in this case. Clay v. Bilby, 72 Ark. 101, 78 S. W. 749.' And the decree recites that the defendants 'were severally constructively summoned by publication, . . . proof of which has been previously filed herein.' The contention of plaintiffs in error is therefore answered by Grignon v. Astor, 2 How. 319, 11 L. ed. 283; Sargeant v. State Bank, 12 How. 371, 13 L. ed. 1028; Voorhees v. Jackson, 10 Pet. 449, 9 L. ed. 490; Applegate v. Lexington & C. County Min. Co. \n117 U.S. 255\n, 29 L. ed. 892, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 742.\n The other assignments of error do not require specific mention. They are either answered by that which we have already said or do not involve jurisdictional questions.\n Decree affirmed.\n Mr. Justice Brewer concurs in the judgment. \n\nFootnotes\n 'St. Francis Levee District\n vs.\n Delinquent Lands.\n Notice.\n'The following named persons and corporations, and all others having or claiming an interest in any of the following described lands, are hereby notified that suit is pending in the circuit court of _____ county, Arkansas, to enforce the collection of certain levee taxes on the subjoined list of lands, each supposed owner's lands being set opposite his or her or its name, respectively, together with the amounts severally due from each, to wit.'\n\n Then shall follow a list of supposed owners, with a descriptive list of said delinquent lands and amounts due thereon, respectively, as aforesaid; and said published notice may conclude in the following form:\n'Said persons and corporations, and all others interested in said lands, are hereby notified that they are required by law to appear and make defense to said suit, or the same will be taken for confessed, and judgment final will be entered directing the sale of said lands for the purpose of collecting said delinquent levee taxes, together with the payment of interest, penalty, and costs allowed by law.' \n\n French v.

SMITH(1907)\nNo. 216\nArgued: March 21, 1907Decided: April 8, 1907\n\n\n\n This is an appeal from a judgment of the supreme court of \n\n[205 U.S. 285, 286]\n\u00a0\n the territory of Hawaii (17 Haw. 96), affirming an order of the third judge of the first circuit court in the territory of Hawaii, which refused to confirm a sale of property made by a commissioner under order of court in a foreclosure suit brought by William O. Smith, as trustee, against the Pacific Heights Electric Railway Company, Limited, a Hawaiian corporation, and directed that the property be again offered for sale. The suit was brought to foreclose a trust deed of $50,000 executed by the railway company to Smith, as trustee, on April 1, 1902, and purporting to convey an electric railway 2 1\/2 miles in length and running up to Pacific Heights, with its equipment of every kind, and also all land and other property conveyed to it by deed from one Charles S. Desky, dated January 25, 1902\n\n\n The sale was made on February 4, 1905, for the sum of $1,100. It was in bulk of the entire property covered by the mortgage, except a cable and condenser, which were of comparatively little value, and which, for reasons not at all affecting the merits of this controversy, were not sold with the balance of the property. The commissioner who made the sale reported that the amount realized was disproportionate to the value of the property sold, and recommended that it should not be confirmed, but that such further order should be made as to the court should seem meet in the premises. On the hearing of a motion to confirm the sale, and objections thereto, the trial court found that the evidence was overwhelming that the actual value of the property was at least seven times the amount at which the property was struck off, that being the highest and best bid therefor.\n Messrs. David L. Withington and William R. Castle for appellants.\n\n\n[205 U.S. 285, 288]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Francis M. Hatch, William O. Smith, A. Lewis, Jr., and L. J. Warren for appellees.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Brewer: \n\n[205 U.S. 285, 289]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n The question presented is whether a court of equity may, prior to any order of confirmation, set aside a foreclosure sale of mortgaged property upon the single ground of inadequacy in price; and further, whether, if it has that power, the inadequacy here shown is so gross as to justify such action. It does not appear that there was any fraudulent conduct on the part of the purchaser or any combination to restrict bidding. The sale was duly advertised. It was, so far as disclosed, open and public, and the bid reported was the highest. Nothing in time or place or lack of attendance of buyers is shown. Many of the considerations, therefore, which have influenced courts of equity to set aside judicial sales are not to be found in the present case. Indeed, the only substantial objection is that the amount of the bid is largely below the value of the property. Something may be said on each side of the question; on the one, that a court of equity owes a duty to the creditors seeking its assistance in subjecting property to the payment of debts, to see that the property brings something like its true value in order that, to the extent of that value, the debts secured upon the property may be paid; that it owes them something more than to merely take care that the forms of law are complied with, and that the purchaser is guilty of no fraudulent act; on the other, that it is the right of one bidding in good faith at an open and public sale to have the property for which he bids struck off to him if he be the highest and best bidder; that if he be free from wrong he should not be deprived of the benefit of his bid simply because others do not bid, or because parties interested have done nothing to secure the attendance of those who would likely give for the property something nearer its value; that if the \n\n[205 U.S. 285, 290]\n\u00a0\n creditors make no effort, and are willing to take the chances of a general attendance, they have no right to complain on the ground that the property did not bring what it should have brought.\n In England the old rule was that in chancery sales, until confirmation of the master's report, the bidding would be opened upon a mere offer to advance the price 10 per cent; but this rule has been rejected, and now both in England and this country a sale will not be set aside for mere inadequacy of price unless that inadequacy be so gross as to shock the conscience, or unless there be additional circumstances against its fairness. But if there be great inadequacy, slight circumstances of unfairness in the conduct of the party benefited by the sale will be sufficient to justify setting it aside. Graffam v. Burgess, \n117 \nU.S. 180, 191\n, 192 S., 29 L. ed. 839, 842, 843, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 686. It is difficult to formulate any rule more definite than this, and each case must stand upon its own peculiar facts.\n It was said by Mr. Chief Justice Waite, in Mayhew v. West Virginia Oil & Oil Land Co. 24 Fed. 205, 215, 'that in chancery a bidder at a sale by a master, under a decree of court, is not considered a purchaser until the report of sale is confirmed.' See also Magann v. Segal, 34 C. C. A. 323, 92 Fed. 252, 255; Jennings v. Dunphy, 174 Ill. 86, 50 N. E. 1045; Vanbussum v. Maloney, 2 Met. (Ky.) 550, 552; Sumner v. Sessoms, 94 N. C. 371; Branch v. Griffin, 99 N. C. 173, 5 S. E. 393, 398. The power of a court of equity in reference to a resale was affirmed by this court in Pewabic Min. Co. v. Mason, \n145 U.S. 349\n, 36 L. ed. 732, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 887, in which case we said (p. 356, L. ed. p. 734, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 888):\n'The question in this case is whether the master's sale shall stand. It may be stated generally that there is a measure of discretion in a court of equity, both as to the manner and the conditions of such a sale, as well as to ordering or refusing a resale. The chancellor will always make such provisions for notice and other conditions as will in his judgment best protect the rights of all interested, and make the sale most profitable to all; and after a sale has once been made, he will, \n\n[205 U.S. 285, 291]\n\u00a0\n certainly before confirmation, see that no wrong has been accomplished in and by the manner in which it was conducted.'\n\n See also Schroeder v. Young, 161, U. S. 334, 40 L. ed. 721, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 512.\n Now, in the case before us, the commissioner who made the sale reported against its confirmation. It was not confirmed, but set aside by the trial court, which found that the evidence was overwhelming that the actual value of the property was at least seven times the amount of the bid. While the testimony is not preserved, it is stated by the supreme court of the territory that it was claimed that only four years before the sale the property cost $78,000, exclusive of the right of way. It was, in fact, bonded less than three years before for $50,000. Speaking in general terms, it consisted of an electric railway 2 1\/2 miles in length, two freight cars, two passenger cars, and other appliances for running the railway. All this was sold for $1,100. The action of the trial court in setting aside the sale was approved by the supreme court of the territory.\n Under the circumstances, we think the order of the supreme court should be sustained. While we are disinclined to any action which will impair confidence in the stability of judicial sales, yet, with the concurrence of judicial opinion adverse to this sale, considering the amount of property sold, the meager sum bid by the purchaser, the express finding that the overwhelming testimony was to the effect that the property was worth at least seven times more than the sum bid, and also recognizing that the courts which have passed upon this question are much more familiar with the condition of things in Hawaii, and therefore more competent to appreciate the significance of the transactions attending the sale, we have come to the conclusion that it would not be right to reverse the ruling below and confirm the sale.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of the Territory of Hawaii is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","17":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBANK OF KENTUCKY v. COM. OF KENTUCKY(1907)\nNo. 87\nArgued: October 23, 1907Decided: December 2, 1907\n\n\n\n Mr. Alexander Pope Humphrey for plaintiffs in error.[ Bank of Kentucky v. Com. of Kentucky \n207 U.S. 258\n (1907) ]\n\n\n[207 U.S. 258, 260]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Henry Lane Stone, Samuel B. Kirby, and Robert W. Bingham for defendant in error. \n\n[207 U.S. 258, 261]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case involves the liability of plaintiffs in error, Bank of Kentucky and National Bank of Kentucky, to be assessed for certain back taxes under the revenue law of the state of \n\n[207 U.S. 258, 262]\n\u00a0\n Kentucky. That law makes it the duty of 'auditor's agent to cause to be listed for taxation all property omitted or any portion of property omitted by the assessor, board of supervisors, board of valuation and assessment, or railroad commission, for any year or years.' Ky. Stat. Carroll's Compilation, 1903,  4241\n\n\n In pursuance of other provisions of the section this suit was brought. There is no dispute about the facts. The Bank of Kentucky was chartered by the legislature of Kentucky in 1834. Its charter was subsequently twice extended, but was repealed by an act approved March 22, 1900. On May 1st, 1900, the National Bank of Kentucky was organized and took over its assets.\n The purpose of the suit is to subject these assets to assessment for taxes for Jefferson county for the years 1898, 1899, and 1899-1900, and for the state for the year 1899-1900. Against the assessment for county taxes plaintiffs in error pleaded a judgment of the circuit court of the United States, which, it is contended, established that it had been adjudged that the Bank of Kentucky was only taxable under a law of the state, called the Hewitt law, and that such law constituted an inviolable contract between the bank and the state. And against the state taxes it was urged that the bank had ceased to exist by the repeal of its charter before liability under the Hewitt Law attached.\n\n 1. \nBy its original charter the Bank of Kentucky was required to pay 25 cents on each share of its stock in lieu of all other taxation. By an exercise of a power reserved the legislature increased this to 50 cents. By the Hewitt law it was provided that the banks in the commonwealth should pay to the state 75 cents on each share of their capital stock outstanding, and the ordinary rate of state taxation on the amount of its profits, less 10 per cent thereof. The tax was to be in lieu of all local taxation, except upon the real estate occupied by the bank for the purpose of its business. It was provided that banks organized prior to its passage might accept \n\n[207 U.S. 258, 263]\n\u00a0\n the terms of the law. If they failed to do so they were to be taxed as other corporations were taxed, and also should be subject to local taxation. The Bank of Kentucky accepted the terms and paid the taxes required. In 1891 Kentucky adopted a new Constitution, which provided that all property of individuals and corporations should be taxed according to its value. In 1892, to enforce the provision of the Constitution, the legislature passed a general revenue bill. Under the terms of the bill, banks, as well as other corporations, are subject to taxation, and it is provided that their property at its fair cash value 'shall be assessed and valued as of the 15th of September in the year listed, and the person owning or possessing the same on that day shall list it with the assessor, and remain bound for the tax, notwithstanding he may have sold or parted with the same.' Corporations are also required to pay a tax on their franchise to the state and to the locality where the franchise is exercised, to be levied by a board denominated the 'board of valuation and assessment,' constituted of the auditor, treasurer, and secretary. It is the duty of the board to determine the apportionment of the tax where more than one jurisdiction is entitled to a share of the tax, and fix the place of its payment. The auditor is chairman of the board, and it is made his duty, at the expiration of thirty days after the final determination of such values, to certify to the county clerks the amount liable for local tax, who in turn certifies it to the local tax officer.\n The judgment relied on as res judicata was entered in a suit brought by the Bank of Kentucky in the circuit court of the United States for the district of Kentucky, wherein it impleaded Samuel H. Stone as the auditor of public accounts of the state of Kentucky, Charles Fenley as the secretary of state, and George W. Long as the treasurer of state, the city of Louisville as a municipal corporation, the county of Franklin as a municipal corporation, and the board of councilmen of the city of Frankfort as a municipal corporation.\n The bill alleged the rights of the bank under the Hewitt law as a contract between it and the state, its exemption from taxa- \n\n[207 U.S. 258, 264]\n\u00a0\n tion except under that law, the invalidity as to it of the act of November 11, 1892. The bill also set forth various litigations which the bank had theretofore conducted, and in which, it insisted, it had been adjudged that it could not be taxed otherwise than under the Hewitt law. And it was alleged that the defendants would proceed to value the franchise of the bank in the manner set forth in the act of November 11 for the years 1895, 1896, and 1897, and certify such value to the clerk of Jefferson county, and that those assessments would be illegal.\n The bill prayed that Stone, Fenley, and Long be perpetually enjoined from assessing the value of the bank's capital stock under the act of November 11 for the years mentioned; that Stone be enjoined from certifying such valuation to the said several municipalities, and that such municipalities be enjoined and restrained from collecting any tax upon such valuation; that the bank's contract be fully established; that it be declared that, upon conforming to the same by making the payments under the Hewitt law or under its charter, no other or further taxes should be exacted from it under any form or by any authority. Issue was joined and the court decreed, among other things, as follows:\n'It is further adjudged, ordered, and decreed, by reason of the several pleas of res judicata, relied on by complainant in this bill and as shown by the exhibits therewith, complainant has an established contract with the commonwealth of Kentucky, under the provisions of article 2 of the act of the general assembly of the state of Kentucky, entitled 'An Act to Amend the Revenue Laws of the Commonwealth of Kentucky,' approved May 17, 1886, and the acceptance of the same by the complainant, the terms of which contract the commonwealth of Kentucky cannot alter or change without the consent of the complainant; that by the terms of this contract the complainant and its shares of stock cannot, during its corporate existence, be assessed for taxation for state purposes in a different mode or at a greater rate of taxation than as prescribed in said act, and can be assessed for taxation and taxed for \n\n[207 U.S. 258, 265]\n\u00a0\n county and municipal purposes only upon its real estate used by it in conducting its business; that the provisions of the present Constitution of the commonwealth of Kentucky and the act of November 11, 1892, in so far as they are intended to provide or do provide for any assessment or taxation of the complainant's property, rights of property, or franchise or shares of stock, except to the extent and in the manner provided by  1, 2, and 3 of article 2 of the said act, approved May 17, 1886, and except to assess a tax for county and municipal purposes upon its real estate used in conducting its business, are in violation of and repugnant to the Federal Constitution and void.'\n\n It is insisted that this decree 'decided that the Bank of Kentucky had a full and binding contract under the Hewitt law,-a contract which the commonwealth of Kentucky could not alter or change,'-and that, by the terms of that contract, its property was only subject to taxation under that law. It is further insisted that the extent of the decree is not limited by the reasons given for it, and Deposit Bank v. Frankfort, \n191 U.S. 499\n, 48 L. ed. 276, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 154, is cited.\n The important consideration is, Upon whom is the decree binding? Meeting the inquiry, the bank contends 'that the county of Jefferson is clearly bound by this decree as privy thereto,' notwithstanding it was not a party to the suit in which the decree was rendered, and deduces this from the dependence of the power of the county to collect taxes upon the assessment by the board of valuation of the value of the franchise of the bank and the certification of the proportion thereof that was subject to county taxation. It is hence further deduced that a judgment against the state board of valuation determines the rights of all the local communities claiming under a valuation and apportionment made by the board and the auditor.\n The action of the Bank of Kentucky is inconsistent with this contention. In its litigation it made the local communities parties, and in the suit the decree in which is pleaded in \n\n[207 U.S. 258, 266]\n\u00a0\n the case at bar as establishing its exemption from taxation, except under the Hewitt law, it secured an injunction against the board of valuation and assessment by reason of a decree obtained against Franklin county in a suit to which the board was not a party. The court decided, and it was required to decide in order to give the bank the benefit of the decree, that the state board of valuation was the agent of the municipalities, county and city, and, as a consequence, that judgment rendered against the county of Franklin in the courts of the state, adjudging the Hewitt law a contract between the bank and the state, was binding upon the board of valuation. 'Nor can there be any doubt,' the court said, 'that the parties to the former litigation and this litigation are the same. The real parties in interest in this cause among the defendants are Franklin county, the city of Frankfort, and the city of Louisville. It is for them that the board of valuation and assessment are about to apportion the estimated value of the franchise, and to certify it to them for the collection of taxes. The members of the board of valuation are nothing but their agents, created under the law for the purpose of assessing this tax. If the parties in interest in whose favor the tax is to be assessed are bound by the prior litigation, certainly the agencies acting for them under the law are equally bound. In this light the board of valuation and assessment is, in respect to the former judgments, privy to the city of Louisville and county of Franklin, and the city of Frankfort.' Bank of Kentucky v. Stone, 88 Fed. 383. And, on account of this agency and consequent privity with those muncipalities, the board of valuation was enjoined from action against the contract, determined to exist by the judgment set up and to which the board was not a party by name. The reason given for the decision is now opposed by plaintiffs in error and a decree obtained on account of it is asserted to be independent of it. The vicarious character of the board, as declared by the court, is attempted to be put out of view, and a decree made against it because, and only because, it was the agent of certain municipalities, is \n\n[207 U.S. 258, 267]\n\u00a0\n sought to be made an instrument to bind all others without power of question or resistance on their part. This attempt is not justified by Deposit Bank v. Frankfort, and, as was said by the circuit court in another case, 'would be extending the doctrine of res judicata further than any authority will justify.' Northern Bank v. Stone, 88 Fed. 415.\n The Northern Bank of Kentucky had obtained a judgment against Bourbon county and its sheriff, adjudging that, under the Hewitt law, it had an irrevocable contract, and the bank sought to use the judgment as an estoppel against other counties and municipalities as well as against Bourbon county. It was sustained as to the latter, but rejected as to the other, municipalities. The argument was that Bourbon county was a municipal corporation under the state government, and that the state was bound by the litigation against it, and therefore every other municipality was bound. The court rejected the contention, making the remarks we have quoted. The relation of the board of valuation to the counties of the state was again decided to be that expressed in Bank of Kentucky v. Stone. The latter case was affirmed by this court by a division of its members. \n174 U.S. 799\n, 43 L. ed. 1187, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 881.\n There is another answer to the contention of plaintiffs in error. The relation of the board of valuation to the counties and other municipalities of the state is necessarily a matter of state regulation.\n The court of appeals of Kentucky in the case at bar, answering the contention based on the effect of the judgment pleaded as res judicata, quoted, with approval, the views expressed by the circuit court for the district of Kentucky in the Northern Bank Case, of the relation of the state to its counties and cities, and pronounced those views conclusive of 'the duty of the Bank of Kentucky to pay its taxes for the years in question.' And the court applied the doctrine of the case of Henderson County v. Henderson Bridge Co. 116 Ky. 164, 105 Am. St. Rep. 197, 75 S. W. 239, and declared that the question there considered was substantially the \n\n[207 U.S. 258, 268]\n\u00a0\n same as involved in the case at bar. Quoting that doctrine, the court said: 'A person or municipality is not bound by former litigation, unless it was a party, either actually or by its representative. Under our statute the fiscal court has control of the affairs of the county, and the sheriff is only a tax collector, in no wise a representative of the county in the management of its affairs, and the county is not therefore bound by any adjudication to which it was not a party.' In other words, the court held that neither a sheriff nor an assessor had control of the affairs of the county, and a judgment against either did not bind the county. Applying this, the court further said: 'The board of assessment and valuation did not have control of the fiscal affairs of Jefferson county, and, in our opinion, the judgment did not bind Jefferson county.' [29 Ky. L. Rep. 646, 647, 94 S. W. 622.]\n\n 2. \nTo support the contention that there is no liability to the state for the tax of 1900, it is contended that the property of the Bank of Kentucky was only assessable under the Hewitt law, and before the property was required to be returned for assessment under that law the Bank of Kentucky had ceased to exist, and its property passed to the National Bank of Kentucky, free from any lien.\n A brief recapitulation of the facts will make the contention clear. Under the Hewitt law the stock and assets of banks were ascertained as of July 1, and the tax paid thereon. On May 1, 1900, as we have seen, by not accepting the conditions imposed upon it by the legislature, the charter of the Bank of Kentucky was repealed. On that day the National Bank of Kentucky was organized and the property of the Bank of Kentucky transferred to it. Under the general laws of the state all taxable property was required to be assessed and valued as of the 15th of September in the year listed, and the owner or possessor is required to list it with the assessor on that day, and remains bound for the taxes, notwithstanding he may have sold or parted with it.  4052. Under the act of 1892, which repealed the Hewitt law, banks were required to make reports on or before the 1st of March of each year as \n\n[207 U.S. 258, 269]\n\u00a0\n of the preceding 31st of December. This provision fixed the time the property of banks should be assessed. The court of appeals held that this law was applicable to the Bank of Kentucky and fixed a lien on its property, which continued, notwithstanding the repeal of the charter of the bank and the transfer of the property to the National Bank of Kentucky. This result followed, the court of appeals further said, even viewing the Hewitt law as an irrevocable contract. In other words, it was decided that either one or the other of the two dates was the day of assessment and the commencement of the lien. That of December 31, if the Hewitt law should be regarded as repealed by the act of 1892, and the court decided that it was repealed. That of September 15, if the Hewitt law was not repealed, because the provision for the assessment of property as of the 15th of September was a part of the law. The court said:\n'If, under the Hewitt law, banks were assessed at the same time the taxes were due and payable, then the assessment did not take place until the day after the close of the fiscal year for which the assessment was made and the taxes were paid. The act does not say that the assessment shall take place on July 1, nor does it say that it is assessed as of that date. The bank is required to make a report and pay on that day. The Hewitt law provides that the holder of the legal title, and the holder of the equitable title, and the claimant or bailee in possession of the property on the 15th of September of the year the assessment is made, shall be liable for the taxes thereon. Hewitt Law,  6, art. 1, Gen. Stat. 1888, ed. p. 1035.'\n\n It was further decided that the only right which the bank secured was to pay taxes upon the property as designated by the Hewitt law. 'When the right to do this is maintained,' the court observed, 'every right it [the Bank of Kentucky] had under its irrevocable charter has been respected.'\n The conclusions of the court are contested by plaintiffs in error, and it is insisted that the day of assessment was not \n\n[207 U.S. 258, 270]\n\u00a0\n September 15 or December 31, but July 1, the day the bank was required to make its report, and that a lien for taxes could not attach until that day, and before that day the Bank of Kentucky had ceased to exist. But we have seen that the court of appeals of Kentucky, construing the laws of the state, made the 15th of September the day of assessment under the Hewitt law; in other words, distinguished between the day of assessment and the day that bank was required to make its report. We are not prepared to say that the conclusion is not justified. But passing that, we concur with the court of appeals of Kentucky that it was competent for the legislature to change the day the bank should report its property for assessment, and that the lien of assessment would follow the property in the possession of its vendee, the National Bank of Kentucky.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","18":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBARRINGTON v. STATE OF MISSOURI(1907)\nNo. 493\nArgued: Decided: April 22, 1907\n\n\n\n Mr. William G. Johnson for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Herbert S. Hadley and John Kennish for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n Plaintiff in error was found guilty of murder in the first degree in the circuit court of St. Louis county, Missouri, and after \n\n[205 U.S. 483, 484]\n\u00a0\n motions for new trial and in arrest of judgment were made and overruled, judgment was rendered on the verdict and sentence passed accordingly. The case was carried to the supreme court of the state and the judgment was affirmed by division No. 2 of that court, having appellate jurisdiction of criminal cases. No Federal question was referred to in the opinion of the court. A motion for rehearing was filed, wherein Federal questions were sought to be raised. The court denied the motion without opinion.\n Plaintiff in error then moved for the transfer of the cause to the court in banc, setting forth certain Federal questions, and the cause was transferred. The court in banc adopted the opinion of division No. 2 as its opinion, and the judgment was again affirmed. 198 Mo. 23, 95 S. W. 235. A motion for rehearing, assuming to raise Federal questions, was filed, and denied without opinion. This writ of error was thereupon brought and comes before us on motions to dismiss or affirm.\n No assignment of errors was returned with the writ, as required by  997 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 712), nor is there in the brief of counsel for plaintiff in error on these motions any specification of errors under Rule 21, but the brief does allege that certain Federal questions were duly raised and so disposed of as to sustain the jurisdiction of this court.\n But if these questions are wholly without merit, or are no longer open by reason of our previous decisions, it has long been settled that the writ of error should be dismissed.\n\n 1. \nBefore the trial of the cause was commenced, plaintiff in error applied for a change of venue on the ground of local prejudice.\n The application was heard at length, and forty-one witnesses testified in its support and thirty-seven witnesses in opposition thereto; and the trial court decided that prejudice justifying a change of venue had not been made out, and denied the application. It is now contended that the refusal to grant the change of venue deprived plaintiff in error of a fair and impartial trial, to which, under the Federal Constitution, he \n\n[205 U.S. 483, 485]\n\u00a0\n was entitled. The state supreme court held it to be a well-settled rule of law in Missouri that the granting of a change of venue in a criminal case rested largely in the discretion of the trial court, and that 'where the trial court has heard the evidence in favor of and against the application, and a conclusion reached adversely to granting the change, such ruling will not be disturbed by this court, and should not be unless there are circumstances of such a nature as indicates an abuse of the discretion lodged in such court.' And the supreme court, after a full review of all the testimony, decided that the trial court had acted properly in overruling the application for a change of venue. In our judgment no Federal question was involved. Were this otherwise it would follow that we could decide in any case that the trial court had abused its discretion under the laws of the state of Missouri, although the supreme court of that state had held to the contrary.\n\n 2. \nIt is also contended that plaintiff in error 'set up and claimed that, under the Federal Constitution, as well as under the Constitution of Missouri, he could not be compelled to give testimony against himself, and that this exemption and protection were denied to him by the court in permitting to be given in evidence against him alleged extrajudicial admissions extorted from him while under arrest by the police officers of the state.' Certain statements made by plaintiff in error, defendant below, were admitted in evidence on the trial, but it does not appear that counsel objected to the introduction of this testimony on the ground that any rights, privileges, or immunities of defendant under the Constitution of the United States were thereby violated. Counsel for the state offered in evidence certain articles taken from defendant's trunk, and this was objected to on the ground that they were taken in violation of the state Constitution and without defendant's consent. The objection was not passed upon, and the articles were withdrawn. The trunk and its contents were again offered in evidence and objected to, but the objection was based entirely upon the ground of irrelevancy and immateriality, \n\n[205 U.S. 483, 486]\n\u00a0\n and the fact that a proper foundation had not been laid in the identification of the trunk.\n When the state offered in evidence the statements made by defendant following his arrest, the trial court excluded the jury and heard the testimony of the persons present at the time for the purpose of determining the competency thereof. After the examination of a number of witnesses, who detailed fully the circumstances under which the statements were made, counsel objected 'because there is no foundation laid for it and because it was [not] voluntary.' This objection was overruled and the evidence admitted.\n The state supreme court held that the trial court, in admitting the testimony, did not commit error. This, notwithstanding the Constitution of Missouri provided 'that no person shall be compelled to testify against himself in a criminal case.' Its ruling upon that proposition is not subject to review in this court.\n After the decision of the supreme court in banc, affirming the judgment, plaintiff in error filed a petition for rehearing which was denied without opinion. The third ground of that motion was as follows: 'Because counsel for appellant, through neglect and inadvertence, failed to call the attention of the court to the proposition that the cross- examination of appellant, complained of as 'improper,' and the admission as evidence of statements or 'confessions' made by appellant while in the 'sweat box' of the St. Louis police department, was in direct violation of the Constitution of the United States, article 5, Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, in that it compelled the appellant to become a witness against himself.' The suggestion came too late, and, moreover, article 5 of the Amendments, alone relied on, does not operate as a 'restriction of the powers of the state, but was intended to operate solely upon the Federal government.' Brown v. New Jersey, \n175 U.S. 172\n, 44 L. ed. 119, 20 Sup. C. Rep. 77. And if, as decided, the admission of this testimony did not violate the rights of the plaintiff in error under the Constitution and laws of the state of Missouri, the record \n\n[205 U.S. 483, 487]\n\u00a0\n affords no basis for holding that he was not awarded due process of low. Howard v. Fleming, \n191 U.S. 126\n, 48 L. ed. 121, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 49.\n\n 3. \nPlaintiff in error filed a demurrer to the indictment, one of the grounds of which was: 'Because of the inconsistency, multiplicity, and repugnancy of said counts, the defendant is being proceeded against in violation of the state and Federal guaranty of due process of law, and in violation of his constitutional right to be specifically informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him.' The demurrer was overruled. And also a motion to quash assigning similar grounds, which was likewise overruled.\n These rulings in respect of the sufficiency of the indictment present no Federal question. Howard v. Fleming, \n191 \nU.S. 126, 135\n, 48 S. L. ed. 121, 124, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 49, and cases cited.\n\n 4. \nAfter the demurrer and motion to quash had been disposed of, a plea in abatement was filed, averring that the prosecuting attorney intentionally refrained from indorsing the names of certain witnesses on the indictment; that defendant was a native of Great Britain and a subject of the King, and tht, by virtue of treaties, the law of nations, the laws and Constitution of the United States, and the laws of Missouri, defendant was entitled to know who were the witnesses against him.\n A similar point, with like allegations, was made in the motion to quash. The court heard the evidence on the plea in abatement, and found the issues against defendant, except that it found that he was a native citizen and subject of Great Britain.\n The question of citizenship is immaterial as affecting the jurisdiction of this court under  709, Rev. Stat. (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 575). French v. Hopkins, \n124 U.S. 524\n, 31 L. ed. 536, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 589. Nor are we aware, as Chief Justice Waite said in Spies v. Illinois ( Ex parte Spies) \n123 \nU.S. 131, 182\n, 31 S. L. ed. 80, 91, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 21, of any treaty giving to subjects of Great Britain any different measure of justice than secured to citizens of this country. And the general rule of law is that alines are subject to the law of the territory where the crime is committed. Wildenhus's Case (Mali v. Keeper of Common Jail) \n120 U.S. 1\n, 30 L. ed. 565, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 383; Carlisle v. United States, 16 Wall. 147, 21 L. ed. 426; People v. McLeod, 1 Hill, 377, 37 Am. Dec. 328; Wharton, Confl. L.  819. \n\n[205 U.S. 483, 488]\n\u00a0\n As to the allegation that the prosecuting attorney intentionally refrained from indorsing the names of certain witnesses on the indictment, in the motion to quash as well as in the plea in abatement, the state courts held that the charge was not sustained by the evidence.\n The right of the accused to the indorsement of names of witnesses does not rest on the common law, but is statutory, and provided for in Missouri by  2517 of the Revised Statutes of 1899, whereby the right of the state to use other witnesses not so indorsed is recognized. The state supreme court discussed the matter at length, held there was no error, and added: 'Aside from all this it is manifest that the defendant has no right to complain of any prejudicial error upon the action of the coutr upon this motion. This motion was filed October 6, 1903, and the record discloses upon the showing made upon such motion and plea in abatement that appellant had notice of these additional witnesses which were introduced by the state at the trial. The trial did not occur until the 23d of February, 1904, some three or four months subsequent to the time of which the record discloses that he had notice of these witnesses.' [198 Mo. 70, 95 S. W. 250.]\n The decision of the supreme court that defendant had been tried in accordance with the procedure provided by the statutes of Missouri is not open to revision here in the circumstances.\n We have not been astute to apply to these motions the rigor of our rules, and have explored the record with care; but have not found therein any denial of fundamental rights, of due proces of law, or of the equal protection of the laws. The Federal questions asserted in the brief or suggested by the record are wholly inadequate to justify our interference.\n Writ of error dismissed. \n\n\n\n","19":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBEHN, MEYER & CO. v. CAMPBELL & GO TAUCO(1907)\nNo. 227\nArgued: March 7, 1907Decided: April 8, 1907\n\n\n\n The defendants in error, hereinafter called the plaintiffs, brought an action in the court of first instance of the city of Manila, in the Philippine Islands, to recover from the plaintiffs in error, hereinafter called the defendants, the sum of 9,250.62 pesos, alleged to be due on account of labor and materials furnished under a building contract and its modifications. The defendants, among other defenses, set up first, that the labor \n\n[205 U.S. 403, 404]\n\u00a0\n was performed in a negligent and unworkmanlike manner, which caused the defendants great damages; and, second, that the plaintiffs contracted in writing with the defendants to fill a certain lot of land with earth and sand at a given rate per cubic meter, and had been paid upon their representation of the amount of earth and sand used in the filling, $81, 497.65, Mexican currency; that the amount of sand and earth used was much less than that represented, and that the plaintiffs had been overpaid $41, 197.63, Mexican currency. The defendants sought to recover this overpayment by way of counterclaim. A trial before the judge of the court of first instance resulted in a finding that the defendants had been damaged through the negligent and unworkmanlike manner of furnishing the labor under the building contract and its modifications, to an amount equal to the sum remaining due under the terms of that contract and that there had been an overpayment on the filling contract, as alleged by the defendants. Accordingly judgment was rendered dismissing the plaintiffs' complaint, and that the defendants recover from the plaintiffs $52,000 Mexican currency. The plaintiffs appealed to the supreme court of the Islands. That court found as a fact substantially that the plaintiffs had fully complied with their contract and were entitled to recover the amount they alleged to be due; that the amount paid by the defendants to the plaintiffs on account of filling was determined by actual measurements made at the time of the filling by defendants' representatives; that there was no fraud or mistake, and that the defendants, therefore, were not entitled to recover anything on account of overpayment on that account. The judgment of the court of first instance was reversed, and judgment ordered for the plaintiffs in the sum of $9,250.62, Mexican currency. Thereupon the defendants appealed to this court. The appeal was dismissed by this court for want of jurisdiction. The defendants then sued out a writ of error, which was allowed by a justice of the supreme court of the Philippine Islands, and filed with its petition the following assignment of errors: \n\n[205 U.S. 403, 405]\n\u00a0\n\n'1. The supreme court of the Philippine Islands erred in reversing the judgment of the court of first instance for the city of Manila to the effect that the plaintiff's in error were entitled to the sum of $9,250.62, Mexican currency, as damages sustained by reason of the faulty construction of the premises in question.\n\n'2. The supreme court of the Philippine Islands erred in reversing the judgment of the court of first instance for the city of Manila granting judgment in favor of the plaintiff in error in the sum of $52,000, Mexican currency, the amount overpaid by the plaintiffs in error to the defendants in error for the delivery of sand.\n\n'3. The supreme court of the Philippine Islands erred in finding as matters of fact the following:\n\n'(1) That in the construction of the building the contract, plans, and specifications have been complied with, with the exception of a variation to the advantage of the owner, which is that the principal posts rest upon layers of stone, instead of upon the ground, as called for by the plan.\n\n'(2) That, if there has been any variation from the original plan, this was done largely, if not wholly, with the consent of the owner, and, at all events, with that of his agent, the inspecting engineer, and that these changes have been improvements.\n\n'(3) That the house was constructed under a contract and specifications which did little more than to designate the size of the building, the material to be employed, and, with the plan, gave a drawing of the building, leaving the details necessary almost completely to the direction of the inspecting architect or engineer.\n\n'(4) That the owner intrusted the direction of the work to an inspecting engineer selected by himself, with full authority to represent him, and that the contractor has performed the work solely in accordance with the direction of the said inspecting engineer.\n\n'(5) That although there is some evidence to indicate that \n\n[205 U.S. 403, 406]\n\u00a0\n a part of the house has settled more than other parts, this is due either to the ground itself or to a defect in plan, or to the directions of the inspecting engineer, and cannot be attributed to a failure on the part of the contractor to comply with the conditions of the contract.\n\n'(6) If there are any cracks in the floor and in the joints in the building, this is due to the class of lumber which was selected by the owner.\n\n'(7) That the plan of the work and the placing of the principal posts were approved by the city engineer and were in conformity with the ordinances.\n\n'(8) That the owner took possession of the house in the month of May, 1902, and has occupied it since that time as a dwelling house.\n\n'By the very fact of accepting the house and occupying it, the defendants acknowledged that it was construted substantially as required by the contract, plans, and specifications; and this is the law even when the work is not done according to the contract, but accepted.\n\n'4. The supreme court of the Philippine Islands erred in not finding that the evidence in the case was not sufficient to justify the court reversing the judgment of the court of first instance.\n\n'5. The supreme court of the Philippine Islands erred in reversing the judgment of the court of first instance for the city of Manila, and in giving judgment against the plaintiff in error in the sum of $9,250.62, Mexican currency.\n\n'6. The supreme court of the Philippine Islands erred in not confirming the judgment of the court of first instance of the city of Manila in giving judgment in favor of the plaintiff in error in the sum of $ 52,000, Mexican currency.'\n\n Messrs. Henry E. Davis and Charles C. Carlin for plaintiffs in error.\n Messrs. Aldis B. Browne and Alexander Britton for defendants in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Moody: \n\n[205 U.S. 403, 407]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Moody, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The defendant first appealed from the judgment of the supreme court of the Philippine Islands, which had been rendered against them and the appeal was dismissed. \n200 U.S. 611\n, 50 L. ed. 619, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 753. The reason, so plain that it seemed not to require statement, was that errors alleged to have been committed in an action at law can be reviewed here only by writ of error. This, in the absence of modification by statute, is the rule in respect to all courts whose records are brought here for review. Walker v. Dreville, 12 Wall. 440, 20 L. ed. 429; United States v. Hailey, \n118 U.S. 233\n, 30 L. ed. 173, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1049; Deland v. Platte County, \n155 U.S. 221\n, 39 L. ed. 128, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 82; Comstock v. Eagleton, \n196 U.S. 99\n, 49 L. ed. 402, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 210.\n The defendants, having failed in their appeal, have now brought a writ of error and ask this court to review the facts to the same extent that they would be reviewed on appeal. But this overlooks the vital distinction between appeals and writs of error which has always been observed by this court, and recognized in legislation. An appeal brings up questions of fact as well as of law, but upon a writ of error only questions of law apparent on the record can be considered, and there can be no inquiry whether there was error in dealing with questions of fact. Wiscart v. Dauchy, 3 Dall. 321, 1 L. ed. 619; Generes v. Campbell, 11 Wall. 193, 20 L. ed. 110; United States v. Dawson, \n101 U.S. 569\n, 25 L. ed. 791; England v. Gebhardt, \n112 U.S. 502\n, 28 L. ed. 811, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 287; Martinton v. Fairbanks, \n112 U.S. 670\n, 28 L. ed. 862, 5 Sup. St. Rep. 301; Dower v. Richards, \n151 U.S. 658\n, 38 L. ed. 305, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 452 ( where the cases are reviewed by Mr. Justice Gray); Elliott v. Toeppner, \n187 U.S. 327\n, 47 L. ed. 200, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 133; Rev. Stat.  1011, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 715.\n The assignment of errors in the case at bar does not allege any errors of law, but deals exclusively with questions of fact. There are six assignments. The first, second, fifth, and sixth assignments severally allege that the supreme court erred in rendering the judgment which it did and in reversing the judgment of the court of first instance. The third assignment specifically recites that 'the supreme court of the Philippine \n\n[205 U.S. 403, 408]\n\u00a0\n Islands erred in finding as matters of fact the following:' Then come eight specifications of errors in such findings. It is, however, argued by counsel that the fourth assignment of errors in effect alleges an error in law. That assignment is as follows: lows: 'The supreme court of the Philiphine Islands erred in not finding that the evidence in the case was not sufficient to justify the court reversing the judgment of the court of first instance.'\n The Philippine Code of Procedure (Public Laws of Philippine Commission, act 190, 1901), prescribes in chapter 22 the practice of the supreme court in reviewing the judgments of courts of first instance. It confines the review to questions of law, with certain exceptions, one of which is as follows:\n'If the excepting party filed a motion in the court of first instance for a new trial, upon the ground that the findings of fact were plainly and manifestly against the weight of evidence, and the judge overruled said motion, and due exception was taken to his overruling the same, the supreme court may review the evidence and make such findings upon the facts and render such final judgment as justice and equity require. But, if the supreme court shall be of the opinion that the exception is frivolous and not made in good faith, it may impose double or treble additional costs upon the excepting party, and may order them to be paid by the counsel presecuting the bill of exceptions, if, in its opinion, justice so requires.'  497, subdiv. 3.\n\n The supreme court, in the case at bar, acted upon the authority conferred by this subdivision. It is said that the supreme court can review the evidence taken in the court of first instance and thereby arrive at a different conclusion of facts from that found by the trial court only in the case that 'the findings of fact were plainly and manifestly against the weight of evidence.' It is therefore urged that whether the court erred in setting aside the conclusions of the lower court as plainly and manifestly against the weight of evidence is a question of law which may be brought here by writ of error. \n\n[205 U.S. 403, 409]\n\u00a0\n It was held in De la Rama v. De la Rama, \n201 U.S. 303\n, 50 L. ed. 765, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 485, that, upon an appeal, this court will consider whether a reversal by the supreme court of the findings of the court of first instance was justified on the ground that the findings below were plainly and manifestly against the weight of evidence, and, upon being satisfied that the action of the supreme court was not warranted, on that ground would reverse it. But this case was one of appeal, and the vital distinction between an appeal and a writ of error has already been shown. The principle acted upon in that case is not applicable to writs of error. The fourth assignment of error, therefore, raises no question of law.\n The case would stop here were it not for the fact that the defendants in their brief and in the oral argument in their behalf go beyond the assignment of errors and set up three alleged errors of law not contained in them.\n It is said that the court below erred:\n'(1) In holding as a matter of law that the fact of taking possession of said dwelling house was an acknowledgment by the plaintiffs in error that it was constructed substantially as required by the said contract.\n\n'(2) In holding as a matter of law that the plaintiffs in error were not entitled to recover their overpayments for earth and sand because no mutual mistake was shown in the premises.\n\n'(3) In rendering judgment for a sum in Mexican currency instead of in Philippine pesos.'\n\n It is provided in the act giving this court jurisdiction to review the judgments of the supreme court of the Philippine Islands that they may be reviewed here 'in the same manner, under the same regulations, and by the same procedure, as far as applicable, as\n T. R. Barnett, Judge. courts of the United States.' In such cases alleged errors not stated in the assignment of errors filed with the petition for the writ have sometimes been considered. The limits of this practice are accurately stated in the thirty-fifth rule of this court. There it is said that if errors are not assigned \n\n[205 U.S. 403, 410]\n\u00a0\n with the petition for the writ they will be disregarded, except that the court at its option may notice a plain error not thus assigned.\n But we find no such plain error in the opinion of the supreme court as warrants us in reversing its judgment. The findings of fact made by that court support and require the judgment which it rendered. We do not think it necessary or desirable to select from an opinion, which was engaged with a discussion of evidence and the inferences which might properly be drawn from it, statements of law and subject them to minute scrutiny, where, on the whole, it is clear that the facts found by the court justify the judgment which it rendered. Therefore we do not consider any questions except those set forth in the assignment of errors, and, deeming that they allege no errors in law, we affirm the judgment.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","20":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBERNHEIMER v. CONVERSE(1907)\nNo. 278\nArgued: Decided: May 27, 1907\n\n\n\n\n[206 U.S. 516, 517]\n\u00a0\n These are writs of error to the circuit court of the United States for the southern district of New York.\n The actions were brought (January 28, 29, 1904) by Theodore R. Converse as receiver of the Minnesota Thresher Manufacturing Company, a corporation of the state of Minnesota, to enforce an alleged stockholders' liability under the Constitution and laws of the state of Minnesota. The court below held the executors of Simon Bernheimer and Isaac Bernheimer, both having died before the suits were brought, liable as such stockholders. \n\n[206 U.S. 516, 518]\n\u00a0\n The record discloses that the Minnesota Thresher Manufacturing Company was incorporated under the laws of the state of Minnesota on the 5th of December, 1884, the objects for which the corporation was formed being the purchase of the capital stock, evidences of indebtedness, and assets of the Northwestern Manufacturing & Car Company, also a corporation under the laws of the state of Minnesota, and for the further purpose of manufacturing and selling steam engines, farm implements, machinery, etc., and the manutacture and sale of articles, etc., and the manufacture and sale of articles, wood and iron form the principal parts.\n The Northwestern Manufacturing & Car Company was in the hands of a receiver, carrying on its business under the orders of a court, and, on October 27, 1887, the property and plant of that company, including all its bills receivable, farmers' notes, and assets were sold under decree and purchased by the Minnesota Thresher Manufacturing Company. The last- named company continued in business until December, 1900. On December 14 of that year the property and business of the thresher company were placed in the hands of a receiver by the order of the circuit court of the United States for the district of Minnesota, in a suit for the foreclosure of a mortgage upon its property, and this receiver carried on the business until the mortgaged property was sold under a decree of foreclosure on May 25, 1901\n\n\n On May 6, 1901, the Merchants' National Bank of St. Paul obtained a judgment in the district court of Ramsey county, Minnesota, against the thresher company, and executions thereon having been returned unsatisfied, the judgment creditor brought suit against the thresher company for the appointment of a receiver and the enforcement of the individual liability of its stockholders in the district court of Washington county, Minnesota. In that suit Theodore R. Converse, defendant in error in these cases, was appointed receiver. On the petition of the receiver, for the purpose of providing funds for the payment of the expenses of the receiver- \n\n[206 U.S. 516, 519]\n\u00a0\n ship in the enforcement of the stock liability and payment of indebtedness, an order was made, December 22, 1902, reciting, among other things, that copies of an order of April 16, 1902 (not in the record), had been published, mailed, and served as therein required, and that due notice of the hearing had been given to the defendant company and to each stockholder of record, as directed by the order, and, on a hearing duly had, an order of assessment of 36 per cent of the par value of each share of the capital stock of the thresher company, to wit, 18 per share, was  essed against each and every share of the capital stock, and against each and every person, corporation, or party liable as such stockholder, and each such person, corporation, or party was directed to pay to the said receiver, at his office in the city of Stillwater, Minnesota, within thirty days after the date of the order, the said sum of $18 a share; and, further, upon failure to pay said sums, the receiver was authorized to prosecute actions or proceedings against the persons liable in any court having jurisdiction in the state of Minnesota or elsewhere. On appeal to the supreme court of the state of Minnesota this order was affirmed. 90 Minn. 144, 95 N. W. 767. Subsequently, as stated, these actions were brought and judgment rendered against the executors of the Bernheimers.\n Mr. Laurence Arnold Tanzer for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n[206 U.S. 516, 522]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William G. Wilson and C. A. Severance for defendant in error.\n\n\n[206 U.S. 516, 524]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n Before entering upon a discussion of the objections urged against the validity of the assessment upon stockholders which is the subject of controversy here, we may say we find no reason to disagree with the judgment of the supreme court of Minnesota in holding the Minnesota Thresher Manufacturing Company to be a corporation organized for other than the purpose of carrying on any kind of manufacturing or mechanical business, and therefore not within the exception as to stockholders' liability in favor of corporations of that kind. State ex rel. Clapp v. Minnesota Thresher Mfg. Co. 40 Minn. 215, 3 L.R.A. 510, 41 N. W. 1020; Merchants' Nat. Bank v. Minnesota Thresher Mfg. Co. 90 Minn. 144, 95 N. W. 767.\n The questions made in these cases involve the right to recover upon a stockholder's liability in a Federal court in a state other than the one in which the original proceedings in liquidation were had, and under whose laws the corporation was formed, and wherein it carried on business, against stockholders in such corporate companies as the Thresher Company, where the stock had been acquired before the passage of the statute of 1899. General Laws of Minnesota, chap. 272, being 'An Act to Provide for the Better Enforcement of the Liability of Stockholders of Corporations.'\n A former statute had been for some years in force in Minnesota and was the statute law of the state when the stock which concerns the controversy here was acquired by the Bernheimers. This statute was before this court in the cases of Hale v. Allinson, \n188 U.S. 56\n, 47 L. ed. 380, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 244, and Finney v. Guy, \n189 U.S. 335\n, 47 L. ed. 839, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 558. It was the act of 1894, General Statutes of Minnesota of that year, chap. 76, p. 1595, and is set forth in full in the margin ( 188 U. S. p. 60, 47 L. ed. p. 385, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 245).\n Under that act it was held, in a series of decisions in the state of Minnesota, which were reviewed in Hale v. Allinson, that an action could only be maintained under the laws of \n\n[206 U.S. 516, 525]\n\u00a0\n Minnesota when brought by a creditor or creditors for the benefit of all creditors of the corporation, and the recovery was had for the purpose of making good any deficiency in the corporate assets for the payment of corporate debts; that the receiver could not maintain such an action outside of the jurisdiction of the court appointing him, and that the only remedy was, as stated, in a creditor's action, bringing in all the stockholders, for the realization of a fund to be proportionately distributed among the creditors in one suit.\n The principal contentions in these cases are that the act of 1899, above referred to, works such a change in the contract theretofore existing by virtue of the acquisition of stock in a Minnesota corporation as to impair the obligation thereof, and, in ways to be hereafter noticed, undertakes to hold a stockholder by judgment rendered without due process of law.\n The act of 1899 was before this court in the case of the First Nat. Bank v. Converse, \n200 U.S. 425\n, 50 L. ed. 537, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 306, and its principal parts are set forth in the margin of the report of that case on page 428, L. ed. page 538, Sup. Ct. Rep. page 307. The act, for our purposes, may be summarized as follows:\n'Sec. 1. Whenever any corporation created or existing by or under the laws of the state of Minnesota, whose stockholders or any of them are liable to it or to its creditors . . . upon or on account of any liability for . . . the stock or shares at any time held or owned by such stockholders, respectively, whether under or by virtue of the Constitution and laws of said state of Minnesota, or any statute of said state or otherwise, has heretofore made or shall hereafter make an assignment for the benefit of its creditors under the insolvency laws of this state; or whenever a receiver for any such corporation has heretofore been or shall hereafter be appointed by any district court of this state, whether under or pursuant to . . . any other statute of this state, or under the general equity powers and practice of such court, the district court appointing such receiver or having jurisdiction of the matter of said assignment may proceed as in this act provided.' \n\n[206 U.S. 516, 526]\n\u00a0\n Section 2 provides that upon the petition of the assignee or receiver, or any creditor of the corporation who has filed his claim, the district court shall appoint a time for hearing not less than thirty days nor more than sixty days from the time of filing said petition, and direct notice of the hearing to be given by publication or otherwise, in the discretion of the court; but if the petition be filed by a creditor, other than the assignee or receiver, the court shall direct notice of the hearing to be personally served on the assignee or receiver.\n\n Section 3 provides that the court shall consider the proofs offered by the assignee or receiver, or by any creditor or stockholder who may appear in person or by attorney as to the probable indebtedness of the corporation and the expenses of the assignment or receivership and the probable amount of assets available for the payment of such indebtedness and expenses; also as to what parties are or may be liable as stockholders, and the nature and extent of such liability. And if it shall appear to the satisfaction of such court that the ordinary assets, or such amount as may be realized therefrom in a reasonable time, will not be sufficient to pay the expenses of such assignment or receivership and the indebtedness, and it is necessary to resort to the liability of stockholders, the court shall, by order, direct and levy a ratable assessment upon all parties liable as stockholders, or upon or on account of any stock or shares of such corporation for such amount as the court, in its discretion, may deem proper, taking into account the probable solvency or insolvency of stockholders, and the probable expenses of collecting the assessment, and shall direct the payment of the amount so assessed to the assignee or receiver within such time as the court may specify in said order.\n Section 4 provides for an order to the assignee or receiver to proceed to collect the amount so assessed, unless it be paid within the time specified in the order, and, in default of payment, the receiver is to bring suit.\n Section 5 provides that the assessment levied shall be con- \n\n[206 U.S. 516, 527]\n\u00a0\n clusive upon and against all parties liable upon or on account of any shares of said stock of such corporation, whether appearing or having notice thereof or not, as to all matters relating to the amount of and the necessity for said assessment, which provision shall also apply to any subsequent assessment levied by order of the court.\n Section 6 makes it the duty of the assignee or receiver, upon failure to pay as required by the order, to institute and maintain an action against any party liable upon or on account of any such shares of stock, and that actions may be maintained against each stockholder in Minnesota or in any other state or country where such stockholder or any property subject to attachment, garnishment, or other process may be found, and provides that if the assignee or receiver shall believe ny such stockholder to be insolvent, or that the expense of prosecuting such action will work to the disadvantage of the estate, he shall not be required to prosecute the same, unless specifically directed so to do by the court.\n Section 7 provides for further assessments in case the first proves inadequate.\n Section 8 extends the provisions of the act to such subsequent assessments.\n Section 9 provides where two or more assessments are levied or directed, the assignee or receiver may join the causes of action against any stockholder on two or more such assessments.\n Section 10 provides that if the assignee or receiver fails to institute or prosecute the action, the creditors may petition the court to compel him to proceed under certain conditions.\n Section 11 provides for the return of the surplus, if any remain, in the hands of the assignee or receiver after paying the expenses of the assignment or receivership and the claims of the creditors, and that stockholders who have paid assessments shall, in addition to the remedy provided in the statute, be entitled to enforce contributions from stockholders who have not paid assessments. \n\n[206 U.S. 516, 528]\n\u00a0\n Section 12 provides for additional judgments in case of the inadequacy of former assessments.\n Section 13 excludes certain stockholders in pending actions from the operation of the act.\n This statute came before the supreme court of Minnesota in Straw & E. Mfg. Co. v. L. D. Kilbourne Boot & Shoe Co. 80 Minn. 125, 83 N. W. 36. In that case it was given full consideration and its constitutionality sustained, and it was held that while the assessments upon the outstanding shares of stock in an amount necessary to meet the deficiency in the assets of the corporation was conclusive upon the stockholders as members of the corporation, yet the statute, properly construed, did not have the effect to deprive a person, when sued for the amount assessed on shares of stock under the provisions of the act, from showing that he was not a stockholder, or that he was not the holder of so large an amount of stock as was alleged, or that he had a claim against the corporation which, in law or equity, he might be enabled to set off as against a claim for assessments, or from making any other defense personal to himself; and that the order of assessment was conclusive upon stockholders only in so far as it decided the amount of assets or liabilities of the insolvent corporation and the necessity of making an assessment upon the stock to the extent and in the amount ordered.\n The constitutionality of the act was again affirmed in the same court in the later case of London & N. W. American Mortg. Co. v. St. Paul Park Improv. Co. 84 Minn. 144, 86 N. W. 872.\n The stockholders' liability in Minnesota, as in some other states, has its origin in a constitutional provision, and arises under  3, article 10, of the Constitution of that state. The language is:\n'Liabilities of stockholders.\n\n'Each stockholder in any corporation (excepting those organized for the purpose of carrying on any kind of manufacturing or mechanical business) shall be liable to the amount of stock held or owned by him.' \n\n[206 U.S. 516, 529]\n\u00a0\n The courts of Minnesota have held that a stockholders' liability is, therefore, fixed and measured by the Constitution. Willis v. Mabon (Willis v. St. Paul Sanitation Co.) 48 Minn. 140, 16 L.R.A. 281, 31 Am. St. Rep. 626, 50 N. W. 1110; McKusick v. Seymour, S. & Co. 48 Minn. 158, 50 N. W. 114. It is apparent from a consideration of this constitutional provision that its purpose was to make a stockholder liable to the creditors of the corporation in an amount not exceeding the par value of the stock held by him, and thus secure, for the benefit of such creditors, in addition to the assets and property which the corporation might possess, the liability of those who hold its stock in a sum necessary to make good any deficiency between the amount of the assets and the debts within the limitation stated. It is evident from the general language used in this constitutional provision that while a remedy might have been worked out in the courts of equity in the state, it was proper, if not necessary, that a statute should be passed to make more effectual the liability thus secured by the Constitution.\n\n In pursuance of that power the legislature passed the act of 1894, which remained in force until the passage of the act of 1899.\n The fundamental contention upon which the argument of the plaintiffs in error against the constitutionality of this subsequent act rests is that the statute created a contract into which the stockholder entered upon subscribing to or obtaining his stock, which the legislature had no power to change without running counter to the constitutional requirement invalidating laws impairing the obligation of contracts. Constitution, art. 1,  10.\n It may be regarded as settled that, upon acquiring stock, the stockholder incurred an obligation arising from the constitutional provision, contractual in its nature, and, as such, capable of being enforced in the courts not only of that state, but of another state and of the United States (Whitman v. National Bank, \n176 U.S. 559\n, 44 L. ed. 587, 20 sup. Ct. Rep. 477), although the obligation is not entirely contractual, and springs primarily from the law creating the obligation (Christopher v. Norwell, \n201 U.S. 216\n, 50 L. ed. 732, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 502). \n\n[206 U.S. 516, 530]\n\u00a0\n Is there anything in the obligation of this contract which is impaired by subsequent legislation as to the remedy, enacting new means of making the liability more effectual? The obligation of this contract binds the stockholder to pay to the creditors of the corporation an amount sufficient to pay the debts of the corporation which its assets will not pay, up to an amount equal to the stock held by each shareholder. That is his contract, and the duty which the statute imposes, and that is his obligation. Any statute which took away the benefit of such contract or obligation would be void as to the creditor, and any attempt to increase the obligation beyond that incurred by the stockholder would fall within the prohibition of the Constitution. But there was nothing in the laws of Minnesota undertaking to make effectual the constitutional provision to which we have referred, preventing the legislature from giving additional remedies to make the obligation of the stockholder effectual, so long as his original undertaking was not enlarged. There is a broad distinction between laws impairing the obligation of contracts and those which simply undertake to give a more efficient remedy to enforce a contract already made.\n This principle was stated by Mr. Chief Justice Marshall in Sturges v. Crowninshield, 4 Wheat. 122, 4 L. ed. 529, as follows:\n'The distinction between the obligation of a contract and the remedy given by the legislature to enforce that obligation . . . exists in the nature of things. Without impairing the obligation of the contract, the remedy may certainly be modified as the wisdom of the nation shall direct.'\n\n The same rule is recognized in Hill v. Merchants' Mut. Ins. Co. \n134 U.S. 515\n, 33 L. ed. 994, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 589, wherein a statute was sustained changing the character of the remedy against stockholders in common to one giving a direct remedy against an individual stockholder. The principle was clearly enunciated in Waggoner v. Flack, \n188 U.S. 595\n- 603, 47 L. ed. 609-613, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 345-348, in which Mr. Justice Peckham, speaking for the court, said:\n'To enact laws providing remedies for a violation of con- \n\n[206 U.S. 516, 531]\n\u00a0\n tracts, to alter or enlarge those remedies from time to time as to the legislature may seem appropriate, is an exercise of sovereignty, and it cannot be supposed that the state, in a case like this, contracts in a public act of its legislature to limit its power in the future, even if it could do so, with or without consideration, unless the language of the act is so absolutely plain and unambiguous as to leave no room for doubt thatit  true meaning amounts to a contract by it to part with its power to increase the effectiveness of existing remedies.'\n\n See, also, Wilson v. Standefer, \n184 U.S. 399\n, 46 L. ed. 612, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 384; New Orleans City & Lake R. Co. v. Louisiana, \n157 U.S. 219\n, 39 L. ed. 679, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 581.\n The liability arising under the Constitution of Minnesota was such that legislation was appropriate to make it effectual. We can find nothing in the fact that one legislature has passed an act which would conclude a subsequent law-making body of equal power from passing new and additional measures to make the remedy more effectual. That the first act did not accomplish its purpose is evident. Under it stockholders in another state, who could not be reached by personal service, were immune from liability, and the entire burden was cast upon local stockholders. There was no provision for a receiver or assignee beginning action outside the state, and it was held by this court in Hale v. Allinson, supra, that a chancery receiver was powerless to enforce the rights of creditors beyond the borders of the state. In this condition of affairs the state of Minnesota has undertaken dertaken to provide a proceeding for the to provide a proceeding for the shall ascertain the assets of the corporation, the extent of the indebtedness of the corporation, the amount to which it is necessary, if at all, to call upon the stockholders' liability. It is obviously an act intended to make effectual the liability which is incurred by stockholders under the Constitution of the state, and it ought not to be rendered nugatory unless substantial objection exists against its enforcement. It operates equally upon all stockholders, at home and abroad, and assesses all by a uniform rule. \n\n[206 U.S. 516, 532]\n\u00a0\n We shall proceed to notice some of the specific objections which are urged against the validity of this legislation by stockholders who acquired stock before the act of 1899 went into effect.\n It is said that the stockholder is held liable in a proceeding to which he is not a party. Under the prior act he could only be held where service could be had upon him personally, but, if we are right in the proposition just announced, that additional remedies may be provided by legislation, then the validity of such additional enactments depends not necessarily upon the personal service upon the stockholders, but upon the fact whether the remedy provided is a wellrecognized means of enforcing such obligations, and not in violation of constitutional rights. It is true that the stockholder is not necessarily served with process in the action wherein the assessment is made under the act of 1899, but no personal judgment is rendered against him in that proceeding, and it has reference to a corporation of which he is a member by virtue of his holding stock therein, and the proceeding has for its purpose the liquidation of the affairs of the corporation, the collection and application of its assets and other liabilities which may be administered for the benefit of creditors. In such case it has been frequently held that the representation which a stockholder has by virtue of his membership in the corporation is all that he is entitled to. It was so held in a well-considered case in Massachusetts (Howarth v. Lombard, 175 Mass. 570, 49 L.R.A. 301, 56 N. E. 888). And it has been held in cases in this court that when an assessment is necessary to be made upon unpaid stock subscriptions for the benefit of creditors, the court may make the assessment without the presence or personal service of stockholders. Hawkins v. Glenn, \n131 U.S. 319\n, 33 L. ed. 184, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 739; Great Western Teleg. Co. v. Purdy, \n162 \nU.S. 329, 336\n, 40 S. L. ed. 986, 990, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 810.\n Nor can we see any substantial difference in this respect between a liability to be ascertained for the benefit of creditors upon a stock subscription and the liability for the same purpose which is entailed by becoming a member of a corporation \n\n[206 U.S. 516, 533]\n\u00a0\n through the purchase f stock, whereby a contract is implied in favor of creditors. The object of the enforcement of both liabilities is for the benefit of creditors, and while it is true that one promise is directly to the corporation and the other does not belong to the corporation, but is for the benefit of its creditors, either liability may be enforced through a receiver acting for the benefit of creditors, under the orders of a court in winding up the corporation in case of its insolvency.\n It is sought to distinguish between the Massachusetts case of Howarth v. Lombard, supra, and kindred cases, and the one at bar, in the fact that when the stock was acquired in that case a statutory provision was already in existence which made the stockholder liable to an assessment in a proceeding in which the stockholder was represented by the corporation. But, as we have said, keeping within the constitutional measure of liability, it was within the power of the legislature of Minnesota to make provisions, within the limits of due process of law, for the liquidation of the affairs of the corporation in a proceeding in the state of its origin, wherein members of the corporation should be sufficiently represented by the presence of the corporation itself. This practice has the sanction of the courts, as we have already shown. It is substantially the procedure authorized by the national banking act, except that the Comptroller of the Currency takes the place of the court, and, without the presence of the stockholders, makes a conclusive assessment. We cannot find any constitutional right belonging to the stockholder which is violated by this change in the character and nature of the remedy against him.\n By becoming a member of a Minnesota corporation, and assuming the liability attaching to such membership, he became subject to such regulations as the state might lawfully make to render the liability effectual.\n It is further urged that in imposing upon the stockholder the additional expense in a proceeding where the expenses incident to the enforcement of the liability in other states, \n\n[206 U.S. 516, 534]\n\u00a0\n and against other parties, are taken into consideration and included in the estimate, there is an unwarranted increase in the amount which could be recovered against the stockholder under the former statute. But remembering at all times that the obligation of the shareholder was the creature of the Constitution of Minnesota, we think the fact that the additional expenses were included in the assessment cannot operate to defeat it. Such expenses are incident to the ascertainment of the trust fund, which it is necessary to realize from the liability of stockholders, and as long as these expenses are kept within the amount of the original liability no legal right is violated. League v. Texas, \n184 U.S. 156\n, 46 L. ed. 478, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 475; Richmond v. Irons, \n121 U.S. 27\n, 30 L. ed. 864, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 788; King v. Pomeroy, 58 C. C. A. 209, 121 Fed. 287.\n It is objected that the receiver cannot bring this action, and Booth v. Clark, 17 How. 322, 15 L. ed. 164; Hale v. Allinson, \n188 U.S. 56\n, 47 L. ed. 380, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 244; and Great Western Min. & Mfg. Co. v. Harris, \n198 U.S. 561\n, 49 L. ed. 1163, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 770, are cited and relied upon. But in each and all of these cases it was held that a chancery receiver, having no other authority than that which would arise from his appointment as such, could not maintain an action in another jurisdiction. In this case the statute confers the right upon the receiver, as a quasi assignee, and representative of the creditors, and, as such, vested with the authority to maintain an action. In such case we think the receiver may sue in a foreign jurisdiction. Relfe v. Rundle (Life Asso. of America v. Rundle) \n103 \nU.S. 222, 226\n, 26 S. L. ed. 337, 339; Howarth v. Lombard, supra; Howarth v. Angle, 162 N. Y. 179, 182, 47 L.R.A. 725, 56 N. E. 489.\n It is also contended that the action is barred by the statute of the state of New York, limiting to two years the right to brng an action for a debt of a corporation after the defendant ceased to be a stockholder. We do not think the provision of the statute (N. Y. Laws, 1892, chap. 688,  55) relied upon covers these cases. It evidently refers to domestic corporations provided for in reference to the stockholder's liability created by the preceding section of the same chapter. The cause of action did not accrue until the receiver could sue \n\n[206 U.S. 516, 535]\n\u00a0\n upon the assessment after the stockholder had failed to pay, as required by the order of the Minnesota court of December 22, 1902. King v. Pomeroy, supra. Under the New York statute of limitations there was six years in which to bring the action after it accrued, under  382 of the Code, the Minnesota Thresher Manufacturing Company not being a 'moneyed corporation or banking association' within  394. Platt v. Wilmot, \n193 U.S. 603\n, 48 L. ed. 809, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 542.\n The present suits were brought a little more than one year after the causes of action accrued.\n Other objections are urged as to the nature of the proceedings in the court of Washington county, Minnesota, in which the original order was made. We have examined them and think none of them go to the jurisdiction and authority of the court, or are such as would invalidate the order of assessment made therein when sued upon in another jurisdiction.\n In what we have said we have noticed the principal objections made to the enforcement of the order of the Minnesota court in another jurisdiction, and, finding no error in the judgment of the court below, it is affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes:\n I regret that the court has thought it unnecessary to state specifically what contract the stockholder is supposed to have made, as different difficulties beset the different views that might be taken. It seems to me hard to reconcile the construction adopted with that given to the stronger words of  5151 of the national bank act (U. S. Rev. Stat.  5151, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3465) in McClaine v. Rankin, \n197 \nU.S. 154, 161\n, 49 S. L. ed. 702, 705, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 410. But, under the circumstances, I shall say no more than that I doubt the result. \n\n\n\n","21":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBIERCE v. HUTCHINS(1907)\nNo. 212\nArgued: Decided: April 8, 1907\n\n\n\n Messrs. Charles H. Aldrich, Henry S. McAuley, and Henry W. Prouty for appellant.\n\n\n[205 U.S. 340, 342]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. David L.

Hecht v. Boughton, \n105 U.S. 235\n, 26 L. ed. 1018. The facts were found by the trial court and certain conclusions of law were stated, which the supreme court of the territory held to be wrong. It sustained the exceptions upon one point which went to the root of the plaintiff's cause of action, and, upon the plaintiff's motion coupled with a statement that it would have no further evidence to present at a second trial, ordered a judgment for the defendant, in order that the case might be brought to this court. The findings of fact were taken to be true by the supreme court, and are not open to dispute, except so far as they depend upon rulings of law, so that the questions for decision here are definite and plain, and there is no need to send the case back for a statement of facts by the supreme court, although one should have been made. Stringfellow v. Cain, \n99 U.S. 610\n, 25 L. ed. 421; Harrison v. Perea, \n168 \nU.S. 311, 323\n, 42 S. L. ed. 478, 482, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 129.\n The suit was replevin for certain rails, cars, engines, and goods, delivered by the appellant to the Kona Sugar Company, Limited, and sold by a receiver of that company to the appellee with full notice of the appellant's claim. Originally there was a contract for the sale of this property for cash, but the Kona Company having failed to pay, the appellant offered certain 'terms in setlement of the contract' previously made, as follows: 'We will take in settlement of this contract the sum of $ 10,000, U. S. gold coin, and the promissory note of the Kona Sugar Company, Limited, for the sum of $37,044.53, in favor of William W. Bierce, Limited, payable six months after date at the Whitney National Bank in New Orleans bearing interest at the rate of seven and onehalf per cent (7 1\/2 per cent) per annum, and secured by first-mortgage bonds of the Kona Sugar Company, Limited, of par value equal to the note, said bonds being portion of a duly authorized issue not exceeding $200,000. This offer is conditioned upon its acceptance by you, payment of the money, and the delivery of the note, with collateral, before 4 P. M. on Thursday, March 14th, A. D. 1901. Upon such payment being made to us before \n\n[205 U.S. 340, 345]\n\u00a0\n the hour named, we will deliver to you the bills of sale authorizing you to take charge of the rails, locomotives, cars, scales, and other materials now awaiting delivery, upon the express condition and understanding that said rails, locomotives, cars, scales, and other materials are and shall remain the property of William W. Bierce, Limited, until the full payment of the note above described, according to its terms.' This offer was accepted, this contract took the place of that previously made, and the property was delivered.\n For purposes of decision the supreme court assumed that, under the foregoing instrument, the passing of title was subject to a condition precedent, but intimated that the majority of the court thought otherwise, if it had been necessary to decide the point. It was not necessary because the court was of opinion that, if there was such a condition, it was lost by what was considered an election on the plaintiff's part. The court below had found that there was no election, and therefore the question was and is whether the acts done by the appellant constituted one as matter of law. If not, then it must be considered whether the sale was on a condition precedent, and those are the two questions of law in the case.\n The facts are simple. After the last contract was made the Kona Company got into trouble and a receiver was appointed. The appellant thereupon filed a claim of lien upon the railroad supposed to belong to the Kona Company, for materials used in the construction and equipment of the road, the materials referred to being the property in question. On or about August 1, 1902, it brought a suit to enforce this lien, and in November of the same year filed a petition in the Kona Company proceedings, asking that a decree already made for the sale of all the Kona Company's property should be modified so as to except all liens from the operation of the sale. Only a part of the property was used in the construction of the road, and, under any circumstances, the claim of a lien would have been bad. The lien suit was dismissed, before, anything had been done in it, in January, 1903. On February 13 the ap- \n\n[205 U.S. 340, 346]\n\u00a0\n pellant, by leave of court, filed a petition in the Kona Company proceedings for an order that the receiver either should pay the amount due upon its note or deliver the property, setting up the contract and alleging that it title to the property still remained. The abortive lien proceedings constitute the election that is supposed to have brought the appellant's title to an end. We have not gone into further particulars because there can be no doubt that to claim a lien upon anything is inconsistent with asserting a title to it, and may be assumed to be sufficient to manifest an election if one is possible. The appellant's allegations in its first petition could give no additional strength to its choice.\n Election is simply what its name imports; a choice, shown by an overt act, between two inconsistent rights, either of which may be asserted at the will of the chooser alone. Thus, 'if a man maketh a lease, rendering a rent or a robe, the lessee shall have the election.' Co. Litt. 145a. So a man may ratify or repudiate an unauthorized act done in his name. Metcalf v. Williams, 144 Mass. 452, 454, 11 N. E. 700. He may take the goods or the price when he has been induced by fraud to sell. Dickson v. Patterson, \n160 U.S. 584\n, 40 L. ed. 543, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 373. He may keep in force or may avoid a contract after the breach of a condition in his favor. Oakes v. Manufacturers' F. & M. Ins. Co. 135 Mass. 248, 249. In all such cases the characteristic fact is that one party has a choice independent of the assent of anyone else. But if a man owns property he has no election to transfer it to another. He cannot make the transfer unless the other assents. And equally, if he owns property subject to be devested by the performance of a condition, he has no election to devest it without performance. The other party must assent. Transfer is very different from election, and requires acts of a different import on the part of the owner, and corresponding acts on the part of the transferee.\n In the case at bar there is no pretense that the appellant's conduct purported to convey the property to the Kona Company in advance of the performance of the stipulated condi- \n\n[205 U.S. 340, 347]\n\u00a0\n tions. The case stands on election alone, and the appellant had no right to elect in the sense of the argument. It could not obliterate the condition and leave the contract in force. It may be that it had an election to avoid the contract altogether, but, if so, it did not attempt to do it. It insisted on the contract as the ground of its claim to a lien for the price of the goods. The election supposed and relied upon is an election to keep the contract in force, but to leave out the reservation of title. It must be kept in mind that the effect attributed to the assertion of the lien is attributed to it as strictly unilateral act, not as an offer to which an assent might be presumed. As such an act the appellant could not give it the supposed effect. It is quite true, as we have said, that the assertion of a lien is inconsistent with the assertion of a title (Van Winkle v. Crowell, \n146 U.S. 42\n, 36 L. ed. 880, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 18), and, therefore, if a lien had been established by judgment or decree, the title would be gone by force of an adjudication inconsistent with its continuance. But the assertion of a lien by one who has title, so long as it is only an assertion, and nothing more, is merely a mistake. It does not purport to be a choice, and it cannot be one, because the party has no right to choose. The claim in the lien suit, as was said in a recent case, was not an election, but an hypothesis. Northern Assur. Co. v. Grand View Bldg. Asso. \n203 \nU.S. 106, 108\n, 51 S. L. ed. 109, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 27. The fact that a party, through mistake, attempts to exercise a right to which he is not entitled, does not prevent his afterwards exercising one which he had and still has unless barred by the previous attempt. Snow v. Alley, 156 Mass. 193, 195, 30 N. E. 691.\n There remains the question whether the sale was conditional. Such sales sometimes are regulated by statute and put more or less on the footing of mortgages. With the development of its effects there has been some reaction against the Benthamite doctrine of absolute freedom of contract. But courts are not legislatures, and are not at liberty to invent and apply specific regulations according to their notions of convenience. In the absence of a statute their only duty is to discover the \n\n[205 U.S. 340, 348]\n\u00a0\n meaning of the contract and to enforce it, without a leaning in either direction, when, as in the present case, the parties stood on an equal footing and were free to do what they chose.\n The contract says in terms that it is conditional, and that the goods are to remain the property of the seller until payment of the note given for the price. This stipulation is perfectly lawful. Harkness v. Russell, \n118 U.S. 663\n, 30 L. ed. 285, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 51. So that the only question is whether any other provision of the contract is inconsistent with this one, or qualifies and explains it as intended to do less than it purports to do when taken alone. Chicago R. Equipment Co. v. Merchants' Nat. Bank, \n136 U.S. 268\n, 34 L. ed. 349, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 999. The fact that possession was to be and was delivered, and that it must have been contemplated that the rails would be put down upon a roadway no boubt assumed, it seems, wrongly, to belong to the Kona Company, had no such effect, as between vendor and vendee. Neither did the requirement of additional security in the form of first-mortgage bonds of the company. It may have been expected that the mortgage would embrace a part or the whole of this property, but there is nothing more common than a provision in a mortgage that it shall apply to and embrace after-acquired property, with sufficient description to ascertain the same and dring it within the mortgage when acquired. And if the mortgage would have been operative at once by way of estoppel in favor of third persons, there was the more reason for exacting an interest under, it to save the vendor's rights in that event. Of course, the absolute liability for the price, and putting that liability in the form of a note, are consistent with the retention of title until the note is paid. Parties can agree to pay the value of goods upon what consideration they please (White v. Solomon, 164 Mass. 516, 30 L. R.A. 537, 42 N. E. 104), and when a purchaser has possession and the right to gain the title by payment, he cannot complain of a bargain by which he binds himself to pay and is not to get the title until he does.\n It was suggested that the ratification of the contract by the Kona Company did not mention the condition. But it got \n\n[205 U.S. 340, 349]\n\u00a0\n its rights from the contract, and, of course, got only such rights as the contract gave. Some other subordinate suggestions were made, but we have disposed of the only questions that are open here.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","22":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBITTERMAN v. LOUISVILLE & N. R. CO.(1907)\nNo. 34\nArgued: November 4, 1907Decided: December 2, 1907\n\n\n\n\n[207 U.S. 205, 206]\n\u00a0\n Upon a bill filed on behalf of the Louisville & Nashville Railroad Company, the circuit court of the United States for the eastern district of Louisiana entered a decree perpetually enjoining the petitioners herein and four other ticket brokers, engaged in business in the city of New Orleans, from dealing in nontransferable round-trip tickets issued at reduced rates for passage over the lines of railway of the complainant on account of the United Confederate Veterans' Reunion and the Mardi-Gras celebration held in the city of New Orleans in the \n\n[207 U.S. 205, 207]\n\u00a0\n years 1903 and 1904, respectively. On an appeal prosecuted by the railroad company, complaining of the limited relief awarded, the circuit court of appeals held that the defendants should also be enjoined generally from dealing in nontransferable round-trip reduced-rate tickets whenever issued by the complainant, and ordered the cause to be remanded to the circuit court with directions to enter a decree in accordance with the views expressed in the opinion. (75 C. C. A. 192, 144 Fed. 34.) A writ of certiorari was thereupon allowed.\n We summarize the averments of the complaint and answer. It was averred in the bill that complainant was a Kentucky corporation, operating about 3,000 miles of railway for the carriage of passengers, baggage, mail, express, and freight, its lines of road extending from New Orleans through various states, and making connections by which it reached all railroad stations in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The seven persons named as defendants were averred to be citizens and residents of Louisiana, each engaged in the city of New Orleans as a ticket broker or scalper in the business of buying and selling the unused return portions of railroad passenger tickets, especially excursion or special-rate tickets issued on occasions of fairs, expositions, conventions, and the like. It was further averred that the defendants were joined in the bill, 'because their business and transactions complained of are in act, purpose, and effect identical, and in order to prevent a multiplicity of suits, the same relief being sought as to each and all of them.'\n Six articles or paragraphs of the bill related to an approaching reunion of United Confederate Veterans to be held in the city of New Orleans, which it was expected would necessitate the transportation by the railroads entering New Orleans of 100,000 visitors, one fourth of which number would pass over the lines of railway of the complainant. A necessity was alleged to exist for special reduced rates of fare to secure a large attendance at such reunion, and it was averred that a rate of 1 cent a mile, one-third the regular rate, had \n\n[207 U.S. 205, 208]\n\u00a0\n been agreed upon for nontransferable round-trip, Reduced-rate tickets which were to be issued for the occasion, and it was stated 'that among the conditions on the face of said ticket, which ticket contract is signed by the original purchaser and the company, is one that said ticket is nontransferable, and, if prsented by any other than the original purchaser, who is required to sign the same at date of purchase, it will not be honored, but will be forfeited, and any agent or conductor of any of the lines over which it reads shall have the right to take up and cancel the entire ticket.' And for various alleged reasons, based mainly upon the large number of expected purchasers, it was averred that the return portion of each ticket was not required to be signed by the original purchaser or presented to an agent of the complainant in the city of New Orleans for the purpose of the identifications of the holder as the purchaser of the ticket.\n It was averred that each defendant was accustomed to buy and sell the return coupons of nontransferable tickets, for the express purpose, and no other, of putting them in the hands of purchasers, to be fraudulently used for passage on the trains of complainant, and it was further averred that the defendants intended in like manner to fraudulently deal in the return portion of the tickets about to be issued for the reunion in question, and that complainant would sustain irreparable injury, for which it would have no adequate remedy at law, unless it was protected from such wrongful acts. It was further averred that unless relief was given the complainant would be compelled to abandon the making of reduced rates for conventions or other assemblies to be held in the city of New Orleans. Averments were also made as to the additional burden which would be cast upon complainant's conductors and train collectors by reason of the practice complained of, the danger which would arise of a multiplicity of suits for damages by reason of errors of such employees in endeavoring to prevent the fraudulent use of such tickets, and it was averred that it would be impossible, in many in- \n\n[207 U.S. 205, 209]\n\u00a0\n stances, to discover the persons who were wrongfully traveling upon the tickets and who were bound to pay the lawful and reasonable one-way rate for their transportation. The impossibility of securing evidence establishing the facts as to said fraud, the necessity, if such evidence could be obtained, of bringing a multiplicity of suits if a remedy at law was availed of, and the impracticability of estimating in dollars and cents the injury to its business, was set forth as making the remedy at law inadequate, and in addition it was charged that the defendants were financially irresponsible. The existence was also averred of various ticket brokers' associations, the members of which acted in concert. It was averred that a large part of the stock in trade of all ticket brokers and scalpers was the disposal of nontransferable railroad tickets, and it was further averred that ticket brokers and scalpers usually sought to avoid injunctions prohibiting the dealing in such tickets by assigning their business to some other ticket broker not named in the order, and it was averred that, in order to afford complete and effective relief, 'the restraining injunctive orders should be broad enough to include all who knowingly do what the order of court prohibits defendants from doing, or who aid or abet defendants in violating the injunction or in defeating the objects and purposes thereof.' Finally, it was alleged that the amount involved in the controversy exceeded, exclusive of interest and costs, the sum of $5,000, and that the value of the business which was sought to be protected, and the rights which the complainant asked to have recognized and enforced, exceeded, in the case of each defendant, the sum of $5,000, exclusive of interest and costs.\n In addition to asking a temporary restraining order the bill prayed that defendants, their agents, etc., 'and all other persons whomsoever, though not named herein, from and after the time when they severally have knowledge of the entry of the restraining order and the existence of the injunction herein,' should be perpetually enjoined 'from buying, selling, dealing \n\n[207 U.S. 205, 210]\n\u00a0\n in, or solicting the purchase or sale of, any ticket or tickets or the return coupons or unused portions thereof issued by orator or by any other railroad company for use over orator's lines of railway or any part of them, which, by the terms thereof, are nontransferable, or from soliciting, advertising, encouraging, or procuring any person other than the original purchaser of such tickets, to use or attempt to use said tickets for passage on any train or trains of orator, especially including the nontransferable round-trip tickets issued for use on the occasion of the United Confederate Veterans' Reunion at New Orleans in May, 1903.'\n Of the seven persons made defendants, three only appeared and answered, viz., Marcus K. Bitterman, Julius Mehlig, and Charles T. Kelsko, the petitioners in this court, on whose behalf a joint and several answer was filed.\n The averments of the bill in respect to the citizenship of the complainant and the character and extent of its railway business was admitted. It was also admitted that the answering defendants were citizens and residents of Louisiana, but it was averred that they were each separately engaged in the ticket brokerage business, duly licensed to conduct such business by the state of Louisiana and the city of New Orleans, and it was expressly denied that the business operations and transactions of all the defendants named in the bill were in act, purpose, and effect identical. So also the answer admitted the averments of the bill in respect to the proposed reunion, the large attendance expected, the issue of reduced-rate, nontransferable tickets, and the necessity therefor, and the impracticability of requiring the signing of the return portion of each ticket by the purchaser.\n It was admitted in the answer that the tickets usually issued by complainant and its connections when making reduced rates as to excusion tickets purported to be nontransferable and upon condition that, if presented by other than the original purchaser, who was supposed to sign the same at the date of purchase, it would not be honored, but would be forfeited, and \n\n[207 U.S. 205, 211]\n\u00a0\n that any agent or conductor should have the right to take up and cancel such ticket if presented for passage. In various paragraphs these restrictions or conditions were assailed as impracticable, unenforceable, and unlawful, and without consideration, and it was averred that the conditions were never enforced, and that the tickets were issued and bought with that understanding, and that no damage was caused to complainant by a person other than the original purchaser of a nontransferable reduced-rate ticket, traveling upon the return portion of such ticket, and that no loss or damage could be caused complainant by reason of the expected dealing by defendants in the reunion tickets referred to in the bill.\n It was not only admitted in the answer that the answering defendants had in the past dealt in nontransferable railroad tickets issued by the complainant, but it was expressly declared to be their intention to continue the practice, particularly in respect to the tickets issued on account of the approaching reunion, and coupled with such averment it was asserted that no fraud would be committed or was intended in respect to the dealing in such tickets. We insert in the margin, portions of the answer relating to such admissions. \n\n[207 U.S. 205, 212]\n\u00a0\n It was denied that the answering defendants were insolvent, but, on the contrary, it was averred that each was able to pay any judgment for damages which might be recovered against him. Denial was made of the allegation of the bill that the \n\n[207 U.S. 205, 213]\n\u00a0\n willingness or ability of the complainant to continue issuing special-rate tickets would be affected by the failure to obtain the relief sought by the bill, and, in the main, the averments of the article of the bill relating to various ticket brokers' associations were also denied.\n As a distinct ground for denying the relief prayed, it was alleged in various forms that the issue of the proposed nontransferable tickets was the result of an unlawful confederation or combination between the various railroads whose roads entered into the city of New Orleans.\n Upon the bill and answer a preliminary injunction was issued, restraining the dealing in nontransferable tickets issued for the approaching United Confederate Veterans' Reunion. Replication was duly filed to the answer. Subsequently, upon depositions taken in the cause, and upon affidavits showing the character of nontransferable tickets proposed to be issued \n\n[207 U.S. 205, 214]\n\u00a0\n for an approaching Mardi Gras festival, a further injunction pendente lite was granted as to dealings in the nontransferable reduced-rate, round-trip tickets issued for use on the occasion of the aforesaid Mardi Gras festival.\n Thereafter a demurrer was filed to the bill for want of equity and because the case made by the bill was a moot, and not a real, controversy, and it was overruled. Then an application was made for leave to file a plea to the jurisdiction, which was refused.\n At the hearing the complaint introduced the depositions of two witnesses and no evidence was given on behalf of the defendants. As before stated, the circuit court entered a final decree perpetually enjoining the dealing in nontransferable reduced-rate, round-trip tickets issued for the United Confederate Veterans' Reunion and the Mardi Gras festivals, and denying relief as to future issues of tickets of a like character.\n On appeal and cross appeal the circuit court of appeals held that the complainant was entitled to the full relief prayed in the bill, and consequently to an injunction restraining the dealing by the defendants not only in the tickets issued for the United Confederate Veterans' Reunion and the past Mardi Gras festival, but from carrying on the business of like dealing in nontransferable reduced-rate tickets which might be issued in the future by the complainant, and the circuit court was directed to decree accordingly.\n Messrs. Louis Marshall, Henry L Lazarus, and Moritz Rosenthal for petitioners.\n\n\n[207 U.S. 205, 217]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Joseph Paxton Blair, Brode B. Davis, and George Denegre for respondent.\n\n\n[207 U.S. 205, 219]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice White, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The points urged at bar on behalf of the petitioners as establishing that the decrees below should be reversed and the bill of complaint dismissed, and, in any event, the injunction be modified and restricted, are the following:\n'1. The bill of complaint does not state a cause of action, either at law or in equity, against any of the defendants, even though the tickets in which they dealt are in form nontransferable, when the original purchasers disposed of them in breach of their contract with the complainant.\n\n'2. The complainant has shown no sufficient ground for equitable intervention, since, assuming, but not admitting, that the acts charged against the defendants are wrongful, tortious, or even fraudulent, it has a plain, adequate, and complete remedy at law to redress such wrongs. \n\n[207 U.S. 205, 220]\n\u00a0\n\n'3. There was an improder joinder of defendants and of independent causes of action. The bill is multifarious and the case does not fall within the rule concerning the avoidance of a multiplicity of suits.\n\n\n'4. The circuit court was without jurisdiction, notwithstanding the colorable averments contained in the bill that the injury sustained in consequence of the defendants' act exceeded $2,000, there being no foundation in fact in support of such averment.\n\n'5. The decree of injunction awarded by the circuit court of appeals, so far as it relates to nontransferable tickets that may be hereafter issued, is in effect the exercise of legislative, as distinct from judicial, power, since it undertakes to promulgate a rule applicable to conditions and circumstances which have not yet arisen, and to prohibit the petitioners from dealing in tickets not in esse, and not even in contemplation, and is, therefore, violative of the most fundamental principle of our government.'\n\n Stated in logical sequence and reduced to their essence, these propositions assert:\n First, want of jurisdiction from the insufficiency of the amount involved, want of power in a court of equity to grant relief because, on the face of the bill, relief at law was adequate, and because equitable relief was improper on account of misjoinder of parties and causes of action.\n Second, because the case as made did not entitle to relief, since it did not show the commission of any legal wrong by the defendants.\n Third, because, conceding the right to relief, the remedy by injunction which the court accorded was so broad as, in effect, to amount to the exertion of legislative, as distinct from judicial, power, and hence was equivalent to the denial of due process of law.\n As, for reasons hereafter to be stated, we think the contentions embodied in the first proposition as to want of jurisdiction, etc., are without merit, we come at once to the funda- \n\n[207 U.S. 205, 221]\n\u00a0\n mental question involved in the second proposition; that is, the absence of averment or proof as to the commission of a legal wrong by the defendants.\n That the complainant had the lawful right to sell nontransferable tickets of the character alleged in the bill at reduced rates we think is not open to controversy, and that the condition of nontransferability and forfeiture embodied in such tickets was not only binding upon the original purchaser, but upon anyone who acquired such a ticket and attempted to use the same in violation of its terms, is also settled. Mosher v. St. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. \n127 U.S. 390\n, 32 L. ed. 249, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1324. See also Boylan v. Hot Springs R. Co. \n132 U.S. 146\n, 33 L. ed. 290, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 50.\n Ture, these cases were decided before the passage oF THE ACT TO regulate commerce, but the power of carriers engaged in interstate commerce to issue nontransferable reducedrate excursion tickets was expressly recognized by that act, and the operation and binding effect of the nontransferable clause in such tickets upon all third persons acquiring the same and attempting to use them, and the duty of the carrier in such case to use due diligence to enforce a forfeiture, results from the context of the act. Thus, by  22, it was provided 'that nothing in this act shall apply to . . . the issuance of mileage, excursion, or commutation passenger tickets.' [24 Stat. at L. 387, chap. 104, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3170.] And it is to be observed that, despite the frequent changes in the act, including the comprehensive amendments embodied in the act of June 29, 1906 (34 Stat. at L. 584, chap. 3591, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1907, p. 892), the provision in question remains in force, although the Interstate Commerce Commission, charged with the administrative enforcement of the act, has directed the attention of Congress to the importance of defining the scope of such tickets in view of the abuses which might arise from the exercise of the right to issue them. (2 Inters. Com. Rep. 340.) And, when the restrictions embodied in the act concerning equality of rates and the prohibitions against preferences are borne in mind, the conclusion cannot be escaped that the right to issue tickets of the class referred to carried with it the duty on the \n\n[207 U.S. 205, 222]\n\u00a0\n carrier of exercising due diligence to prevent the use of such tickets by other than the original purchasers, and therefore caused the nontransferable clause to be operative and effective against anyone who wrongfully might attempt to use such tickets. Any other view would cause the act to destroy itself; since it would necessarily imply that the recognition of the power to issue reduced-rate excursion tickets conveyed with it the right to disregard the prohibitions against preferences which it was one of the great purposes of the act to render efficacious. This must follow, since, if the return portion of the round-trip ticket be used by one not entitled to the ticket, and who otherwise would have had to pay the full one-way fare, the person so successfully traveling on the ticket would not only defraud the carrier, but effectually enjoy a preference over similar one-way travelers who had paid their full fare, and who were unwilling to be participants in a fraud upon the railroad company.\n Any third person acquiring a nontransferable reduced-rate railroad ticket from the original purchaser, being therefore bound by the clause forbidding transfer, and the ticket in the hands of all such persons being subject to forfeiture on an attempt being made to use the same for passage, it may well be questioned whether the purchaser of such ticket acquired anything more than a limited and qualified ownership thereof, and whether the carrier did not, for the purpose of enforcing the forfeiture, retain a subordinate interest in the ticket, amounting to a right of property therein, which a court of equity would protect. Board of Trade v. Christie Grain & Stock Co. \n198 U.S. 236\n, 49 L. ed. 1031, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 637, and authorities there cited. See also Sperry & H. Co. v. Mechanics' Clothing Co. 128 Fed. 800. We pass this question, however, because the want of merit in the contention that the case as made did not disclose the commission of a legal wrong conclusively results from a previous decision of this court. The case is Angle v. chicago, St. P. M. & O. R. Co. \n151 U.S. 1\n, 38 L. ed. 55, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 240, where it was held that an actionable wrong is committed by one 'who maliciously \n\n[207 U.S. 205, 223]\n\u00a0\n interferes in a contract between two parties and induces one of them to break that contract to the injury of the other.' That this principle embraces a case like the present, that is, the carrying on of the business of purchasing and selling nontransferable reduced-rate railroad tickets for profit, to the injury of the railroad company issuing such tickets, is, we think, clear. It is not necessary that the ingredient of actual malice, in the sense of personal ill will, should exist to bring this controversy within the doctrine of the Angle Case. The wanton disregard of the rights of a carrier, causing injury to it, which the business of purchasing and selling nontransferable reduced-rate tickets of necessity involved, constitute legal malice within the doctrine of the Angle Case. We deem it unnecessary to restate the grounds upon which the ruling in the Angle Case was rested, or to trace the evolution of the principle in that case announced, because of the consideration given to the subject in the Angle Case and the full reference to the authorities which was made in the opinion in that case.\n Certain is it that the doctrine of the Angle Case has been frequently applied in cases which involved the identical question here at issue,-that is, whether a legal wrong was committed by the dealing in nontransferable reduced-rate railroad excursion ticket. Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Beekman, 30 Wash. L. Rep. 715; Illinois C. R. Co. v. Caffrey, 128 Fed. 770; Delaware, L. & W. R. Co. v. Frank, 110 Fed. 689; Nashville, C. & St. L. R. Co. v. McConnell, 82 Fed. 65.\n Indeed, it is shown by decisions of various state courts of last resort that the wrong occasioned by the dealing in nontransferable reduced- rate railroad tickets has been deemed to be so serious as to call for express legislative prohibition correcting the evil. Kinner v. Lake Shore & M. S. R. Co. 69 Ohio St. 339, 69 N. E. 614; Schubach v. McDonald, 179 Mo. 163, 65 L. R. A. 136, 101 Am. St. Rep. 452, 78 S. W. 1020, and cases cited; Samuelson v. State, 116 Tenn. 470, 115 Am. St. Rep. 805, 95 S. W. 1012. In the case last referred to, where the subject is elaborately reviewed, the supreme court of Tennessee, in holding that the \n\n[207 U.S. 205, 224]\n\u00a0\n prohibitive statute was not unconstitutional as forbidding a lawful business, and in affirming a criminal conviction for violating the statute, observed:\n'That the sale as well as the purchase of nontransferable passage tickets is a fraud upon the carrier and the public, the tendency of which is the demoralization of rates, has been settled by the general concensus of opinion among the courts.'\n\n Concluding, as we do, that the commission of a legal wrong by the defendants was disclosed by the case as made, we are brought to consider the several contentions concerning the jurisdiction of the court and its right to afford relief. The bill contained an express averment that the amount involved in the controversy exceeded, exclusive of interest and costs, the sum of $5,000 as to each defendant. The defendants not having formally pleaded to the jurisdiction, it was not incumbent upon the complainant to offer proof in support of the averment. Nevertheless, the complainant introduced testimony tending to show that, on the New Orleans division of its road, a loss of from fifteen to eighteen thousand dollars a year was sustained through the practice by dealers of wrongfully purchasing and selling nontransferable tickets. That hundreds of the tickets annually issued for the Mardi Gras festivals in New Orleans were wrongfully bought and sold; that other nontransferable reduced-rate tickets were, in a like manner, illegally trafficked in to the great damage of the corporation, and that the defendants were the persons principally engaged in conducting such wrongful dealings. But, even if this proof be put out of view, we think the contention that a consideration of the whole bill establishes that the jurisdictional amount alleged was merely colorable and fictitious is without merit. We say this because the averments of the bill as to the number of such tickets issued, the recurring occasions for their issue, the magnitude of the wrongful dealings in the nontransferable tickets by the defendants, the cost and the risk incurred by the steps necessary to prevent their wrongful use, the injurious effect upon the revenue of the complainant, the \n\n[207 U.S. 205, 225]\n\u00a0\n operation of the illegal dealing in such tickets upon the right of the complainant to issue them in the future, coupled with the admissions of the answer, sustain the express averment as to the requisite jurisdictional amount. Besides, the substantial character of the jurisdictional averment in the bill is to be tested, not by the mere immediate pecuniary damage resulting from the acts complained of, but by the value of the business to be protected and the rights of property which the complainant sought to have recognized and enforced. Hunt v. New York Cotton Exchange, \n205 \nU.S. 322, 336\n, 51 S. L. ed. 821, 826, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 529.\n The contention that, though it be admitted, for the sake of the argument, that the acts charged against the defendant 'were wrongful, tortious, or even fraudulent,' there was no right to resort to equity, because there was a complete and adequate remedy at law to redress the threatened wrongs when committed, is, we think, also devoid of merit. From the nature and character of the nontransferable tickets, the number of people to whom they were issued, the dealings of the defendants therein and their avowed purpose to continue such dealings in the future, the risk to result from mistakes in enforcing the forfeiture provision, and the multiplicity of suits necessarily to be engendered if redress was sought at law,-all establish the inadequacy of a legal remedy and the necessity for the intervention of equity. Indeed, the want of foundation for the contention to the contrary is shown by the opinions in the cases which we have previously cited in considering whether a legal wrong resulted from acts of the character complained of, since, in those cases, it was expressly held that the consequences of the legal wrong flowing from the dealing in nontransferable tickets were of such a character as to entitle an injured complainant to redress in a court of equity.\n There is an opinion of the supreme court of New York (not the court of last resort) which would seem to express contrary views (New York C. & H. R. R. Co. v. Reeves, 41 Misc. 490, 85 N. Y. Supp. 28), but the reasoning there relied on, in our opinion, is inconclusive. \n\n[207 U.S. 205, 226]\n\u00a0\n The proposition that the bill was multifarious because of the misjoinder of parties and causes of action was not assigned as error in the circuit court of appeals, and, therefore, might well be held not to be open. But, passing that view, we hold the objection to be untenable. The acts complained of as to each defendant were of a like character, their operation and effect upon the rights of the complainant were identical, the relief sought against each defendant was the same, and the defenses which might be interposed were common to each defendant and involved like legal questions. Under these Conditions the case is brought within the principle laid down in Hale v. Allinson, \n188 \nU.S. 56, 77\n, 47 S. L. ed. 380, 392, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 244.\n As we have stated, the circuit court granted a preliminary injunction, restraining the defendants from illegally dealing in tickets issued on account of the United Confederate Veterans' Reunion, and, before final hearing, granted a second injunction, restraining such dealing in like tickets issued for the approaching Mardi Gras festival. By the final decree these injunctions were perpetuated, the court declining to grant the relief sought by the complainant in relation to nontransferable tickets to be issued for the future, without prejudice, however, to the right of the complainant to seek relief by independent proceedings on each occasion when it might issue such nontransferable tickets. The circuit court of appeals decided that error had been committed in refusing to grant an injunction against dealing in nontransferable tickets to be issued in the future, and directed that the decree below be enlarged in that particular. It is insisted that the circuit court of appeals erred in awarding an injunction as to dealings 'in nontransferable tickets that may be hereafter issued . . . since it thereby undertook to promulgate' a rule applicable to conditions and circumstances which have not yet arisen, and to prohibit 'the petitioners from dealing in tickets not in esse . . . and is, therefore, violative of the most fundamental principles of our government.' But when the broad nature of this proposition is considered, it but denies that there is power in \n\n[207 U.S. 205, 227]\n\u00a0\n a court of equity in any case to afford effective relief by injunction. Certain is it that every injunction, in the nature of things, contemplates the enforcement, as against the party enjoined, of a rule of conduct for the future as to the wrong to which the injunction relates. Take the case of trespasses upon land where the elements entitling to equitable relief exist. See Slater v. Gunn, 170 Mass. 509, 41 L.R.A. 268, 49 N. E. 1017, and cases cited. It may not be doubted that the authority of a court would extend, not only to restraining a particular imminent trespass, but also to prohibiting like acts for all future time. The power exerted by the court below which is complained of was in no wise different. The bill averred the custom of the complainant at frequently occurring periods to issue reduced-rate, nontransferable tickets for fairs, conventions, etc., charged a course of illegal dealing in such nontransferable tickets by the defendants, and sought to protect its right to issue such tickets by preventing unlawful dealings in them. The defendants in effect not only admitted the unlawful course of dealing as to particular tickets then outstanding, but expressly avowed that they possessed the right, and that it was their intention to carry on the business as to all future issues of a similar character of tickets. The action of the circuit court of appeals, therefore, in causing the injunction to apply not only to the illegal dealings as to the then outstanding tickets, but to like dealings as to similar tickets which might be issued in the future, was but the exertion by the court of its power to restrain the continued commission against the rights of the complainant in the future of a definite character of acts adjudged to be wrongful. Indeed, in view of the state of the record, the inadequacy of the relief afforded by the decree as entered in the circuit court is, we think, manifest on its face. The necessary predicate of the decree was the illegal nature of the dealings by the defendants in the outstanding tickets, and the fact that such dealings, if allowed, would seriously impair the right of the complainant in the future to issue the tickets. Doubtless, for this reason the decree was made with- \n\n[207 U.S. 205, 228]\n\u00a0\n out prejudice to the right of the complainant to apply for relief as to future issues of tickets by independent proceedings whenever, on other occasions, it was determined to issue nontransferable tickets. But this was to deny adequate relief, since it subjected the complainant to the necessity, as a preliminary to the exercise of the right to issue tickets, to begin a new suit with the object of restraining the defendants from the commission in the future of acts identical with those which the court had already adjudged to be wrongful and violative of the rights of the complainant.\n In Scott v. Donald, \n165 U.S. 107\n, 41 L. ed. 648, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 262, on holding a particular seizure of liquor under the South Carolina dispensary law to be invalid, an injunction was sustained, not only addressed to the seizure in controversy, but which also operated to restrain like seizures of liquors in the future, and the exertion of the same character of power by a court of equity was upheld in the cases of Donovan v. Pennsylvania Co. \n199 U.S. 279\n, 50 L. ed. 192, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 91, and Swift & Co. v. United States, \n196 U.S. 375\n, 49 L. ed. 518, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 276.\n Nor is there merit in the contention that the decision in New York N. H. & H. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n200 U.S. 404\n, 40 L. ed. 526, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 272, supports the view here relied upon as to the limited authority of a court of equity to enjoin the continued commission of the same character of acts as those adjudged to be wrongful. On the contrary, the ruling in that case directly refutes the claim based on it. There certain acts of the carrier were held to have violated the act to regulate commerce. The contention of the government was that, because wrongful acts of a particular character had been committed, therefore an injunction should be awarded against any and all violations in the future of the act to regulate commerce. Whilst this broad request was denied, it was carefully pointed out that the power existed to enjoin the future commission of like acts to those found to be illegal, and the injunction was so awarded. The whole argument here made results from a failure to distinguish between an injunction generally restraining the commission of illegal acts in the \n\n[207 U.S. 205, 229]\n\u00a0\n future and one which simply restrains for the future the commission of acts identical in character with those which have been the subject of controversy, and which have been adjudged to be illegal.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n IX.\n Respondents further admit that, in accordance with the general custom of the trade, they separately buy and sell the return coupons of railway tickets, whether the same are stamped 'nontransferable' or not, for the reason that the term 'nontransferable' does not import any practical or legal meaning in the business, according to the common understanding of the railways themselves, the ticket brokers, and the traveling public to whom said tickets are issued, who freely sell them to brokers, who, in turn, sell them to other persons desiring to use said tickets for transportation, when genuine and bona fide.\n ...\n Respondents do not deny that the complainant, on occasions of Mardi Gras festivals in the city of New Orleans, have joined in the issuing of reduced rates and the putting out of said so-called 'nontransferable' tickets, but, as above set out, the general traveling public, the railways, and the ticket brokers, by common consent, by usage, and by understanding, have \n all treated said tickets as articles of property, and as negotiable and transferable to any person desiring to purchase and travel on the same when genuine and bona fide; and respondents deny that these respondents have ever fraudulently dealt in the return coupons of such tickets, or that complainant has ever been damaged in respect thereto, by any act of respondents.\n X.\n Respondents admit that it is their hope and expectation to buy and sell the return portions of said U. C. V. Reunion tickets, but they deny that they will solicit, induce, or persuade the holders thereof to sell such return portions to respondents upon any false or fraudulent pretense or representation upon the part of respondents.\n Respondents admit that they, in common with the general public, have some knowledge of the character and terms of the proposed tickets; that they are informed and believe that such tickets will be issued at low rates, to induce and enable the traveling public to attend said reunion in large numbers; that respondents expect to offer the same for sale, if they shall acquire any of said tickets, and will sell such tickets to persons other than the original purchasers, for such price as they are willing to pay, and that it is no concern of complainant or its connections, or other railways, whether respondents make a profit or a loss in the proposed dealing in said U. C. V. reunion tickets.\n ...\n XIV.\n Respondents admit that it is the custom and usage of complainant and its connections to issue railroad tickets at reduced rates to the traveling public on various occasions, such as expositions, conventions, Mardi Gras, reunions, or other public gatherings, and that the tickets which are usually issued by complainant purport by their terms to be nontransferable and to constitute a so-called 'special contract' in express terms between complainant, the lines issuing the same, all other lines over which the same entitle the holders to travel, and the original purchasers of said tickets, whereby the said original purchasers are forced to agree that said ticket shall not be transferred by them to any other persons; but respondents show that said tickets, when issued by complainant and its connecting lines and other railways, on such occasions as expositions, reunions, conventions, Mardi Gras, and the like, are, in practice and general consent and common understanding of the traveling public, the railways, and the ticket brokers, when bona fide and genuine tickets, good for the return passage over the lines of said complainant and its connections and other railways, in the \n hands of the holders thereof, whether such holders be the original purchasers or not; that such practice and such understanding are common and general all over the United States; that such tickets are sold and dealt in as legitimate business in every large city, to the knowledge of the complainant, and such tickets are and have been for many years sold by complainant with full knowledge of the fact that they are, in practice and general understanding of the traveling public, good in the hands of any holder.\n XV.\n Respondents jointly and severally admit that each of them are, and have been for some time, separately engaged in the lawful business of buying, selling, and dealing in such tickets, and in soliciting and inducing the original purchasers thereof to sell and transfer the same to respondents, with the intent and purpose that such tickets shall be used by the second purchaser thereof, but respondents deny that such use is a violation in law or in fact of the terms thereof. And respondents deny any knowledge that such use of said tickets by persons other than the original holders is any fraud upon complainant or the railways issuing such tickets when the same are genuine and bona fide; and respondents again aver that it is a matter of no concern or interest to the complainant or the railways issuing such tickets, whether the original purchasers are the holders and presenters of the same, or whether the holder has purchased said ticket from the original purchaser, or whether such holder has purchased the same from a ticket broker, or whether, as frequently happens, one of such tickets is accidentally or otherwise exchanged for another of the same class and form. \n\n\n\n\n","23":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBOWN v.

BEACH(1907)\nNo. 14\nArgued: March 22, 1907Decided: May 27, 1907\n\n\n\n Judgment against the plaintiff in error (who was defendant below) was recovered in a state circuit court in Indiana, which was affirmed by the supreme court of the state (164 Ind. 37, 108 Am. St. Rep. 272, 71 N. E. 963), and the plaintiff in error brings the case here to review that judgment. The predecessor of the defendant in error, being at the time treasurer of Tippecanoe county, in the state of Indiana, brought this action in 1897 against the plaintiff in error to subject funds in his hands to the payment of taxes alleged to be due from the estate of one Job M. Nash, deceased, which taxes had been assessed in above county and state in 1894, after the death of Nash, on personal property of the deceased that \n\n[206 U.S. 392, 393]\n\u00a0\n had been omitted from the tax list in his lifetime, during the years 1881 to 1893, both inclusive.\n The point in dispute between the parties relates to the assessment for omitted property on what are called the'O hio notes,' the plaintiff in error insisting that such assessment was illegal as beyond the jurisdiction of the state to impose.\n The material facts are not really in dispute. It appears that Nash died in 1893, at that time, and for more than twenty years prior thereto, a resident of the city and state of New York. He left a will which was admitted to probate in Hamilton county, Ohio, and his executors qualified there. They thereafter refused to pay the tax imposed upon the Ohio notes in Indiana. By the terms of the will a trust was created, and part of the personal property constituting such trust (more than enough to pay the taxes in dispute) was turned over to James Buck, plaintiff in error and one of the two trustees named in the will. He resided in Lafayette, in the state of Indiana, and the other trustee resided in Cincinnati, in the state of Ohio. From this fund, in the hands of Buck, the defendant in error asked to have the taxes paid which had been assessed, as above stated, and which he claimed were due the state. This was refused, and this action was thereupon commenced.\n A former action had been brought by the trustees for relief by injunction against the predecessor of the defendant in error to enjoin him from seizing upon or interfering with the trust fund for the payment of the taxes in dispute, and in that action the trustees had been unsuccessful. Buck v. Miller, 147 Ind. 586, 37 L.R.A. 384, 62 Am. St. Rep. 436, 45 N. E. 647, 47 N. E. 8, decided in 1896\n\n\n The amount assessed on the estate of decedent upon the 'Ohio notes' from 1884 to 1893, on account of omitted assessments during those years, aside from the penalties for nonpayment, was $36,357.71.\n During the above-mentioned years, while the decedent was, as stated, a resident of the state of New York, he had a large sum of money invested in the states of Ohio and Indiana, approximating $750,000. The money loaned by him in Ohio \n\n[206 U.S. 392, 394]\n\u00a0\n was evidenced by Ohio notes, made by the borrowers, who were residents of Ohio, the payment of the money borrowed being secured by mortgages on lands situated in Ohio. The moneys loaned in Ohio were loaned through an agent of Mr. Nash, residing in Cincinnati. The notes were dated and payable in Cincinnati, to the order of Mr. Nash, but were not indorsed by him, and all renewals and payments on account of them were made to his agent in Cincinnati. All moneys paid upon or by reason of these notes were deposited in a bank in Cincinnati to the credit of Mr. Nash, and no part thereof was sent to Indiana. The Cincinnati agent commenced loaning decedent's money about 1860, and, upon the removal of decedent to New York in 1870, and until his death, in 1893, the agent made investments on decedent's behalf in Ohio, collected the principal and interest upon his mortgage loans, and had general charge of his financial interests in that state.\n James Buck was the agent of decedent at Lafayette, in the state of Indiana, for many years preceding the death of Mr. Nash. The Ohio notes were sent to him from Cincinnati by the agent there, during the years in question, together with the mortgages securing the payment of the notes, and they were kept in a safe at Lafayette, Indiana, by Mr. Buck, but no business was transacted in regard to them nor any use made of them in Indiana, otherwise than that a short time before the interest on or principal of the notes became due they were sent to the Ohio agent to have the interest payments made to him indorsed upon them, or to be delivered up if the principal were paid.\n Nothing else was done in Indiana in regard to the notes, except that a few days prior to the 1st day of April in each year (which is the day upon which assessments for taxes are, by law, made in the state of Indiana) Mr. Buck sent the notes and mortgages to the Ohio agent, and a few days subsequent to that day in each year the same were returned by the Ohio agent to Mr. Buck, who retained them in his possession.\n When the Ohio notes and mortgages were sent from Cincin- \n\n[206 U.S. 392, 395]\n\u00a0\n nati to Mr. Buck by the Ohio agent, Mr. Buck made a record of their receipt in a book kept by him for that purpose, showing the dates and amounts of the notes and when due, and whenever payment or renewal of said notes was reported by the Ohio agent to the Indiana agent, he made entries of the facts in the register kept by him.\n Mr. Buck also had possession of the notes and mortgages given to Mr. Nash for moneys loaned in the state of Indiana, and such moneys were invested and reinvested in that state during these years, and the taxes thereon were duly paid.\n Mr. Buck transacted no business directly with the makers of the Ohio notes or mortgages, but, as stated, sent the notes to the Ohio agent for any business to be done in regard to them.\n During Mr. Buck's agency money was sometimes sent to him at Lafayette from Cincinnati to be invested, which money was placed on deposit in the bank in Indiana and loaned for Mr. Nash. Such moneys have nothing to do with the 'Ohio notes' in issue in this action.\n During these years, at least from 1886, Mr. Buck was authorized by virtue of a power of attorney from Mr. Nash to satisfy when due and when the money was paid all notes and mortgages; but, so far as the Ohio notes and mortgages were concerned, he never assumed to satisfy any of them or receive payment for the same. That was all done by the Ohio agent at Cincinnati.\n Messrs. Byron W. Langdon and W. H. H. Miller for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[206 U.S. 392, 397]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Will R. Wood, Cassius C. Hadley, and J. Frank Hanly for defendant in error.\n\n\n[206 U.S. 392, 399]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The only question involved here is in regard to the taxability of the Ohio notes in the state of Indiana.\n The plaintiff in error asserts that the simple physical presence \n\n[206 U.S. 392, 400]\n\u00a0\n of the Ohio notes in Indiana, payable to, and not indorsed by, the decedent, did not constitute taxable property there, because such notes were given and were payable and were paid in Ohio, by residents of Ohio, and to a nonresident of Indiana, and for loans made in Ohio, the capital represented by such notes never having been used in business in Indiana, and he insists that a tax upon such capital or upon the notes themselves as representing that capital, is an illegal tax, and that to take property in payment of such an illegal tax is to take it without due process of law, and constitutes a violation of the 14th Amendment.\n If the facts in this case constituted the debts evidenced by the Ohio notes property in the jurisdiction of the state of Indiana at the time when such taxes were imposed, then the tax was valid, if there were statutory authority of that state for the same. The state court has held that there was such authority (Buck v. Miller, 147 Ind. 586, 37 L.R.A. 384, 62 Am. St. Rep. 436, 45 N. E. 647, 47 N. E. 8; Buck v. Beach, 164 Ind. 37, 108 Am. St. Rep. 272, 71 N. E. 963, being the case at bar), and that construction of the statute concludes this court (Delaware L. & W. R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n198 \nU.S. 341, 352\n, 49 S. L. ed. 1077, 1081, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 669).\n The sole question, then, for this court, is whether the mere presence of the notes in Indiana constituted the debts of which the notes were the written evidence property within the jurisdiction of that state, so that such debts could be therein taxed.\n Generally, property, in order to be the subject of taxation, must be within the jurisdiction of the power assuming to tax.

For the purpose of taxation however, it has long been held that personal property may be separated from its owner, and he may be taxed on its account at the place where the property is, although it is not the place of his own domicil, and even if he is not a citizen or resident of the state which imposes the tax. Pullman's Palace Car Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n141 \nU.S. 18, 22\n, 35 S. L. ed. 613, 616, 3 Inters. Com. Rep. 595, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 876; Tappan v. Merchants' Nat. Bank, 19 Wall. 490, 22 L. ed. 189; People ex rel. Hoyt v. Tax & A. Comrs. 23 N. Y. 224, 240. The same rule applies to intangible property. Generally speaking, intangible property in the nature of a debt may be regarded, for the purposes of taxation, as situated at the domicil of the creditor and within the jurisdiction of the state where he has such domicil. It is property within that state. Thus it has been held that a debt owned by a citizen of one state against a citizen of another state and evidenced by the bond of the debtor, secured by a deed of trust or mortgage upon real estate situated in the state where the debtor resides, is properly taxed by the state of the residence of the creditor, if the statute of that state so provides, and such tax violates no provision of the Federal Constitution. Kirtland v. Hotchkiss, \n100 \nU.S. 491, 498\n, 25 S. L. ed. 558, 562.\n Rejecting the fiction of law in regard to the situs of personal property, including therein choses in action, the courts of Indiana have asserted jurisdiction by reason of the statute of that state over these Ohio notes for the purpose of taxation in Indiana, founded upon the simple fact that such notes were placed in the latter state by the Ohio agent of the decedent under the circumstances above set forth. The supreme court of Indiana refused to accept the testimony of the agents that the Ohio notes were sent to Lafayette merely for safekeeping, and for clerical convenience, and said that 'the court below was authorized to make the opposite deduction from the uniform course of the business in respect to the keeping of said notes and mortgages and from the evidence that decedent gave the direction which established the practice that was pursued in that particular. More than that, the evidence \n\n[206 U.S. 392, 402]\n\u00a0\n clearly warranted the conclusion that Buck was vested with a control of said notes and securities for the purpose of enabling decedent to escape taxation in Ohio. We must, therefore, conclude, in support of the general finding, that the court below found that in conducting the business of the Ohio agency the decedent separated from said business the possession of said notes and mortgages and vested the right to such possession in said Buck. There was no return for taxation of said notes, or of the investments represented by them, either in Ohio or New York during the lifetime of the decedent.'\n Taking this to be a finding of fact by the supreme court of the state, it is plain that the action of the decedent in sending the Ohio notes into the state of Indiana for the purpose stated (whether successful or not) was improper and unjustifiable. The record does show, however, that the executors subsequently paid the Ohio authorities over $40,000 for taxes on the moneys invested in Ohio.\n But an attempt to escape proper taxation in Ohio does not confer jurisdiction to tax property asserted to be in Indiana which really lies outside and beyond the jurisdiction of that state. Jurisdiction of the state of Indiana to tax is not conferred or strengthened by reason of the motive which may have prompted the decedent to send into the state of Indiana these evidences of debts owing him by residents of Ohio. The question still remains, Was there any property within the jurisdiction of the state of Indiana, so as to permit that state to tax it, simply because of the presence of the Ohio notes in that state? It was not the value of the paper as a tangible thing, on which these promises to pay the debts existing in Ohio were written, that was taxed by that state. The property really taxed was the debt itself, as each separate note was taxed at the full amount of the debt named therein or due thereon. And jurisdiction over these debts for the purpose of taxation was asserted and exercised solely by reason of the physical presence in Indiana of the notes themselves, \n\n[206 U.S. 392, 403]\n\u00a0\n although they were only written evidence of the existence of the debts which were in fact thereby taxed.\n A distinction has been sometimes taken between bonds and other specialty debts belonging to the deceased, on the one hand, and simple contract debts on the other, for the purpose of probate jurisdiction, and the probate court where the bonds are found has been held to have jurisdiction to grant probate, while, in the other class of debts ( including promissory notes), jurisdiction has attached to the probate court where the debtor resided at the death of the creditor. 1 Wms. Exrs. 6th Am. from 7th English ed., bottom paging 288, 290, note [h]; Wyman v. Halstead (Wyman v. United States) \n109 U.S. 654\n, 27 L. ed. 1068, 3 Sup. Ct. Rep. 417. See also Beers v. Shannon, 73 N. Y. 292, 299; Owen v. Miller, 10 Ohio St. 136, 75 Am. Dec. 502.\n Under such rule, the debts here in question were not property within the state of Indiana, nor were the promissory notes themselves, which were only evidence of such debts. The rule giving jurisdiction where the specialty may be found has no application to a promissory note. Assuming such a rule, the case here is not covered by it.\n Questions of the validity of state taxation with reference to the Federal Constitution have become quite frequent in this court within the last few years. The case of Metropolitan L. Ins. Co. v. New Orleans, \n205 U.S. 395\n, 51 L. ed. 853, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 499, is the latest. The question there was in relation to the validity of certain taxes assessed in the city of New Orleans against the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company by reason of the company doing business in lending money to the holders of its policies in New Orleans. The domicil of the company was in the city of New York, and the evidences of the credits, in the form of notes, were kept most of the time in New York, being sent to New Orleans when due. The tax was, under the laws of the state of Louisiana, levied on the 'credits, money loaned, bills receivable,' etc., of the plaintiff in error, and its amount was ascertained by computing the sum of the face value of all the notes held by the company in New Orleans \n\n[206 U.S. 392, 404]\n\u00a0\n at the time of the assessment. The assessment was made under an act which provided that 'bills receivable, obligations, or credits arising from the business done in this state,' shall be assessable at the business domicil of the nonresident, the assessment being made in such a way under the statute as would 'represent in their aggregate a fair average on the capital, both cash and credits, employed in the business of the party or parties to be assessed.' The tax was sustained because, as is stated in the opinion of the court, which was delivered by Mr. Justice Moody, 'the insurance company chose to enter into the business of lending money within the state of Louisiana, and employed a local agent to conduct that business. It was conducted under the laws of the state. The state undertook to tax the capital employed in the business precisely as it taxed the capital of its own citizens in like situation. For the purpose of arriving at the amount of capital actually employed, it caused the credits arising out of the business to be assessed. We think the state had the power to do this, and that the foreigner doing business cannot escape taxation upon his capital by removing temporarily from the state evidences of credits in the form of notes. Under such circumstances, they have a taxable situs in the state of their origin.' The temporary absence of the notes givenfo r the loans from the state (being in New York, the domicil of the company) except when they became due was regarded as unimportant. The law, it was said, regarded the place of their origin as their true home, to which they would return to be paid, and their temporary absence, however long continued, was left out of account.\n The prior cases of New Orleans v. Stempel, \n175 U.S. 309\n, 44 L. ed. 174, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 110, and State Assessors v. Comptoir National D'Escompte, \n191 U.S. 388\n, 48 L. ed. 232, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 109, were also cited. In the first there was a tax on credits, evidenced by notes ( secured by mortgages on real estate in New Orleans) which the owner, a nonresident, who had inherited them, left in Louisiana in the possession of an agent, who collected the principal and interest as they became due. The \n\n[206 U.S. 392, 405]\n\u00a0\n capital of the owner was thus invested in the state, and was thereby subject to taxation there, and the notes did not alter the nature of the debt, but were merely evidence of it. In the latter case a foreign banking company did business in New Orleans, and through an agent lent money which was evidenced by checks drawn upon the agent, treated as overdrafts and secured by collateral, the checks and collateral remaining in the hands of the agent until the transactions were closed. The credits thus evidenced were held taxable in Louisiana. The corporation was held to be doing business and had capital employed in the city of New Orleans, to the extent of the assessment made upon it therein.\n In Bristol v. Washington County, \n177 U.S. 133\n, 44 L. ed. 701, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 585, the assessment was upheld because it appeared that the person assessed was doing business in Minnesota through an agent, in lending money in that state, which was secured by mortgages on real property therein. The amount of money thus invested in that state was held to be properly taxable therein.\n In Savings & L. Soc. v. Multnomah County, \n169 U.S. 421\n, 42 L. ed. 803, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 392, the assessment was upon the real estate mortgaged, the interest of the mortgagee therein being taxed to him and the rest to the mortgagor, and it was held by this court that the fact that the mortgage was owned by a citizen of another state, and in his possession outside of the state of Oregon, where the real estate was situated, did not violate the 14th Amendment. It was stated that 'the state may tax real estate mortgaged, as it may all other property within its jurisdiction, at its full value. It may do this, either by taxing the whole to the mortgagor, or by taxing to the mortgagee the interest therein represented by the mortgage, and to the mortgagor the remaining interest in the land. And it may, for the purpose of taxation, either treat the mortgage debt as personal property, to be taxed like other choses in action, to the creditor at his domicil, or treat the mortgagee's interest in the land as real estate, to be taxed to him, like other real property, at its situs.' Under the statute of Oregon \n\n[206 U.S. 392, 406]\n\u00a0\n the assessment was made against the mortgagee upon his interest in the land as real estate.\n There are no cases in this court where an assessment such as the one before us has been involved. We have not had a case where neither the party assessed nor the debtor was a resident of or present in the state where the tax was imposed, and where no business was done therein by the owner of the notes or his agent relating in any way to the capital evidenced by the notes assessed for taxation. We cannot assent to the doctrine that the mere presence of evidences of debt, such as these notes, under the circumstances already stated, amounts to the presence of property within the state for taxation. That promissory notes may be the subject of larceny, as stated in 48 N. Y., cited below, does not make the debts evidenced by them property liable to taxation within the state, where there is no other fact than the presence of the notes upon which to base the claim.\n In People ex rel. Westbrookv. Ogdensburgh, 48 N. Y. 390, it was held that money due upon a contract for the sale of land was personal property, and that where such contract belonging to a nonresident was in the hands of a resident agent, it might, for the purposes of municipal taxation, be assessed to the agent and taxed. In the opinion Judge Earl said: 'The debts due upon these contracts are personal estate, the same as if they were due upon notes or bonds; and such personal estate may be said to exist where the obligations for payment are held.' The contracts spoken of in that case were contracts for the sale of land by a nonresident owner to persons within the county where the lands were situated. The debtors resided within the state, and the agent of the nonresident for the sale of the land resided in the state and had possession of the contracts. A different case as to its facts from the one before us.\n In People ex rel. Jefferson v. Smith, 88 N. Y. 576, jurisdiction to tax in New York was denied under the statute of that state, because the personal estate was not within the state, although the \n\n[206 U.S. 392, 407]\n\u00a0\n same principle (page 581) as contained in 48 N. Y., supra, was asserted.\n If payment of these notes had to be enforced it would not be to the courts of Indiana that the owner would resort. He would have to go to Ohio to find the debtor as well as the lands mortgaged as security for the payment of the notes. It is true that if the notes were stolen while in Indiana, and they were therein a subject of larceny, the Indiana courts would have to be resorted to for the punishment of the thieves. That would be in vindication of the general criminal justice of the state. This consideration, however, is not near enough to the question involved to cause us to change our views of the law in regard to the taxation of property, and make that property within the state which we think is clearly outside it.\n Although public securities, consisting of state bonds and bonds of municipal bodies, and circulating notes of banking institutions, have sometimes been treated as property in the place where they were found, though removed from the domicil of the owner (State Tax on Foreign-held Bonds, 15 Wall. 300, 324, 21 L. ed. 179, 188), it has not been held in this court that simple contract debts, though evidenced by promissory notes, can, under the facts herein stated, be treated as property, and taxed in the state where the notes may be found.\n As is said in the above-cited case (at page 320, L. ed. at page 187): 'All the property there can be in the nature of things in debts of corporations belongs to the creditors, to whom they are payable, and follows their domicil, wherever that may be. Their debts can have no locality separate from the parties to whom they are due. This principle might be stated in many different ways, and supported by citations from numerous adjudications, but no number of authorities and no forms of expressions could add anything to its obvious truth, which is recognized upon its simple statement.'\n The cases cited in Metropolitan L. Ins. Co. Case, supra, show that this rule is enlarged to the extent of holding that capital evidenced by written instruments, invested in a \n\n[206 U.S. 392, 408]\n\u00a0\n state, may be taxed by the authorities of the state, although their owner is a non-resident and such evidences of debt are temporarily outside of the state when the assessment is made. Although the language of the opinion in the case of State Tax on Foreign-held Bonds, supra, has been somewhat restricted so far as regards the character of the interest of the mortgagee in the land mortgaged (Savings & L. Soc. v. Multnomah County, \n169 \nU.S. 421, 428\n, 42 S. L. ed. 803, 805, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 392), the principle upon which the case itself was decided has not been otherwise shaken by the later cases (New Orleans v. Stempel, \n175 \nU.S. 309, 319\n, 320 S., 44 L. ed. 174, 180, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 110; Blackstone v. Miller, \n188 \nU.S. 189, 206\n, 47 S. L. ed. 439, 445, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 277). In the Stempel Case, supra, the notes,  we have said, represented the capital of the owner invested in the state, and the capital was taxed, although the owner was a nonresident.\n Cases arising under collateral inheritance tax or succession tax acts have been cited as affording foundation for the right to tax as herein asserted. The foundation upon which such acts rest is different from that which exists where the assessment is levied upon property. The succession or inheritance tax is not a tax on property, as has been frequently held by this court (Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 U.S. 41\n, 44 L. ed. 969, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 747, and Blackstone v. Miller, \n188 U.S. 189\n, 47 L. ed. 439, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 277), and therefore the decisions arising under such inheritance tax cases are not in point.\n Our decision in this case has no tendency to aid the owner of taxable property in any effort to avoid or evade proper and legitimate taxation. The presence of the notes in Indiana formed no bar to the right, if it otherwise existed, of taxing the debts evidenced by the notes in Ohio. It does, however, tend to prevent the taxation in one state of property in the shape of debts not existing there, and which, if so taxed, would make double taxation almost sure, which is certainly not to be desired, and ought, wherever possible, to be prevented.\n For the reason that, as the assessment in this case was made upon property which was never within the jurisdiction of the state of Indiana, the state had no power to tax it, and the \n\n[206 U.S. 392, 409]\n\u00a0\n enforcement of such a tax would be the taking of property without due process of law.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of Indiana is reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with the opinion of this court. Reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice Day, dissenting:\n I am unable to concur in the opinion and judgment of the court in this case, and believe that its importance and far-reaching effect warrant a statement of the grounds upon which I differ.\n Before stating the view which it seems to me should be controlling, I believe that the statement of facts, as outlined by the learned Justice speaking for the court, should be somewhat amplified, with a view to a more complete showing of the case.\n The office in Lafayette, Indiana, was the office of Nash, for which he paid the rent. The safes in which the notes were kept in this office were the safes of Nash, and the power of attorney under which the agent held the 'Ohio notes' not only authorized him to enter satisfaction of them when paid, but gave him complete control and dominion over them, with power of sale. And while it does not clearly appear that the proceeds of the notes in question were reinvested by the agent in Indiana, it does appear that after 1886 large sums of money were sent from Cincinnati to Lafayette, and were invested by Nash's agent in Indiana. Furthermore, in the opinion it is said that the executors, subsequently to the death of Nash, paid over $40,000 of taxes on money invested in Ohio. It does appear that after the death of Nash, under the Ohio law the auditor of Hamilton county instituted a proceeding for the collection of five years (of the thirteen here involved) of back taxes upon some of the notes representing the Ohio investments, and, rather than litigate, a settlement was made \n\n[206 U.S. 392, 410]\n\u00a0\n by the executors for this five years' claim in the sum of $40,000. Whether that was for the notes here in question the record does not disclose. As the Ohio agent testified, only a part of the Ohio notes were sent to Indiana, and others in large amounts were kept in Ohio. We know of no statute in Ohio which would tax the notes permanently kept in Indiana, and none is pointed out. The supreme court of Indiana in this case reached the conclusion that these particular notes were not taxable in Ohio. Of course, the settlement of the claim could not affect the legal proposition here involved, but for accuracy of statement it must not be regarded that equitably the claim for taxes upon these notes has been satisfied. On the contrary, his record discloses that, by the scheme adopted, more than three quarters of a million of dollars in capital invested in notes and mortgages successfully evaded taxes during Nash's lifetime in New York, where he was domiciled, and in Ohio and Indiana, where his agents were loaning his money for him, and where his notes and mortgages, the results of such loans, were held for him.\n Accepting the decision of the supreme court of the state that a statute of the state has undertaken to tax these notes, it is now held that the Constitution of the United States prevents such taxation of notes and mortgages held under the protection and within the power of the state by the agent of a nonresident owner, although such agent holds the securities in an office belonging to the owner, in a safe provided by him, with a power of attorney which gives him full dominion over them, and, for the convenience of the owner, keeps a book in which transactions concerning them are recorded at the instance of the owner, and sends them out for collection. These notes were sent beyond the borders of the state of Indiana only for collection, or for the few days when they were supposed to be liable for taxation, and, when such danger was thought to be past, returned to the agent in Indiana.\n I agree that a debt intangible in form cannot acquire a situs for the purpose of taxation, but I submit that when a \n\n[206 U.S. 392, 411]\n\u00a0\n debt takes the shape of note and mortgage it may, if the state in the exercise of its taxing power so wills, acquire a situs separate from the domicil of the owner under the circumstances shown in this case. I concede that the precise point here involved has not been decided in previous cases in this court, but in my view the principles declared in this court were followed in the supreme court of Indiana and require the affirmance of its judgment.\n This court in a series of cases has held that notes, bonds, and mortgages may acquire a situs at the place where they are held. Some of the cases are: New Orleans v. Stempel, \n175 U.S. 309\n, 44 L. ed. 174, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 110; Bristol v. Washington County, \n177 U.S. 133\n, 44 L. ed. 701, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 585; Blackstone v. Miller, \n188 U.S. 189\n, 47 L. ed. 439, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 277; State Assessors v. Comptoir National D'Escompte, \n191 \nU.S. 388, 403\n, 48 S. L. ed. 232, 238, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 109; Carstairs v. Cochran, \n193 U.S. 10\n, 48 L. ed. 596, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 318; Scottish Union & Nat. Ins. Co. v. Bowland, \n196 U.S. 611\n, 49 L. ed. 619, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 345.\n It would unnecessarily extend this dissent to analyze these cases. Brief reference to some of them, in my judgment, shows that the principles therein declared, when extended to this case, would warrant the state, if it so chose in exerting its taxing power, to reach notes and mortgages held within its jurisdiction under the circumstances which we have detailed.\n In New Orleans v. Stempel, supra, a tax on credits evidenced by notes and secured by mortgages was upheld, where the owner left them in Louisiana in the possession of an agent, who collected the same as they fell due. There was no fact of investment and reinvestment of capital in the case, and the court, speaking through Mr. Justice Brewer, said:\n'This matter of situs may be regarded in another aspect. In the absence of statute, bills and notes are treated as choses in action, and are not subject to levy and sale on execution, but, by the statutes of many states, they are made so subject to seizure and sale, as any tangible personal property. 1 Freeman, Executions,  112; 4 Am. & Eng. Enc. Law, 2d ed. p. 282; 11 Am. & Eng. Enc. Law, 2d ed. p. 623. Among the states referred to in these authorities as having statutes war- \n\n[206 U.S. 392, 412]\n\u00a0\n ranting such levy and sale are California, Indiana, Kentucky, New York, Tennessee, Iowa, and Louisiana, Brown v. Anderson, 4 Mart. N. S. 416, affirmed the rightfulness of such a levy and sale. In Fluker v. Bullard, 2 La. Ann. 338, it was held that if a note was not taken into the actual possession of the sheriff a sale by him on an execution conveyed no title on the purchaser, the court saying: 'In the case of Simpson v. Allain it was held that, in order to make a valid seizure of tangible property, it is necessary that the sheriff should take the property levied upon into actual possession. 7 Rob. (La.) 504. In the case of Goubeau v. New Orleans & N. R. Co. the same doctrine is still more distinctly announced. The court there says: 'From all the different provisions of our laws above referred to, can it be controverted that, in order to have them carried into effect, the sheriff must necessarily take the property seized into his possession? This is the essence of the seizure. It cannot exist without such possession.' 6 Rob. (La.) 348. It is clear, under these authorities, that the sheriff effected no seizure of the note in controversy, and consequently his subsequent adjudication of it conferred no title on Bailey.'\n\n'The same doctrine was reaffirmed in Stockton v. Stanbrough, 3 La. Ann. 390. Now, if property can have such a situs within the state as to be subject to seizure and sale on execution, it would seem to follow that the state has power to establish a like situs within the state for purposes of taxation. It has also been held that a note may be made the subject of seizure and delivery in a replevin suit. Graff v. Shannon, 7 Iowa, 508; Smith v. Eals, 81 Iowa, 235, 25 Am. St. Rep. 486, 46 N. W. 1110; Pritchard v. Norwood, 155 Mass. 539, 30 N. E. 80.\n\n'It is well settled that bank bills and municipal bonds are in such a concrete tangible form that they are subject to taxation where found, irrespective of the domicil of the owner, are subject to levy and sale on execution, and to seizure and delivery under replevin; and yet they are but promises to pay,-evidences of existing indebtedness. Notes and mortgages are of the same nature; and, while they may not have be- \n\n[206 U.S. 392, 413]\n\u00a0\n come so generally recognized as tangible personal property, yet they have such a concrete form that we see no reason why a state may not declare that, if found within its limits, they shall be subject to taxation.'\n\n In commenting on this case and State Assessors v. Comptoir National D'Escompte, \n191 U.S. 388\n, 48 L. ed. 232, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 109, Mr. Justice Moody, speaking for the court in the late case of Metropolitan L. Ins. Co. v. New Orleans, \n205 U.S. 395\n, 51 L. ed. 853, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 499, said: 'In both of these cases the written evidences of the credits were continuously present in the state, and their presence was clearly the dominant factor in the decisions.'\n In Blackstome v. Miller, \n188 U.S. 206\n, 47 L. ed. 445, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 277, Mr. Justice Holmes, speaking for the court, said:\n'There is no conflict between our views and the point decided in the case reported under the name of State Tax on Foreignheld Bonds, 15 Wall. 300, 21 L. ed. 179. The Taxation in that case was on the interest on bonds held out of the state. Bonds and negotiable instruments are more than merely evidences of debt. The debt is inseparable from the paper which declares and constitutes it by a tradition which comes down from more archaic conditions. Bacon v. Hooker, 177 Mass. 335, 337, 83 Am. St. Rep. 279, 58 N. E. 1078.'\n\n To the consideration of the subject in the opinions of the learned Justices just quoted, it may be added that bills and notes are the subject of conversion in trover, and the measure of damages is the collectible value of the obligation. Mercer v. Jones, 3 Campb. 477; 2 Ames's Bills & Notes, p. 693, and numerous cases there cited. Bills and notes may be the subject of donatio causa mortis, even though payable to order and unindorsed. 2 Ames's Bills & Notes, 699-701. They are held to be governed by the designation of 'goods and chattels' in the statute of frauds and other statutes. 2 Ames's Bills & Notes, 706.\n Bills and notes have been held to be 'goods, wares, and merchandise' within the meaning of the statute of frauds. Baldwin v. Williams, 3 Met. 365; Somerby v. Buntin, 118Ma ss. 279, 19 Am. Rep. 459. \n\n[206 U.S. 392, 414]\n\u00a0\n In view of this recognition of the character of bills and notes as tangible property, it seems to me inaccurate to say that they are mere evidences of debt. They are tangible things, capable of delivery, passing from hand to hand, and for many purposes may be regarded as of the value of the debt which they evidence.\n It is elementary that the power of the states as to matters of taxation is very broad, and subject only, in the limitation of its exercise, to the Constitution of the state and the nation.\n It seems to me that a state, in pursuance of its taxing policy, may give a situs to such evidences of debt held within its jurisdiction as have taken the tangible form of bonds, notes, and mortgages.\n It is said to deny this power to the states, under the circumstances of this case, will tend to prevent double taxation,-a thing much to be desired. This case seems to me an apt illustration of the contrary view; by denying the power to Indiana to tax these notes under the circumstances shown, the scheme of the owner to avoid any tax upon them is made effectual, and, except for the recovery after his death for a small part of the taxes actually due, this vast sum of money escapes taxation altogether. I think that the powers of taxation here invoked by the state of Indiana ought not to be denied, and if the practical effect can be given any weight in deciding legal rights, to me it seems evident that such denial will work immunity from just taxation of property represented in promissory notes and mortgages sent beyond the jurisdiction of the state where the owner is domiciled, and held by agents in distant states, within the protection of their laws, for the sole purpose of avoiding contribution to the public treasury. As I understand the opinion, municipal bonds or other such securities held as these are would be legitimately subject to taxation. They are but promises to pay, in a concrete form, of the same character as notes and mortgages. In my opinion there is no constitutional objection to their localization for \n\n[206 U.S. 392, 415]\n\u00a0\n taxation by the law of the state when the owner has chosen to give them a situs there as in this case.\n Without further extending these views, I am constrained to dissent from the opinion and judgment of the court in this case.\n Mr. Justice Brewer concurs in this dissent. \n\n\n\n","25":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCENTRAL OF GEORGIA R.

In the view we take of them they may be considered together.\n Actions were begun by the plaintiffs in error, in the superior court of Fulton county, to enjoin the enforcement of executions in the hands of the sheriff, issued for taxes assessed by the comptroller general on shares of the corporate stock of the Western Railway of Alabama, an Alabama corporation, which stock was alleged to be held and owned by the plaintiffs in error.\n The superior court refused to award an injunction.\n Upon writs of error the supreme court affirmed the judgments of the court below. 124 Ga. 596, 630, 53 S. E. 251, 207. The cases were remitted to the superior court of Fulton county and that court rendered final decrees in favor of the defendants below, holding the tax executions to be lawful. The cases were again taken to the supreme court of Georgia and there affirmed. 125 Ga. 589, 617, 54 S. E. 52, 64.\n The question of the taxability of these shares was a matter of litigation in the Federal courts of the Georgia district, and it was held such shares were not taxable. 116 Fed. 669, \n\n[207 U.S. 127, 132]\n\u00a0\n Affirmed in the court of appeals, 54 C. C. A. 672, 117 Fed. 1007. The latter case was reversed and the stock held taxable in the case of Wright v. Louisville & N. R. Co. decided by this court at the October term, 1904. \n195 U.S. 219\n, 49 L. ed. 167, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 16.\n Thereupon says the supreme court of Georgia:\n'On January 27, 1905, the comptroller general wrote to the president of the Georgia Railroad & Banking Company the following letter: 'The Supreme Court of the United States having recently held, as you doubtless are aware, that the shares of stock of the Western Railway of Alabama owned by the Georgia Railroad & Banking Company are taxable in Georgia, it becomes my duty to assess these shares of stock for taxation for each of the years in which they are in default for their taxes. This assessment is required to be made by the comptroller general from 'the best information obtainable.' I desire to proceed to the discharge of this duty intelligently, and therefore respectfully request you to furnish me any data in your possession which will enable me to make perfectly fair, just, and legal assessments of this property. From your long connection with the property as president of the Georgia Railroad & Banking company, and your familiarity with its value, you doubtless are in possession of information which will very greatly aid me in making an equitable assessment of the property. I trust, therefore, you will submit at your earliest possible convenience any facts or suggestions bearing upon this line which you may deem proper. I would be glad to have any data which you may submit with reference to its value for each year, beginning with the year 1883, the year I am informed your corporation became the owner of these shares of stock. I expect to proceed with this matter some time the early part of next week, if possible.' Other correspondence took place between the comptroller general and various officers of the Georgia railroad, including the general counsel, who eventually submitted to the comptroller general a statement regarding what he considered the value of the railroad property in \n\n[207 U.S. 127, 133]\n\u00a0\n question, together with a tabulated statement of the dividends which the Georgia railroad had received from the stock, at the same time protesting that the stock was not liable for taxation, and refusing to make any return of it for that purpose. The comptroller general thereupon, according to his affidavit, 'assessed the same from the best information obtainable.' It is insisted with great earnestness and ability that the levy of executions under these circumstances, without giving notice to the railroad company or allowing it any opportunity to be heard as to the basis of valuation upon which the assessment was made, amounted to a seizure of its property without due process of law. It is not claimed that the comptroller general has violated the provisions of any existing statute, but that the laws of Georgia do not provide for the collection of taxes on omitted property after a return has been made by the taxpayer and accepted by the comptroller general.' [124 Ga. 612.]\n\n The first and perhaps principal question argued in the case arises upon the contention of the plaintiffs in error that the method of assessment provided for the taxation of property in such cases as the present, as laid down in the statutes of the state of Georgia, as construed by the supreme court of the state, do not afford the taxpayer due process of law. The pertinent sections of the Political Code of Georgia are copied in the margin. \n Section 804. Returns to Comptroller, How Made. The returns of all companies or persons required to be made to the comptroller general must be in writing and sworn to by the presiding officer, etc.\n Section 805. Ruturns and Taxes, etc. The returns of all railroad and insurance and express companies, and agents of foreign companies, authorized in this state, shall be made to the comptroller general by the first day of May in each year, and the taxes thereof paid to the state treasurer by the first day of October, and not later than December twentieth of each year.\n Section 812. Returns to Comptroller Must be Itemized. Whenever corporations, companies, persons, agencies, or institutions are required by law to make returns of property, or gross receipts, or business, or income, gross, annual, net, or any other kind, or any other return, to the comptroller general, for taxation, such return shall contain an itemized statement of property, each class or species to be separately named and valued, or an itemized account of gross receipts, or business, or income, as above defined, or othermatters required to be returned, and in case of net income only, an itemized account of gross receipts and expenditures, to show how the income returned is ascertained, and such returns shall be carefully scrutinized by the comptroller general, and if, in his judgment, the property embraced therein is returned below its value, he shall assess the value, within sixty day thereafter, from any information he can obtain, and if he shall find a return of gross receipts, or business, or income, as above defined, or other \n\n[207 U.S. 127, 134]\n\u00a0\n Of the system of taxation thus provided the supreme court of Georgia, in a summary of its provisions, says:\n'The Political Code,  812, prescribes the method by which 'corporations, companies, persons, agencies, or institutions,' shall make returns of their property to the comptroller general for taxation, and provides that 'such returns shall be carefully scrutinized by the comptroller general, and if, in his judgment, the property embraced therein is returned below its value, he shal assess the value, within sixty days thereafter, from any information he can obtain, and if he shall find a return of . . . matters required to be returned as aforesaid, below the true amount, or false in any particular, or in anywise contrary to law, he shall correct the same and assess the true amount, from the best information at his command, within sixty days. In all cases of assessment, or of correction of returns, as herein provided, the officer or person making such \n\n[207 U.S. 127, 135]\n\u00a0\n returns shall receive notice and shall have the privilege, within twenty days after such notice, to refer the question of true value or amount, as the case may be, to arbitrators, . . . and their award shall be final.' Section 813 is as follows: 'In cases of failure to make return, the comptroller general shall make an assessment from the best information he can procure, which assessment shall be conclusive upon said corporations, companies, persons, agencies, or institutions.' By  814 it is provided that 'in all cases of default of payment of taxes upon returns or assessments, the comptroller general shall enforce collections in the manner now provided by law.' 'If any corporation, company, person, agency, or institution, who are required to make their returns to the comptroller general, shall fail to return the taxable property or specifics, or pay annually the taxes for which they are liable to the state treasury, the comptroller general shall issue against them an execution for the amount of taxes due, according to law, together with the costs and penalties.' Section 874. 'When there is no return \n\n[207 U.S. 127, 136]\n\u00a0\n by which to assess the tax, the comptroller general shall, from the best information he can procure, assess in his discretion.' Section 879. These sections of the Political Code are thus set out in order that we may have before us at the outset the various statutes bearing on the power of the comptroller general to collect taxes on property which has not been returned. And at this point we will take occasion to say that, in our opinion, all considerations of the good faith of the railroad company should be eliminated from this discussion. It may be conceded that the officials of the company honestly believe that this stock was not taxable, and that there has never been on their part the slightest effort to conceal the Georgia railroad's ownership of it, or to deceive the comptroller general in any way. In no jurisdiction has the maxim ' Ignorantia legis neminem excusat' been more rigidly applied than in Georgia. The railroad company was bound to know that this stock was taxable, and its mistaken, though honest, belief to the contrary, furnishes no excuse for nonpayment.'\n\n In view of this statute as thus construed the question made is whether due process of law is afforded where a taxpayer, without fraudulent intent and upon reasonable grounds, withholds property from tax returns with an honest belief that it is not taxable, and the assessing officer proceeds to assess the omitted property without opportunity to the taxpayer to be heard upon the validity of the tax or the amount of the assessment, either in the tax proceedings or afterward upon a suit to collect taxes, or by independent suit to enjoin their collection.\n Considerable discussion was had in the oral argument of the case concerning the effect of the rulings of the supreme court of Georgia in construing the sections of the Political Code governing this subject.\n A perusal of the opinions delivered in these cases leaves no doubt in our minds that the supreme court of Georgia has held the taxing scheme of the state of Georgia, as laid down in its statutes, to be that, while it provides for a method of valuation in case of the return of property for taxtion, it does not in- \n\n[207 U.S. 127, 137]\n\u00a0\n tend to give to the taxpayer who fails to return property legally liable to be assessed any opportunity to be heard as to the value of the property or the amount of the assessment. But the failure to return places it within the power and duty of the collector to make an assessment final and conclusive upon the taxpayer without hearing, for, in its latest utterance upon the subject (124 Ga. 617), that learned court said:\n'The Georgia law affords to every citizen, individual or corporate, ample facilities for the preservation of his rights as against the tax gatherer, always provided that he makes a return to the proper officer of the property that he owns. It presupposes that the taxpayer will disclose to the officer all of his taxable property, and it requires him to know whether his property is taxable or not. The requirement of candor in disclosing the ownership of property is really at the foundation of our tax system. So long as the citizen complies with that requirement, he is afforded every opportunity to dispute with the state the question of the value of his property and the amount of tax to be levied thereon. When he fails to return, in whole or in part, fraudulently or through an honest mistake, he then and there becomes a defaulter, and the door of opportunity is closed to him, so far as the right to have the mutual rights between himself and the taxing power adjusted by arbitration is concerned. In other words, ample 'machinery' is available to the citizen who makes full returns; deprivation of the right to be further heard is one of the penalties visited upon the defaulter. The collecting officer must ascertain as best he can the amount of property to be taxed, as well as its value, and take summary means for its collection. This, it seems to us, is the scheme of taxation contemplated by the laws of this state. Whether or not it is consistent with a wise public policy we do not undertake to determine. That it is not unconstitutional we are fully satisfied.'\n\n It would be impossible to reconcile the different holdings in the state courts upon this subject. One class holds that upon the assessment of omitted property the taxpayer has no right \n\n[207 U.S. 127, 138]\n\u00a0\n to be heard, having by his failure to return submitted himself to 'the doom of the assessor.' Another class holds that in such cases there must be an opportunity to be heard before the taxpayer can be thus assessed, and that to deny him such right as a penalty for failure to return is a denial of due process of law secured to the taxpayer by many state Constitutions as well as the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.\n Of course, this court, as the ultimate arbiter of rights secured by the Federal Constitution, is charged with the duty of determining this question for itself.\n Former adjudications in this court have settled the law to be that the assessment of a tax is action judicial in its nature, requiring for the legal exertion of the power such opportunity to appear and be heard as the circumstances of the case require. Davidson v. New Orleans, \n96 U.S. 97\n, 24 L. ed. 616; Weyerhaueser v. Minnesota, \n176 U.S. 550\n, 44 L. ed. 583, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 485; Hagar v. Reclamation Dist. No. 108, \n111 U.S. 701\n, 28 L. ed. 569, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 663.\n In the late case of Security Trust & S. V. Co. v. Lexington, \n203 U.S. 323\n, 51 L. ed. 204, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 87, decided at the last term of this court, the subject underwent consideration, and it was there held that, before an assessment of taxes could be made upon omitted property, notice to the taxpayer, with an opportunity to be heard, was essential, and that somewhere during the process of the assessment the taxpayer must have an opportunity to be heard, and that this notice must be provided as an essential part of the statutory provision, and not awarded as a mere matter of favor or grace. In that case it was further held that where the procedure in the state court gave the taxpayer an opportunity to be heard upon the value of his property and extent of the tax in a proceeding to enjoin its collection the requirement of due process of law was satisfied.\n Applying the principles thus settled to the statutory law of Georgia, as construed by its highest court, does the system provide due process of law for the taxpayer in contesting the validity of taxes assessed under its requirements?\n Under the scheme provided for, if the property is withheld \n\n[207 U.S. 127, 139]\n\u00a0\n from return, the comptroller, without notice or opportunity for hearing, must proceed to value the property, and his valuation is final and conclusive, unless the taxpayer can show-a very unlikely contingency-that the taxing officer has acted in bad faith in making the assessment. Against the assessment thus made there is no relief in the courts of the state upon proceedings brought to collect the taxes or by bill to enjoin their collection. The penalty of failure to return, no matter how honest or well grounded the taxpayer may have been in his belief that the property was not subject to taxation, compels him to submit to the final and conclusive assessment made by the taxing officer.\n It may be conceded that, under the provisions of  855, the duty to return property omitted in former years is a continuing one, and that, under  812 of the Political Code, upon such return the system of arbitration of value may be open to the taxpayer; but if for good reason, the taxpayer contests the taxability of his property, and does not return it, the door of opportunity is closed upon him.\n As in the present case, courts may differ as to the taxable character of the property, but the taxpayer must concede its taxability, or be forever concluded by a determination of its value judicial in its nature ( Hagar v. Reclamation Dist. No. 108, \n111 U.S. 701\n, 28 L. ed. 569, 572, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 663), in a proceeding where he has no legal right to a hearing.\n But it is contended that plaintiffs in error had an opportunity to be heard, and were in fact heard, upon the question of the value of their property upon an issue made by an amendment to the answer in the superior court, after the case went back from the supreme court, tendering an issue and asking the court to pass upon the value of the property.\n Upon this subject we think the decision of the supreme court does not leave in doubt the effect of such hearing upon this issue. For it is said ( 125 Ga. 605):\n'As to those years in which the plaintiff had an opportunity to return its property for taxation and failed to do so, and for \n\n[207 U.S. 127, 140]\n\u00a0\n which the property has been assessed by the comptroller general, whether the property has been excessively assessed cannot now be inquired into. Under the former ruling in this case it is concluded by the failure to return the property at the time required by law, and must bear the burden of the assessment made in conformity to law. There was neither averment nor proof that the assessment was the result of fraud or corruption on the part of the comptroller general. If there had been, a different question would have been presented.'\n\n And further, in the same opinion (125 Ga. 616):\n'The plaintiffs contend that the valuation placed by the comptroller general upon the stock was excessive. The defendant contended that, as the plaintiff was a defaulter, the valuation of the comptroller general was conclusive under the law. In an amendment to the answer, the defendant alleged that the valuation placed upon the stock by the plaintiff was not its true market value, 'but, on the contrary, the true market value is as assessed by the comptroller general,' and concluded the amendment with a prayer 'that the court may so find and decree.' The plaintiff objected to the allowance of this amendment on the ground that the court was without jurisdiction to assess or revalue the same for the purpose of taxation, and that the prayer was vague and indefinite. The court ruled that it could not in this case decide or fix the value of the stock for the purpose of determining the amount for which the execution should proceed, but that it would hear evidence with a view of determining whether the assessment was excessive, and refused to strike the prayer. Evidence was heard in reference to the method adopted by the comptroller general in reaching the valuation placed by him upon the stock, and there was a finding in the final decree that the valuation was not excessive. As has been said, there was evidence justifying this finding of fact. Under the circumstances, even if there was any error in refusing to strike the prayer of the amendment to the answer, the error was not of such a character as to require a reversal of the judgment.' \n\n[207 U.S. 127, 141]\n\u00a0\n That is to say, the supreme court had already decided that the taxpayer, being in default of return, was not entitled to be heard upon the valuation of his property, except for the purpose of attacking the assessment for 'fraud or corruption' in the assessing officer, and the testimony did not show such excessive valuation as, within the rule laid down in both decisions, would avoid the action of the comptroller general.\n\n The record discloses that for many years this class of property was not regarded as taxable in Georgia, and was not returned for taxation in the state. But it is contended that the taxpayer here stands in the attitude of one acting contumaciously, and denying the validity of the tax after this court had practically decided its validity against the plaintiffs in error in Wright v. Louisville & N. R. Co. \n195 U.S. 219\n, 49 L. ed. 167, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 16. But, as we have seen, the supreme court of Georgia has expressly eliminated the element of bad faith in the taxpayer from the findings upon which its decision rests. The Wright Case was held not to have concluded the contention that plaintiffs were denied the equal protection of the laws, in that no other person or corporation in Georgia was assessed upon stock in a foreign corporation, nor the validity of the claim that the stock was not held in Georgia, nor other grounds alleged in the petitions, except so far as the Georgia railroad was concerned for the year 1900. 124 Ga. 607, 53 S. E. 251. We must decide the case in view of its relations to a taxpayer not fraudulently concealing his property, and honestly contending, with reasonable grounds for the contention, that it is not taxable under the laws of the state.\n As we have seen, the system provided in Georgia by the statutes of the state as construed by its highest court requires of the taxpayer that he return all his property, whether its liability is fairly contestable or not, upon pain of an ex parte valuation, against which there is no relief in the tax proceedings or in the courts, except in those cases where fraud or corruption can be shown in the action of the assessing officer.\n Reluctant as we are to interfere with the enforcement of \n\n[207 U.S. 127, 142]\n\u00a0\n the tax laws of a state, we are constrained to the conclusion that this system does not afford that due process of law which adjudges upon notice and opportunity to be heard, which it was the intention of the 14th Amendment to protect against impairment by state action.\n The judgments of the Supreme Court of Georgia are reversed and the cases remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n matters required to be returned as aforesaid, below the true amount, or false in any particular, or in anywise contrary to law, he shall correct the same and assess the true amount, from the best information at his command, within sixty days. In all cases of assessment or of correction of returns, as herein provided, the officer or person making such returns shall receive notice and shall have the privilege within twenty days after such notice, to refer the question of true value or amount, as the case may be, to arbitrators,-one chosen by himself and one chosen by the comptroller general-with power to choose an umpire in case of disagreement, and their award shall be final.\n Section 813. When No Return, Comptroller to Assess. In cases of failure to make return the comptroller general shall make an assessment from the best information he can procure, which assessment shall be conclusive upon said corporations, companies, persons, agencies, or institutions.\n Section 814. Collection of Tax, How Enforced. In all cases of default of payment of taxes upon returns or assessments, the comptroller general shall enforce collections in the manner now provided by law.\n Section 847. Defaulters to be Doubly Taxed. If a person fails to make a re- \n turn, in whole or in part, or fails to affix a value to his property, it is the duty of the receiver to make the valuation and assess the taxation thereon, and in all other respects to make the return for the defaulting person from the best information he can obtain, and, having done so, he shall double the tax in the last column of the digest against such defaulters, after having placed the proper market value or specific return in the proper column; and for every year's default the defaulter shall be taxed double until a return is made.\n Section 855. Taxes for Former Years, How Returned and Collected. Receivers and collectors are required to receive the returns and to collect the taxes thereon for former years, when any person is in default, which taxes shall be assessed according to the law in force at the time the default occurred, and shall be so specified in the digest.\n Section 874. Defaulting Corporations. If any corporations, company, person, agency, or institution, who are required to make their returns to the comptroller general, shall fail to return the taxable property, or specifics, or pay annually the taxes for which they are liable to the state treasury, the comptroller general shall issue against them an execution for the amount of taxes due, according to law, together with the costs and penalties.\n Section 879. When There is No Return. When there is no return by which to assess the tax the comptroller general shall, from the best information he can procure, assess in his discretion. \n\n\n\n\n","26":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHAMBERS v.

Anderson for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[207 U.S. 142, 144]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George F. Arrel, James P. Wilson, and Arrel, wilson, & Harrington for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[207 U.S. 142, 146]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Moody delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a writ of error directed to the supreme court of the state of Ohio. The plaintiff in error is the widow of Henry E. Chambers, who, while in the employ of the defendant in error as a locomotive engineer, and engaged in the performance of his duty, received injuries from which he shortly afterwards died. Both husband and wife were, at the time of the injuries and death, citizens of Pennsylvania, and the wife has since continued to be such. The injuries and death occurred in Pennsylvania. The widow brought an action in the court of common pleas of the state of Ohio against the defendant railroad, alleging that the injuries were caused by its negligence. In that action she sought to recover damages under certain parts of the Constitution and laws of Pennsylvania printed in the margin, which provided for the recovery of damages \n\n[207 U.S. 142, 147]\n\u00a0\n for death. The plaintiff had a verdict and judgment in the court of common pleas, from which, by petition in error, the case was removed first to an intermediate court and then to the supreme court of the state. There it was insisted by the defendant that the action could not be maintained in the courts of Ohio. The supreme court sustained this contention, reversed the judgments of the court below, and entered judgment for the defendant. A statute of Ohio provided that 'whenever the death of a citizen of this state has been or may be caused by a wrongful act, neglect, or default in another state, territory, or foreign country, for which a right to maintain an action and recover damages in respect thereof is given by a statute of such other state, territory, or foreign country, such right of action may be enforced in this state within the time prescribed for the commencement of such action by the statute of such other state, territory, or foreign country.' [Bates, Anno. Stat.  6134a.] There was no other statutory provision on the subject. The supreme court held that the action authorized by this statute for a death occurring in another state was only when the death was that of a citizen of Ohio; that the common law of the state forbade such action; and that, as the person for whose death damages were demanded in this case was not a citizen of Ohio, the action would not lie. The plaintiff brings the case here on writ of error, alleging that the statute thus construed and the judg- \n\n[207 U.S. 142, 148]\n\u00a0\n ment based upon that construction violate article 4,  2, paragraph 1, of the Constitution of the United States, which provides that 'the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states.' This allegation presents the only question for our consideration.\n The defendant objects to our jurisdiction to re-examine the judgment because the Federal question was not properly and seasonably raised in the courts of the state. But it clearly and unmistakably appears from the opinion of the supreme court that the Federal question was assumed to be in issue, was decided against the claim of Federal right, and that the decision of the question was essential to the judgment rendered. This is enough to give this court the authority to re-examine that question on writ of error. San Jose Land & Water Co. v. San Jose Ranch Co. \n189 U.S. 177\n, 47 L. ed. 765, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 487; Montana ex rel. Haire v. Rice, \n204 U.S. 291\n, 51 L. ed. 490, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 281.\n In the decision of the merits of the case there are some fundamental principles which are of controlling effect. The right to sue and defend in the courts is the alternative of force. In an organized society it is the right conservative of all other rights, and lies at the foundation of orderly government. It is one of the highest and most essential privileges of citizenship, and must be allowed by each state to the citizens of all other states to the precise extent that it is allowed to its own citizens. Equality of treatment in this respect is not left to depend upon comity between the states, but is granted and protected by the Federal Constitution. Corfield v. Coryell, 4 Wash. C. C. 371, 380, Fed.

Rep. 165, per Harlan, J.\n But, subject to the restrictions of the Federal Constitution, the state may determine the limits of the jurisdiction of its courts, and the character of the controversies which shall be heard in them. The state policy decides whether and to what \n\n[207 U.S. 142, 149]\n\u00a0\n extent the state will entertain in its courts transitory actions, where the causes of action have arisen in other jurisdictions. Different states may have different policies, and the same state may have different policies at different times. But any policy the state may choose to adopt must operate in the same way on its own citizens and those of other states. The privileges which it affords to one class it must afford to the other. Any law by which privileges to begin actions in the courts are given to its own citizens and withheld from the citizens of other states is void, because in conflict with the supreme law of the land.\n The law of Ohio must be brought to the test of these fundamental principles. It appears from the decision under review (and we need no other authority) that, by the common law of the state, the courts had no jurisdiction to entertain actions to recover damages for death where the cause of action arose under the laws of other states or countries. This rule was universal in its application. The citizenship of the persons who brought action or of the person for whose death a remedy was sought was immaterial. If the death was caused outside the state and the right of action arose under laws foreign to the state, its courts were impartially closed to all persons seeking a remedy, entirely irrespective of their citizenship. The common law, however, was modified by a statute which, as amended, became the statute under consideration here. By this statute the courts were given jurisdiction over certain actions of this description, while the common law was left to control all others. A discrimination was thus introduced into the law of the state. The discrimination was based solely on the citizenship of the deceased. The courts were open in such cases to plaintiffs who were citizens of other states if the deceased was a citizen of Ohio; they were closed to plaintiffs who were citizens of Ohio if the deceased was a citizen of another state. So far as the parties to the litigation are concerned, the state, by its laws, made no discrimination based on citizenship, and offered precisely the same privileges to citizens of \n\n[207 U.S. 142, 150]\n\u00a0\n other states which it allowed to its own. There is, therefore, at least a literal conformity with the requirements of the Constitution.\n But it may be urged, on the other hand, that the conformity is only superficial; that the death action may be given by the foreign law to the person killed, at the instant when he was vivus et mortuus, and made to survive and pass to his representatives (Higgins v. Central New England & W. R. Co. 155 Mass. 176, 31 Am. St. Rep. 544, 29 N. E. 534); that in such cases it is the right of action of the deceased which is brought into court by those who have it by survivorship; and that, as the test of jurisdiction is the citizenship of the person in whom the right of action was originally vested, and the action is entertained if that person was a citizen of Ohio and declined if he was a citizen of another state, there is, in a real and substantial sense, a discrimination forbidden by the Constitution.\n If such a case should arise, and be denied hearing in the Ohio courts by the Ohio law, then, as the denial would be based upon the citizenship of that person in whom the right of action originally vested, it might be necessary to consider whether the Ohio law did not, in substance, grant privileges to Ohio citizens which it withheld from citizens of other states. But no such case is before us. The Pennsylvania statute which created the right of action sought to be enforced in the Ohio courts has been construed by the courts of Pennsylvania. The applicable section is  19 of the act of 1851. Of it the Pennsylvania court said in Fink v. Garman, 40 Pa. 95:\n'The 18th section was apparently intended to regulate a common-law right of action by securing to it survivorship; but the 19th section was creative of a new cause of action, wholly unknown to the common law. And the right of action was not given to the person suffering the injury, since no man could sue for his own death, but it his widow or personal representatives. It was not survivorship of the cause of action which the legislature meant to provide for by this section, but \n\n[207 U.S. 142, 151]\n\u00a0\n the creation of an original cause of action in favor of a surviving widow or personal representative.'\n\n This is the settled interpretation of the act. Mann v. Weiand, 81* Pa. 243; Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Bock, 93 Pa. 427; Engles's Estate, 21 Pa. Co. Ct. 299; McCafferty v. Pennsylvania R. Co. 193 Pa. 339, 74 Am. St. Rep. 690, 44 Atl. 435. It appears clearly, therefore, that the cause of action which the plaintiff sought to enforce was one created for her benefit and vested originally in her. She has not been denied access to the Ohio courts because she is not a citizen of that state, but because the cause of action which she presents is not cognizable in those courts. She would have been denied hearing of the same cause for the same reason if she had been a citizen of Ohio. In excluding her cause of action from the courts the law of Ohio has not been influenced by her citizenship, which is regarded as immaterial. We are unable to see that in this case the plaintiff has been refused any right whichd the Constitution of the United States confers upon her, and accordingly the judgment is affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes, concurring:\n Although I do not dissent from the reasoning of the judgment, I prefer to rest my agreement on the proposition that if the statute cannot operate as it purports to operate it does not operate at all. I do not think that it can be presumed to mean to give to all persons a right to sue in case the Constitution forbids it to make the more limited grant that it attempts. Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co. \n184 \nU.S. 540, 565\n, 46 S. L. ed 679, 692, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 431. Apart from the statute no one can maintain an action like this in Ohio. I may add that I do not understand that there is anything in the judgment that contradicts my opinion as to the law.\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan (with whom concurred Mr. Justice White and Mr. Justice McKenna), dissenting:\n The plaintiff in error, Elizabeth M. Chambers, a citizen of Pennsylvania, sought by this action against the Baltimore & \n\n[207 U.S. 142, 152]\n\u00a0\n Ohio Railroad Company, in the common pleas court of Mahoning county, Ohio, to recover damages on account of her husband's death in Pennsylvania in 1902,-his death having been caused, it was alleged, by the negligence of the defendant railroad company while operating a part of its line in Pennsylvania. The railroad company was brought into court by due service of summons, and there was a trial resulting in a verdict and judgment in favor of the plaintiff for $3,000. The case was carried upon writ of error to the circuit court of Mahoning county and the judgment was there affirmed. That judgment of affirmance was reversed by the supreme court of Ohio, with directions to enter judgment for the railroad company.\n That the laws of Pennsylvania give a right of action in favor of the widow of a deceased whose death is 'occasioned by unlawful violence or negligence' is not disputed. It is equally clear that the present plaintiff's cause of action is not local, but is transitory, in its nature, and, speaking generally, can be maintained in any jurisdiction where the wrongdoer may be found and be brought before the court. Dennick v. Central R. Co. \n103 U.S. 11\n, 26 L. ed. 439; Stewart v. Baltimore & O. R. Co. \n168 U.S. 445\n, 42 L. ed. 537, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 105.\n By a statute of Ohio (1902) in force when this action was brought, it was provided that 'whenever the death of a citizen of this state has been or may be caused by a wrongful act, neglect, or default in another state, territory, or foreign country, for which a right to maintain an action and recover damages in respect thereof is given by a statute of such other state, territory, or foreign country, such right of action may be enforced in this state within the time prescribed for the commencement of such action by the statute of such other state, territory, or foreign country.' 95 Ohio Laws, 401. By a previous statute (1894) suits of that kind were allowed in Ohio when death was caused by a wrongful act, negligence, or default in another state if such suits were allowed in the state where the death occurred. But that statute, as stated by the court in this case, was repealed by the above act of 1902. So that the \n\n[207 U.S. 142, 153]\n\u00a0\n court, in the present case, held that the act of 1902 changed the former law in two essential particulars: '1. It dispenses with the condition that the state in which the wrongful death occurs shall enforce in its courts the statute of this state of like character. 2. It in terms limits the right therein given to maintain an action in this state for wrongful death occurring in another state, to actions for causing the death of citizens of Ohio, where as original  6134a gave such right without limitation or restriction as to citizenship.' Again, the court said: 'Having regard, then, to the scope and effect of the provisions of the section amended, and to the special character of the amendments made, we think it clear that the legislature, by the adoption of amended  6134a [the act of 1902], undertook and intended thereby to limit and restrict the right to recover in the courts of this state for a wrongful death occurring in another state, to those cases where the person killed was, at the time of his death, a citizen of Ohio.' That there may be no mistake as to the decision, I quote the official syllabus of the present case, which, by the law of Ohio, is to be taken as indicating the point actually in judgment: 'No action can be maintained in the courts of this state upon a cause of action for wrongful death occurring in another state, except where the person wrongfully killed was a citizen of the state of Ohio.' 73 Ohio St. 16, 76 N. E. 91.\n It thus appears that the final judgment in this case for the railroad company rests upon the distinct ground that the courts of Ohio cannot, under the statute of that state, take cognizance of an action for damages on account of death occurring in another state and caused by wrongful act, neglect, or default, except where the person wrongfully killed was a citizen of Ohio. In that view, if two persons, one a citizen of Ohio and the other a citizen of Pennsylvania, traveling together on a railroad in Pennsylvania, should both be killed at the same moment and under precisely the same circumstances, in consequence of the negligence or default of the railroad company, the courts of Ohio are closed by its statute against any suit \n\n[207 U.S. 142, 154]\n\u00a0\n for damages brought by the widow or the estate of the citizen of Pennsylvania against the railroad company, but will be open to suit by the widow or the estate of the deceased citizen of Ohio, although by the laws of the state where the death occurred the widow or estate of each decedent would have, in the latter state, a valid cause of action.\n Is a state enactment having such effect repugnant to the clause of the Federal Constitution, art. 4,  2, which declares that 'the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states?' Will not that constitutional guaranty be shorn of much of its value if any state can reserve, either for its own citizens, or for the estates of its citizens, privileges and immunities which, even where the facts are the same, it denies to citizens or to the estates of citizens of other states?\n It is not necessary to fully enumerate the privileges and immunities secured against hostile discrimination by the constitutional provision in question. All agree that among such privileges and immunities are those which, under our institutions, are fundamental in their nature. I cordially assent to what is said upon this point in the opinion just delivered for the majority of the court. The opinion says: 'In the decision of the merits of the case there are some fundamental principles which are of controlling effect. The right to sue and defend in the courts is the alternative of force. In an organized society it is the right conservative of all other rights, and lies at the foundation of orderly government. It is one of the highest and most essential privileges of citizenship, and must be allowed by each state to the citizens of all other states to the precise extent that it is allowed to its own citizens. Equality of treatment in this respect is not left to depend upon comity between the states, but is granted and protected by the Federal Constitution. . . . The privileges which it [the state] affords to one class it must afford to the other. Any law by which privileges to begin actions in the courts are given to its own citizens and withheld from the citizens of other \n\n[207 U.S. 142, 155]\n\u00a0\n states is void, because in conflict with the supreme law of the land.'\n These views are supported by the former decisions of this and other courts. In the leading case of Corfield v. Coryell, 4 Wash. C. C. 371-380, Fed. Cas. No. 3,230, Mr. Justice Washington said: 'The inquiry is, What are the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states? We feel no hesitation in confining these expressions to those privileges and immunities which are, in their nature, fundamental, which belong, of right, to the citizens of all free governments, and which have, at all times, been enjoyed by the citizens of the several states which compose this Union, from the time of their becoming free, independent, and sovereign. What these fundamental principles are it would, perhaps, be more tedious than difficult to enumerate.' Among the particular privileges and immunities which are clearly to be deemed fundamental, the court in that case specifies the right 'to institute and maintain actions of any kind in the courts of the state.'\n In Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168, 180, 19 L. ed. 357, 360, the court, speaking by Mr. Justice Field, said: 'It was undoubtedly the object of the clause in question [Const. art. 4,  2] to place the citizens of each state upon the same footing with citizens of other states, so far as the advantages resulting from citizenship in those states are concerned. It relieves them from the disabilities of alienage in other states; it inhibits discriminating legislation against them by other states; it gives them the right of free ingress into other states, and egress from them; it insures to them in other states the same freedom possessed by the citizens of those states in the acquisition and enjoyment of property and in the pursuit of happiness; and it secures to them in other states the equal protection of their laws. It has been justly said that no provision in the Constitution has tended so strongly to constitute the citizens of the United States one people as this. Indeed, without some provision of the kind removing from the citizens of each state the disabilities of alienage in the other states, and giving them equality of privilege with citizens of \n\n[207 U.S. 142, 156]\n\u00a0\n those states, the Republic would have constituted little more than a league of states; it would not have constituted the Union which now exists.'\n So, in Ward v. Maryland, 12 Wall. 418-430, 20 L. ed. 449-452, the court, after referring to Corfield v. Coryell, above cited, and speaking by Mr. Justice Clifford, stated that the right 'to maintain actions in the courts of the state' was fundamental, and was protected by the constitutional clause in question against state enactments that discriminated against citizens of other states.\n Referring to the cases just cited, and to the constitutional clause in question, Mr. Justice Miller, speaking for the court in the Slaughter- House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 77, 21 L. ed. 394, 409, said: 'Its sole purpose was to declare to the several states that whatever those rights, as you grant or establish them to your own citizens, or as you limit or qualify, or impose restrictions on their exercise, the same, neither more nor less, shall be the measure of the rights of citizens of other states within your jurisdiction.'\n In Cole v. Cunningham, \n133 U.S. 107\n-144, 33 L. ed. 538-542, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 269-271, the present Chief Justice, speaking for the court, said: 'The intention of  2 of article 4 was to confer on the citizens of the several states a general citizenship, and to communicate all the privileges and immunities which the citizens of the same state would be entitled to under the like circumstances, and this includes the right to institute actions.'\n In the more recent case of Blake v. McClung, \n172 U.S. 239\n-256, 43 L. ed. 432-438, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 165-172, the court said: 'We must not be understood as saying that a citizen of one state is entitled to enjoy in another state every privilege that may be given in the latter to its own citizens. There are privileges that may be accorded by a state to its own people in which citizens of other states may not participate except in conformity to such reasonable regulations as may be established by the state. For instance, a state cannot forbid citizens of other states from suing in its courts, that right being enjoyed by its own people; but it may require a nonresident, although a citizen of another state, to give bond for costs, although such bond be not required of a resident. Such \n\n[207 U.S. 142, 157]\n\u00a0\n a regulation of the internal affairs of a state cannot reasonably be characterized as hostile to the fundamental rights of citizens of other states. . . . The Constitution forbids only such legislation affecting citizens of the respective states as will substantially or practically but a citizen of one state in a condition of alienage when he is within or when he removes to another state, or when, asserting in another state the rights that commonly appertain to those who are part of the political community known as the people of the United States, by and for whom the government of the Union was ordained and established.'\n These cases, I think, require the reversal of the judgment of the supreme court upon the ground that it denies to the plaintiff a right secured by the Constitution of the United States. The statute of Ohio, we have seen, closes the doors of the courts of that state against the present plaintiff alone because her deceased husband was not, at the time of his death, a citizen of Ohio. Thus, every citizen of Ohio, when in another state, for whatever purpose, is accompanied by the assurance on the part of his state that its courts will be open for suit by his widow or representative if his death, while in another state, is caused by the negligence or default of another person or company. But that privilege is denied by the Ohio statute to the representative of citizens of other states meeting death under like circumstances. Indeed, if a citizen of Ohio should go into another state, and, while there, wilfully, or by some wrongful act, neglect, or default on his part, cause the death of someone, although he might be liable to a suit for damages in the state where death occurred, yet, if sued for damages in the courts of his own state, he need only plead in bar of the action in Ohio that the decedent was not, at the time of his death a citizen of Ohio. Such, it seems to me, is the operation of the statute of Ohio as it is interpreted by the court below.\n The supreme court of Ohio, it will be observed, does not base its judgment upon any common law of the state apart from its statutes. It says: 'From a consideration of the statutes \n\n[207 U.S. 142, 158]\n\u00a0\n hereinbefore referred to, and the former decisions of this court, we think it must now be held to be the recognized policy and established law of this state, that an action for wrongful death occurring in another state will not be enforced in the courts of this state, except where the person killed was, at the time of his death, a citizen of Ohio.' It places its judgment on its statutes and judicial decisions, which it regards as together indicating the policy and law of the state to be such as to preclude an action for damages, except where the deceased was a citizen of Ohio. That exception, upon whatever basis it may be rested, must fall before the Constitution of the United States and be treated as a nullity. The denial to the widow or representative of Chambers of the right to sue in Ohio, upon the ground that he was not a citizen of Ohio when killed, was the denial, in every essential sense, of a fundamental privilege belonging to him under the Constitution, in virtue tue of his being a citizen of one of the states of the Union,-the right to sue and defend in the courts of justice, which right this court concedes to be 'one of the highest and most essential privileges of citizenship.' While in life Chambers enjoyed the right-and it was a most valuable right-of such protection as came from the rule established in Pennsylvania, that in case of his death in consequence of the negligence of others, the wrong done to the deceased in his lifetime could be remedied by emans of suit brought in the name and for the benefit of his widow or personal representative. But Ohio takes this right of protection from him; for the Ohio court would have taken cognizance of this action if the decedent, Chambers, had been, when killed, a citizen of Ohio, while it denies relief to his widow, and puts her out of court solely because her husband was, when killed, a citizen of another state. It thus accords to the Ohio widow of a deceased Ohio citizen a privilege which it withholds from the Pennaylvania widow of a deceased Pennsylvania citizen. If the statutes of Ohio had excluded from the jurisdiction of the courts of that state all actions for damages on account of death, a different question would be presented. But that is \n\n[207 U.S. 142, 159]\n\u00a0\n not what Ohio has assumed to do. As already shown, it allows suits for damages like the present one, where the death occurred in another state, provided the deceased was a citizen of Ohio, but prohibits them where he was a citizen of some other state. The final judgment in this case therefore denies a fundamental right inhering in citizenship, and protected by  2 of article 4 of the Constitution. The Constitution is the supreme law of the land. But it would not be supreme if any right given by it could be overridden either by state enactment or by judicial decision. In Higgins v. Central New England & W. R. Co. 155 Mass. 176, 180, 31 Am. St. Rep. 544, 547, 29 N. E. 534, 535, the supreme judicial court of Massachusetts, after referring to transitory causes of action which did not exist at common law, but were created by the statute of another state and passed to the administrator of the deceased, said: 'When an action is brought upon it here, the plaintiff is not met by any difficulty upon these points. Whether our courts will entertain it depends upon the general principles which are to be applied in determining the question whether actions founded upon the laws of other states shall be heard here. These principles require that, in cases of other than penal actions, the foreign law, if not contrary to our public policy, or to abstract justice or pure morals, or calculated to injure the state or its citizens, shall be recognized and enforced here, if we have jurisdiction of all necessary parties, and if we can see that, consistently with our own forms of procedure and law of trials, we can do substantial justice between the parties.' The statute of Pennsylvania which gave the plaintiff, as widow of the deceased, a right to sue for damages, does not offend natural justice or good morals, nor is it calculated to injure the citizens of any state, not even those of Ohio, nor can it be said to offend any policy of that state which has been made applicable equally to its own citizens and citizens of other states. The case is plainly one in which Ohio attempts, in reference to certain kinds of actions that are maintainable in perhaps every state of the Union, including Ohio, to give to its own citizens privileges which it denies, under like circumstances, \n\n[207 U.S. 142, 160]\n\u00a0\n to citizens of other states. To a citizen of Ohio it says: 'If you go into Pennsylvania, and are killed while there, in consequence of the negligence or default of someone, your widow may have access to the Ohio courts in a suit for damages, provided the wrongdoer can be reached in Ohio by service of process.' But to the citizen of Pennsylvania it says: 'If you come to your death in that state by reason of the negligence or default of someone, even if the wrongdoer be a citizen of Ohio, your widow shall not sue the Ohio wrongdoer in an Ohio court for damages, because, and only because, you are a citizen of another state.' This is an illegal discrimination against living citizens of other states, and the difficulty is not met by the suggestion that no discrimination is made against the widow of the deceased because of her citizenship in another state. The statute of Pennsylvania in question had in view the protection of persons, while alive, against negligence or default causing death. It must have had that object in view. I submit that no state can authorize its courts to deny or disregard the constitutional guaranty that the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states.\n With entire respect for the views of others, I am constrained to say that, in my opinion, so much of the local law, whether statutory or otherwise, as permits suits of this kind for damages where the deceased was a citizen of Ohio, but forbids such suits where the deceased was not a citizen of Ohio, is unconstitutional. The judgment under review should be reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n Sections 18 and 19 of the act of April 15, 1851, are as follows: 'Sec. 18. No action hereafter brought to recover damages for injuries to the person by negligence or default shall abate by reason of the death of the plaintiff; but the personal representatives of the deceased may be substituted as plaintiff, and prosecute the suit to final judgment and satisfaction.' 'Sec. 19. Whenever death shall be occasioned by unlawful violence or negligence, and no suit for damages be brought by the party injured, during his or her life, the widow of any such deceased, or, if there be no widow, the personal representatives, may maintain an action for and recover damages for the death thus occasioned.' SECTIONS 1 AND 2 OF THE ACT OF APRIL 26, 1855, are as follows: 'sec. 1. The persons entitled to recover damages for any injury causing death shall be the husband, widow, children, or parents of the deceased, and no other relative, and the sum recovered shall go to them in the proportion they would take his or her personal estate in case of intestacy, and that without liability to creditors.' 'Sec. 2. The declaration shall state who are the parties entitled in such action; the action shall be brought within one year after the death, and not thereafter.' By  21, article 3, of the Constitution of the state of Pennsylvania of 1874, it is provided as follows, to wit: 'Sec. 21. No act of the general assembly shall limit the amount to be recovered for injuries resulting in death, or for injuries to person or property, and in case of death from such injuries the right of action shall survive, and the general assembly shall prescribe for whose benefit such actions shall be prosecuted.'\n\n\n\n\n\n","27":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHANLER v. KELSEY(1907)\nNo. 240\nArgued: March 14, 1907Decided: April 15, 1907\n\n\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Day:\n This is a writ of error to the surrogates' court of the county of New York, state of New York, but its real purpose is to \n\n[205 U.S. 466, 467]\n\u00a0\n review a decision of the court of appeals of the state, sustaining an order of the surrogates' court, which imposed a transfer tax upon certain estates arising under appointment by Laura Astor Delano, deceased. 176 N. Y. 486, 64 L.R.A. 279, 68 N. E. 871.\n Laura Astor Delano was the daughter of William B. Astor. Upon the occasion of her marriage, in 1844, to Frank H. Delano, Mr. Astor executed a deed in the nature of a marriage settlement, conveying certain real and personal property to trustees in trust to pay the income to said Laura Delano for life, with remainder to her issue in fee, or, in default of issue, to her heirs in fee; and giving her power, in her discretion, to appoint the remainder 'amongst her said issue or heirs, in such manner and proportions as she may appoint by instrument in its nature testamentary, to be acknowledged by her as a deed, and in the presence of two witnesses, or published by her as a will.'\n In the years 1848, 1849, and 1865 William B. Astor made other deeds, by way of addition to the original marriage settlement, substantially similar in their terms. That of 1848 conveyed certain real estate to Mrs. Delano for life, with power of appointment as to said premises, or any part thereof, 'to and among her said issue, brothers, sister Alida, or their issue, in such manner and proportions as she may appoint by instrument in its nature testamentary, to be acknowledged by her as a deed in the presence of two witnesses, or acknowledged by her as a will.' The deed of 1849 conveyed to trustees certificates for $50,000 of the public debt of Ohio; 'to hold the same in trust for the benefit of Laura Astor Delano during her life, and at her death to transfer and convey the capital of the said stock to her issue; but, in case she left no issue, then to her surviving brothers and sister Alida and to the issue of any of them who died leaving issue; and said instrument contained a power of appointment to Laura Astor Delano as follows: 'Provided, however, that it shall be lawful for the said Laura, by any instrument executed duly as a will of personal estate, to dispose of the said capital unto and amongst her \n\n[205 U.S. 466, 468]\n\u00a0\n issue, brothers, sister and their issue, in such shares and proportions as she may think fit, and upon such limitations, by way of trust or otherwise, as, in her discretion, may be lawfully devised.\" These deeds were absolutely irrevocable, took effect upon delivery, and were not made in contemplation of the death of the grantor.\n Laura A. Delano died June 15, 1902, in Geneva, Switzerland, leaving no descendants. By her last will and testament, duly admitted to probate in the county of New York on October 14, 1902, she exercised the power of appointment conferred in the deeds from her father in favor of the plaintiffs in error.\n One of the plaintiffs in error, Arthur Astor Carey, a grandson of William B. Astor, and an appointee to whom Mrs. Delano had appointed the property originally conveyed by the deeds of 1848 and 1849, took an appeal from the order of the surrogates' court refusing to dismiss the petition to the appellate division of the supreme court, where it was held that the act under which the tax was imposed, as applied to this case, was unconstitutional. Re Delano, 82 App. Div. 147, 81 N. Y. Supp. 762. The state comptroller appealed to the court of appeals from the decision of the appellate division.\n That court sustained the right to impose the transfer tax upon the interests appointed by Mrs. Delano under the powers created by the deeds above referred to.

Hill for defendant in error. \n\n[205 U.S. 466, 472]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n The tax in controversy was imposed under an amendment of the general transfer-tax law of the state of New York, chapter 284, Laws of 1897, which provides as follows:\n'Whenever any person or corporation shall exercise a power of appointment derived from any disposition of property made either before or after the passage of this act, such appointment, when made, shall be deemed a transfer, taxable under the provisions of this act, in the same manner as though the property to which such appointment relates belonged absolutely to the donee of such power, and had been bequeathed or devised by such donee by will; and whenever any person or corporation possessing such a power of appointment so derived shall omit or fail to exercise the same within the time provided therefor, in whole or in part, a transfer taxable under the provisions of this act shall be deemed to take place to the extent of such omissions or failure, in the same manner as though the persons or corporations thereby becoming entitled \n\n[205 U.S. 466, 473]\n\u00a0\n to the possession or enjoyment of the property to which such power related had succeeded thereto by a will of the donee of the power failing to exercise such power, taking effect at the time of such omission or failure.'\n\n The validity of this tax was attacked in the courts of New York upon objections pertaining to both the Federal and state Constitutions. The latter are not open here, and we shall consider the case only so far as it relates to the objections made to the validity of this statute by reason of alleged violations of the Federal Constitution. These are: First, that by the imposition of the tax the property of the beneficiaries is taken without due process of law, in violation of the 14th Amendment; and, second, that such taxation violates the obligation of a contract within the protection of  10 of article 1 of the Federal Constitution.\n The objection that the property is taken without due process of law is based upon the argument that the estate in remainder was derived from the deeds of William B. Astor, and not under the power of appointment received from those deeds by Mrs. Laura A. Delano. In support of this contention, common-law authorities are cited to the proposition that an estate created by the execution of a power takes effect in the same manner as if it had been created by the deed which raised the power; that the beneficiary takes, not under the execution of the power by the donee, but by authority and under grant from the grantor, in like manner as if the power and the instrument which created it had been incorporated into one instrument. 4 Kent, Com. 327; 2 Washb. Real Prop. 320. The argument is that the estate which arose by the exercise of the power came from William B. Astor, and not from Laura A. Delano, and was vested long before the passage of the amendment of 1897, under the authority of which the tax was imposed, and to tax the exercise of the power therefore takes property without due process of law.\n However technically correct it may be to say that the estate came from the donor, and not from the donee, of the power, it is \n\n[205 U.S. 466, 474]\n\u00a0\n self-evident that it was only upon the exercise of the power that the estate in the plaintiffs in error became complete. Without the exercise of the power of appointment the estates in remainder would have gone to all in the class named in the deeds of William B. Astor. By the exercise of this power some were devested of their estates and the same were vested in others. It may be that the donee had no interest in the estate as owner, but it took her act of appointment to finally transfer the estate to some of the class and take it from others.\n Notwithstanding the common-law rule that estates created by the execution of a power take effect as if created by the original deed, for some purposes the execution of the power is considered the source of title. It is so within the purpose of the registration acts. A person deriving title under an appointment is considered as claiming under the donee within the meaning of a covenant for quiet enjoyment. 2 Sugden, Powers, 3d ed. 19.\n'So, on an issue to try whether the plaintiff was entitled by two writings, or any other, purporting a will of J. S., and the evidence was of a feoffment to the use of such person as J. S. should appoint by his will, in which case it was contended that the devisees were in by the feoffment, and not by the will, the court held that this was only fictione juris, for that they were not in without the will, and therefore that was the principal part of the title, and such proof was good enough and pursuant to the issue, and a verdict was accordingly given for the plaintiff.' Sugden on Powers, vol. 2, p. 19, citing Bartlet v. Ramsden, 1 Keble, 570.\n\n So, in the present case, the plaintiffs in error are not in without the exercise of the power by the will of Mrs. Delano.\n By statute in England, for the purposes of taxation, it has been provided that the donee of the power shall be regarded, in case of a general power, as the one from whom the estate came. In Atty. Gen. v. Upton, L. R. 1 Exch. 224, the court of exchequer had under consideration the succession duty act (16, 17 Vict. chap. 51), and it was held that the \n\n[205 U.S. 466, 475]\n\u00a0\n appointee under a general power of appointment, taking effect on the death happening since the commencement of the act, takes succession from the donee of the power. The testator, Admiral Fanshawe, by will devised certain lands to the use of his wife, Caroline Fanshawe, for life, remainder to such use as she should by deed or will appoint, and, in default of appointment, for the use and benefit of testator's nephews, C. F. and J. F. Fanshawe, and their issue. She by deed appointed to the use that trustees should, after her death, receive an annuity during the lives of the wife of the testator's nephew, and of the children of the nephew by her, in trust for the separate use of the wife, Elizabeth Fanshawe. Section 4 of the act, which is there construed, provides that any person having a general power of appointment, under any disposition of property, taking effect upon the death of any person dying after the time appointed for the commencement of the act, shall, in the event of his making any appointment thereunder, be deemed to be entitled, at the time of his exercising such power, to the property or interest thereby appointed as a succession derived from the donor of the power. All the judges agreed that under  4 of the act the nephew's wife took the annuity as a succession from the testator's widow, and not from the testator himself; that, therefore, a duty of 10 per cent was payable. Bramwell, B., was of opinion that the duty was also payable under  2, which provides that 'every past or future disposition of property, by reason whereof any person has or shall become beneficially entitled to any property . . . shall be deemed to have conferred, or to confer, on the person entitled by reason of any such disposition . . . a succession.' In speaking of this section the Baron said:\n'Now, will these annuitants take by reason of the will of Admiral Fanshawe? We must look, not at the causa remota, but at the causa proxima, and that is the disposition of Caroline Fanshawe. Again, the act says that the term 'predecessor' 'shall denote the settlor, disponer, testator, obligor, ancestor, or other person from whom the interest of the successor is or \n\n[205 U.S. 466, 476]\n\u00a0\n shall be derived.' From whom, then , is the interest derived? As I said in Re Barker, 7 Hurlst. & N. 116, these are ordinary English words, and ought to be construed by lawyers as ordinary Englishmen would construe them. Now, not one man in a hundred would say that this interest was derived from Admiral Fanshawe nor from any other person than the donee of the power. I do not mean to deny or attempt to cast any doubt on the rule of law that an appointee takes his estate from the donor of the power, but I say that it is a rule not applicable to the construction of this statute, and it is not true, as is supposed, that there is any decision of the House of Lords to the contrary.'\n\n The learned Baron seems to have gone farther, as to  2, than his brethren were willing to. Atty. Gen. v. Mitchell, L. R. 6 Q. B. Div. 548. His observations are, nevertheless, suggestive.\n While the entire bench recognized the common-law rule that the estate is taken to come from the donor of the power, it enforced the statutory change as to a subsequent exercise of the power treating the estate as coming from the donee, by whose act it was appointed to the beneficiary.\n The statute of New York in question acts equally upon all persons similarly situated. It affects an estate which only became complete by the exercise of a power subsequent to its enactment.\n The exercise of the power bestowing property in the present case was made by will. And we need not consider the case, expressly reserved by the court of appeals in its opinion, as to the result if it had been exercised by deed.\n That the will was effectual to transfer the estate was ruled by the court of appeals, and its decision on this question is binding here, as was held in Orr v. Gilman, \n183 U.S. 278\n, 46 L. ed. 196, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 213, which came here for a review of a decision of the court of appeals of New York, rendered in Re Dows, 167 N. Y. 227, 52 L.R.A. 433, 88 Am. St. Rep. 509, 60 N. E. 439,-a case which arose under the same statute of 1897. In that case the testator devised real estate in trust to pay the income to his son for life, and, upon his death, to vest abso- \n\n[205 U.S. 466, 477]\n\u00a0\n lutely and at once in his children and the issue of his deceased children, as his son should appoint by will. If, however, the son should die intestate, the estate was to vest absolutely and at once in his children then living, and the issue of the deceased children. The son exercised the power of appointment by his last will, probated in 1899. The court of appeals held that the property was subject to the taxation imposed by the act of 1897; that such tax was on the right of succession, and not on the property. It became important in that case to determine whether the property passed by virtue of the will of the donor, David Dows, Senior, and then became vested in the grandchildren, or only became vested in them when the power of appointment was exercised by the will of David Dows, Junior.\n This court held that the answer to this question must, of course, be furnished by the court of appeals in that case. \n183 U.S. 282\n, 46 L. ed. 199, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 213. In other words, the court of appeals of New York had the exclusive right to construe instruments of title in that state, and determine for itself the creation and vesting of estates through wills under the laws of the state. 'The court of appeals held that it was the execution of the power of appointment which subjected grantees under it to the transfer tax. This conclusion is binding upon this court in so far as it involves a construction of the will and of the statute.' \n183 U.S. 288\n, 46 L. ed. 202, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 217. In the present case the New York court of appeals has spoken in no uncertain language upon the subject: 'As the tax is imposed upon the exercise of the power, it is unimportant how the power was created. The existence of the power is the important fact, for what may be done under it is not affected by its origin. If created by deed its efficiency is the same as if it had been created in the same form by will. No more and no less could be done by virtue of it in the one case than in the other. Its effective agency to produce the result intended is neither strengthened nor weakened by the nature of the instrument used by the donor of the power to create it. The power, however or whenever created, authorized the donee by her will to devest certain defeasible estates, \n\n[205 U.S. 466, 478]\n\u00a0\n and to vest them absolutely in one person. If this authority had been conferred by will instead of by deed, the right to act would have been precisely the same, and the power would have neither gained nor lost in force. . . .\n'As we said through Judge Cullen in the Dows Case: 'Whatever be the technical source of title of a grantee under a power of appointment, it cannot be denied that in reality and substance it is the execution of the power that gives to the grantee the property passing under it.' This accords with the statutory definition of a power as applied to real estate, for it includes an authority to create or revoke an estate therein. Real Property Law,  111. [Laws 1896, chap. 547, p. 577.] Such was the effect of the exercise of the power under consideration, for it both revoked and created estates in the real property and the interests in the personal property. No tax is laid on the power, or on the property, or on the original disposition by deed, but simply upon the exercise of the power by will, as an effective transfer for the purposes of the act.' 176 N. Y. 493, 494, 64 L.R.A. 282, 68 N. E. 872, 873.\n\n As in Orr v. Gilman, supra, we must accept this decision of the New York court of appeals holding that it is the exercise of the power which is the essential thing to transfer the estates upon which the tax is imposed. That power was exercised under the will of Laura Delano, a right which was conferred upon her under the laws of the state of New York, and for the exercise of which the statute was competent to impose the tax in the exercise of the sovereign power of the legislature over the right to make a disposition of property by will. United States v. Perkins, \n163 U.S. 625\n-628, 41 L. ed. 287, 288, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1073; Magoun v. Illinois Trust & Sav. Bank, \n170 \nU.S. 283, 288\n, 42 S. L. ed. 1037, 1040, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 594.\n We cannot say that property has been taken without due process of law, within the protection of the 14th Amendment, by the manner in which the court of appeals has construed and enforced this statute. Orr v. Gilman, supra.\n Nor do we perceive that the effect has been to violate any contract right of the parties. It is said that this is so, because, \n\n[205 U.S. 466, 479]\n\u00a0\n instead of disposing of the entire estate, 95 per cent of the property included in the power has been transferred and 5 per cent taken by the state; but as there was a valid exercise of the taxing power of the state, we think the imposition of such a tax violated no contract because it resulted in the reduction of the estate.\n Certainly the remainder-man had no contract with the donor or with the state. For whether the remainder-men received aliquot parts of the entire estate or the same was devested in whole or in part for the benefit of others in the class, depended upon the exercise of the power by the donee. The state was not deprived of its sovereign right to exercise the taxing power upon the making of a will in the future by which the estate was given to the appointees.\n We find no error in the judgment of the Surrogates' Court entered on the remittitur from the Court of Appeals, and the same is affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes, dissenting:\n I have the misfortune to differ from the majority of my brethren in this case, and although the argument which seemed and still seems to me unanswerable was presented and has not prevailed, I think that the principles involved are of sufficient importance to justify a statement of the reasons of my dissent. A state succession tax stands on different grounds from a similar tax by the United States or a general state tax upon transfers. It is more unlimited in its possible extent, if not altogether unlimited, and therefore it is necessary that the boundaries of the power to levy such taxes should be accurately understood and defined.\n I have always believed that a state inheritance tax was an exercise of the power of regulating the devolution of property by inheritance or will upon the death of the owner,-a power \n\n[205 U.S. 466, 480]\n\u00a0\n which belongs to the states; and I have been fortified in my belief by the utterances of this court from the time of Chief Justice Taney to the present day. Mager v. Grima, 8 How. 490, 493, 12 L. ed. 1168, 1170; United States v. Perkins, \n163 \nU.S. 625, 627\n, 628 S., 41 L. ed. 287, 288, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1073; Magoun v. Illinois Trust & Sav. Bank, \n170 \nU.S. 283, 288\n, 42 S. L. ed. 1037, 1040, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 594; Plummer v. Coler, \n178 \nU.S. 115, 124\n, 126 S., 137, 44 L. ed. 998, 1004, 1009, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 829; Billings v. Illinois, \n188 \nU.S. 97, 104\n, 47 S. L. ed. 400, 403, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 272; Campbell v. California, \n200 \nU.S. 87, 94\n, 50 S. L. ed. 382, 387, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 182; Cahen v. Brewster, \n203 \nU.S. 543, 550\n, 51 S. L. ed. 310, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 174. See also Re Sherman, 153 N. Y. 1, 4, 46 N. E. 1032. For that reason the power is more unlimited than the power of a state to tax transfers generally, or the power of the United States to levy an inheritance tax. The distinction between state and United States inheritance taxes was recognized in Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 \nU.S. 41, 58\n, 44 S. L. ed. 969, 976, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 747, and whatever may be thought of the decision in Snyder v. Bettman, \n190 U.S. 249\n, 47 L. ed. 1035, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 803, I do not understand it to import a denial of the distinction reaffirmed by the dissenting members of the court. \n190 U.S. 256\n, 47 L. ed. 1038, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 803.\n If, then, a given state tax must be held to be a succession tax in order to maintain its validity, or if in fact it is held to be a succession tax by the state court of which it is the province to decide that matter, it follows that such a tax cannot be levied except where there is a succession, and when some element or step necessary to complete it still is wanting when the tax law goes into effect. If some element is wanting at that time, the succession depends, for taking effect, on the continuance of the permission to succeed or grant of the right on the part of the state; and, as the grant may be withdrawn, it may be qualified by a tax. But if there is no succession, or if the succession has fully vested, or has passed beyond dependence upon the continuing of the state's permission or grant, an attempt to levy a tax under the power to regulate succession would be an attempt to appropriate property in a way which the 14th Amendment has been construed to forbid. No matter what other taxes might be levied, a succession tax could not be, and so it has been decided in New York. Re Pell, 171 N. Y. 48, 55, 57 L.R.A. 540, 89 Am. St. Rep. 791, 63 N. E. 789; Re Seaman, 147 N. Y. 69, 41 N. E. 401. \n\n[205 U.S. 466, 481]\n\u00a0\n It is not denied that the tax under consideration is a succession tax. The court of appeals treated it as such in the present case. It said: 'If the power had been exercised by deed, a different question would have arisen; but it was exercised by will, and, owing to the full and complete control by the legislature of the making, the form, and the substance, of wills, it can impose a charge or tax for doing anything by will.' Re Delano, 176 N. Y. 486, 494, 64 L.R.A. 279, 282, 68 N. E. 871, 873, Reversing 82 App. Div. 147, 81 N. Y. Supp. 762. That it was such a tax and valid for that reason was decided in Re Dows, 167 N. Y. 227, 52 L.R.A. 433, 88 Am. St. Rep. 509, 60 N. E. 439, Affirmed by this court. Orr v. Gilman, \n183 U.S. 278\n, 46 L. ed. 196, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 213, adopting the New York view, \n183 U.S. 289\n, 46 L. ed. 202, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 213. And these decisions and some of the other decisions of this court cited above were relied upon by the court of appeals. 176 N. Y. 492, 64 L.R.A. 279, 68 N. E. 871. See, further, Re Vanderbilt, 50 App. Div. 246, 63 N. Y. Supp. 1079, Affirmed in 163 N. Y. 597, 57 N. E. 1127; Re Lansing, 182 N. Y. 238, 248, 74 N. Y. 882. Probably the tax would be invalid for other local reasons besides those mentioned in Re Dows, but for the construction which it has received. Re Pell, 171 N. Y. 48, 60, 57 L.R.A. 540, 89 Am. St. Rep. 791, 63 N. E. 789.\n This being, then, a succession tax, I should have thought it plain that there was no succession for it to operate upon. More precisely, even if otherwise any element of succession could have been found,-a matter that I think would need explanation,-the execution of the power did not depend in any way upon the continued co-operation of the laws of New York by way of permission or grant. I am not concerned to criticize the statement of the court of appeals that in substance it is the execution of the power that gives to the grantee the property passing under it. It is enough if it is remembered that the instrument executing the power derives none of its efficiency in that respect from the present laws of New York. It is true that the instrument happens to be a will, and that it could not have operated as a will except by the grant of the privilege from the state at the time when Mrs. Delano died. But what would execute the power depended, in the first place, upon the deed creating it, and if that deed did not \n\n[205 U.S. 466, 482]\n\u00a0\n require a will, but only an instrument otherwise sufficiently characterized, it did not matter whether the instrument was also good as a will or not. Ela v. Edwards, 16 Gray, 91, 100.\n What the deeds which I am considering required was 'an instrument in its nature testamentary, to be acknowledged by her (Mrs. Delano) as a deed in the presence of two witnesses, or published by her as a will.' The language was chosen carefully, I presume, in view of the incapacities of married women at that time. By the terms used a will was unnecessary. It was enough if Mrs. Delano sealed and acknowledged an instrument in its nature testamentary, in the presence of two witnesses, whether it was good as a will or not. Strong v. Wilkin, 1 Barb. Ch. 9, 13; Heath v. Withington, 6 Cush. 497. This she did. In Orr v. Gilman, \n183 U.S. 278\n, 46 L. ed. 196, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 213, the power was created by will, and, what is more obviously material, it required a will for its execution, and so might be held to invoke and submit itself to the law in force when the execution should take place. Therefore that case has no bearing upon this. The ground upon which this tax is imposed is, I repeat, the right of the state to regulate, or, if it sees fit, to destroy, inheritances. If it might have not appropriated the whole it cannot appropriate any part by the law before us. And I also repeat that it has no bearing upon the matter that, by a different law, the state might have derived an equal revenue from these donees in the form of a tax. I do not understand it to be suggested that the state, without compensation, could have appropriated the remainder after Mrs. Delano's life, which Mr. Astor parted with in 1844 and shortly following years. If it could not have done so I am unable to see on what ground this tax is not void. The English decisions throw no light upon the question before us because they are concerned only with the construction of statutes which, however construed, are law.\n Mr. Justice Moody concurs in this dissent. \n\n\n\n","28":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHAPMAN & DEWEY LAND CO. v.

The chancery court rendered a decree dismissing the bill, and the case was carried to the supreme court of the state, where the decree was affirmed. 77 Ark. 338, 92 S. W. 534. Thereupon this writ of error was allowed.\n The supreme court of the state stated the case in brief thus:\n'Plaintiff claims title under an act of Congress entitled 'An Act to Enable the State of Arkansas and Other States to Reclaim the 'Swamp Lands' within Their Limits,' approved September 28, 1850. [9 Stat. at L. 519, chap. 84, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1591.] It alleges that, in pursuance of the provisions of this act, surveyed sections and parts of fractional sections in fractional township 12 north of the base line, in range 6 east of the fifth principal meridian, and in township 12 north of the base line, in range 7 east of the fifth principal meridian, and in Poinsett county, in this state, were duly selected, approved, and patented to the state of Arkansas, as a part of the swamp land grant; that certain of these lands were conveyed by the state of Arkansas, on the 12th day of June, 1871, to Moses S. Beach; that plaintiff acquired and is the owner of these lands so conveyed to Beach as well as certain other of the lands which were deeded to the state of Arkansas by the United States; that many of the legal subdivisions of sections so acquired by plaintiff were bounded by a large body of non-navigable water called in the official surveys of the United \n\n[206 U.S. 41, 43]\n\u00a0\n States and field notes thereof as the 'sunk lands,' 'St. Francis river sunk lands,' the 'Hatchie coon sunk lands,' and the 'Cut-Off lake;' that the legal subdivisions so bounding were fractional, and in the survey were meandered along such body of water. The plaintiff thereupon claims the lands lying under this body of water; and these are the lands in controversy in this suit to which it (plaintiff) seeks a decree to quiet its title as against the defendants.\n\n'Plaintiff alleges that these lands are wild, unimproved, and unoccupied; and that the defendants are claiming them under certain deeds; and asks that these be declared void, invalid, and of no force whatever.\n\n'The defendants answered and denied that the so-called 'sunk land' was a body of water, or that it is shown to be by the surveys of the United States or the field notes; but that it was sometimes temporarily flooded with water, and was land bearing 'trees and vegetables, willow and cypress;' and that the meandered lines run as alleged by plaintiff were run as boundaries, and not for the purpose of finding the number of acres in the sections or legal subdivisions 'for which purchasers would have to pay when the government might dispose of the land.\"\n\n Defendants' answer and cross bill asserted that, in the year 1893, the state of Arkansas, by an act of its legislature, 'created the board of directors of the St. Francis Levee District, the purpose being to erect a levee against the waters of the Mississippi river and protect what is known as the St. Francis basin from overflow by the Mississippi river; that the lands concerning which plaintiffs bring this suit, and cross complainants file this cross bill, are a portion of the said St. Francis basin, and are originally and naturally subject to overflow from the Mississippi river. That after creating the board of directors of the St. Francis Levee District, the state of Arkansas, by its legislature, to aid in the erection of said levee, granted to the board of directors of the St. Francis Levee District lands within said district, the title to which was in \n\n[206 U.S. 41, 44]\n\u00a0\n the state of Arkansas; that this act of donation by the legislature of the state of Arkansas went into effect on the 29th day of March, 1893, and thereby the legal title to the unsurveyed lands in township 12 north, range 6 east, and township 12 north, range 7 east, became vested in the board of directors of the St. Francis Levee District;' and that thereafter the said board of directors conveyed to defendants' predecessors in title.\n The supreme court, among other things, said that appellant claimed 'the land in controversy by virtue of the contiguity of certain lands, acquired by it from the United States, through the state of Arkansas and other grantors, to what is called 'sunk lands' and 'Cut-Off lake.'

BOWEN(1907)\nNo. 168\nArgued: Decided: November 11, 1907\n\n\n\n The firm of A. McCoy & Company, a banking copartnership at Rensselaer, Indiana, was composed of Alfred McCoy and Thomas McCoy, and on July 11, 1904, the copartnership and its individual members were respectively adjudicated bankrupts.\n Abner T. Bowen presented claims, on notes signed by the firm and also by its members, against the estate of the copartnership, which were allowed, and against the individual estate of Alfred McCoy, which were disallowed, by the referee, 'subject only to such right as said claimant may have in said estate as a creditor of the estate of the firm of A. McCoy & Company, bankrupts, after the payment of the individual creditors of the estate of said Alfred McCoy, bankrupt.'\n Petition for review was filed and the matter certified to the district court for the district of Indiana, by which the decision and order of the referee were approved and affirmed. Thereupon the case was carried by appeal to the circuit court of appeals for the seventh circuit, which reversed the judgment of the district court and remanded the cause 'with instructions . . . to allow the claim as a debt against the individual estate \n\n[207 U.S. 89, 90]\n\u00a0\n of Alfred McCoy, to be paid therefrom ratably with other creditors of that estate to the extent that such debt is not paid in the administration of the estate of the firm of McCoy & Company.' 80 C. C. A. 60, 150 Fed. 106.\n An appeal to this court was allowed by a judge of the circuit court of appeals, and the case having been docketed here was submitted on a motion to dismiss or affirm.\n Messrs. Harry R. Kurrie, Frank Foltz, and Simon P. Thompson for appellant. \n\n[207 U.S. 89, 91]\n\u00a0\n Mr. M. Winfield for appellee.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n The motion to dismiss was rested on two grounds: (1) That appellant had failed to comply with clause 3 of general order in bankruptcy 36; (2) that the case was not appealable to this court.\n Clause 3 of general order 36 reads as follows:\n'In every case in which either party is entitled by the act to take an appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, the court from which the appeal lies shall, at or before the time of entering its judgment or decree, make and file a finding of the facts, and its conclusions of law thereon, stated separately; and the record transmitted to the Supreme Court of the United States on such an appeal shall consist only of the pleadings, the judgment or decree, the finding of facts, and the conclusions of law.'\n\n No such finding of facts and conclusions of law was made in this case, nor was the court requested to make such finding. The appeal was a general appeal, and the entire record was sent up. The omission cannot be supplied by reference to the opinion, as is attempted in argument. British Queen Min. Co. v. Baker Silver Min. Co. \n139 U.S. 222\n, 35 L. ed. 147, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 523, and cases cited; Lehnen v. Dickson, \n148 \nU.S. 71, 74\n, 37 S. L. ed. 373, 374, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 481.\n But if the case was not appealable, the appeal must be dismissed, even though clause 3 had been complied with.\n The bankruptcy act provides,  25b:\n'From any final decision of a court of appeals, allowing or rejecting a claim under this act, an appeal may be had under such rules and within such time as may be prescribed by the Supreme Court of the United States in the following cases and no other:\n\n'1. Where the amount in controversy exceeds the sum of two thousand dollars, and the question involved is one which \n\n[207 U.S. 89, 92]\n\u00a0\n might have been taken on appeal or writ of error from the highest court of a state to the Supreme Court of the United States; or\n\n'2. Where some justice of the Supreme Court of the United States shall certify that, in his opinion, the determination of the question or questions involved in the allowance or rejection of such claim is essential to a uniform construction of this act throughout the United States.' [30 Stat. at L. 553, chap. 541, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3432.]\n\n As to paragraph 2, there was no such certificate here; and as to paragraph 1, we are not able to perceive that a writ of error from the highest court of a state to this court could be maintained. No validity of a treaty or statute of, or an authority exercised under, the United States, was drawn in question; nor the validity of a statute of, or an authority exercised under, any state, on the ground of repugnancy to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States; nor was any title, right, privilege, or immunity claimed under the Constitution, or any treaty or statute of, or commission held or authority exercised under, the United States, and decided against.\n The decision below proceeded on well-settled principles of general law, broad enough to sustain it without reference to provisions of the bankruptcy act. and, moreover, even if it could be held that by his claim Bowen asserted any right within the meaning of  709, Rev. Stat. (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 575), the decision was in his favor, and the trustee's bare denial of the claim could not be relied on under that statute. Jersey City & B. R. Co. v.

S. yds. consigned to Drumm Com. Co.; and the said first party, in consideration thereof, agrees to deliver the said animals to the said railway company, for transportation between the points aforesaid, upon the following terms, viz.:\n That whereas, the said first party, before delivering the said animals to said railway company, demanded to be advised of the rate to be charged for the carriage of said animals, as aforesaid, and thereupon was offered by the said railway company alternative rates proportionate to the value of the said animals, such value to be fixed and declared by the first party or his agent, and\n Whereas, such alternative rates are made in pursuance of the provisions relating thereto of the classification of freights adopted as regulations by the said railway company, and fully set forth as follows, to wit:\n Live Stock.-Ratings given above are based upon declared valuations by shippers, not exceeding the following:\n Each horse or pony (gelding, mare, or stallion), mule or jack $100 00 Each ox, bull, or steer 50 00 Each cow 30 00 Each calf 10 00 Each hog 10 00 Each sheep or goat 3 00\n When the declared value exceeds the above, an addition of 25 per cent will be made to the rate for each 100 per cent \n\n[205 U.S. 444, 447]\n\u00a0\n or fraction thereof, of 'additional declared valuation per head;' which said alternative rates are fully shown in and upon the regular tariffs and classifications printed, published, and posted by the said company as required by law, and\n Whereas, the first party, in order to avail himself of said alternative rates, and to secure the benefit thereof, has declared, and does hereby declare, said animals to be of the value as follows, to wit: Each steer, value, $50.00.\n To which value the rate aforesaid is proportioned by the classifications and tariffs aforesaid.\n Now, in consideration of the premises and of the foregoing, it is expressly agreed that for all purposes connected with, resulting from, or in any manner growing out of, this contract, and the transportation of the said animals pursuant thereto, the value of the said animals and of each thereof shall in no case exceed the said valuation.\n It is further agreed in consideration of the alternative rate so made by the said railway company and accepted by the first party, that in case of loss or of damage to said animals, whether resulting from accident or negligence of said railway company, or its servants, the said railway company shall not be liable in excess of the actual loss or damage; and in no case shall the said railway company be liable in any manner in excess of the agreed valuation upon each animal lost or damaged. Nor shall said railway company be liable for loss or damage after delivery to any connecting line, nor for any loss or damage not incurred upon its own line; but, nevertheless, in the event that the said animals are to be transported beyond the line of the railway of the second party upon and by any connecting line forming a part of the system known as the 'Burlington System,' then it is expressly understood and agreed that this contract shall be for, and shall inure to the benefit of, the corporation operating such connecting line, and such connecting line shall be liable to perform all the obligations of this contract.\n It is further agreed that the said railway company shall \n\n[205 U.S. 444, 448]\n\u00a0\n in no case be liable for any loss or damage to said animals unless a claim shall be made in writing by the owner or owners thereof, or his or their agents, and delivered to a general freight agent of the said railway company, or to the agent of said railway company at the station from which the animals are shipped, or to the agent at the point of destination, within ten (10) days from the time the said animals are removed from the cars. And, in case of loss or damage upon any connecting line, such connecting line shall not be in any manner liable unless claim shall be made in like manner in writing to such general officer or agent of such connecting line.\n And in consideration of free transportation for one person, designated by the first party, hereby given by said railway company, such persons to accompany the stock, it is agreed that the said cars, and the said animals contained therein, are and shall be in the sole charge of such persons, for the purpose of attention to and care of the said animals, and that the said railway company shall not be responsible for such attention and care; and, further, that the second party shall not be liable to the first party, or any of his servants, agents, or copartners, or other person, carried pursuant to this contract, for any injury or damage, from whatever cause, suffered or incurred while being so carried. And the first party agrees that, before setting out upon the journey, he will fully inform each of the persons to be carried pursuant hereto of the provisions of this contract in this regard.\n It is agreed that the said animals are to be loaded, unloaded, watered, and fed by the owner or his agent in charge; that the second party shall not be liable for loss from theft, heat, or cold, jumping from car, or other escape, injury in loading or unloading, injury which animals may cause to themselves or to each other, or which result from the nature or propensities of such animals, and that the railway company does not agree to deliver the stock at destination at any specified time, nor for any particular market.\n Witness the name of the railway company by its agent, \n\n[205 U.S. 444, 449]\n\u00a0\n and the hand of the first party, the day and year first above written.\n Chicago, Burlington, & Quincy Railway Company,\n By C.

At the close of the trial there was substantial evidence that the injury to the plaintiff was caused by the negligence of the defendant's servants in the operation of the cattle train, the evidence relative to the contract between the parties for the free transportation of the plaintiff was uncontradicted and it established these facts: The plaintiff resided at Robertson in the state of Missouri. He had been engaged in dealing in and shipping cattle in that state for eighteen years, had frequently made contracts of the character of that here in evidence, and was familiar with this agreement, and with the rates and terms upon which the railway company transported cattle from Robertson to the city of Chicago. The defendant operated regular passenger trains and carried passengers thereon between these stations for a regular fare of about $12. The danger of accident and injury to one riding in the caboose of a cattle train is about four times the danger to one riding in a coach of a passenger train. The defendant offered to carry and did transport cattle from Robertson to Chicago and between other places on its railroad, \n\n[205 U.S. 444, 450]\n\u00a0\n and assumed the entire responsibility and care of them during the transportation, without furnishing free transportation to the shipper or any of his agents, and without any agreement that he or any of his agents should water, feed, or give care or attention to the cattle during the transportation, for the same price and rate as it charged and received in cases in which the owner or his agent received free transportation upon the cattle train and agreed to assume the responsibility of the care of the cattle and the risk of his own injury while riding upon the freight train, as he did in the contract in evidence. The railway company preferred to carry and care for the cattle without furnishing transportation to anyone upon the freight trains, but nevertheless it offered to provide, and, when desired, did provide, free transportation on the cattle train for one person for every two cars shipped upon the terms specified in the italicized paragraph of the agreement. Cattle were shipped each way. The railway company charged and received the same rate whichever method was adopted, and left the shippers free to make their choice. The majority of the shippers accepted the free transportation on the train with their cattle, and agreed to care for them and to hold the company exempt from liability for any injury to themselves while they were riding on the freight train. The plaintiff and other shippers had the option to ship their cattle without free transportation for anyone, and to throw the entire care of the cattle on the company, or to accept the free transportation and to make the agreement to care for their cattle during the transportation, and to exempt the defendant from liability for their injuries while riding on the cattle train. The plaintiff was not requested, required, or constrained to accept the free transportation upon the cattle train upon which he rode, to assume the care of the cattle during their carriage, or to ride on the cattle train and to agree that the defendant should not be liable for his injuries while he was so carried, but he did so voluntarily because he wished to accompany his cattle to Chicago and to sell them there. In this state of the case the trial court denied the request of counsel \n\n[205 U.S. 444, 451]\n\u00a0\n for the defendant to instruct the jury to return a verdict in its favor, an exception was taken to this ruling, and it was assigned as error.\n And the circuit court of appeals for the eighth circuit further certifies that the following question of law is presented by the assignment of errors in this case, that its decision is indispensable to a determination of this case, and that to the end that this court may properly decide the issues of law presented it desires the instruction of the Supreme Court of the United States upon the following question:\n Where the owner of cattle has the option to ship them to market at the same rate without free transportation for himself or his agents on the cattle train, to throw the entire responsibility of the care of the cattle during the transportation upon the railroad company, and to travel to the market town on a passenger train of that company for the regular fare, or to accept free transportation to the market town upon the cattle train which carries his cattle, to assume the responsibility of their care during the transportation, and to agree that the railroad company shall not be liable to him for any injury or damage which he sustains while he is being so carried, and, without request, requirement, or constraint, he voluntarily chooses the latter alternative, is his contract that the railroad company shall not be liable to him for such injury or damage valid?\n Messrs.

Knight, \n123 \nU.S. 426, 432\n, 434 S., 435, 31 L. ed. 190-194, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 193-196, the court \n\n[205 U.S. 444, 452]\n\u00a0\n had occasion to determine the scope of those provisions of the Revised Statutes which authorized the judges of the circuit court in any civil suit or proceeding before it, where they were divided in opinion, to certify to this court the point upon which they so disagreed. Rev. Stat.  650, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 527; Rev. Stat.  652, 693. Speaking by Mr. Justice Gray, this court held that each question certified must be a distinct point or proposition of law, clearly stated, so that it could be definitely answered without regard to other issues of law or of fact in the case. It said: 'The points certified must be questions of law only, and not questions of fact, or of mixed law and fact,-'not such as involve or imply conclusions or judgment by the court upon the weight or effect of testimony of facts adduced in the cause.' . . . The whole case, even when its decision turns upon matter of law only, cannot be sent up by certificate of division.' In that case the general creditors of one of the parties sought to set aside, as fraudulent, a warrant of attorney to confess judgment. The court further said: 'The statement (embodied in the certificate and occupying three closely printed pages in the record) of what the judges below call 'the facts found' is in truth a narrative in detail of various circumstances as to the debtor's pecuniary condition, his dealings with the parties to this suit and with other persons, and the extent of the preferred creditors' knowledge of his condition and dealings. It is not a statement of ultimate facts, leaving nothing but a conclusion of law to be drawn; but it is a statement of particular facts, in the nature of matters of evidence, upon which no decision can be made without inferring a fact which is not found. The main issue in the case, upon which its decision must turn, and which the certificate attempts in various forms to refer to the determination of this court, is whether the sale of goods was fraudulent as against the plaintiffs. That is not a pure question of law, but a question either of fact or of mixed law and fact . . . . Not one of the questions certified presents a distinct point of law; and each of them, either in express terms or by necessary implication, involves in its decision a con- \n\n[205 U.S. 444, 453]\n\u00a0\n sideration of all the circumstances of the case. . . . 'They are mixed propositions of law and fact, in regard to which the court cannot know precisely where the division of opinion arose on a question of law alone;' and 'It is very clear that the whole ease has been sent here for us to decide, with the aid of a few suggestions from the circuit judges of the difficulties they have found in doing so.' Waterville v. Van Slyke, \n116 \nU.S. 699, 704\n, 29 S. L. ed. 772, 774, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 662.' See also Fire Ins. Assoc. v. Wickham, \n128 \nU.S. 426, 434\n, 32 S. L. ed. 503, 506, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 113.\n In United States v. Rider, \n163 U.S. 132\n, 41 L. ed. 101, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 983, the Chief Justice, speaking for the court, said that 'it has always been held that the whole case could not be certified,' and that 'under the Revised Statutes, as to civil cases, the danger of the wheels of justice being blocked by difference of opinion was entirely obviated.' In that case it was also held that certificates of questions of law by the circuit courts of appeals under the judiciary act of March 3d, 1891, are governed by the same general rules as were formerly applied to certificates of division of opinion in the circuit court,-citing Columbus Watch Co. v. Robbins, \n148 U.S. 266\n, 37 L. ed. 445, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 594; Maynard v. Hecht, \n151 U.S. 324\n, 38 L. ed. 179, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 353.\n In United States v. Union P. R. Co. \n168 \nU.S. 505, 512\n, 41 S. L. ed. 559, 561, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 167 (which was the case of certified questions from a circuit court of appeals), the rule as announced in the Rider Case was affirmed. To the same effect are Graver v. Faurot, \n162 \nU.S. 435, 436\n, 40 S. L. ed. 1030, 1031, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 799; Cross v. Evans, \n167 \nU.S. 60, 64\n, 42 S. L. ed. 77, 78, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 733; McHenry v. Alford, \n168 \nU.S. 657, 658\n, 42 S. L. ed. 616, 617, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 242.\n The present certificate brings to us a question of mixed law and fact, and, substantially, all the circumstances connected with the issue to be determined. It does not present a distinct point of law, clearly stated, which can be decided without passing upon the weight or effect of all the evidence out of which the question arises. The question certified is rather a condensed, argumentative narrative of the facts upon which, in the opinion of the judges of the circuit court of appeals, depends the validity of the live-stock contract in suit. Thus, practically, the whole case is brought here by the certified question, and we are, in effect, asked to indicate what, under all the facts stated, should be the final judgment. It is, obviously, as if the court had been asked, generally, upon a statement of all \n\n[205 U.S. 444, 454]\n\u00a0\n the facts, to determine what, upon those facts, is the law of the case. We thus state the matter, because it is apparent that the case turns altogether upon the question propounded as to the validity, in view of all the facts stated, of the contract under which the plaintiff's cattle were transported. This court is without jurisdiction to answer the question certified in its present imperfect form and the certificate must be dismissed. Sadler v.

The bills allege that the board, coerced by political clamor and its fears, arbitrarily determined in advance to add about nineteen million dollars to the assessment of railroad property for the previous year, and then pretended to fix the values of the several roads by calculation. They allege that the assessments were fraudulent, and void for want of jurisdiction, and justify these general allegations by more specific statements. One is that other property in the state, especially land, was valued at a lower rate than that of the railroads. Another, of more importance, is to the effect that \n\n[204 U.S. 585, 592]\n\u00a0\n the board adopted a valuation by stock and bonds, and then taxed the appellants upon the proportion of the value so reached that their mileage within the state bore to their total mileage, without deducting a large amount of personal property owned outside the state, or specially valuable terminals, etc., east of the Missouri river. The principle of this last objection was sanctioned in Fargo v. Hart, \n193 U.S. 490\n, 48 L. ed. 761, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 498, under the commerce clause of the Constitution, art. 1,  8, but later cases have decided that tangible property permanently outside the jurisdiction is exempted from taxation by the 14th Amendment ( Delaware, L. & W. R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n198 U.S. 341\n, 49 L. ed. 1077, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 669; Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky, \n199 U.S. 194\n, 50 L. ed. 150, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 36), and the 14th Amendment alone, somewhat inadequately referred to, is the foundation of these appeals. Demurrers to the bills were overruled, mainly, if not wholly, on the ground of the charges of duress and fraud. Answers then were filed denying the material allegations, and, after a hearing on evidence, the bills were dismissed.\n The dominant purport of the bills is to charge political duress, so to speak, and a consequent scheme of fraud, illustrated by the specific wrongs alleged, and in that way to make out that the taxes were void. As the cases come from the circuit court, other questions beside that under the Constitution are open, and, therefore, it is proper to state at the outset that the foundation for the bills has failed. The suggestion of political duress is adhered to in one of the printed briefs, but is disposed of by the finding of the trial judge, which there is no sufficient reason to disturb. The charge of fraud, even if adequately alleged (Missouri v. Dockery, \n191 \nU.S. 165, 170\n, 48 S. L. ed. 133, 134, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 53), was very slightly pressed at the argument, and totally fails on the facts. Such charges are easily made and, it is to be feared, often are made without appreciation of the responsibility incurred in making them. Before the decree could be reversed it would be necessary to consider seriously whether the constitutional question on which the appeals are based \n\n[204 U.S. 585, 593]\n\u00a0\n was not so pleaded as part of the alleged fraudulent scheme that it ought not to be considered unless that scheme was made out. Eyre v. Potter, 15 How. 42, 56, 14 L. ed. 592, 598; French v. Shoemaker, 14 Wall. 314, 335, 20 L. ed. 852, 857; Hickson v. Lombard L. R. 1 H. L. 324.\n When we turn to the evidence there is equal ground for criticism. The members of the board were called, including the governor of the state, and submitted to an elaborate cross-examination with regard to the operation of their minds in valuing and taxing the roads. This was wholly improper. In this respect the case does not differ from that of a jury or an umpire, if we assume that the members of the board were not entitled to the possibly higher immunities of a judge. Buccleuch v. Metropolitan Bd. of Works, L. R. 5 H. L. 418, 433. Jurymen cannot be called, even on a motion for a new trial in the same case, to testify to the motives and influences that led to their verdict. Mattox v. United States, \n146 U.S. 140\n, 36 L. ed. 917, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 50. So, as to arbitrators. Buccleuch v. Metropolitan Bd. of Works, L. R. 5 H. L. 418, 457, 462. Similar reasoning was applied to a judge in Fayerweather v. Ritch, \n195 \nU.S. 276, 306\n, 307 S., 49 L. ed. 193, 213, 214, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 58. A multitude of cases will be found collected in 4 Wigmore on Evidence,  2348, 2349. All the often- repeated reasons for the rule as to jurymen apply with redoubled force to the attempt, by exhibiting on cross-examination the confusion of the members' minds, to attack in another proceeding the judgment of a lay tribunal, which is intended, so far as may be, to be final, notwithstanding mistakes of fact or law. See Coulter v. Louisville & N. R. Co. \n196 \nU.S. 599, 610\n, 49 S. L. ed. 615, 618, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 342; Central P. R. Co. v.

C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Backus, 133 Ind. 513, 542, 18 L.R.A. 729, 33 N. E. 421. In Fargo v. Hart, \n193 \nU.S. 490, 496\n, 497 S., 48 L. ed. 761, 764, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 498, there was no serious dispute as to what was the principle adopted.\n Again, this board necessarily kept, and evidently was expected by the statutes to keep, a record. That was the best evidence, at least, of its decisions and acts. If the roads had \n\n[204 U.S. 585, 594]\n\u00a0\n wished an express ruling by the board upon the deductions which they demanded, they could have asked for it, and could have asked to have the action of the board or its refusal to act noted in the record. It would be time enough to offer other evidence, when such a request had been made and refused. See Fargo v. Hart, \n193 \nU.S. 490, 498\n, 48 S. L. ed. 761, 764, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 498; Cleveland, C. C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Backus, supra; Havemeyer v. Cook County, 202 Ill. 446, 66 N. E. 1044. However, as the foregoing objections were not urged, and as the cases were discussed upon all the testimony, we shall proceed to consider them in the same way.\n The facts that appear from any source are few. The board voted first, as a preliminary step toward ascertaining the actual value of all property to be assessed, to make an estimate of the tangible property of the railroads, to be taken as one of the factors in making up the total assessment of the roads. Sehedules were prepared, and it is objected that the board added 25 per cent to certain items as furnished by the companies. If this be true, and it is not admitted that any figures were more than tentative, the addition seems to have been made on personal judgment and on a theory that the values given were the values the property was insured for. If mistaken, a mistake does not affect the case. The main point comes on the final assessment, to which we turn at once.\n The board expressed its result in another vote. 'Having given full and due consideration to the returns furnished said board by the several railroad companies, and having taken into consideration the main track, side track, spur tracks, warehouse tracks, roadbed, right of way, and depot grounds, and all water and fuel stations, buildings, and superstructures thereon, and all machinery, rolling stock, telegraph lines, and instruments connected therewith, all material on hand and supplies, moneys, credits, franchises, and all other property of said railroad companies, and having taken into consideration the gross and net earnings of said roads, the total amount \n\n[204 U.S. 585, 595]\n\u00a0\n expended in operation and maintenance, the dividends paid, the capital stock of each system or road and the market value thereof and the total amount of secured and unsecured indebtedness [we] do hereby ascertain and fix, for the purposes of taxation, the full actual value, the average value per mile, and the assessable value per mile of the several roads as follows:' with a list.\n The roads supplement the record by evidence that the state treasurer, a member of the board, on the objection being made to a paper said to exhibit the stock, bonds, and floating debt of the Union Pacific, that the stock and bonds of other companies owned by the Union Pacific had not been deducted, answered, 'the board has decided that it cannot make deductions for property outside of the state.' This answer was in the presence of the other members of the board. It is agreed that the paper referred to was prepared for the use of the board. It shows a column of figures marked 'Deductions for locally assessed,' and amounting, when added, to 1,152,230. Then, under the head 'Earnings,' are the figures 398,474,068, from which is subtracted 1,152,230, giving 397,321,838, which is divided by 6,104, giving 65,092 as the quotient. This dividend is said to be shown, by the coincidence of figures, to have been made up of the market value of the stock of the Union Pacific, its mortgage bonds and other indebtedness, less the property locally assessed in the state, but without the deduction to which we have referred and to which the road alleges that it was entitled. The divisor is the total number of miles of the road. It is true that the valuation ultimately reached was $55,000 a mile instead of $65, 092, but this is said to have been an arbitrary reduction, and did not reduce the amount sufficiently, if we were to assume that this paper furnished the basis of the tax.\n But no such assumption can be made. The board considered the paper, no doubt, but so they considered a capitalization of what they understood to be the net earnings \n\n[204 U.S. 585, 596]\n\u00a0\n in the state, and the value of the tangible property apart from its outside connections. Exactly what weighed in each mind, and even what elements they purported to consider in their debates, is little more than a guess. There is testimony which cannot be neglected that, in this very matter of valuing the road by stocks and bonds, etc., the board, from another table furnished by the company, valued it at over $540,000,000, and did deduct from that sum the stocks and bonds owned by the road, and valued by the board at over $140,000,000, prior to the subsequent reduction to $55,000 a mile. It is said that this valuation is absurd and due to misunderstanding of the table. But we have nothing to do with complaints of that nature, or with anything less than fraud, or a clear adoption of a fundamentally wrong principle. The board, in its formal action properly before us, did vote to request of the Union Pacific, among other things, 'an itemized statement of the several bonds and stocks owned by said company, for which they are legally entitled to receive credit on offset, in estimating the value of said Co. for assessment.' This recognizes the ture principle, almost in terms. Beyond a speculation from figures, and a few statements improperly elicited from one or two members of the board, there is nothing to contradict the inference from this vote except the above alleged statement of the treasurer, met by his and others' testimony that a proper deduction was made.\n Evidently the board believed that the figures furnished by the roads were too favorable and were intended to keep the taxes as low as they could be kept. Evidently, also, the members or some of them used their own judgment and their own knowledge, of which they could give no very good account on cross-examination, but which they had a right to use, if honest, however inarticulate the premises. It would seem from the testimony, as might have been expected, that the valuations fixed were a compromise and were velieved by some members to be too low, as they seemed to one too high. It is argued to us, on expert testimony, that they are too low. \n\n[204 U.S. 585, 597]\n\u00a0\n The result of the evidence manifests the fruitlessness of inquiries, which, as we have said, should not have been gone into at all. We have adverted more particularly to the case of the Union Pacific, but that of the Chicago, Burlington, & Quincy Railroad stands on similar and no stronger ground, and what we have said disposes of the main contention of both. If the court below had found the other way it would have been difficult to say that the finding was sustained by competent evidence. There certainly is no sufficient reason for disturbing the finding as it stands.\n A point less pressed than the foregoing was that the other property in the state was greatly undervalued and that thus the rule of uniformity prescribed by the Constitution of Nebraska had been violated. Upon this matter it is enough to say that no scheme or agreement on the part of the county assessors, who taxed the other property, was shown, or on the part of the board of equalization and assessment, and to refer to Coulter v. Louisville & N. R. Co. \n196 U.S. 599\n, 49 L. ed. 615, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 342.\n Again, it was said that, inasmuch as the present Union Pacific Company, a Utah corporation, acquired its road by foreclosure of a mortgage from a preceding corporation chartered by the United States, it appeared from admissions in testimony or followed from the board's taxing the Nebraska portion of the road as a going concern that it was taxing United States franchises, contrary to the decision in California v. Central P. R. Co. \n127 U.S. 1\n, 32 L. ed. 150, 2 Inters. Com. Rep. 153, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1073. This, also, although stated, was not pressed. It does not appear that the present Union Pacific has any United States franchies that were taxed, and, if it has any that were considered in estimating the value of the road, it does not appear that they were considered improperly under the later decisions of this court. Central P. R. Co. v. California, \n162 U.S. 91\n, 40 L. ed. 903, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 766, 105 Cal. 576, 590, 38 Pac. 905. See Adams Exp. Co. v. Ohio State Auditor, \n166 U.S. 185\n, 41 L. ed. 965, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 604. And the same thing may be said as to the interstate business of the \n\n[204 U.S. 585, 598]\n\u00a0\n roads. Adams Exp. Co. v. Ohio State Auditor, \n165 U.S. 194\n, 41 L. ed. 683, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 305, \n166 U.S. 185\n, 41 L. ed. 965, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 604. The board had a right to tax all the property in the state, and to tax it at its value as an organic portion of a larger whole. Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Missouri, \n190 U.S. 412\n, 47 L. ed. 1116, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 730.\n Various arguments were addressed to us upon matters of detail which would afford no ground for interference by the court, and which we do not think it necessary to state at length. Among them is the suggestion of arbitrariness at different points, such as the distribution of the total value set upon the Chicago, Burlington, & Qunicy system, among the different roads making it up. But the action does not appear to have been arbitrary except in the sense in which many honest and sensible judgments are so. They express an intuition of experience which outruns analysis and sums up many unnamed and tangled impressions,-impressions which may lie beneath consciousness without losing their worth. The board was created for the purpose of using its judgment and its knowledge. State Railroad Tax Cases, \n92 U.S. 575\n, 23 L. ed. 663; State ex rel. Bee Bldg. Co. v. Savage, 65 Neb. 714, 768, 769, 91 N. W. 716; Re Cruger, 84 N. Y. 619, 621; San Jos e Gas Co. v. January, 57 Cal. 614, 616. Within its jurisdiction, except, as we have said, in the case of fraud or a clearly shown adoption of wrong principles, it is the ultimate guardian of certain rights. The state has confided those rights to its protection and has trusted to its honor and capacity as it confides the protection of other social relations to the courts of law. Somewhere there must be an end. We are of opinion that, whatever grounds for uneasiness may be perceived, nothing has been proved so clearly and palpably as it should be proved, on the principle laid down in San Diego Land & Town Co. v. National City, \n174 \nU.S. 739, 754\n, 43 S. L. ed. 1154, 1160, 19 Sup. Ct.

CITY & SUBURBAN RY. OF WASHINGTON(1907)\nNo. 43\nArgued: November 8, 1907Decided: December 2, 1907\n\n\n\n\n[207 U.S. 302, 303]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Percy Metzger and Victor H. Wallace for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. George P. Hoover and Charles A. Douglas for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[207 U.S. 302, 304]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Moody delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a writ of error to the court of appeals of the District of Columbia. The plaintiff in error brought an action to recover damages for personal injuries which she alleged were suffered by her through the negligence of the defendant in error, a corporation operating an electric street railway. The defendant pleaded in abatement that the plaintiff was, at the time of bringing action, an infant under the age of twenty-one years. Issue was joined on the plea. Thereafter the defend- \n\n[207 U.S. 302, 305]\n\u00a0\n ant, on motion and payment of the costs, was permitted to withdraw this plea and file a plea in bar. When the case came for trial at a later term the plaintiff tendered back the costs and moved the court to reconsider its order that the plea in abatement might be withdrawn and the plea in bar filed, and that the trial proceed upon the issue joined on the plea in abatement. To the refusal to grant these motions the plaintiff excepted. This exception requires no further consideration than that given to it in the court below, and is overruled.\n The plaintiff then introduced testimony in support of her declaration, and at the close of this testimony the judge presiding at the trial directed a verdict for the defendant. The plaintiff excepted to the order of the court and her exception was overruled by the court of appeals, and is now here for our consideration. The question is whether there was evidence which, with the inferences reasonably to be drawn from it, tended to prove all the essential elements of the plaintiff's cause of action.\n Without reciting all the testimony, which is set forth in full in the opinion of the court of appeals, the facts disclosed by it may be stated in narrative form. The plaintiff, a young woman, had lived and worked in Riverdale, Maryland, for about a year before the accident. During that time she had frequently traveled to Washington on the defendant's cars. It was the custom of persons who traveled from Riverdale to Washington on the defendant's railway to board the cars from what was called the platform near the station of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad. At that point there are two tracks of the defendant, running north and south. The distance between the inner rails of the two tracks was 7 feet, 10 inches. The steps of the cars projected 2 feet, 2 inches beyond the tracks, leaving, when two cars passed each other at this point, a clear space between them of 3 feet, 6 inches, so that, as one of the plaintiff's witnesses said, 'there was ample room to stand if you were thinking what you were doing.' The platform extended 30 feet lengthwise along the tracks. \n\n[207 U.S. 302, 306]\n\u00a0\n It consisted of boards laid on the ground and sleepers and parallel with the tracks. It covered the space between the tracks and the rails of the tracks and the width of two boards beyond the outside tracks. A road ran west of and near the tracks. West of the tracks there was 'a kind of sink,' and those boarding the cars for Washington from that side had 'to stand out in the mud or in that hole to get on the car.' The cars to Washington ran on the west, and the cars from Washington ran on the east, track. It was the custom of persons taking the Washington car to board it from the east side, standing on the platform between the tracks, and the doors of the cars were opened to receive them from that side; sometimes, however, such passengers entered from the west side. The purpose for which the platform was originally constructed was not shown, but it was used in the manner stated and for the passage of persons and vehicles. One standing on the platform at this point could see or be seen for a distance of at least a quarter of a mile north or south. On the evening of September 29, 1900, the plaintiff came to this place to take the car for Washington. The hour was not stated, but it was light enough to recognize a person a hundred yards away. The plaintiff testified that she remembered nothing from the time she left her house until she recovered consciousness in the hospital; but from other testimony it appears that, as the car for Washington approached from the north, she went to the platform and stood between the tracks. There were other persons intending to take the car, one of whom stood near her and also between the tracks. As the car for Washington came from the north, another of defendant's cars came from the south. The Washington car slowed down and came to a stop just as the latter car, without stopping, ran by 'at a rapid rate of speed,' as one witness said, or '12 to 15 miles an hour,' as another witness said. No one saw exactly what happened to the plaintiff, who was standing near the north end of the platfrom, but the sound of 'a shock' was heard, and the plaintiff was found unconscious between the tracks, 10 or 15 \n\n[207 U.S. 302, 307]\n\u00a0\n feet north of the north end of the platform. It may be inferred that she was struck by the rapidly passing car bound north, which did not come to a stop, as one witness said, for one or two hundred feet beyond the platform.\n If, upon these facts, reasonable men might fairly reach the conclusion that the plaintiff, while herself in the exercise of due care, was injured by the negligence of the defendant, the case should have been submitted to the jury. Warner v. Baltimore & O. R. Co. \n168 U.S. 339\n, 42 L. ed. 491, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 68. That the plaintiff was injured by being hit by the car running north does not admit of doubt. We need not delay at that point, but may proceed at once to the other aspects of the case. The plaintiff had come to a place where passengers had habitually boarded the defendant's cars. The defendant had encouraged and invited persons to enter its cars going south from the space between the tracks, by opening the doors and reveiving them from that side. It was a place which, in itself, was perfectly safe, unless made otherwise by the manner in which the defendant used the east track for the passage of cars. The plaintiff, therefore, was not a trespasser nor a mere traveler upon the highway. It is not important to determine whether she had become a passenger. Intending to become a passenger, she had come to a place recognized by the practice of the defendant as a convenient and suitable one from which to enter the car, and the car stopped to receive her. The defendant owed her an affirmative duty. It was bound to use that care for her protection which was reasonably required in view of the situation in which she had, at the defendant's invitation, placed herself, of the purpose for which she was there, of the approach of the car which she was intending to enter, and of the dangers to be apprehended from contact with a rapidly moving car, propelled by mechanical power. A jury might well say that, under such circumstances, reasonable care demanded the exercise of the utmost viligance, foresight, and precaution. The motorman of the northbound car could see plainly that the car for Washington was about to stop, and that passengers were standing upon the space be- \n\n[207 U.S. 302, 308]\n\u00a0\n tween the tracks, intending to enter it. He might readily have understood that the noise of the transit of the two cars would be commingled, and that those who intended to enter the other car would naturally direct their attention to it, and might fail to notice the approach of his own car. In point of fact, the motorman took no precaution whatever; he assumed that those who were standing on the platform would take care of themselves, and ran his car by them at full speed as if oblivious of their existence. We think, as the court of appeals held, that from the evidence the jury might have found that the defendant was negligent. The question whether the plaintiff herself was guilty of contributory negligence presents somewhat greater difficulty. There was room to stand between the two cars and escape contact with either. But the margin of safety was narrow and left little allowance for the infirmities of mankind. In the confusion of two cars approaching from opposite directions it is too much to expect nice calculations of distances. It is not to be wondered at that in the attempt to escape the one the plaintiff fell foul of the other. The same witness (himself standing on the platform between the tracks) who said that 'there was ample room to stand if you were thinking about what you were doing' also said: 'I realized that I would have to hold myself strictly in the center of the two tracks.' We think that the plaintiff, if she was rightly where she was, was not, as a matter of law, guilty of negligence in failing to appreciate accurately the boundaries of the narrow zone of safety which the defendant's conduct had left to her. The 3 feet, 6 inches width of the clear platform cannot fairly be considered without taking into account the dangers which infested the borders upon each side. A platform which would be wide enough for a child to walk in safety from the base of the Washington monument to the steps of the Capitol, if elevated to extend from the summit of one to the dome of the other, would imperil the passage of the man of steadiest nerve. Nor was the plaintiff necessarily wanting in due care by taking her place between the tracks. It was the usual place \n\n[207 U.S. 302, 309]\n\u00a0\n from which entrance to the Washington car was made. It was safe enough under ordinary circumstances. It was made unsafe only by reason of the defendant's negligent act in running another car rapidly by. The plaintiff had the right to assume that the defendant would not commit such an act of negligence, and that, when it stopped one car and thereby invited her to enter it, it would not run another rapidly by the place of her entrance and put her in peril. We think that it cannot be said, as a matter of law, that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence. That issue, with the others in the case, should have been submitted to the jury with appropriate instructions. Nor is it clear that, even if the plaintiff was not free from fault, her negligence was the proximate cause of the injury. If she carelessly placed herself in a position exposed to danger, and it was discovered by the defendant in time to have avoided the injury by the use of reasonable care on its part, and the defendant failed to use such care, that failure might be found to be the sole cause of the resulting injury.

CO. v. INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION(1907)\nNo. 201\nArgued: Decided: May 13, 1907\n\n\n\n Messrs. Edward Colston and Lawrence Maxwell, Jr., for appellants.\n Messrs. L. A. Shaver and P. J. Farrell for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n Official classification territory embraces that portion of the United States lying between Canada on the north, the Atlantic \n\n[206 U.S. 142, 143]\n\u00a0\n ocean on the east, the Potomac and Ohio rivers on the south, and the Mississippi river on the west. This territory includes what is known as Central Freight Association territory and Trunk Line territory, both being governed by the official classification. The Central Freight Association territory comprises the area west of Pittsburg and Buffalo, including the lower peninsula of Michigan and east of a line from Chicago to St. Louis, the Mississippi river from St. Louis to Cairo, and north of the Ohio river. Trunk Line territory lies north of the Potomac river and east of Pittsburg and Buffalo. Whilst official classification governed throughout the whole of official classification territory, the rates throughout the whole of the official classification territory were not uniform, because of a difference of rates prevailing in the subdivision; that is, in the Central Freight and Trunk Line territory. Thus, although on shipments from points in the Central Freight Association territory to points in the Trunk Line territory or vice versa rates were the same for similar distances, yet, on shipments between termini wholly within one or the other of these territories, the rates varied because of the different rules governing rates which prevailed as to traffic exclusively moving in that particular territory.\n The first classification adopted by the railroads to control in the territory above described as official classification territory was made contemporaneously with the going into effect of the act to regulate commerce, presumably to comply with that act, and took effect on April 1, 1887. From that date until January 1, 1900, nineteen general classifications of freight, numbered from 1 to 19, were, at various times, adopted to govern in official classification territory. The articles embraced in these classifications were divided into classes, numbered from 1 to 6, the rate increasing as the number of the class decreased. From the beginning, until June 1, 1891, common soap in boxes in car loads was rated as fifth class, and fourth class for less than car loads. On the last- named date, in consequence of an order entered by the Commission on a complaint as to the \n\n[206 U.S. 142, 144]\n\u00a0\n classification of common soap in car loads, made by Procter & Gamble, soap manufacturers, of Cincinnati, Ohio, soap in car loads was renduced to sixth class. This classification continued to govern until January 1, 1900, when a new classification, known as official classification No. 20, went into effect, by virtue of which soap in car loads was advanced from sixth to fifth class, and soap in less than car loads was advanced from fourth to third class.\n After the going into effect of classification No. 20, the Procter & Gamble Company, successor to the firm of Procter & Gamble, complained to the Interstate Commerce Commission in respect to the alterations made in the classification of common soap. The petition recited the prior complaint by the firm of Procter & Gamble, and the making, in 1890, of the order which led to the reduction from fifth to sixth class, heretofore referred to.\n It was charged in the petition that, in official classification No. 20, there had been an inequitable selection of particular articles and an increase in the rates upon such articles alone by the device of changing them from a lower to a higher class, for the sole purpose of increasing revenues to cover an alleged increase of cost of operation of the railroads; and that, 'by such course defendants have subjected and do thereby subject the said traffic in the articles changed, including common soap in car loads and less than car-load lots, to an undue and unreasonable prejudice and disadvantage with respect to the traffic in all of the articles whose classification was not changed in official classification No. 20.' It was further alleged as follows:\n If there are any qualities and conditions which, though not considered by defendants at the time of the adoption of said classification No. 20, justify, nevertheless, the making of any or part of said changes, the same, at any rate, do not apply to common soap in car loads or less than car-load lots. The same should, at least, have remained in sixth class in car-load lots, as ordered by this Commission as aforesaid, and in fourth class \n\n[206 U.S. 142, 145]\n\u00a0\n in less than car-load lots, so as to maintain the proper relation and difference of rates between car-load and less than car-load lots. The changing of particular articles as aforesaid from lower to higher classes for the sole purpose of increasing the revenues of the railroads interested therein is not a condition or circumstance justifying the said change of classification in common soap.'\n It was prayed that an order might be entered requiring the Cincinnati, Hamilton, & Dayton Railroad Company and seven other named railroad companies, forming various connecting and joint lines of railroad in the territory governed by official classification No. 20, to 'cease and desist from refusing to carry common soap in car-load lots at sixth-class rates, and from refusing to carry common soap in less than car-load lots at fourth-class rates.' After the filing of the petition, and before answer, official classification No. 20 was, in part, changed by making a new class, intermediate classes three and four for soap in less than car-load lots and on some other articles, this class being determined by giving the articles in question the benefit of a reduction on the third-class rate of 20 per cent, provided the application of the 20 per cent reduction did not reduce the charge below the fourth-class rate, in which event the 20 per cent reduction should not be fully applied, but would only be applied to the extent necessary to make the rate not less than fourth class. The classification thus operating is spoken of as 20 per cent less than third class, but not less than fourth class, and we shall speak of it hereafter in this way.\n In the answers filed the defendants in substance denied that common soap was improperly classified in official classification No. 20, originally or as modified, or that an unreasonable or unlawful rate was exacted for the carriage of soap, or that the defendants subjected the soap traffic to any undue or unreasonable prejudice, disadvantage, or discrimination.\n The taking of testimony was ended on September 26, 1900, and the report and opinion of the Commission was filed about \n\n[206 U.S. 142, 146]\n\u00a0\n two and a half years thereafter; viz., on April 10, 1903. 9 Inters. Com. Rep. 440. As respects putting car-load soap in the fifth class, the Commission refrained both from deciding that the classification was unreasonable per se or that its reasonableness had been affirmatively established. It said:\n'We regard the primary and controlling question in this case as a question of classification; that is, of relative rates, and dispose of it accordingly. In that view it is sufficient to hold that car-load soap is not improperly placed in the fifth class, and that fifth-class rates therefore are not shown to be unlawful. So long as most articles entitled to as low rates as car-load soap are put in the fifth class and required to pay fifth-class rates, we are not warranted, on the evidence before us, in condemning the same rating for that commodity. This disposition of the case, however, will not authorize the retention of carload soap in fifth class if the classification of other articles with which soap is compared should be reduced, nor will anything now decided preclude the Commission from holding, in an appropriate proceeding, that fifth-class rates in this territory are excessive.'\n\n In regard to the less than car-load classification of common soap, after directing attention to the fact that such traffic had always been fourth class until January 1, 1900, the Commission said:\n'A presumption that such rates are reasonable arises from the voluntary action of the carriers in keeping those rates in effect during such a long period, and that presumption has not been overcome, in our judgment, by the evidence presented in this case.'\n\n It was also found that certain rules set out in the findings governing car loads of mixed freight, permitting the carriage of the same at car-load rates, coupled with the increase in the long-standing less than car-load rates on soap, operated a strong discrimination in favor of meat packers who manufactured soap, against manufacturers who were mainly engaged in manufacturing and selling soap. So, also, the Commission held \n\n[206 U.S. 142, 147]\n\u00a0\n that the change as to the classification of soap in less than car-load lots, besides involving the payment of higher rates for less than car-load shipments, had brought about rate relations different from those previously existing between shippers of soap in official classification territory. Thus it was found that, as a result of the new method of classification, a shipper located at New York city could ship therefrom to practically all points in New England and a large number of points in New York state without paying higher than fourth-class rates, while a shipper located at Cincinnati could not ship northerly or northwesterly therefrom, more than about 60 miles, without paying an advance over fourth-class rates. The Commission expressly declared that 'the difference of 15 cents between fifth class and third class, which was in effect as between car- load and less than car-load shipments from January 1, to March 10, 1900,' the time during which official classification No. 20 prevailed, before it was modified by the percentage reduction as to soap in less than car-load lots, 'would plainly be excessive,' and that the change operated by the percentage modification in question occasions a difference 'which varies according to a given per cent, as applied to different scales of rates, appears to be inequitable and unjust, and the fact is so found.'\n In the order, as entered, the Commission dismissed so much of the complaint as referred to the classification of common or laundry soaps in car loads, and the defendants were 'notified and required to cease and desist, on or before the 15th day of June, 1903, from charging, demanding, collecting, or receiving for the transportation of common or laundry soap in less than car-load quantities charges or rates per one hundred pounds, equal to 20 per cent less than rates fixed by them for the transportation of articles, designated as third class in their established freight classification, called and known as the 'official classification,' which said 20 per cent less than third-class rates for the transportation of common or laundry soap in less than car loads are found and determined in and \n\n[206 U.S. 142, 148]\n\u00a0\n by said report and opinion of the Commission to be in violation of the act to regulate commerce.'\n The railway companies not having complied with the order, this proceeding was commenced by the Commission in the circuit court of the United States for the southern district of Ohio, under the direction of the Attorney General of the United States, to enforce compliance therewith. As respects the alleged unlawful character of the change in the classification of soap in less than car-load quantities, it was charged in the petition as follows:\n'And the petitioner charges that the action of the defendants in raising the classification of common or laundry soap in less than car-load quantities, on December 29, 1899, from fourth class to third class, and subsequently on March 10, 1900, changing the classification of common or laundry soap in less than car-load quantities to 20 per cent below third- class rates, the same being more than fourth-class rates, was in violation of the act to regulate commerce; and petitioner further charges that the rates charged by the defendants since December 29, 1899, for the transportation of common or laundry soap in less than car-load quantities are in violation of  1 of the act to regulate commerce, in that they are unreasonable and unjust; and said rates are and have been in violation of  3 of said act, in that said rates, based upon the classification aforesaid, give an undue and unreasonable preference or advantage to other descriptions of traffic, and subject common or laundry soap in less than car loads to an undue prejudice and disadvantage. The petitioner further charges that the change in classification by the defendants, made effective about December 29, 1899, whereby common or laundry soap in less than carload quantities was changed from fourth to third class, and the change in classification by the defendants, made effective March 10, 1900, whereby common or laundry soap in less than carload quantities was charged more than fourth-class rates, to wit, 20 per cent below third-class rates, were in violation of said act to regulate commerce, in \n\n[206 U.S. 142, 149]\n\u00a0\n that said changes were unreasonable and unjust, and result in unlawful discrimination and prejudice against common or laundry soap in less than car-load quantities, and against localities in official classification territory, wherein commodities are produced and transported, and against producers, shippers, dealers, and consumers in said territory.'\n\n In the various answers filed issue was taken upon these averments without any intimation that any of the issues so tendered were improper to be raised.\n The case was heard in the circuit court on the evidence before the Commission and on additional evidence taken by the defendants, principally directed to showing the extra cost incident to handling and transporting freight in general in less than car-load lots. The complainant took no additional testimony. The circuit court decided in favor of the Commission ( 146 Fed. 559), holding that the evidence not only failed to justify the change of classification complained of, but established that the advance in rates caused by the increase in the classification of soap in less than car-load quantities was not only unreasonable and unjust, but also resulted in an unlawful discrimination and preference between shippers. The case was then appealed to this court.\n Before considering the fundamental question upon which the order of the Commission and the decree of the court enforcing it rest, we dispose of certain propositions relied upon by the railway companies, because to do so we think will clear the way for an analysis of the final question arising, stripped of confusing and irrelevant considerations. We think the Commission, in making an investigation on the complaint filed by the Procter & Gamble Company, had the power, in the public interest, disembarrassed by any supposed admissions contained in the statement of complaint, to consider the whole subject and the operation of the new classification in the entire territory, as also how far its going into effect would be just and reasonable, would create preferences, or engender discriminations; in other words, its conformity to the require- \n\n[206 U.S. 142, 150]\n\u00a0\n ments of the act to regulate commerce. And that such was the view taken as well by the railway companies as by the Commission during the course of the investigation before that body is, we think, beyond doubt. Thus, on the examination of the very first witness called for the complainant before the Commission, counsel for the railway companies stated that, in his opinion, the pending investigation had 'no significance except as preliminary to a judicial proceeding.' And when, at the threshold, a question was raised in the examination of the same witness as to the competency of evidence on a subject not directly expressed in the complaint, but bearing upon the effect of the new classification, the Commission declared it was competent to show the general effect of such classification in the territory through which it operated. Our assent to this view of the power of the Commission conclusively, of course, also disposes of the contention that the court was without authority to determine the validity of the order of the Commission by the scope of the act to regulate commerce, because of an admission asserted to exist in the complaint originally filed before the Commission. It is needless, moreover, to say that the course of the proceeding before the Commission which we have stated strips the case of any element of surprise or possible prejudice.\n The Commission, as we have seen, did not find that the rate promulgated in official classification No. 20, as to soap in car loads, was unreasonable, preferential, or discriminatory. From this it is elaborately argued that the order rendered by the Commission demonstrates its own error. This proceeds upon the following theory: For a number of years prior to 1891 soap in less than car loads was in the fourth class, and soap in car loads in the fifth class. By the order of the Commission, rendered in 1891, as we have seen, soap in car loads was put in the sixth class. By official classification No. 20 soap in car loads was moved up to fifth, and soap in less than car loads from fourth to third class. The change made by the new classification destroyed the previous relation, since the \n\n[206 U.S. 142, 151]\n\u00a0\n difference between the rates governing third and fifth classes made by the new was greater than the difference between the fourth and sixth classes as obtaining in the prior classification. And this was one of the complaints made by the Procter & Gamble Company concerning the new classification No. 20. The carriers, it is said, to meet this objection, adopted, after the complaint was filed, the modified classification of 20 per cent less than third class, but not less than fourth class. The effect of this reduction, it is declared, was to cause soap in less than car loads to occupy just the same relative position to soap in car loads as it had occupied in the classification existing prior to the going into effect of official classification No. 20. And as the order of the Commission did not change the classification as applied to soap in car loads, made by official classification No. 20, the proposition is that that body, in holding the modified classification of 20 per cent less than third class, and not less than fourth class, to be illegal, destroyed the relation which the Commission had created by its former order, and which it was the purpose of the complaint of the Procter & Gamble Company to restore. But the argument takes for granted the very question for decision,-that is, whether the modified classification of 20 per cent less than third class, but not less than fourth class, operated to continue the relation between soap in car loads and soap in less than car loads, which prevailed throughout official classification territory before the making of official classification No. 20. That the proposition thus begs the whole question is demonstrated by the mere statement that both the Commission and the court below decided that official classification No. 20, as modified as to soap in less than car loads by the percentage order, was unreasonable, discriminatory, and, by its effect, created preferences among manufacturers and shippers of soap which had not existed prior to the new classification. When the real significance of the proposition is thus seen it amounts to this, that we must assume that both the court below and the Commission erroneously decided the controversy, and, upon this mere assumption, \n\n[206 U.S. 142, 152]\n\u00a0\n proceed to reverse their action. But our duty not to assume, but to decide the case, cannot be thus obscured.\n Laying aside, however, the questions of unreasonableness of discrimination, and of preference and the consequent destruction, if these effects exist, by the new classification, of the prior relation between soap in car loads and less than car-load quantities, let us briefly consider the intrinsic merit of the proposition relied upon. It is that prior to official classification No. 20 there was a just relation between soap in car loads in class 6 and soap in less than car loads in class 4. Of course, this admits that such just relation was destroyed by official classification No. 20 as originally put in force, since thereby soap in car-load lots was placed in class 5 and soap in less than car-loads in class 3, between which classes there was a greater difference relatively in rates than theretofore existed between the two commodities in the prior classification. This inequality the carriers declare was obviated after the complaint was filed by the modified classification as to soap in less than car-load lots of 20 per cent less than third class, but not less than fourth class. By this means, it is insisted, the relation previously existing was recreated, and any disturbance engendered by official classification No. 20 was cured. Now, on the surface of things, the contradiction of the position is manifest. The modified rate on its face did not propose to put soap in less than car loads throughout the whole territory in a uniform class, but in the class which might result from the operation of a percentage basis, controlled by whether or not the application of the percentage might or might not take soap out of one class and into another. In other words, it clearly contemplated that, by the varying rates to which the percentage would be applied, soap in less than car loads would be left in portions of the territory in fourth class and in a higher class in other portions. How, in view of this, it can be in reason conceived that the admitted uniform classification prevailing prior to the percentage rule could possibly continue under a classification inherently wanting in uniformity, we fail to understand. \n\n[206 U.S. 142, 153]\n\u00a0\n But put the foregoing considerations aside. The complaint as to the order of the Commission is that it disturbed the previous relations between soap in car loads and less than car loads. What was the order? In effect it condemned, and directed the carrier to desist from enforcing, the modified percentage classification. At the worst view for the carrier the order complained of can only be taken as persuasively indicating-and such was the view intimated in the opinion of the Commission-the duty of the carriers to return soap in less than car loads to class 4, in which it had been uniformly placed prior to the going into effect of official classification No. 20. The real grievance which the railway companies must have reduces itself to this,-that the order may lead to the putting of soap in less than car loads in class 4. But the very percentage basis which the carriers adopted contemplated that, in some portions of the territory and somewhere, the effect of the modification by a percentage reduction might be to put soap in less than car loads in the fourth class; else, why the limitation, 'but not less than fourth class,' contained in the modified classification.\n We are thus brought to the fundamental question, which is, Did the percentage classification lead to rates which were unreasonable, unjustly discriminatory, or unduly preferential? If either was the result, the order directing the carriers to desist from enforcing the classification in question was proper.\n We take up the related questions of discrimination and preference because the arising of such consequences from the classification more saliently appear, and because the demonstration of such results is, in a measure, elucidated by what we have previously said. Concerning the discrimination the Commission said:\n'Whatever the effect of a percentage less than third class for less than car-load shipments of other commodities, taking that rating under the classification, may be, it plainly works discrimination against complainant and other western shippers \n\n[206 U.S. 142, 154]\n\u00a0\n of soap in less than car-load lots, in favor of their competitors in the East, when the present situation is compared with that which existed under the old fourth-class rating.'\n\n And this finding was expressly concurred in by the circuit court. In pointing out the mode by which the modified classification operated the result in question, the Commission said:\n'These differences are due to variations in the scales of rates prevailing in the different sections. The 20 per cent less than third- class rating for less than car-loads applies to all shippers of less than car-load lots of soap throughout the entire territory, but it increases some rates more than others, and leaves some as they were before it was adopted. When, for example, under the application of that rule, the rate from Cincinnati to Boston is increased 4 cents, and the rate from New York to Boston remains the same, as compared with the fourth-class rates formerly in effect, it is plain that this method of determining rates upon a percentage basis operates unequally upon the different shippers of less than car-load quantities in that territory.'\n\n The statute gives prima facie effect to the findings of the Commission, and, when those findings are concurred in by the circuit court, we think they should not be interfered with unless the record establishes that clear and unmistakable error has been committed. See Cincinnati, N. O . & T. P. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n162 \nU.S. 184, 194\n, 40 S. L. ed. 935, 938, 5 Inters. Com. Rep. 391, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 700; Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Behlmer, \n175 \nU.S. 648, 672\n, 44 S. L. ed. 309, 318, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 209.\n It is insisted that this is a case of that character. How, in reason, it is urged, can it be said that discrimination or preference, which did not before exist, was or could be produced from the mere application to the prior rates of a uniform percentage reduction? This, however, obscures the fact that the 20 per cent reduction was not uniform, but was that percentage less than third class, with the qualification 'but not less than fourth class.' In other words, the modified percentage reduction was not a fixed percentage, but was one which might \n\n[206 U.S. 142, 155]\n\u00a0\n vary, depending upon the result which would be brought about by applying the rule. Putting, however, entirely aside this view, let us consider only the result of the working of the rule on the basis of 20 per cent less than third class. The factors to be considered are these: a, the relation existing prior to the going into effect of official classification No. 20; b, the operation of that classification over the whole of official classification territory; c, the percentage modification of 20 per cent less than third class as to soap in less than car loads, and also its operation over the whole territory; and, d, the varying rates of charges in the separate spheres into which the official classification territory was divided, viz., Central Freight Association territory and the Trunk Line territory. Now, testing the matter by these criteria, does it appear, as contended, that the findings of the Commission and the court, as to resulting preferences and discrimination, are so contradictory and erroneous that we should disregard them? The proposition that they were must rest upon the assumption that the application of a fixed percentage reduction to existing rates, whilst it might vary them, could not possibly change their relation. But this assumes that the variation which existed between rates in the different spheres of official classification territory was only a difference in the sum of the rate prevailing in one territory from that which prevailed in the other as to the same class. But this is a mistake, since there was also a difference in the two separate spheres of territory as to the margin of difference between the different classes of rates governing in the two territories. Thus, there was in Central Freight Association territory not only a higher rate for commodities in the third class than prevailed in Trunk Line territory for the same class, but there was also in the Central Freight Association territory a wider difference between the rates governing commodities in the third class and those controlling commodities in the fourth class. It follows from this that where, in any given case, the 20 per cent reduction was applied to the increased rate which had arisen from having placed less than \n\n[206 U.S. 142, 156]\n\u00a0\n car-load soap in the third class, if the application of the full 20 per cent reduction was not sufficient to reduce the amount to the fourth class, the commodity would pay more than fourth class. In other words, although the commodity in the case stated would get the full benefit of the 20 per cent reduction from the third-class rate, as giving it that benefit did not reduce to the fourth-class rate the commodity would yet pay higher than fourth-class rate. It also follows that if, in any case where the 20 per cent reduction was applied the result of applying it, because of the narrowness of the difference between third and fourth class in that territory, operated to reduce the same to the fourth class, the commodity would be left exactly in the class in which it stood before,-that is, fourth class. By this it indubitably resulted that in a large degree in one of the subdivisions of the same classification territory soap in less than car loads remained in fourth class, and in the other took a higher class. And this illustrates the correctness of the findings of the Commission and of the court as to the preference resulting from applying to a territory governed by one classification a rule of percentage which, while assuming unity, produced diversity, and which, while asserting equality of class, engendered inequality. Of course, we confine our decision to the case before us.\n And the views heretofore expressed serve also to dispose of the contention that, although it be conceded that discrimination and preference was created, yet the carrier should not have been ordered to desist from enforcing the modified percentage classification, because the discrimination and preference, if any, were not the result of the operation of that classification, and, moreover, were not repugnant to the act to regulate commerce, because they were simply the consequence of natural competitive advantages enjoyed by shippers in the sphere of the Trunk Line territory, which were not possessed by shippers in that other portion of official classification territory, known as Central Freight Association territory. But this simply involves a restatement of the misconception which we have \n\n[206 U.S. 142, 157]\n\u00a0\n already pointed out. The discriminations and preferences which the Commission and the court below found to exist were results arising from the application to the conditions prevailing in official classification territory of the modified percentage classification. In other words, the order forbidding the enforcement of the modified percentage classification was based on the finding that that classification disturbed the rate relations theretofore existing in official classification territory, and created preferences and discriminations which would disappear if the further enforcement of the changed classification was prevented.\n This brings us to the final contention made on behalf of the railway companies, viz., that the order of the Commission was not lawful, because not within the power conferred by the act of Congress. This is, we think, largely disposed of by what we have previously said as to the nature and scope of the investigation which the Commission was authorized to make and the redress which it was empowered to give irrespective of the particular character of the complaint by which its power may have been previously invoked. Whatever might be the rule by which to determine whether an order of the Commission was too general where the case with which the order dealt involved simply a discrimination as against an individual, or a discrimination or preference in favor of or against an individual or a specific commodity or commodities or localities, or as applied to territory subject to different classifications, we think it is clear that the order made in this case was within the competency of the Commission, in view of the nature and character of the wrong found to have been committed and the redress which that wrong necessitated. Finding, as the Commission did, that the classification by percentage of common soap in less than car-load lots operating throughout official classification territory, brought about a general disturbance of the relations previously existing in that territory, and created discriminations and preferences among manufacturers and shippers of the commodity and between localities in such \n\n[206 U.S. 142, 158]\n\u00a0\n territory, we think the Commission was clearly within the authority conferred by the act to regulate commerce in directing the carriers to cease and desist from further enforcing the classification operating such results.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","34":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCITIZENS' SAV. & TR. CO. v. ILLINOIS CENT. R.R.(1907)\nNo. 238\nArgued: Decided: March 4, 1907\n\n\n\n This suit in equity was brought in the circuit court of the United States for the eastern district of Illinois against the Illinois Central Railroad Company, the Belleville & Southern Illinois Railroad Company, the St. Louis, Alton, & Terre \n\n[205 U.S. 46, 47]\n\u00a0\n Haute Railroad Company, all Illinois corporations (to be hereafter called, respectively, the Illinois, the Belleville, and Terre Haute companies), and the United States Trust Company, a New York corporation. The lastnamed corporation was never served with process and did not appear in the suit. The case presents a question as to the jurisdiction of the court below.\n The plaintiff, an Ohio corporation, is the holder of 400 shares of the common stock of the Belleville company, and sues as well in its own as on behalf of all other stockholders of that company, or beneficiaries, who may choose to come in and bear their proportion of the cost and expenses of the proceedings. Assuming the allegations of the bill to be true, the suit is not a collusive one, and could be properly brought by a stockholder of the Belleville company, making that company a defendant.\n The bill refers to various instruments, deeds, and leases, as follows: A deed of October 1st, 1895, between the Terre Haute company, the Illinois company, and the Belleville company, whereby the railroad and properties of the Belleville company, then held by the Terre Haute under a lease executed in 1866, were transferred to the Illinois company, for a period of ninety-nine years; a deed of September 10th, 1897, to which the Belleville and Terre Haute companies were parties, and which purported to transfer the title to all the railroad properties of the former to the latter company; a lease of September 15th, 1897, by the Terre Haute company to the Illinois Central Railroad Company, confirming the above lease of October 1st, 1895, and covering, among other properties, the Belleville railroad, extending from Belleville, in St. Clair county, Illinois, to Duquoin, Perry county, in the same state; and a deed of February 17th, 1904, between the Terre Haute company, and the Illinois company, purporting to convey to the latter company all the railroad properties, corporate rights and franchises of the former company. \n\n[205 U.S. 46, 48]\n\u00a0\n The plaintiff prayed that these leases and deeds, so far as they affect, or purport to affect, the properties, franchises, rights, or liabilities of the Belleville company, be canceled and declared void, and that that company be required to return and account for whatever consideration it may have received under such leases and deeds to the party or parties from whom the consideration may have moved.\n The bill charges, in substance, that said deeds were illegally and fraudulently procured by the Illinois Central Railroad Company, and by means of those instruments, and by various improper schemes, it has acquired not only complete control over and possession of the Belleville company and all its properties, but has manages, and is continuing to manage, those properties in its own interest and in total disregard of the rights of holders of the common stock of the Belleville company. Indeed, it is charged that what the Illinois Central Railroad Company has done, is doing (and, unless restrained, will continue to do), has practically destroyed the value of such stock.\n The plaintiff also prayed for a decree ordering the defendant, the Illinois Central Railroad Company, to account for and pay over to the Belleville company, or to a receiver to be appointed for that company, such proportion of the yearly gross earnings as the Belleville company is entitled to under the lease executed by and between the Belleville company and the Terre Haute Railroad Company, bearing date October 1st, 1866; such accounting to cover each fiscal year, or part thereof, from the time when the Illinois Central Railroad Company first acquired the railroad properties of the Belleville company as lessee or sublessee under the lease executed on or about the 1st of April, 1896, up to the time of such accounting; further, for 'an order appointing a receiver for the Relleville & Southern Illinois Railroad Company, with the usual powers of such receivers; and that the Illinois Central Railroad Company, through its officers and agents, be ordered to surrender and deliver to said receiver all the \n\n[205 U.S. 46, 49]\n\u00a0\n corporate assets, books, papers, and everything that rightfully belongs to the Belleville & Southern Illinois Railroad Company, and that the Illinois Central Railroad, Company be ordered to account to such receiver, as is hereinbefore prayed. That the defendant, the Illinois Central Railroad Company, its officers and agents, be restrained from further violating the rights of your orator, and be ordered, directed, and restrained in particular from interfering in any way with said receiver, or with the operation of said Belleville company as an independent and separate railroad company; and for such other and further relief as the equity of the case may require.'\n Process in the case against the Illinois company was served upon its ticket agent at Fast St. Louis, 'there being no president, vice president, secretary, or treasurer of that company found' in the district; and against the Belleville and Terre Haute companies, upon a director of each company, at Pinkneyville, Illinois, there being no president, vice president, secretary, or treasurer of either of those companies found in the district.\n The Belleville company pleaded-especially appearing, under protest, for the purposes of its plea, and no other-that the court below was without jurisdiction to proceed against it, in that the defendant was an inhabitant of the morthern division of the northern district of Illinois, having its residence in that division and district at Chicago, where its corporate meetings were held and its corporate business transacted.\n Similar pleas were filed by the Terre Haute company and the Illinois Central Railroad Company, each specially appearing under protest for the purpose only of denying the jurisdiction of the court below, and each company claiming to be an inhabitant and resident of the northern district of Illinois.\n By its final order the court sustained the pleas to the jurisdiction, and dismissed the suit. \n\n[205 U.S. 46, 50]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Edward C. Eliot and William B. Sanders for appellant.\n\n\n\n[205 U.S. 46, 51]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. J. M. Dickinson and Blewett Lee for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan, delivered the opinion of the court:\n\n\n[205 U.S. 46, 53]\n\u00a0\n This case is here upon a certificate as to the jurisdiction of the circuit court.\n The eastern district of Illinois was created by the act of Congress approved March 3d, 1905, chap. 1427. 33 Stat. at L. 992, 995, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1905, p. 93. The present suit in equity was, as we have stated, instituted in the circuit court for that district, but its jurisdiction was denied by the judgment below upon the ground solely that each defendant railroad corporation was shown to be an inhabitant of the northern district of Illinois, not of the eastern district, and, therefore, this suit was not local to the latter district.\n By the 8th section of the act of March 3d, 1875, determining the jurisdiction of the circuit courts of the United States, it was provided: 'That when, in any suit commenced in any circuit court of the United States, to enforce any legal or equitable lien upon, or claim to, or to remove any encumbrance or lien or cloud upon the title to, real or personal property within the district where such suit is brought, one or more of the defendants therein shall not be an inhabitant of, or found within, the said district, or shall not voluntarily appear thereto, it shall be lawful for the court to make an order directing such absent defendant or defendants to appear, plead, answer, or demur, by a day certain to be designated, which order shall be served on such absent defendant or defendants, if practicable, wherever found, and also upon the person or persons in possession or charge of said property, if any there be; or, where such personal service upon such absent defendant or defendants is not practicable, such order shall be published in such manner as the court may direct, not less than once a week for six consecutive weeks; and in case such absent defendant shall not appear, plead, answer, or demur within the time so limited, or within some further time, to be allowed by the court, in its discretion, \n\n[205 U.S. 46, 54]\n\u00a0\n and upon proof of the service or publication of said order, and of the performance of the directions contained in the same, it shall be lawful for the court to entertain jurisdiction, and proceed to the hearing and adjudication of such suit in the same manner as if such absent defendant had been served with process within the said district; but said adjudication shall, as regards said absent defendant or defendants without appearance, affect only the property which shall have been the subject of the suit and under the jurisdiction of the court therein, within such district,' etc. 18 Stat. at L. 470, 472, chap. 137, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 513.\n These provisions were substantially those embodied in  738 of the Revised Statutes, except that the act of 1875 embraced (as  738 did not) suits in equity 'to remove any encumbrance or lien or cloud upon the title to real or personal property.' Both  738 and the act of 1875 related to legal and equitable liens or claims on real and personal property within the district where the suit was brought.\n The repealing clause of the judiciary act of 1887, 1888 (24 Stat. at L. 552, chap. 373, 25 Stat. at L. 433, chap. 866, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 508), did not reach the 8th section of the act of 1875. That section is still in force, as was expressly held in Jellenik v. Huron Copper Min. Co. \n177 \nU.S. 1, 10\n, 44 S. L. ed. 647, 650, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 559.\n We are then to inquire as to the scope of the 8th section of the above act of 1875. And that inquiry involves the question whether this suit is one 'to enforce any legal or equitable lien upon, or claim to, or to remove any encumbrance or lien or cloud upon the title to, real or personal property' within the eastern district of Illinois where the suit was brought.\n In Mellen v. Moline Malleable Iron Works, \n131 U.S. 352\n, 33 L. ed. 178, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 781, we had occasion to examine the provisions of the act of 1875. A question there arose as to the jurisdiction of a circuit court of the United States to render a decree annulling a trust deed and chattel mortgage covering property within the district where the suit was brought, in which suit the defendants did not appear, but were proceeded against in the mode authorized by the above act of 1875. This court said: 'The \n\n[205 U.S. 46, 55]\n\u00a0\n previous statute gave the above remedy only in suits 'to enforce any legal or equitable lien or claim against real or personal property within the district where the suit is brought,' while the act of 1875 gives it also in suits brought 'to remove any encumbrance or lien or cloud upon the title to' such property. Rev. Stat.  738; 18 Stat. at L. 472, chap. 137,  8, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 513. We are of opinion that the suit instituted by the furnace company against the iron works and others belonged to the class of suits last described. The trust deed and chattel mortgage in question embraced specific property within the district in which the suit was brought. The furnace company, in behalf of itself and other creditors of the iron works, claimed an interest in such property as constituting a trust fund for the payment of the debts of the latter, and the right to have it subjected to the payment of their demands. In Graham v. La Crosse & M. R. Co. \n102 \nU.S. 148, 161\n, 26 S. L. ed. 106, 111, this court said that 'when a corporation became insolvent, it is so far civilly dead that its property may be administered as a trust fund for the benefit of the stockholders and creditors. A court of equity, at the instance of the proper parties, will then make those funds trust funds which, in other circumstances, are as much the absolute property of the corporation as any man's property is his.' See also Mumma v. Potomac Co. 8 Pet. 281, 286, 8 L. ed. 945, 947; Morgan County v. Allen, \n103 \nU.S. 498, 509\n, 26 S. L. ed. 498, 502; Wabash, St. L. & P. R. Co. v. Ham, \n114 \nU.S. 587, 594\n, 29 S. L. ed. 235, 238, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1081; 2 Story, Eq. Jur.  1252; 1 Perry, Tr.  242. The trust deed and chattel mortgage executed by the iron works created a lien upon the property in favor of Wheeler, Carson, Hill, and the Keator Lumber Company, superior to all other creditors. The furnace company, in behalf of itself and other unsecured creditors, as well as Wheelock, denied the validity of Hill's lien as against them. That lien was therefore an encumbrance or cloud upon the title, to their prejudice. Until such lien or encumbrance was removed, they could not know the extent of their interest in the property or in the proceeds of its sale. The case made by the original, as well \n\n[205 U.S. 46, 56]\n\u00a0\n as cross suit, seems to be within both the letter and the spirit of the act of 1875.'\n A recent case is that of Jellenik v. Huron Copper Min. Co. supra. That was a suit by stockholders of a Michigan corporation. Its object, as the bill disclosed, was to remove the cloud that had come upon their title to the shares of stock held by them. The issues in the case made it necessary to determine the scope of the above act of 1875, chap. 137. This court said: 'Prior to the passage of the above act of March 3, 1875, the authority of a circuit court of the United States to make an order directing a defendant-who was not an inhabitant of nor found within the district, and who did not voluntarily appear-to appear, plead, answer, or demur, was restricted to suits in equity brought to enforce legal or equitable liens or claims against real or personal property within the district. Rev. Stat.  738. But that act extended the authority of the court to a suit brought 'to remove any encumbrance or lien or cloud upon the title to real or personal property within the district where such suit is brought.' One of the objects of the present suit was to remove an encumbrance or cloud upon the title to certain shares of the stock of a Michigan corporation. No question is made as to the jurisdiction of the court so far as it rests upon the diverse citizenship of the parties. The plaintiffs alleged that they were the equitable owners of that stock, although the legal title was in certain of the defendants. The relief asked was a decree establishing their rightful title and ownership; and, in order that such a decree might be obtained, the defendants referred to were ordered to appear, plead, answer, or demur; but, as they refused to do so, the circuit court decided that it could not proceed further. That court was of opinion that 'the shares of stock in question are not personal property within the district within the purview of the statute of the United States authorizing the bringing in by publication of notice to nonresident defendants who assert some right or claim to the property which is the subject of suit.' 82 Fed. \n\n[205 U.S. 46, 57]\n\u00a0\n 778, 779. The proper forum, the court said, for the litigation of the question involved, would be in the state of which the defendants were citizens. The question to be determined on this appeal is whether the stock in question is personal property within the district in which the suit was brought. If it is, then the case is embraced by the act of 1875, chap. 137, and the circuit court erred in dismissing the bill.' Again: 'It is sufficient for this case to say that the state under whose laws the company came into existence has declared, as it lawfully might, that such stock is to be deemed personal property. That is a rule which the circuit court of the United States, sitting in Michigan, should enforce as part of the law of the state in respect of corporations created by it. The stock held by the defendants residing outside of Michigan who refused to submit themselves to the jurisdiction of the circuit court being regarded as personal property, the act of 1875 must be held to embrace the present case if the stock in question is 'within the district' in which the suit was brought. Whether the stock is in Michigan, so as to authorize that state to subject it to taxation as against individual shareholders domiciled in another state, is a question not presented in this case, and we express no opinion upon it. But we are of opinion that it is within Michigan for the purposes of a suit brought there against the company-such shareholders being made parties to the suit-to determine whether the stock is rightfully held by them. The certificates are only evidence of the ownership of the shares, and the interest represented by the shares is held by the company for the benefit of the true owner. As the habitation or domicil of the company is and must be in the state that created it, the property represented by its certificates of stock may be deemed to be held by the company within the state whose creature it is, whenever it is sought by suit to determine who is its real owner. This principle is not affected by the fact that the defendant is authorized by the laws of Michigan to have an office in another state, at which a book showing the transfers \n\n[205 U.S. 46, 58]\n\u00a0\n of stock may be kept.' See also Dick v. Foraker, \n155 U.S. 404\n, 39 L. ed. 201, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 124.\n These decisions, we think, make it clear that this suit comes within the act of 1875, as one to remove an encumbrance or cloud upon the title to real property within the eastern district of Illinois. The railroad in question is wholly within that district, although the defendant corporations, including the Belleville company, may hold their annual or other meetings in Chicago. The bill seeks the cancelation of the deeds and leases under and by authority of which the properties of the Belleville company are held and managed in the interest, as is alleged, of the Illinois Central Railroad Company, and to the destruction of the rights of the stockholders of the Belleville company. The bill also, as we have seen, prays for the appointment of a receiver of the Belleville company, and the surrender and delivery to such receiver of all its corporate assets, books, papers, and everything that rightfully belongs to it, and account to such receiver, as prayed; also, that the Illinois Central Railroad Company be restrained from interfering in any way with the receiver, or with the operation of the Belleville railroad as an independent, separate company. In addition, there is a prayer in the bill for general relief. If the deeds and leases in question are adjudged to be void, the entire situation, as to the possession and control of the Belleville railroad properties, will be changed, and the alleged encumbrances upon the properties of the Belleville company will be removed. We express no opinion upon the question whether, upon its own showing, or in the event the allegations of the bill are sustained by proof, the plaintiff is entitled to a decree giving the relief asked by it. There was no demurrer to the bill as being insufficient in equity. The only inquiry now is whether, looking at the allegations of the bill, the suit is of such a nature as to bring it within the act of 1875, as one to remove encumbrances or clouds upon real or personal property within the district where the suit was brought, and, therefore, one local to such district. The court below held \n\n[205 U.S. 46, 59]\n\u00a0\n that the suit was not one which could be brought and maintained against the defendant corporations found to be inhabitants of another district, and not voluntarily appearing in the suit; and this, notwithstanding the railroad in question is wholly within the district where the suit was brought. 18 Stat. at L. 472, chap. 137, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 513; 25 Stat. at L. 436, chap. 866. If the suit was within the terms of the act of 1875, then the circuit court of the eastern district of Illinois, although the defendant corporations may be inhabitants of another district in Illinois, could proceed to such an adjudication as the facts would justify, subject, of course, to the condition prescribed by the 8th section of that act, that any adjudication affecting absent defendants without appearance should affect only such property within the district as may be the subject of the suit and under the jurisdiction of the court.\n The plaintiff contends that this condition was waived, and the general appearance of the defendants entered, when their counsel, at the hearing as to the sufficiency of the pleas to the jurisdiction, argued the merits of the case as disclosed by the bill. This is too harsh an interpretation of what occurred in the court below. There was no motion for the dismissal of the bill for want of equity. The discussion of the merits was permitted or invited by the court in order that it might be informed on that question in the event it concluded to consider the merits along with the question of the sufficiency of the pleas to the jurisdiction. We are satisfied that the defendants did not intend to waive the benefit of their qualified appearance at the time of filing the pleas to the jurisdiction.\n We adjudge that the suit is of such a nature as to bring it within the jurisdiction of the circuit court for the eastern district, under the act of 1875. The judgment must, therefore, be reversed, and the cause remanded, that the plaintiff may proceed, as it may be advised, with the preparation of its case under the act of 1875\n\n\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","35":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCITY OF CHICAGO v. MILLS(1907)\nNo. 286\nArgued: Decided: February 4, 1907\n\n\n\n\n[204 U.S. 321, 322]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. James Hamilton Lewis, Henry M. Ashton, and David K.

Boyesen for appellee. \n\n[204 U.S. 321, 325]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case is here upon a question of jurisdiction of the circuit court of the United States for the northern district of Illinois to entertain the suit. 26 Stat. at L. 826, chap. 517, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 488. The case originated in a bill filed in that court by the complainant, Darius O. Mills, a citizen of California, as a stockholder in the People's Gas, Light, & Coke Company, a corporation of the state of Illinois, to restrain the city of Chicago from enforcing a certain ordinance limiting the right of the gas company as to charges for furnishing gas.\n Complainant averred a demand of the directors that an action be brought by the company to restrain the city from enforcing the ordinance, and alleged compliance with the ninety-fourth equity rule, and the refusal of the company to bring the action.\n The original bill alleged that the ordinance impaired the obligation of the contract contained in the charter of the gas company, in contravention of the contract clause of the Federal Constitution; and, also, that the ordinance was illegal in that the city had no power to pass it.\n The ordinance thus complained of was adopted by the city of Chicago, October 15, 1900, and provided that charges for gas in excess of 75 cents per 1,000 cubic feet should be illegal, and fixed a penalty of not less than $25 or more than $200 for each and every violation of the ordinance.\n The objection made to the jurisdiction of the circuit court, and which is said to be established in the record and duly presented here, is based upon the allegation that the suit by Mills was brought in the Federal court by collusion between him and the gas company, and for the fraudulent purpose of invoking the jurisdiction of the Federal court concerning a controversy which was really between the company and the city of Chicago,-parties lacking the requisite diversity of citizenship to maintain the suit in the Federal courts.\n The record discloses that the appeal was allowed to this \n\n[204 U.S. 321, 326]\n\u00a0\n court solely upon the question of the jurisdiction of the court as a circuit court of the United States. A certificate entered the same term at which the appeal was allowed sets forth that the city objected to the jurisdiction of the court as a Federal court, and that the appeal was prayed solely upon the question of jurisdiction of the court as a circuit court of the United States, and that the appeal was granted solely upon the question of jurisdiction.\n Portions of the proceedings, including the testimony on the question of jurisdiction, duly signed and sealed and made part of the record, are certified to this court by a certificate in the form of a bill of exceptions. Re Lehigh Min. & Mfg. Co. \n156 U.S. 322\n, 39 L. ed. 438, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 375; G. H. Nichols Lumber Co. v. Fransom (decided at this term), \n203 U.S. 278\n, ante, 102, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 102.\n A preliminary objection is made that the certificate does not show whether the jurisdictional question arose from insufficient amount, want of diversity of citizenship, collusion, or otherwise. But we are of the opinion that an examination of the record, aided by the opinion of the court contained therein, and made part thereof, distinctly shows that the question of jurisdiction passed upon concerned the collusive character of the action of the complainant.\n We think this brings the case within the ruling in Smith v. McKay, \n161 U.S. 355\n, 40 L. ed. 731, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 490, in which the court, looking into the character of the appeal, the certificate of the court, and the certified copy of the opinion, made part of the record, sustained the court's jurisdiction, citing, with approval, Shields v. Coleman, \n157 U.S. 168\n, 39 L. ed. 660, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 570, and Re Lehigh Min. & Mfg. Co. supra.\n The circuit court, after an examination of the testimony, reached the conclusion that the action was not collusive, and, upon final decree, granted a perpetual injunction against the enforcement of the ordinance in question. On this appeal we are only concerned with the correctness of the conclusion reached in the circuit court as to the question of jurisdiction. This question is before us upon this record. Wetmore v. Rymer, us upon this record. Wetmore v. Rymer, \n\n[204 U.S. 321, 327]\n\u00a0\n \n169 U.S. 115\n, 42 L. ed. 682, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 293. In order to determine it it is necessary to consider briefly as may be the facts shown in this record.\n The ordinance in question was passed October 15, 1900. The People's Gas, Light, & Coke Company, on the 21st of December, 1900, brought a suit in the circuit court of the United States for the northern district of Illinois, seeking to enjoin enforcement of the ordinance, upon the ground that it impaired the obligation of its charter contract, denied equal protection of the laws, and amounted to a confiscation of its property; and upon the further ground that no power had been conferred upon the city of Chicago by the legislature of Illinois to thus regulate the price of gas.\n It is unnecessary to recite all of the proceedings of that suit in detail. The history of the litigation will be found in the opinion of the chief justice when the case came here from the circuit court on appeal ( \n194 U.S. 1\n, 48 L. ed. 851, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 520).\n To the bill as originally filed in that case the city of Chicago filed a general demurrer, and the circuit court, holding that no constitutional right of the company was impaired, decided that its jurisdiction would not extend to the question of the power of the council to pass the ordinance in question, and that such a question was one primarily for the state courts; thereupon the company filed an amended bill, limiting its rights to the alleged impairment of its contract. The city of Chicago also demurred to the amended bill, and, upon the hearing of the demurrer, it was sustained and the bill dismissed for want of jurisdiction, and a final decree was entered to that effect. An appeal was thereupon taken to this court.\n When the litigation had progressed thus far, complainant, Mills, who was the largest stockholder in the company, consulted counsel in New York with a view to protecting his interests. Counsel, having examined the record, prepared a letter dated December 16, 1902, addressed to the directors of the gas company, and signed by complainant, in which he set forth that the proceedings in the suit concerning the ordinance reducing the price of gas to 75 cents per 1,000 cubic feet had been sub- \n\n[204 U.S. 321, 328]\n\u00a0\n mitted to his counsel, together with a copy of the opinion of the circuit court, and that an appeal was then pending in the Supreme Court of the United States; the advice of his counsel that that suit might not adequately protect his interests, as the bill was dismissed for want of jurisdiction, and that the Supreme Court might limit the decision of the case to the question of jurisdiction. And, further, that it did not involve the question of the power of the council of the city of Chicago to reduce the rates of the company. He then requested the institution of a suit against the city of Chicago at the earliest practicable moment for the purpose of preventing the enforcement of the ordinance, upon the ground that it impaired its charter contract and that the council had no power to pass it. The letter further expounded the necessity of resorting to a court of equity for protection of the company's rights.\n The record discloses that the company's counsel came to New York, where a conference was had with the counsel retained by Mills, and a difference of opinion was developed as to the propriety and advisability of a new suit which would cover the opints in difference. The result of this conference was that the company's counsel notified counsel for Mills that he should advise the board to decline the request to bring a new suit.\n On January 29, 1903, the company wrote to Mills, declining to begin the suit, and sent a copy of the resolution reciting the belief of the board that for the company to institute further legal proceedings to test the validity of the ordinance of October 15, 1900, would excite public prejudice against the company, which at that time it was deemed of great importance to avoid, and afterwards, at the annual meeting of the stockholders of the company, a resolution directing the beginning of the suit was defeated.\n The question of jurisdiction must be decided, having reference to the attitude of the case at the date the bill was filed, on June 8, 1903. Kirby v. American Soda Fountain Co. 194 \n\n[204 U.S. 321, 329]\n\u00a0\n U. S. 141, 145, 146, 48 L. ed. 911, 912, 913, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 619. As to the refusal of the company to institute a new suit, there is nothing in the record to show any concert of action between complainant and the company. At that time his counsel in New York was not concerned in the litigation in Chicago or in the appeal to this court. As the case brought by the gas company then stood, it had been dismissed for want of jurisdiction, and an appeal taken from that decree of dismissal. The case did not necessarily involve the question of contract rights, and did not embrace the question of power of the city.\n In this attitude of affairs counsel might well advise that the protection of the stockholders' interest required the beginning of a suit which should embrace the vital questions in issue. There was a sharp difference of views between the representatives of Mills and those of the company's solicitors as to the advisability of bringing an action.\n For the prudential reasons outlined in their letter of January 29, 1903, above referred to, the directors of the company declined to bring the suit. After the judgment of the circuit court was affirmed in this court, the question of the power of the city to pass the ordinance was left undecided, and was subsequently litigated to a final decree in favor of the contention made in the suit begun by Mills.\n It is true that upon the hearing of the demurrer in this action the circuit court ordered a decree correcting its former decree in the gas company suit so as to show that the court decided the case upon the merits as to the allegations as to contract, and dismissed the bill without prejudice to the bringing of any other suit to test the power of the city.\n The corrected decree was brought before this court in the then pending appeal of the gas company. \n194 U.S. 1\n, 48 L. ed. 851, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 520.\n After the decision in this court, affirming the decree in the gas company suit, an amended bill was filed by complainant Mills, based solely upon the alleged want of power of the city council of Chicago to pass the ordinance in controversy, which resulted in the decree to which we have referred, enjoining \n\n[204 U.S. 321, 330]\n\u00a0\n the enforcement of the ordinance, for the reason that the city council of Chicago had no power to pass the same.\n As we have said, we think the record establishes that complainant and his counsel honestly believed that such new suit was necessary to protect the stockholders' interests. There is an entire lack of testimony to show any collusive action at the time of the beginning of the suit.\n It is true that subsequent events made it to the interest of the company to make common cause with Mills against the enforcement of the ordinance in question, but when he began his suit no proceedings were pending which involved the important question of the power of the city upon which the complainant ultimately prevailed.\n It is true that an officer of the company, who was the next largest stockholder to Mills, contributed to the expenses in this suit; but he testified, and there is nothing in the record to contradict him, that he paid this money from his own resources, without actual repayment, or any understanding with the company that he should be reimbursed.\n It is true that Mills' counsel was retained in the suit in this court after the beginning of his suit in Chicago.\n It is also true that, in answering to a question put in the language of the ninety-fourth rule, as to whether the suit was brought to confer upon the circuit court of the United States jurisdiction in a case of which it would not otherwise have cognizance, complainant answered that he so understood it, but subsequently said that he did not understand the question. This admission, intentionally made, would not necessarily show collusion. But we think it was not the purpose of the complainant to say more than that he expected his action to be brought in the United States court. When a citizen of one state has a cause of action against a citizen of another state which he may prosecute lawfully in a Federal court, and when the suit is free from fraud or collusion, his motive in preferring a Federal tribunal is immaterial.

MINNEAPOLIS ST. RY. CO.(1907)\nNo. 46\nArgued: Decided: February 9, 1907\n\n\n The case was tried upon amended bill and answer. The ground alleged for injunction in the amended bill was in substance that the ordinance of February 9, 1907, violated the terms of a previous and subsisting contract, prescribing the rates of fare to be charged by the company in the city of Minneapolis. It appears in the record that the railway company was organized on July 1, 1873, and that its alleged contract arises from an ordinance of the city of Minneapolis passed July 9, 1875, ratified by an act of the legislature of the state of Minnesota passed March 4, 1879. We shall have occasion later on to deal more specifically with this ordinance and ratifying act.\n It is sufficient for the present purpose to say that it is the contention of the company, that, by the ordinance of July 9, 1875, and the ratifying act, it became the owner of an irrepealable contract for the term of fifty years from the date of its organization, by the terms of which it had the right to charge a fare not exceeding 5 cents for each person carried on any continuous line which might be designated by the city council of the city, such continuous line, however, not to exceed 3 miles in length. The contract, it is alleged, is violated by the ordinance of February 9, 1907, requiring the sale of six tickets for 25 cents.\n The existence of the alleged contract is denied by the city upon several grounds. It is urged that the complainant company was so organized that its charter, and consequently its corporate life, expired thirty years after the date of its incorporation,-that is, on July 1, 1903; and therefore its contract rights ceased and terminated at that time. This contention is based upon the incorporation of the company, which \n\n[215 U.S. 417, 422]\n\u00a0\n it is insisted, could only be under title 4 of the laws of Minnesota, which includes transportation and other lawful business, and limits corporations organized thereunder to a continuation for not more than thirty years. Bissell's Stat. (Minn.) 1873, p. 443.\n It is the contention of the company that it was organized under title 1 of the laws of Minnesota (Bissell's Stat. 1873, p. 419, for a term of fifty years. Title 1 is headed, 'Of Corporations Empowered to Take Private Property for Public Uses,' and includes corporations 'for the purpose of building, improving, and operating railways, . . . and all works of internal improvement which require the taking of private property or any easement therein.' Pertinent provisions of title 1 as to incorporation are given in the margin. \n\n Title 1.\n Sec. 1. Any number of persons, not less than five, may associate themselves and become incorporated for the purpose of building, improving, and operating railways, telegraphs, canals, or slack- water navigation, upon any river or lake, and all works of internal improvement which require the taking of private property or any easement therein.\n Sec. 2.

The name of the corporation, the general nature of its business, and the principal place, if any, of transacting the same. Second. The time of commence and the period of continuance of said corporation. Third. The amount of capital stock of said corporation, and how to be paid in. Fourth. The highest amount of indebtedness or liability to which said corporation shall at any time be subject. Fifth. The names and places of residence of the persons forming such association for incoproration. Sixth. The names of the first board of directors, and in what officers or persons the government of the corporation and the man- agement of its affairs shall be vested, and when the same are elected. Seventh. The number and amount of the shares in the capital stock of said corporation. . . .\n Sec. 4. When articles are filed, recorded, and published, as aforesaid, the persons named as corporators therein become a body corporate [provisions follow in this section as to management of business, amendment of articles of incorporation, etc.].\n Sec. 5. No such corporation shall be formed to continue more than fifty years in the first instance, but it may be renewed from time to time for periods not longer than fifty years: Provided, that three fourths of the votes cast at any regular election for the purpose are in favor of such renewal, and those desiring a renewal purchase the stock of those opposed thereto at its current value. \n\n[215 U.S. 417, 423]\n\u00a0\n Title 4 is, 'Of Corporations for Pecuniary Profit Other Than Those Named in Title 1.' The pertinent parts of that title are given in the margin. \n Title 4. (This title is title 2 of chapter 34 of the Statutes of 1866.)\n Of Corporations for Pecuniary Profit Other Than Those Named in Title 1.\n Sec. 98 (45, as amended by act of March 10, 1873). Any number of persons, not less than three, who have or shall, by articles of agreement in writing, associate according to the provisions of this title under any name assumed by them, for the purpose of engaging in and carrying on the business of mining, smelting, or manufacturing iron, copper, or other minerals, or for producing the precious metals, or for quarrying and marketing any kind of ore, stone, slate, or other mineral substances, or for constructing, leasing, or operating docks, warehouses, elevators, or hotels, or as a mutual savings fund, loan, or building association, manufacturing gas, or for any kind of manufacturing, lumbering, agricultural, mechanical, mercantile, chemical, transportation, or other lawful business, and who have or shall comply with the provisions of this title, shall, with their associates, successors, and assigns, constitute a body corporate and politic under the name assumed by them in their articles of agreement; provided, no company shall take a name previously assumed by any other company. Any mutual saving fund, loan, or building association, as authorized to loan funds and to secure such loans by mortgage or other security, and any premiums taken by any such association for the preference or priority of such loans, shall not be deemed interest within the meaning of  1 of chapter 23 of the general statutes. Any such association is authorized and empowered to purchase at any sheriff's or other judicial sale, or at any other sale, public or private, any real estate upon which such association may have or hold any mortgage, judgment, or lien, or other encumbrance, or in which such association may have an interest, and the real estate so purchased, to sell, convey, lease, or mortgage at pleasure, to any person or persons whatsoever.\n Sec. 99. (46, as amended by act of February 28, 1870). The provisions of  2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 42, and 44 of title 1 shall apply to and be observed by corporations organizing under this title.\n Sec. 100. (47 . . .

No corporation shall be formed under this title to continue more than thirty years.#e been organized under title 4. There have been no proceedings, so far as the record shows, to inquire into its corporate existence since the expiration of the thirty years, and this record discloses that a number of ordinances have been passed by the city of Minneapolis since July 1, 1903, requiring of the corporation the construction of additional lines of railway upon certain of the streets of the city of Minneapolis, and to otherwise discharge its duties as a continuing corporation. \n\n[215 U.S. 417, 424]\n\u00a0\n Much of the elaborate briefs of counsel in this case is devoted to a discussion of the question of the organization of this corporation, and as to whether it was under the one title or the other. This is not a proceeding in quo warranto, and the jurisdiction of the Federal court rested upon the contention that the company has a contract right, protected from impairment by a legislative act of the state. It is only necessary to examine the question of the incorporation and organization of the company so far as is required to determine whether or not this alleged contract right exists, and whether it has been violated by the ordinance of the city of Minneapolis, attacked in the amended bill.\n There can be no question that the attempted incorporation of this company was under title 1 of the statutes already referred to. It was incorporated by five persons. It states the business for which it was formed, 'to construct and operate \n\n[215 U.S. 417, 425]\n\u00a0\n railways in the streets and highways of the city of Minneapolis and its suburbs in the county of Hennepin, state of Minnesota.' It states the time of the commencement of the corporation to be the 1st of July, 1873, and the period of continuance thereof to be fifty years thereafter. The shares of capital stock are twenty-five hundred at $100 each.\n Under title 4 the corporate life is limited to not more than thirty years, and the shares of capital stock are to be not less than $10 or more than $50 each.\n The corporation has continued to act since the expiration of the thirty years which would have been its corporate life had it of its affairs shall be vested, and when the same are elected.\n This record therefore shows that the company undertook to organize under title 1, for the period of fifty years, has continued to act as such corporation, and was so acting at the time of the passage of the ordinance of February 9, 1907\n\n\n We proceed to examine the question, Did the ordinance of July 9, 1875, together with the ratifying act of 1879, make a contract between the city of Minneapolis and the street railway company which would endure for the period of fifty years? Section 1 of the ordinance of July 9, 1875, provides:\n'Sec. 1. That the Minneapolis Street Railway Company be and is hereby granted, during the term of its charter, the exclusive right and privilege of constructing and operating a single or double track for a passenger railway line, with all necessary tracks for turnouts, side tracks, and switches, in such streets of said city, as the city council may deem suited to street railways, subject to the terms, conditions, and forfeitures hereinafter contained; provided, that the city council reserves the \n\n[215 U.S. 417, 426]\n\u00a0\n right to limit the said company to the construction of a single track upon such street or streets as it may deem proper.'\n\n Section 8 of the same ordinance provides:\n'Sec. 8. The said company may regulate and establish, from time to time, such rates of fare for the transportation of passengers and freight over its lines of railway as it may deem proper; provided, that the charge for carrying a person, including hand baggage, from one point to another within the city limits, whether by one or more lines operated by the same company, shall not exceed 5 cents on any one line; provided, further, that the city of Minneapolis hereby reserves the right to alter and regulate the rate to be charged by the said companies, their successors and assigns, for the transportation of passengers and freight at the expiration of five years from the approval of this ordinance, and every five years thereafter, fixing the same at such rates as the city council of said city may deem just and reasonable; provided, that the city shall not reduce the passenger's fare below 5 cents, over any one continuous line, and what shall be considered a continuous line may be designated by the city council of the said city, but that said council shall not designate any such continuous line to be more than 3 miles in length.'\n\n Section 17 of the ordinance provides:\n'Sec. 17. Within thirty days from the publication of this ordinance said company shall file with the city clerk a written acceptance of the grants hereinabove made, with the conditions, regulations, and limitations above expressed, signed by the president and secretary of said company, and when so accepted, this ordinance shall operate as a contract between the city and said company, and upon failure to file such acceptance, as aforesaid, then the above grant shall not become operative to vest any rights, privileges, or franchises whatsoever.'\n\n It also appears that the city filed its acceptance in writing of the ordinance on August 18, 1875. \n\n[215 U.S. 417, 427]\n\u00a0\n In considering the terms of this ordinance and what it undertook to accomplish on its face, we are to bear in mind that public grants of this character are not to be extended by implication, and that all that is granted must be found in the plain terms of the act. This principle has been so frequently and recently announced in this court that it is unnecessary to cite the cases which have established it. Recognizing this principle, it must also be remembered that grants of the character of the one under consideration here, when embodying the terms of a contract, are protected by the Federal Constitution from impairment by subsequent state legislation, and notwithstanding the principle of strict construction, whatever is plainly granted cannot be taken from the parties entitled thereto by such legislative enactments. Statutes and ordinances of this character are not to be extended by construction, nor should they be deprived of their meaning, if it is plainly and clearly expressed.\n Examining this ordinance in the light of these principles, there is no ambiguity in  8, which gives to the city the right to regulate the fares to be charged, provided the same are not reduced below 5 cents for each passenger over any one continuous line, to be designated by the city, of not more than 3 miles in length. By  1 of the same ordinance, the right and privilege of constructing and operating a railway line subject to the terms, conditions, and forfeitures named in the ordinance is granted to the street railway company 'during the term of its charter.'\n What did this mean? The company had undertaken to organize, and filed its certificate of incorporation,-which is its charter under the laws of Minnesota,-and had therein stated its term of existence to be for fifty years from the 1st day of July, 1873. There was a positive requirement of the law that this period of duration should be stated in the certificate filed for the purpose of procuring incorporation, and it was there found, and was duly filed, recorded, and published as required by law. \n\n[215 U.S. 417, 428]\n\u00a0\n It is unreasonable to suppose that the city and the company at that time entered into and inquiry or controversy as to whether the company could lawfully incorporate for more than thirty years. The charter referred to in the ordinance could not have been anything else than the certificate of incorporation required by law. Of this the city was bound to take notice; and when it granted the privileges 'during the term of the charter,' it could have meant nothing less than during the period named in the charter. As was declared by the supreme court of Minnesota in Duluth v. Duluth Gas & Water Co. 45 Minn. 210, 47 N. W. 781, a case involving the extent of rights conferred upon a water company by a city ordinance, 'The council must be held, when dealing with defendant, to know its character, its purposes and powers, as disclosed by its articles of incorporation.'\n We come now to the terms of the ratifying act of March 4, 1879. This act is as follows: An Act to Confirm the Grant of the City of\n Minneapolis to the Minneapolis Street\n Railway Company.\n Be it enacted by the legislature of the state of Minnesota:\n Sec. 1. That whereas the city of Minneapolis did, by an ordinance entitled, 'An Ordinance Authorizing and Regulating Street Railways in the City of Minneapolis,' passed by the city council of said city on the ninth ( 9th) day of July, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-five (1875), and approved by the mayor of said city on the seventeenth (17th) day of July, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-five (1875), and by an ordinance passed July third (3d), one thousand eight hundred and seventy-eight (1878 ), and amended July eighth (8th), one thousand eight hundred and seventy- eight (1878), and approved July tenth (10th), one thousand eight hundred and seventy-eight (1878), grant to the Minneapolis Street Railway Company the right to construct and maintain a street railway through the streets of \n\n[215 U.S. 417, 429]\n\u00a0\n said city, with certain rights and privileges in said ordinance particularly set forth. Now the said right to construct and maintain said street railway through the streets of said city, with the rights and privileges as set forth and qualified in said ordinance, is hereby legalized and granted to said company.\n Sec. 2. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage.\n The ordinances of July, 1878, referred to in the ratifying act, concerned certain streets in the city of Minneapolis, and are not important to be considered in this connection.\n It has not been suggested in the elaborate briefs presented by the learned counsel for the city, that the state legislature at that time had not the constitutional right to pass this ratifying act.\n In Green v. Knife Falls Boom Corp. 35 Minn. 155, 27 N. W. 924, the supreme court of Minnesota sustained a special law conferring new and independent franchises and enlarged powers upon the boom company, a corporation organized under title 4, and originally not having the power of eminent domain, nor to take tolls, nor to obstruct the navigable portions of the St. Louis river.\n By the special act the corporation was given power over the navigation and use of the river as respects the passage of logs, the power to exercise the right of eminent domain was conferred upon it, the right to charge toll upon all logs passed through their works, and to receive and take entire charge and control of timber which might run or be driven through the same, and to boom, scale, and deliver such timber, as provided in the act, with a lien upon all such logs, which might be enforced by sale.\n It was held that, by a long course of legislation and practical construction, such legislation was justified and ought not to be disturbed. The constitutional amendment of 1881, it was said, made such legislation impossible thereafter, because the legislature is therein prohibited from enacting any special \n\n[215 U.S. 417, 430]\n\u00a0\n or private laws in the following cases: '. . . For granting corporate powers or privileges, except to cities.' In this case the court referred to Ames v. Lake Superior & M. R. Co. 21 Minn. 241, in which it seems to be held that, under the former constitution, prohibiting the formation of corporations, except for municipal purposes, under special acts, such special acts stopping short of creating new corporations might be passed by the legislature. See opinion upon rehearing, pages 284, 285.\n Looking to the terms of the act of March 4, 1879, we find that the right to construct and maintain the street railway upon the streets of the city, with the rights and privileges as set forth and qualified in the ordinance, is 'legalized and granted to said company.' Language could scarcely be plainer, and, if we are correct in construing the ordinance as granting the right and privilege of maintaining railways in the streets of Minneapolis for the charter term of fifty years, upon the terms therein mentioned, a vital part of which concerns the right of the company to charge a certain fare for passengers carried, it follows that this privilege, with the others, was vested in the company by the legislature of the state of Minnesota.\n We may note in this connection that the mere fact that a contract may extend beyond the term of the life of a corporation does not destroy it. This principle was recognized by this court in Detroit v. Detroit Citizens' Street R. Co. \n184 U.S. 368\n, 46 L. ed. 592, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 410, in which it was held that a city ordinance granting the use of the streets of the city for a term which would extend the grant for sixteen years beyond the life of the corporation did not invalidate it. It was held that the limitation upon the corporate life of the company did not prevent it from taking franchises, or other property, the title to which would not expire with the corporation itself; and further, that, at the end of its corporate life, if such property were still in existence, it would be an asset divisible among the shareholders after the payment of debts, or it might, if \n\n[215 U.S. 417, 431]\n\u00a0\n assignable, be transferred to any other person or company competent to hold it.\n The ratifying act, being within the power of the legislature, vested this contract right in the company, notwithstanding the want of power in the city to make it at the time it was entered into. Nash v. Lowry, 37 Minn. 261, 33 N. W. 787.\n The principle is well stated by Morawetz in his work on Private Corporations, vol. 1,  319, 2d ed.:\n'Where the legislature, by statute, recognizes and acquiesces in the existence of a corporation which was formed by the corporators without the proper authority, it thereby invests the association with the right of continuing to act in a corporate capacity for the purposes and in the manner that it publicly assumed to act. And if rights or franchises are conferred upon an association claiming to be incorporated, it thereby becomes authorized to exercise the powers expressly conferred, and such others as the legislature appears to have imputed to it.'\n\n See, as to the effect of validating acts, Los Angeles v. Los Angeles City Water Co. \n177 U.S. 558\n, 44 L. ed. 886, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 736; Blair v. Chicago, \n201 \nU.S. 400, 454\n, 50 S. L. ed. 801, 823, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 427.\n But, it is contended, if a contract is found to exist, its rights were lost by virtue of the ordinance of September 19, 1890, authorizing the street railway company to change its mode of operation from the use of horse power to electricity. It is insisted that, by the acceptance of the electrical-power ordinance, the company abandoned any rights it had under the ordinance of 1875 and the ratifying act of 1879; and, furthermore, that, by the express terms of the ordinance of September 19, 1890, the right to control the future rates of fare was thereby vested in the city to an extent unlimited except by constitutional inhibitions against confiscatory legislation.\n As to the termination of the rights of the company by reason of the substitution of electricity for horse power, is there such abandonment of the rights originally secured that they no longer exist? It is contended that the original ordinance \n\n[215 U.S. 417, 432]\n\u00a0\n was limited to the right to operate street railways horse or penumatic power, and that when the ordinance of September 19, 1890, was passed conditions were entirely changed, by horse or pneumatic power, and that was substituted, and rights existing under the original ordinance were terminated and abandoned.\n Let us see if the ordinance of 1875 was limited to the use of animal or pneumatic power. Section 4 of that ordinance provides:\n'Sec. 4. The cars to be used upon such tracks shall be propelled with either animal or pneumatic power, as the said company deem advisable, provided that no propelling power or machinery of any sort shall be used after it shall prove to be a public nuisance, and said company may connect with any other railway upon which power is used similar to that authorized to be used on street railways by the city council; but no locomotive, freight or passenger car, such as are usually run over the general railways of this state for the transportation of freight and passengers, shall be used upon any of said tracks, unless authorized by the city council; provided, that the said Minneapolis Street Railway Company, and any other street railway company which the council may charter under  3 of this ordinance, shall each allow the other to connect with and jointly use such portions of the track belonging to each as the convenience of the traveling public may require, upon such equitable terms as may be agreed upon by the said companies, or as may be determined by the district court of Hennepin county.'\n\n There can be no doubt that, in the then state of the art, the use of electric power as the means of operating the cars of the company was not specifically in contemplation. While pneumatic power is also suggested, there does not seem to be any means of operation by that method. That the use of other motive power might be developed in the progress of street railway operation, we think, was clearly indicated in the ordinance itself. For while animal or pneumatic power is \n\n[215 U.S. 417, 433]\n\u00a0\n named, it is provided that no propelling power shall be used after it shall be proved a public nuisance, and that the company might connect with other street railroads upon which power is used similar to that authorized to be used by street railways by the city council, but steam-power cars, such as are in common use, should not be used upon the city tracks, unless so authorized by the city council.\n In these terms of the ordinance it is evident that the parties had in mind that other propelling power might be developed, and it was the purpose of the city council to keep control if its use, so as to prevent it from becoming a public nuisance in the streets. There was no positive limitation to animal power, and the possible progress and improvement in the means of propelling cars, contemplated by the parties, was carried into effect when the city passed, and the company accepted, the ordinance of September 19, 1890. By that ordinance the railway company was authorized to operate all its existing lines, and all its lines to be thereafter constructed in the city, by electricity as the motive power.\n Section 8 of that ordinance provides:\n'Sec. 8. In the construction, maintenance, and operation of said lines of street railway, said Minneapolis Street Railway Company, its successors and assigns, shall at all times be subject to all the conditions and limitations and other provisions of an ordinance entitled, 'An Ordinance Authorizing and Regulating Street Railways in the City of Minneapolis,' passed July 9, 1875, and approved July 17, 1875, as the same has been amended and is now in force, and all other ordinances of said city now in force or hereafter adopted, so far as applicable.'\n\n It is the contention of the city that, by the terms of this ordinance, the street railway company became subject to regulation by the ordinances of the city then in force, or thereafter adopted, including the right to regulate and control the amount to be charged for fares for the transportation of passengers. \n\n[215 U.S. 417, 434]\n\u00a0\n In construing this section we must bear in mind that the company then had, as we have heretofore said, a contract upon the subject of fares, which limited the city in its right to regulate the same to a reduction not below 5 cents per passenger upon any one continuous line. It needs no argument to demonstrate that the right to charge passenger fares is of the very essence of the contract, essential to the operation and success of the enterprise. Detroit v. Detroit Citizens' Street R. Co. \n184 \nU.S. 368, 384\n, 46 S. L. ed. 592, 606, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 410.\n In  6 of the ordinance of September 19, 1890, it is provided:\n'Set. 6. Passenger cars on all said lines shall run between extreme limits on all extensions to or near the intersection of Washington avenue with Hennepin avenue, without change to passengers traveling thereon, and after November 1, 1890, said street railway company shall issue transfer checks at the junction of said lines at Washington and Hennepin avenues, to any passenger on any of said lines who shall pay one full fare, which transfer check shall entitle passenger so receiving the same to a continuous passage on either of said connecting lines; provided, that no passenger shall be entitled to more than one transfer check for one fare; and provided further, that said transfer check shall be used only by the person receiving the same for a continuous passage, and shall be used on the next car departing on the connecting line upon which it is to be used. And, if any of the lines of said railway do not connect at said Washington and Hennepin avenues, transfer checks shall be given at the point nearest to the crossing of Washington and Hennepin avenues where such lines do connect with a line reaching said junction point at Washington and Hennepin avenues.'\n\n This is the only section which mentions the subject of fares, and it is therein provided that transfer checks may be issued at certain points to persons paying 'one full fare,' the transfer check to be used only by the person receiving the same, for one continuous passage. \n\n[215 U.S. 417, 435]\n\u00a0\n The rate of fare had been fixed in the ordinance of July 9, 1875, and, if it was intended to change it, it would seem clear that the parties would have entered into new negotiations concerning it, and would have adopted, if that was desirable, some definite measure concerning it. The ordinance of July 9, 1875, was not attempted to be repealed, and is referred to in  8 of the ordinance of September 19, 1890, 'as the same as has been amended, and as now in force,' and adopted, 'so far as applicable,' concerning the things mentioned in  8.\n It is true that by the ordinance of July 9, 1875, there was no right to reduce the passenger fare below 5 cents over any one continuous line not more than 3 miles in length, to be designated by the city council. By the terms of the ordinance of September 19, 1890, transfers were to be allowed, so that, for one full fare, a passenger might receive a continuous trip very considerably exceeding 3 miles in length,-it is stated in one of the briefs to include a trip of 11 miles. But we do not understand that the acceptance of this regulation had the effect to abrogate the contract as to the right to charge a fare of 5 cents over one continuous line, that is, for one continuous passage. Acquiescence in a regulation which may not have been deemed injurious, and may have been deemed wise and expedient, does not preclude a contest against the enforcement of regulations which are injurious and violative of contract rights. Los Angeles v. Los Angeles City Water Co. \n177 \nU.S. 558, 579\n, 44 S. L. ed. 886, 895, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 736.\n This right to future control under  8 was to include the 'construction, maintenance, and operation' of the lines of the street railway company. Did this undertaking have the effect to abrogate the contract right already existing, and to subject the company for the future, as to the right to charge fares, to the discretion of the city council? Or do the terms 'construction, maintenance, and operation' have reference to the manner of carrying on the business of the road, the laying of its tracks, the use of the streets, the keeping up of \n\n[215 U.S. 417, 436]\n\u00a0\n the equipment, the safety of the passengers and the public, and similar matters not involving the right to charge fares? We think these terms refer to the latter class of rights and privileges. Such is the import of the words used, and the subject of rates of fare is not mentioned. The case already referred to, Detroit v. Detroit Citizens' Street R. Co. \n184 U.S. 368\n, 46 L. ed. 592, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 410, is an instructive one upon this point. In that case it was held that a street railway company having a valid contract giving it the right to charge 5 cents for the transportation of each passenger did not lose that right by accepting the terms of an ordinance reserving the right to make such further rules, orders, and regulations as to the city council may seem proper. \n184 U.S. 399\n.\n We therefore reach the conclusion that when the ordinance complained of, that of February 9, 1907, was enacted by the city council, the company was the owner of a valuable contract right secured to it by the ordinance of July, 1875, ratified by the enactment of the legislature of the state of Minnesota on March 4, 1879, which secured to the company for fifty years from July 1, 1873, the contract right to charge 5 cents per passenger for one continuous trip. We think that the requirement of the ordinance, that the company should operate its roads by the sale of tickets six for a quarter, as required by the ordinance of February 9, 1907, was an enactment by legislative authority which impaired the obligation of the contract thus held and owned by the complainant company. We therefore reach the conclusion that the decree of the circuit court enjoining the execution of the ordinance, for the reasons stated, should be affirmed.\n An examination of the decree, however, shows that it goes beyond the necessities of the case in specifically decreeing that the complainant company is a corporation organized under title 1 of chapter 34 of the Statutes of Minnesota for the year 1866, with charter rights as alleged in the amended bill. It also decrees that the contract under the ordinances of July 9, 1875, and July 18, 1878, as ratified by the act of \n\n[215 U.S. 417, 437]\n\u00a0\n March 4, 1879, constituted a contract for and during the term of complainant's charter, as alleged in the amended bill. In the amended bill it is alleged that the charter rights of the company were extended to March 1, 1937; this is undoubtedly averred because of the amendment to the charter which appears in the record, extending the term of the company's corporate life until that time. The decree as it stands might be construed as establishing a contract to endure until March, 1937.\n All that was necessary to adjudge was that the company, by virtue of the ordinance of July 9, 1875, as amended in July, 1878, as ratified and confirmed by the act of the legislature of the state of Minnesota of March 4, 1879, constituted a valid contract for the term of fifty years from July 1, 1873, which is still so far in force as to prevent the city council from reducing the rate of fare below the sum of 5 cents for each passenger for one continuous passage, and enjoining the city from publishing and enforcing the ordinance of February 9, 1907, because the same impaired the obligation of the subsisting contract aforesaid.\n The decree of the Circuit Court should be modified so as to meet these requirements, and, so modified, affirmed. \n\n\n\n","37":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCLARK v.

No definite term of extension was stated. What has already been said in regard to the other six pleas in the case determines the decision in regard to the same pleas hereinabove set forth.

CO. v. CITY OF CLEVELAND(1907)\nNo. 197\nArgued: Decided: January 7, 1907\n\n\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Peckham: \n\n[204 U.S. 116, 117]\n\u00a0\n This bill was filed in the United States circuit court for the northern district of Ohio on the 21st of March, 1905, against the city of Cleveland and the Forest City Railway Company, for the purpose of obtaining an injunction to restrain the city from carrying out a certain ordinance relating to the Garden street branch of complainant's railroad, passed by the city council January 11, 1904, on the ground that it was null and void, because it impaired the obligations of various contracts which the complainant alleged had been entered into between the complainant and the city, providing for the use until either July 13, 1913, or July 1, 1914, of certain streets by the railroad owned by the complainant, and known as the Garden street or Central avenue branch, and hereafter called the Garden street branch. The ordinance granted to the Forest City Railway Company (a stranger to the original grants) the renewal right to maintain and operate the existing street railroads through the streets named therein, which were the same streets theretofore granted to the Garden street railroad. The right was granted upon condition that the grantee should pay to the owners of the poles and other property being in the streets an amount to be agreed upon therefor, or such sum as should be finally adjudicated upon by a court. A temporary restraining order was granted. The defendants made separate answers, denying the existence of any contract between the complainant and the city upon the subject of the Garden street branch subsequent to March 22, 1905, and the Forest City Railway Company claimed under the ordinance of January, 1904, the right to take possession of such Garden street branch after March, 1905, and to use the tracks of the complainant's railroad. The case was heard upon the pleadings and various ordinances and resolutions of the council of the city. \n\n[204 U.S. 116, 118]\n\u00a0\n After hearing, a decree was made by the circuit court (137 Fed. 111) which decreed that the right claimed by the complainant to operate its Garden street branch railroad in the streets named in the bill expired on the 22d day of March, 1905. It was also decreed that the ordinance of January 11, 1904, was inoperative, so far as it assumed to confer upon the defendant the Forest City Railway Company any legal right to take the tracks, poles, wires, and appliances erected and maintained by the complainant in the streets, because such ordinance authorized the taking of the property of complainant without due process of law. The railroad company, therefore, was enjoined from interfering with the complainant in the peaceable possession of the property mentioned, and the city was enjoined from attempting in any manner, by virtue of the ordinance, to put the defendant the Forest City Railway Company into possession of the same. From the decree the complainant and both of the defendants appealed directly to this court, as involving questions arising under the Constitution of the United States. The complainant's appeal is No. 197, and is from that portion of the decree which adjudges that the right of the complainant to maintain and operate its Garden street branch railroad expired on the 22d of March, 1905. The cross appeal of the defendants is from that portion of the decree which enjoins the Forest City Railway Company from taking possession of the property described, and which also enjoins the city from in any manner attempting to put that company into possession thereof. It thus appears that the whole controversy turns upon the question whether the right of the Garden street railroad terminated March 22, 1905, or lasts until July 1, 1914, or possibly only until July 13, 1913\n\n\n The record shows that there are, among others, two lines of railroad belonging to the complainant, one of which is known as the Euclid avenue, sometimes called the 'main' line, and the other the Garden street branch. Both lines run from east to west through the city in different, though generally parallel, streets up to the point of their intersection at Erie street and \n\n[204 U.S. 116, 119]\n\u00a0\n Euclid avenue (or Prospect street) from which point west, for a short distance, to the public square and Water street, the Garden street branch is authorized to use the Euclid avenue tracks.\n The following (among many other) ordinances and resolutions of the council of the city were put in evidence on the trial, together with the various resolutions of complainant, in which it accepted such ordinances and resolutions. These constitute the case between the parties, and there is no contradictory evidence. Complainant contends that the Garden street grant must be measured in time by that provided for the termination of the Euclid avenue grant.\n The ordinances and resolutions relating to the Euclid avenue line will be first stated. The first is a resolution which granted to the East Cleveland Railroad Company, a corporation incorporated February 28, 1859, for that purpose, the right to construct and operate a railroad from a point on Prospect street at its intersection with Erie street, to the eastern terminus of Prospect street, which grant was for the term of twenty years from September 20, 1859. The company, having obtained the necessary consents of the property owners along the line, duly located, constructed, and operated the road under that resolution and within a short time after it was authorized so to do.\n This was the commencement of what is known as the Euclid avenue, or sometimes (after 1868) the main line of one of the roads owned now by the complainant.\n By ordinance, April 15, 1862, the company was authorized to extend its line from the intersection of Erie and Euclid streets west to the public square.\n September 15, 1879, an ordinance was passed which granted a renewal of the franchise to the East Cleveland Railroad Company to maintain and operate its whole Euclid avenue street railroad as far as Willson avenue, on the east, for a period of twenty-five years from September 20, 1879 ( September 20, 1904). This ordinance makes no reference to the Garden street line, which had then been built and was in operation, and does not mention any of the streets through which that line passed, \n\n[204 U.S. 116, 120]\n\u00a0\n although the Garden street line had the right, under the ordinance of 1868, hereinafter mentioned, to use the tracks of the Euclid avenue line from the point of junction therewith westerly to its terminus.\n On the 4th of April, 1883, another ordinance was passed, granting to the East Cleveland Railroad Company the right to extend, lay, and operate its double track on Euclid avenue from the west line of Willson avenue easterly to the east line of Fairmount street, the right granted to terminate on the 20th of September, 1904, 'with the said renewal of that part of said company's line lying west of Willson avenue.' Ordinance of September 15, 1879, above referred to.\n By ordinance of March 15, 1886, another grant was made to the Euclid avenue line east of Fairmount street, which grant was to cease and terminate upon the 20th of September, 1904, 'as provided for said company's tracks in Euclid avenue, west of Fairmount street.'\n In order to change from animal power to electricity an ordinance was passed July 13, 1888, granting to the East Cleveland Street Railway Company the right to construct and operate an electric street railway on Euclid avenue from Willson avenue easterly to the city limits, and on Cedar avenue from a point near the Cleveland & Pittsburg Railway, company's right of way in that avenue, easterly to a point about 1,500 feet east of Fairmount street. The permission was given on the condition that the grant was to be exercised within six months from the passage of the ordinance. The grant was also upon condition that if the company, from any cause, should fail to extend the electric system over its entire main and Cedar avenue lines within eighteen months from the date of the passage of the ordinance, then the ordinance should be void. Nothing in the ordinance was to be construed as authorizing any increase in the fare for transportation over any portion of the company's line. The 6th section of the ordinance stated that the privilege of constructing the electric system, as provided in the ordinance, was granted 'in consideration of the improved facilities \n\n[204 U.S. 116, 121]\n\u00a0\n hereby contemplated and the large expenditures necessary to secure the same, and shall be in force for the period of twenty-five years from and after the date of the passage of this ordinance, upon its main and Cedar avenue lines.' The right to change to electric power, as given by the foregoing ordinance, was confined, it will be observed, to that portion of the Euclid avenue line east of Willson avenue, and on Cedar avenue to that part lying between the Cleveland & Pittsburgh Railway Company's right of way and a point 1,500 feet east of Fairmount street. Nothing west of Willson avenue is included in that grant.\n On May 13, 1889, a resolution was adopted, which authorized and required the railroad company, 'as soon as practicable, to extend the use of such motive power over its main and Cedar avenue lines to the westerly termini thereof.' This included those lines west of Willson avenue, and under the ordinance and resolution the Euclid avenue line was changed to an electric street railroad within the times mentioned in the ordinance and resolution.\n There was no extension of time granted by the resolution of 1889 for the termination of the grant on any portion of the Euclid avenue line.\n On July 17, 1893, the right was given to the company to extend its road at the intersection of Prospect and Erie streets to the intersection of Prospect and Ontario streets, and also at the intersection of Superior and Seneca streets, thence along Seneca, Lake, and Ontario streets, and the council imposed upon it the duty, if required by the council, of operating its cars over the entire length of any of the lines. Other duties were imposed upon it. Complainant contends that some part of this ordinance refers to a portion of the Garden street extension, and that it requires the operation of all the Garden street cars over these tracks, and the grant is to terminate at the time mentioned in the 1888 ordinance,- July 13, 1913.\n The above list includes the material ordinances and resolutions pertaining particularly to Euclid avenue. \n\n[204 U.S. 116, 122]\n\u00a0\n After the Euclid avenue line had been built the council, on the 14th of January, 1868, passed a resolution granting its consent to the East Cleveland Street Railroad Company to lay down its tracks from the intersection of Prospect and Brownell street, 'to connect with the main line of its railroad,' running thence through Garden and other streets to and across Willson avenue, to the eastern boundary of the city, during the period of twenty years. Willson avenue was then the eastern boundary of the city. The road could continue to use and occupy the streets, avenues, and public grounds over which its main line was then constructed and operated westerly from the junction (at Brownell and Prospect streets) of said road with the main line to its westerly terminus, for the same length of time.\n This Garden street line was thereafter built, and it is asserted that it was the inception of a new and separate street railroad. It has been extended at various times since, and forms, with its various extensions, what is called the Garden street branch, and is the railroad in question.\n On the 30th of March, 1868, the railroad company was permitted by ordinance of the village of East Cleveland to construct a branch railroad on Garden street, which would form an extension, in fact, of the Garden street line easterly through the village to the line of Wade street. The grant was for twenty years from the time of the completion of the work, which was to be completed within five years from the date of the passage of the resolution granting the right,-March 30, 1868.\n On the 25th of March, 1873, the council passed a resolution, in the preamble of which it was stated that the East Cleveland Railroad Company desired and proposed to connect their Garden street branch with the main line of their road at the intersection of Erie and Prospect streets, and thereupon the council granted to the railroad company the 'right to lay down a double track street railroad in Ohio street from their present track in Brownell street to Erie street, and in Erie street, \n\n[204 U.S. 116, 123]\n\u00a0\n from Ohio street to Prospect street, to connect with their main track at this point.' This made a junction at Erie and Prospect streets, with the Euclid Avenue Railroad, instead of at Brownell and Prospect streets,-a small difference as to length of road.\n On the 23d of May, 1876, the council authorized the East Cleveland Railroad Company to extend the Garden street branch of its road at the easterly end thereof along Garden street to Baden avenue thence to Quincy, along Quincy to New, and along New street to Garden street, there to connect with the Garden street tracks. The ordinance provided that the right therein granted should continue for twenty years from that date.\n This extension placed a track in Quincy street from Baden to New street, which was a very short distance. It did make a different date for the termination of the grant than was provided for the rest of the branch, and it was to be operated 'in connection with said branch and its main line.' No increase of fare was to be charged by the company on any part of its branch or of its main line or extension by reason of the extension.\n In the year 1880, on the 22d of March, the council passed an ordinance authorizing the East Cleveland Railroad Company to extend the Garden street branch of its railway from the then-existing track at the intersection of Baden avenue and Quincy street, on and along said Quincy street, in an easterly direction to the intersection of Quincy street and Lincoln avenue, and to equip and operate the said extension and its Garden street branch for the period of twenty-five years from and after the passage of the ordinance.' When this ordinance was passed the eastern limits of the city of Cleveland had been extended, so that the territory covered by the grants to the Garden street line was at that time included in the city of Cleveland.\n In 1885, February 9, the council passed an ordinance permitting the East Cleveland Railroad Company 'to extend its \n\n[204 U.S. 116, 124]\n\u00a0\n Garden street branch from the intersection of Quincy street and Lincoln avenue, in an easterly direction, to Woodland Hills avenue, . . . and equip and operate said extension as a single track railroad, with all necessary switches, turnouts, and turntables' in connection with said branch and its main line, and terminating with the grant for the main line, but with the express condition that 'no increase of fare shall be charged by said company on any part of its main line, or on said extension, by reason of said extension.'\n On the 17th of June, 1887, the council granted another extension to the Garden street branch on Garden street from Baden avenue easterly to Lincoln avenue, the grant to terminate 'with the grant for the Garden street main line,' and no extra fare.\n On the 10th of March, 1890, the council passed an ordinance which 'granted the right to operate its Garden street branch by electricity' from and to the points named in the ordinance, and this grant was 'to operate by electric power the said Garden street branch during the term of its present grant for said Garden street branch.' Both roads were thereafter operated as electric street railroads.\n On the 30th day of March, 1891, another ordinance was passed, authorizing the railroad company 'to operate a second or additional track in and upon Central avenue (Garden street) from the east line of Willson avenue to the Cleveland & Pittsburg Railroad tracks.' It was provided that the 'right herein granted shall be valid until the expiration of the grants for the said company's main line.'\n On the 20th of April, 1891, an ordinance was passed which authorized the railroad company to 'operate a second or additional track in and upon Quincy street from New street to Woodland Hills avenue.' This was part of the Garden street line. Section 3 of the ordinance contained the provision that the 'right herein granted shall be valid until the expiration of the grants for said company's tracks on said Quincy street east of Lincoln evenue; to wit, July 13, 1913.' \n\n[204 U.S. 116, 125]\n\u00a0\n These are the material ordinances which particularly relate to the Garden street railroad.\n During March and April, 1893, the complainant herein was organized as a consolidation of several street railroads, which, it is enough to say, included, among others, the Euclid avenue and the Garden street lines, and on the 22d day of May, 1893, the consolidated railroad company (this complainant), through its vice president, addressed a communication to the council, stating that the various consolidations had been made under advice of counsel, but inas much as some question seemed to have arisen as to the intention of the company, it was stated that the company did not claim any rights greater than the constituent companies forming the organization; that it intended to obey all ordinances to which each and all the constituent companies were subject, and that it had, since the consolidation had been effected, issued transfer checks to all persons desiring them, to enable such persons to have a continuous ride from any East Side line to any South Side or West Side line, and from any South or West Side line of the company to any East Side line, for one fare, and would continue such system of transfers where it could not better accommodate its patrons by such through lines as it might establish; and that it disclaimed all intention of charging more than one fare for any such continuous ride; 'and that its aim has been and will be to give its patrons vastly improved service and accommodations by reason of such consolidation.'\n The council thereupon, by resolution, consented to the consolidation of the various railroad companies named in the resolution under the name of the Cleveland Electric Railway Company, upon the condition that 'only one fare shall be charged for a continuous ride on or over any line of railway formerly owned by any other of said constituent companies within the limits of the city of Cleveland; and passengers on any of such lines paying one fare shall be entitled, without extra or additional charge, to be transferred to any other of said lines and have a continuous ride thereon for said single fare.' The con- \n\n[204 U.S. 116, 126]\n\u00a0\n ditions contained in the resolution were thereafter accepted by the complainant in writing.\n On the 19th day of February, 1894, the council adopted 'an ordinance granting permission to the Cleveland Electric Railway and the Cleveland City Railway Company to extend their tracks in Willson avenue.' This avenue runs north and south and crosses many of the avenues in which some of the constituent companies of the consolidated road had laid their tracks.\n The ordinance granted each railroad company the right to extend its double track railroad along Willson avenue from and to the various points named in the ordinance, and the road was to be constructed and operated in connection with the existing tracks in Willson avenue as a double track street railroad. The two companies named in the ordinance were to jointly construct and maintain the road, and each was to have the right to occupy and use the track, wires, etc., of the other company then in Willson avenue, on such terms and conditions as the council might deem just and reasonable, unless the companies should otherwise agree. Provision was then made for the running of through cars on Willson avenue between certain points, and night cars were to be operated by the companies throughout the entire length of Willson avenue. A passenger on any car operated on any part of said Willson avenue was to have the right, on the payment of one fare, without additional or extra charge, to be transferred to any other line of either of said companies intersecting or coming to said Willson avenue, and was to have a continuous ride thereon, with the right, without additional charge, to be transferred from said second line to a car on any other line of either of these companies intersecting or coming to Willson avenue, and was to be entitled, without additional or extra charge, to be transferred to the Willson avenue line and to have a continuous ride thereon. Regulations were made for the paving of certain portions of the street by the company under the direction of the city authorities, and provision was made for widening the roadway on Willson avenue \n\n[204 U.S. 116, 127]\n\u00a0\n between certain points named, and for setting back curbs, hydrants, etc., all of which was to be done at the expense of the companies, which were also to comply with and perform all the general ordinances of the city relating to street railroads, then or thereafter in force. By  10 it was provided that the grant should be in force until the 1st day of July, 1914.\n On the 25th of June, 1894, the council passed 'An Ordinance Granting the Cleveland Electric Railway the Right to Extend and Operate Its Double Track Street Railroad in Quincy Street from New Street to Willson Avenue.' This ordinance provided for the extension and operation by the Cleveland Electric Railway Company of a double track street railroad on and along Quincy street, from its then present tracks thereon, westerly to Willson avenue, connecting by curves with its Willson avenue tracks. The 6th section provided that 'this grant shall terminate with the grant for said company's present line in Quincy street.'\n These ordinances and resolutions are those which particularly relate to the extent of the grants to the railroad company for the Euclid avenue and for the Garden street lines. Other ordinances and resolutions were passed, showing, in connection with those already in evidence, as insisted upon by the complainant, the existence of a general system for the operation of the roads owned by the complainant, including the Euclid avenue and Garden street lines, as a unit, and the necessity existing for operating all of the lines in connection with each other for the life of the longest grant. And it is insisted that this was the obvious intention of the council, to be gathered from the various ordinances, among them those especially above adverted to.\n Messrs. William B. Sanders, John W. Warrington, and Andrew Squire for Cleveland Electric Railway Company.\n\n\n[204 U.S. 116, 129]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. D. C. Westenhaver and Garfield, Howe, & Westenhaver for Forest City Railway Company.\n Mr. Newton D. Baker for the city of Cleveland.\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n Out of these various ordinances and resolutions arise the difficulties suggested in this case. The facts are somewhat complicated by reason of their number, and the inferences to be drawn from them are not always perfectly plain and certain. The complainant contends that, by reason of the action of the city council and the acceptance by the complainant of the various ordinances and resolutions adopted by that council, a valid contract has been entered into between the city and the complainant, by which the right to use the streets named in the ordinances by the Garden street branch has been granted to complainant up to July 1, 1914; or, if it is mistaken as to that time, that then the contract terminates on the 13th of July, 1913. The city contends that neither date is right, but that the contract, so far as it related to the Garden street branch, terminated on the 22d of March, 1905.\n The rules of construction which have been adopted by courts in cases of public grants of this nature by the authorities of cities are of long standing. It has been held that such grants should be in plain language, that they should be certain and \n\n[204 U.S. 116, 130]\n\u00a0\n definite in their nature, and should contain no ambiguity in their terms. The legislative mind must be distinctly impressed with the unequivocal form of expression contained in the grant, 'in order that the privileges may be intelligently granted or purposely withheld. It is matter of common knowledge that grants of this character are usually prepared by those interested in them, and submitted to the legislatures with a view to obtain from such bodies the most liberal grant of privileges which they are willing to give. This is one among many reasons why they are to be strictly construed.' Blair v. Chicago, \n201 \nU.S. 400, 471\n, 50 S. L. ed. 801, 830, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 427. In the case cited this court has had occasion to state the principle of construction and to cite some of the authorities upon which it is based. This has been so lately done that it is unnecessary to more than refer to that case as authority for the doctrine above stated.\n Before proceeding with an examination of the various ordinances and resolutions referred to in the foregoing statement, it is well to say that we do so upon the assumption that the legislature has heretofore granted to the city council of Cleveland most comprehensive power to contract with street railroads within its limits, with regard to the use of its streets, and the length of time for which such use may be granted, not longer than twenty-five years. Cleveland v. Cleveland City R. Co. \n194 \nU.S. 517, 533\n, 48 S. L. ed. 1102, 1107, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 756; Cleveland v. Cleveland Electric R. Co. \n201 \nU.S. 529, 541\n, 50 S. L. ed. 854, 859, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 513. Therefore, in deciding this case, we assume the validity of the contract, whatever it is, that was made. The only question involved herein is one of construction and intent.\n The most important of the many ordinances and resolutions relating to the Euclid avenue line, commencing in 1859, have been referred to in the foregoing statement of facts because of the contention of complainant that the Garden street branch is nothing but an extension and, in reality, as in law, a component part of the Euclid avenue line, and that the Garden street grant is limited and governed by the time of the expiration of the Euclid avenue grant. In other words, that the grant \n\n[204 U.S. 116, 131]\n\u00a0\n of 1888 to the Euclid avenue line of the right to change its motive power, and extending the termination of the grant until twenty-five years from that date, thereby extended the termination of the grant to the Garden street branch to the same time, although the whole branch road had been separately and otherwise provided for, and had never before had The same termination as the Euclid avenue line. The grant is to be implied which is line. The grant is to be implied which is to work such a change in a grant then existing in specific and direct language. The same argument is also set forth in regard to the ordinance of July 17, 1893, which will be again referred to.\n Under these circumstances it is important to direct special attention to the Garden street branch.\n The East Cleveland Railroad Company, having built and operated its road through the various streets mentioned in the ordinance or 1859, granting it leave so to do, became desirous of building another road in connection with the one it was then operating, but there was no statute at that time in Ohio permitting the extension of a road then built, and the company, therefore, in 1867 and the early part of 1868, took the same proceedings to acquire the right to build the new road that it had taken to build the former, although it did not seek a new incorporation. As a railroad company already existing, it applied to the council of the city of Cleveland for leave to construct a street railroad from the intersection of Prospect and Brownell streets, to connect with the main line of its road, and thence through various streets and along the center of Garden street, to and across Willson avenue, to the easterly boundary of the city. It procured the consents of the property owners along the line; notice for the reception of bids was published by the city as provided for in the statute, and the railroad company made a formal bid for the privilege of laying down its tracks through the various streets, and named the rates of fare which would be charged. That bid was the lowest, if not the only one, made, and it was duly accepted, and the privilege was granted to build a railroad in Garden street, and to operate \n\n[204 U.S. 116, 132]\n\u00a0\n it for twenty years from the date of the adoption of the ordinance, January 14, 1868, and the company was to continue to use the western end of the Euclid avenue road as stated in the ordinance. The ordinance was accepted and the road built. At this time the grant to the Euclid avenue line expired September 20, 1879.\n Referring to the procedure under which the Garden street branch was created and the permission of the city council to build the road obtained, it is plain that the branch thus built was not a mere extension or part of the Euclid avenue line, so that a grant to the latter necessarily covered the other as an inseparable part of it, but was a distinct line, with a separate route, with the exception of a short distance at the west end, where it was permitted to use the tracks of the Euclid avenue line. The termination of the right was at a different time from that provided for the Euclid avenue line. This use of the Euclid avenue tracks for a short distance did not make the Garden street branch a mere extension of the former road. Whether authorized by its charter to build the Garden street road is not important. It did so, and its right to do it was given by an ordinance of the council which has been recognized as valid ever since. Because on some occasions it has been called a branch does not alter the weight to be given the facts stated, or turn the branch into a mere extension where it has been otherwise uniformly treated.\n It is contended that by the resolution of March 25, 1873, which granted to the East Cleveland Railway Company the right to lay a double track street railroad, intersecting with its main line at Erie street and Prospect street, and thence through other streets mentioned in the resolution, the Garden street line thereby became an extension of the main line, or was recognized as a mere extension. The preamble to that resolution recites that the railroad company desires to connect the Garden street branch with the main line of their road at the intersection of Erie and Prospect streets, and to remove the other track from Brownell street, between Ohio and Prospect streets, \n\n[204 U.S. 116, 133]\n\u00a0\n and therefore permission is granted to the company so to do. That resolution provided simply for changing the connection of the Garden street branch with the Euclid avenue line from Brownell street to Erie street, and for the taking up of the track on Brownell street, between Ohio and Prospect streets. It did not make the Garden street branch any more of an extension of the main line than it had been before. The branch road certainly did not become a part of the main road simply because it ran in connection with it, or because it ran over a small portion of the tracks of that road. It remained what is started out as, a road with a separate route and a different term of life.\n The grant made in 1876 to the company to extend its Garden street tracks from its then terminus at Baden street, to and along other streets towards the east, with the right to equip and operate said extension for twenty years, in connection with the said Garden street branch and its main line, had no effect upon the question we are discussing. That extension of the tracks of the Garden street branch spoken of in the ordinance was also a short one, and was to terminate at a different time from that then existing in regard to the other portion of the Garden street branch. That it was to be operated in connection with its Garden street branch and the main line did not make the branch as extended a part of the main line, or alter the fact that the branch was a separate road, although operated in connection with the main line. It is quite diffidult to see why the right to operate this particular extension should have been granted for twenty years or until 1896, instead of being limited to terminate with the branch, but, at any rate, the grant is in unambiguous terms, and states in so many words the length of time it is to last. Its importance is not very great, and is entirely effaced by the subsequent ordinance of 1880, which provided for the termination of the whole Garden street branch at the time specified,-1905.\n By that ordinance (March 22, 1880) the question of the termination of the grant for the whole Garden street branch was distinctly settled. By it the right to extend that branch of its \n\n[204 U.S. 116, 134]\n\u00a0\n railroad in an easterly direction, on and along Quincy street, was given to the company, and the right 'to equip and operate the said extension and its Garden street branch' was given for the period of twenty-five years from the passage of the ordinance, but without increase of fare on any portion. This, of course, placed the termination of the whole grant to the Garden street branch on March 22, 1905. There is no ambiguity as to this grant, and the termination of the grants to the two roads was kept apart, one being September 20, 1904, the other March 22, 1905.\n Much stress is laid by the complainant on the ordinance of the 9th of February, 1885, which was entitled 'An Ordinance to Permit the East Cleveland Railroad Company to Extend the Garden Street Branch of Its Railway.' The company was thereby authorized to extend the Garden street branch from the intersection of Quincy street and Lincoln avenue in an easterly direction, to Woodland Hills avenue. It was to be operated in connection 'with said branch and its main line and terminating with the grant for the main line,' but with no increase of fare. It is contended that the particular grant mentioned in this ordinance was to terminate with the grant for the main line, which would make it terminate September 20, 1904, instead of March 22, 1905. If this were the only question, of course, the complainant would not insist that the grant to it should be shortened six months. But it is cited for the purpose of showing an intention of the council to limit the termination of the Garden street branch by the limitation then existing in regard to the Euclid avenue line. It is contended that from the time of the passage of this ordinance by the council and its acceptance by the complainant the parties thereby agreed that the extension should be operated with the main line, and that its grant for such operation should expire with the grant for the main or Euclid avenue line, and that this was in pursuance of the plan by the city to have the grants to the two roads expire at the same time. And the claim is that the subsequent ordinances must be construed in the same manner \n\n[204 U.S. 116, 135]\n\u00a0\n and for the purpose of carrying out the same scheme. There is here undoubtedly some room for the contention of complainant, but we think, upon looking at all the facts in connection with this question, that the intention of the council was not that way. The Garden street branch, running from the intersection of Erie and Prospects streets, towards the east, terminated, at the time of this grant, at Lincoln avenue. This made a long line of road. By the ordinance it was lengthened from Lincoln avenue to Woodland Hills avenue,-a comparatively short extension of track. The right granted to the whole branch line as far east as Lincoln avenue then terminated on the 22d of March, 1905, and yet, by this construction of the ordinance of 1885, this small extension of track from Lincoln avenue to Woodland Hills avenue was to expire September 20, 1904. Why this difference? The ordinance did not assume in any way to alter the time of the termination of the then-existing grant to the rest of the Garden street branch, but it simply limited the time of the termination of the grant for the extension then given. Hence it is difficult to see how any agreement can be found to arise from the ordinance for the simultaneous termination of all the grants to both the main line and the Garden street branch. Nor can any general scheme to have the grants of both roads terminate together be evolved from anything done by the parties up to and including 1885.\n There is nothing in Cleveland v. Cleveland Electric R. Co. \n201 \nU.S. 529, 539\n, 50 S. L. ed. 854, 858, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 513, that covers this case. The language of the ordinance adverted to in that case is to be applied to very different facts from those existing here. We assume the ability of the council to make such a contract as complainant contends for herein, but we think none such was made in fact.\n So far as can be determined from this record, there was absolutely no reason for terminating the right to use this small extension of track in September, 1904, while the rest of the branch then existing was not to terminate until six months later. It cut up the branch line in a way which it is impossible from this record to give any reason for, and accordingly, under \n\n[204 U.S. 116, 136]\n\u00a0\n the then-existing circumstances, it might be argued that the words, 'terminate with the grant for the main line,' did not mean the Euclid avenue line, but it referred to the Garden street branch, which was, as a matter of fact, the main line so far as concerned the small extension of the track from Lincoln avenue to Woodland Hills avenue. To terminate the grant for the extension at the same time with the grant for the line thereby extended would be the most obvious and natural course to pursue. It is true the ordinance itself recognizes the 'branch and its main line' as constituting two different lines, and provides that the grant is to terminate with the grant for the main line. And yet the real meaning of the ordinance, when regarded in the light of the facts then existing, becomes, to say the least, ambiguous. The general provision for the termination of the grant for the whole Garden street branch, as made in 1880, ought not to be expunged by an implication arising out of such doubtful language as is found in this 1885 ordinance. But if otherwise, it results only that the particular extension expired in September, 1904, with the grant to the Euclid avenue line, which, at that period, expired on that date.\n In 1887, June 17, an extension of the Garden street branch was granted, which, by the terms of the ordinance, was to terminate 'with the grant for the Garden street main line,' without increase of fare being charged. Here the council, it will be observed, expressly referred to the Garden street branch as the main line, and it is undoubtedly plain that it was properly so referred to. In extending the branch, and with reference to the extension, the branch would naturally be regarded and spoken of as the main line. If not done in all cases it is somewhat difficult to find any reason for it.\n Again, by an ordinance passed March 10, 1890, granting leave to change the motive power on the Garden street branch, the right was given to operate that branch by electric power 'during the term of its present grant of said Garden street branch.' The 'present grant' for the Garden street branch \n\n[204 U.S. 116, 137]\n\u00a0\n was that which was granted in March, 1880, which was to terminate in twenty-five years, or March 22, 1905. Here was a clear recognition of the time when that grant expired, and there had been no ordinance or resolution of the council, since 1880, which, in our opinion, changed the termination of that grant. It is an entire mistake to say that at this time the right to operate the Garden street tracks terminated at the same time with the right of the company to operate the Euclid avenue line, or that the Garden street branch was but an extension of that line.\n On the 30th of March, 1891, the right was granted to construct and operate a second or additional track upon Central avenue (Garden street) from the east line of Willson avenue to the Cleveland & Pittsburg Railroad tracks. It was provided in that ordinance that the right therein granted should be for and until the expiration of the grants for the said company's main line. Here again the question arises, What was the meaning of the expression 'main line' as used in this connection? The ordinance allowed a second or additional track in a street in which the company then had the right to use, and was using, a single track. So far as that extended grant was concerned, the main line was the rest of the Garden street branch, and the same observations that we have made heretofore in regard to the main line are operative here.\n It cannot be possible that it was intended to limit the right to use the second or additional track, in the portion of the street mentioned, to a different time than that which existed with relation to the first track laid down by the company in the same street. Of course, the two grants were meant to terminate at the same time.\n At this time the grant to the company's Euclid avenue line had been extended so that it did not expire until July 13, 1913. Can it be supposed that the council intended that this short length of road, in which a second or additional track was to be laid, was to be operated with two tracks until 1905 and after that with one track until 1913? We think such a construction \n\n[204 U.S. 116, 138]\n\u00a0\n is not permissible, and that what is meant by the language, 'main line,' in that ordinance, means the line which is the main line with reference to the extension therein granted; namely, the Garden street branch, and not the Euclid avenue line.\n The ordinance of the 20th of April, 1891, is somewhat important. It granted the East Cleveland Railroad Company permission to lay an additional or second track in Quincy street, from New street to Woodland Hills avenue. That street at the point indicated is part of the Garden street branch, and, as compared with the rest of the Garden street branch, is a very small portion thereof, and the ordinance only grants the right to lay an additional track. The right granted was, by the terms of  3, to 'be valid until the expiration of the grants for said company's tracks on said Quincy street, east of Lincoln avenue, to wit, July 13, 1913.'\n It is said that the council, in such ordinance, expressly authorizes the continuation of the operation of this Central avenue (Garden street) extension until July 13, 1913, the date of the expiration of the Euclid avenue line of the company. But the language used in this ordinance as to the time of the expiration of the grant for the company's tracks on Quincy street, east of Lincoln avenue, is a clear mistake of fact. The grant, it will be observed, is not in terms an extension to July 13, 1913. The reference to that date is but the expression of an opinion that the date named is the true time of the termination of the Quincy street grants. It is not a grant extending to that date, unless the previous grants are limited to that time. Now, on April 20, 1891, the grants on Quincy street, east of Lincoln avenue, in fact terminated either in 1904 or 1905, depending upon the construction of the language of the original grant in Quincy street, made in February, 1885. That was a grant which was to expire with the termination of the grant for the main line. For the reasons already given we think that that language meant the Garden street branch, which was the main line as to that extension, and that it, therefore, ex- \n\n[204 U.S. 116, 139]\n\u00a0\n pired in 1905, March 22. There was no subsequent legislation which extended that grant beyond that time.\n But if it be assumed that the grant for the company's tracks on Quincy street, east of Lincoln avenue, was to terminate with the grant for the Euclid avenue line as the main line, it must be recollected that that grant on Quincy street was made February 9, 1885, to the Garden street branch, and at that time the grant to the Euclid avenue line terminated in September, 1904. The grant of 1885 was not made to terminate with the grant for the main line, as that main line might thereafter be extended, but it referred to that grant as it then existed, and it was to be measured by such existing grant, and not by any subsequent extension which might be granted to the Euclid avenue line.\n Nor do we think the time for the termination of the Garden street branch was in any degree affected by the consolidation of the various roads in 1893. The communication from the railway company, through its vice president, May 22, 1893, states distinctly that it 'does not claim any rights greater than the constituent companies forming the organization, and that it intends to obey all ordinances to which each and all of the constituent companies were subject.' Its intention to issue transfer checks, so as to have a continuous ride for one fare, gave no greater rights to the company than it theretofore had, nor did the resolution of the council, consenting to the consolidation on condition that but one fare should be charged for a continuous ride, give any greater rights to the consolidated company than each of the constituent companies had theretofore enjoyed. The consolidation does not require, in order to comply with the conditions specified in the resolution consenting to the consolidation, that the consolidated companies should be permitted to operate until the expiration of the longest grant to any of the companies. At the expiration of the grant to the Garden street branch the operation of that road might terminate, while the operation of the rest of the consolidated roads could go on perfectly well. To hold that, by virtue \n\n[204 U.S. 116, 140]\n\u00a0\n of the consolidation, upon the conditions stated, there was an implied extension of the grant to the Garden street branch of at least eight years, is to violate the rules of construction above referred to in regard to grants of this nature.\n It is also strongly urged by the complainant that the ordinance passed soon after the consolidation ordinance, viz., the ordinance of July 17, 1893, not only imposed additional burdens on the consolidated company, but that the ordinance relates to a portion of the line originally constructed as part of the Garden street branch, and that it also required the operation of all the Garden street cars over these tracks, so that the council legislated as to the operation of the tracks upon Garden street and provided that such operation should continue until July 13, 1913. It is true the ordinance provided that the grant therein made should be limited to the above date, and there were certain conditions attached to the making of the grant, but it is quite plain to us that the ordinance could not be read as thereby extending the time for the termination of the Garden street branch without a most violent implication, based upon a very small foundation. This is made clear when it is seen that the streets through which the ordinance provides for extending the double track railroad formed no part of the line originally constructed as part of the Garden street branch. The latter road was permitted to use, for a short distance, the tracks of the Euclid avenue line from a point at the junction of Brownell street (subsequently made Erie street) with Prospect street, west to the public square. But that portion of the track of the Euclid avenue line was never part of the line originally constructed for the Garden street branch, nor did it become such because subsequently the branch road was permitted to use it for the passage of its cars to the public square. It is quite clear, therefore, that the limitation of the time for the termination of the grant provided for in the 6th section of the ordinance was not also an extension of the time for the termination of the separate grant to the Garden street branch from 1905 to 1913.\n The same may be said of the ordinance of February 19, 1894, \n\n[204 U.S. 116, 141]\n\u00a0\n extending the tracks in Willson avenue. While the council consented to the extension by the complainant and the Cleveland City Railroad Company of the line of railway in Willson avenue, and also to the operation of that line in connection with other lines of the consolidated company, which included the Garden street branch, yet it cannot be held that there arose from that ordinance, when accepted by the company, a contract which should extend the time on all of the roads until the expiration of the grant contained in that ordinance, July 1, 1914. By such means an implied extension of time, affecting over 200 miles of track, as is stated, would be accomplished by making these conditions in regard to the Willson avenue grant a substitute for a grant, in plain language, affecting the Garden street branch. On the contrary, we think that the effect of that ordinance was simply to make it necessary for the Garden street branch and the other roads also, to comply with the conditions set forth in the ordinance until the expiration of their respective and existing grants, but that ordinance did not thereby extend the various other railroad grants by implication. There is no such connection between the various roads as to make it necessary, in order to operate one, that all the others should be in operation as a unit, and as comprehending one indivisible system. There is nothing in this record which shows any difficulty whatever in operating the Garden street branch as separate from the rest of the so-called system, or in operating that system separate from the branch. If the council had intended to extend the time of the termination of the various grants to these railroads it surely would have said so, and not left it to such vague and uncertain presumptions.\n The chief importance of the various ordinances and resolutions for the extension of the Garden street branch, coupled with the user of the tracks of the Euclid avenue line by the branch road from Erie street west to the public square, and providing for but one fare over the whole road, is to strengthen, if possible, the contention of complainant that such branch has always been treated by the city and the company as a mere \n\n[204 U.S. 116, 142]\n\u00a0\n extension of the Euclid avenue line, and to be operated in connection with it, so that a grant extending the time of the termination of the latter line included thereby the Garden street branch. We think the contention is not justified by the facts. The whole history of the branch line shows differently. Even in the important matter of a change of motive power, the Euclid avenue line was provided for in 1888 and 1889, while there was a separate and distinct provision made for the Garden street branch in 1890, and a statement therein made that the permission was granted to the Garden street branch during the term of the present grant to said branch.\n A careful examination of the whole record leads us to the opinion that there is no error therein so far as the complainant's appeal is concerned, and the decree upon its appeal is affirmed.\n Upon the appeal of the defendants, we think little need be said. The defendants insist that, upon the termination of the grant to the Garden street branch, the rails, poles, and other appliances for operating that road, and then remaining on the various streets, became the property of the city; or, at least, that the city had the right to take possession of the streets and of the rails, tracks, etc., therein existing. We agree with the court below in the opinion that the title to the property remains in the railroad company which had been operating the road, and we are of opinion that the Forest City Railway Company had no rights in the streets, so far as to affect the right of the complainant to its property then existing in such streets. How that property may be disposed of is not now a matter before this court. We only hold that the defendant company cannot avail itself of the provisions of the ordinance of January 11, 1904, so far as taking possession of the property of the complainant is concerned.\n The decree upon the defendants' appeal is also affirmed. \n\n\n\n","39":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOFFEY v.

The land sought to be recovered was once the property of Ezra S. Whitney, through whom both parties claim title,-the plaintiff, through a deed of the land executed and delivered by Whitney, on November 30, 1898; the defendant, under a sale of the land on execution in pursuance of a levy duly made on April 12, 1898. The defendant's paper title is therefore the earlier one and must prevail if the sale upon execution was valid. The validity of this sale is the only question in the case.\n The execution issued on a judgment in a criminal case, in which, by information, Whitney was charged with the \n\n[204 U.S. 659, 662]\n\u00a0\n embezzlement, while county treasurer of Harlan county, in the state of Nebraska, of $11,190 of the public money in his possession by virtue of his office. Upon trial by jury Whitney was found guilty as charged and sentenced to imprisonment for a term of years, and to 'pay a fine in one sum of $22,390,' which was double the amount of the embezzlement found by the jury. On appeal the conviction was amrmed by the supreme court of Nebraska. Whitney v. State, 53 Neb. 287, 73 N. W. 696. The sentence awarded was that prescribed by  124 of the Nebraska Criminal Code, which provides that a public officer who embezzles the public money 'shall be imprisoned in the penitentiary not less than one year nor more than twentyone years, according to the magnitude of the embezzlement, and also pay a fine equal to double the amount of money or other property so embezzled as aforesaid, which fine shall operate as a judgment at law on all of the estate of the party so convicted and sentenced, and shall be enforced to collection by execution or other process for the use only of the party or parties whose money or other funds, property, bonds, or securities, assets or effects of any kind as aforesaid has been so embezzled.' Neb. Comp. Stat. 1903, p. 1942\n\n\n The proceedings which ended in the sale on execution under which the defendant claims title were in conformity with the Constitution and laws of Nebraska, and the sheriff's deed vested title in the defendant. Everson v. State, 66 Neb. 154, 92 N. W. 137. It is within the power of the state to enact laws creating and defining crimes against its sovereignty, regulating the procedure in the trial of those who are charged with committing them, and prescribing the character of the sentence which shall be awarded against those who have been found guilty. In these respects the state is supreme and its power absolute, and without any limits other than those prescribed by the Constitution of the United States. The exercise of the power of the state in this field cannot be drawn in question in this court or elsewhere than in its own courts, except for \n\n[204 U.S. 659, 663]\n\u00a0\n the purpose of restraining it within the limits thus established. One of the limitations upon the power of the state, imposed by the 14th Amendment, is that the state shall not deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. The plaintiff contends that the sentence awarded against Whitney violated this prohibition, in that Whitney had no opportunity to be heard upon and defend against that part of the sentence which imposed a fine and authorized a judgment against his estate for its collection. The plaintiff therefore insists that the sale on execution of Whitney's land was bad, because the execution issued upon a judgment which was void. The short and conclusive answer to the whole contention is, that it is not true in fact. Whitney was given an opportunity to be heard and to defend. The information charged him with embezzling $11,190, the property of Harlan county. The trial was had upon this information and the jury returned a verdict in the following terms:\n'We, the jury, duly impaneled and sworn in the above-entitled cause, do find the defendant guilty, as charged in the information, and we further find the sum so embezzled to be $11,190.' Thereupon it became the duty of the court to imposes a sentence of imprisonment of not less than one year nor more than twenty-one years, and of a fine that should be equal to double the amount of the money embezzled. This was done. The case was then appealed to the supreme court of Nebraska, argued by counsel, and the conviction affirmed. It is idle to say that Whitney was denied a hearing, or an opportunity for every defense permitted to him by the laws of Nebraska.\n\n The plaintiff in error rests his contention upon some language used by the supreme court of Nebraska in Everson v. State, ubi supra. In that case Everson was convicted of a trespass upon the land in dispute. He defended against the charge by claiming title through the deed from Whitney, under which, as Everson's grantee, the plaintiff in this case claims title. The state, on the other hand, contended that the title \n\n[204 U.S. 659, 664]\n\u00a0\n was in Harlan county by virtue of the sale on execution hereinbefore stated. Everson, asserting, as the plaintiff here asserts, that the execution sale passed no title, attacked the judgment upon which it was issued upon two grounds:\n First, that the law under which it was rendered was repealed by a subsequent provision of the Constitution of the state;\n Second, that it was unconstitutional in inflicting a double punishment, in that the fine was added to imprisonment.\n In overruling these two contention the court described the statute as one giving a fixed sum 'in the nature of liquidated damages . . . to one who has suffered injury by the wrongful act of a public officer,' and said: 'We . . . do not care to put ourselves upon record as holding that the return of the property of the value of the property which the thief has embezzled or stolen, either voluntarily or by compulsory process, should be considered any part of his punishment within the meaning of our Bill of Rights.' P. 158, N. W. p. 138. Seizing hold of this language, the plaintiff in error in this case argues that, by an interpretation of the statute binding upon us, it authorizes a mere civil judgment for damages, against which the defendant has been denied the right to defend by showing that his civil liability for the embezzlement had been discharged, and that therefore the judgment was wanting in due process of law. But this argument misinterprets the decision of the supreme court of Nebraska by giving to its language a meaning not expressed or intended.\n As part of the consequences of a conviction of the crime of embezzlement by a public officer, the law of Nebraska provides that a fine double the amount embezzled shall be inflicted, which shall operate as a judgment against the estate of the convict. It is not of the slightest importance whether this fine is called a penalty, a punishment, or a civil judgment. Whatever it is called, it comes to the convict as the result of his crime. The amount of the judgment is fixed by the amount of the embezzlement, and not by the amount re- \n\n[204 U.S. 659, 665]\n\u00a0\n maining due on account of the embezzlement, and the only question left open to the accused is the fact and amount of the embezzlement. It is provided that the judgment shall issue for double that amount, entirely irrespective of the question whether restitution has been made in whole or in part. Upon the only question, therefore, open to him, Whitney had an opportunity to be heard, and, in point of fact, was heard. Upon his appeal ( 53 Neb. 287, 73 N. W. 696) the amount of the embezzlement was expressly affirmed by the court (p. 303, N. W. p. 701), and the claim that the restitution of the stolen property relieves the offender from criminal liability was pronounced 'a monstrous doctrine,' trine,' and it was said: 'Whether or not Harlan county has been successful in collecting or securing the payment of the money which the defendant is charged with having embezzled is of no consequence in this case.' Whitney had full opportunity to present every defense allowed to him by the law of the state. The law itself was justified by the plenary power of the state, and neither it nor its administration in this case discloses any violation of a right secured by the Constitution of the United States, and the judgment of the Circuit Court is therefore affirmed. \n\n\n\n","40":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOM.

STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA(1907)\n\nArgued: Decided: May 27, 1907\n\n\n\n\n[206 U.S. 290, 291]\n\u00a0\n This is a bll filed, on leave, February 26, 1906, by the commonwealth of Virginia against the state of West Virginia.\n The bill averred that--\n On the 1st day of January, 1861, complainant was indebted in about the sum of $33,000,000 upon obligations and contracts made in connection with the construction of works of internal improvement throughout her then territory. By far the greater part of this indebtedness was shown by her bonds and other evidences of debt, given for the large sums of money which she from time to time had borrowed and used for the above purpose; but a portion of her liabilities, though arising under contracts made before that date, had not then been covered by bonds issued for their payment.\n'In addition to the above liability to the general public, there was a large indebtedness evidenced by her bonds and other liabilities held by and due to the commissioners of the sinking fund and the literary fund of the state, as created under her laws, amounting, the former, to $1,462,993. 00, and the latter, to $1,543,669.05, as of the same date.\n\n'The official reports and records showing the exact character and amounts of the public debt thus contracted and how the same was created are referred to, and will be produced upon a hearing of the case\n\n'(2) That portion of the territory embraced in what constitutes the present territorial limits of Virginia was, prior to that date, devoted mainly to agriculture, and to some extent to grazing and manufacturing, which afforded its chief sources of revenue, while that portion included in what now constitutes the state of West Virginia had vast potentialities of wealth and revenue in the undeveloped stores of minerals and timber, which had been known for many years prior to the date named, and their prospective values, if made accessible to the markets of the country, were understood to be well \n\n[206 U.S. 290, 292]\n\u00a0\n nigh beyond computation. It was to hasten and facilitate the development of these sources of wealth and revenue by the construction of graded roads, bridges, canals, and railways, extending through the state from tidewater towards the Ohio river, that the commonwealth of Virginia, in the first quarter of the nineteenth century, entered upon a system of public internal improvoments which it was contemplated should include the entire territory of the state, and embraced in its design the construction of public works adapted, not to the needs of any one portion of the state alone, but of the entire state, as a unit of interest. The larger part of these works were constructed east of the Appalachian range, as leading up to the undeveloped territory west thereof, but a very considerable portion of them were, at an expense of several millions of dollars, constructed west of said range, within the territory now included in the state of West Virginia; and the completion of some of the main lines of improvement beyond the said range and through to the Ohio river, since the 1st day of January, 1861, has increased to a very great and material extent the values of real estate, including coal and timber, in the said territory now included in West Virginia, thus carrying into effect the original scheme of improvement, which could not have been done had not the lines east of said range been first constructed; and your oratrix believes and avers that the property values within the limits of West Virginia have been enormously enhanced in a large measure by reason of these improvements. The money appropriated to the payment of the annually accruing interest on the said debt, prior to January 1, 1861, and to the formation of the sinking fund for the ultimate redemption thereof, was derived from taxes imposed upon the property subject to texation throughout the entire state. The first of this indebtedness to be contracted was a small amount borrowed by the state in the year 1820, and the debt was thereafter from time to time continued and increased by renewals and new loans until it reached the amount above stated in 1861. \n\n[206 U.S. 290, 293]\n\u00a0\n '() The commonwealth of Virginia was induced to enter upon the construction of this general system of internal improvement in a very large measure for the purpose of developing the aforesaid resources of the western portion of the state, now constituting the state of West Virginia, thereby ameliorating the condition of her citizens residing therein; and it was with this view that she took upon herself the burden of the public debt for which her bonds were issued, without which debt such improvements could not have been undertaken. In corroboration of this view it will appear from an inspection of the legislative records of the state, where the vote carrying the appropriations for such public improvements was recorded, that in nearly every instance a majority of those members of the house and senate of the original state, who then represented the counties now composing West Virginia, voted for such appropriations. Indeed, it appears from those records that a great majority of the acts of the legislature of Virginia under which said indebtedness was created would have failed of their passage had the representatives from the counties embraced in what is now West Virginia opposed their enactment, and that a very large proportion of said indebtedness was actually contracted over the votes of a majority of the representatives from the counties and cities embraced in the limits of the present state of Virginia. This will be found to be true, not only in the legislature for one single session, but in the legislatures for many successive years, thus showing it to have been a fixed policy of the people in that portion of the state now constituting West Virginia to participate in, support, and carry out this general plan of internal improvements in the state.\n\n'4. The development of this system of public improvements thus entered upon was, from its character and extent, necessarily progressive, and the same extended with the general growth and increasing needs of the state, and was incomplete, as above stated, in 1861, though a very considerable portion of such improvements had, prior to that time, been \n\n[206 U.S. 290, 294]\n\u00a0\n constructed as above stated, in the territory now constituting West Virginia, in order to meet the needs of the people of that portion of the state for their local purposes. As early as the year 1816 a board of public works was created by law for the state, the members of which were elected by the voters of the state at large, and this board had in charge the construction and supervision of all the works of public improvement in this state. The annual reports of this board will be referred to for information as to the character, extent, cost, and location of the public works and internal improvements constructed in the state prior to January lst, 1861. The amounts expended upon the construction of these works in what is now West Virginia can only be accurately ascertained by an examination of the numerous entries in the records of this board extending through a number of years and showing such expenditures as made from time to time.\n\n'5. On the 17th of April, 1861, the people of Virginia, in general convention assembled, adopted an ordinance by which it was intended to withdraw Virginia from the union of the states. From this action a considerable portion of the people of Virginia dissented, and organized a separate government which was known and recognized by the government of the United States as the 'restored state of Virginia,' and will be hereafter referred to in this bill as the 'restored state.'\n\n'6. On the 20th day of August, 1861, the restored state of Virginia, in convention assembled, in the city of Wheeling, Virginia, adopted an ordinance to 'provide for the formation of a new state out of the portion of the territory of this state,'  9 of which ordinance was as follows, to- wit:\n\n\"9. The new state shall take upon itself a just proportion of the public debt of the commonwealth of Virginia, prior to the 1st day of January, 1861, to be ascertained by charging to it allth e state expenditures within the limits thereof, and a just proportion of the ordinary expenses of the state government since any part of said debt was contracted, and deducting therefrom the moneys paid into the treasury of the \n\n[206 U.S. 290, 295]\n\u00a0\n commonwealth from the counties included within the said new state during said period. All private rights and interests in lands within the proposed state, derived from the laws of Virginia prior to such separation, shall remain valid and secure under the laws of the proposed state, and shall be determined by the laws now existing in the state of Virginia.'\n\n'7. On the 31st day of December, 1862, an act was passed by the 37th Congress of the United States [12 Stat. at L. 633, chap. 6], providing that the new state thus formed in pursuance of the ordinances of the Wheeling convention above referred to, should, upon certain conditions, be admitted into the Union by the name of West Virginia, with a constitution which had theretofore been adopted for the new state by the people thereof, such conditions being that a change should be made in such proposed constitution in regard to the liberation of slaves therein; and it was provided by this act of Congress that whenever the President of the United States should issue his proclamation stating the fact that such change had been made and ratified, thereupon the act admitting the new state into the Union should take effect sixty days after the date of such proclamation. Such proclamation declaring these conditions to have been complied with was duly made by President Lincoln on April 20th, 1863, and West Virginia, in conformity therewith and by the operation of said act of Congress, was admitted into the Union as a state on the 20th day of June, 1863; and thereupon the state of West Virginia became fully organized and each of its departments of government commenced operation on the date last named.\n\n'8. Pending the admission of the state of West Virginia to the Union the general assembly of the restored state of Virginia passed, February 3, 1863, the following act:\n\n\"That all property-real, personal, and mixed-owned by, or appertaining to, this state, and being within the boundaries of the proposed state of West Virginia, when the same becomes one of the United States, shall thereupon pass to, and become the property of the state of West Virginia, and without any \n\n[206 U.S. 290, 296]\n\u00a0\n other assignment, conveyance, or transfer or delivery than is herein contained, and shall include, among other things not herein specified, all lands, buildings, roads, and other internal improvements or parts thereof, situated within said boundaries, and vested in this state, or in the president and directors of the literary fund, or the board of public works thereof, or in any person or persons for the use of this state, to the extent of the interest and estate of this state therein; and shall also include the interest of this state, or of the said president and directors, or of the said board of public works, in any parent bank or branch doing business within said boundaries, and all stocks of any other company or corporation, the principal office or place of business whereof is located within said boundaries, standing in the name of this state, or of the said president or directors, or of the said board of public works, or of any person or persons, for the use of this state.'\n\n\"That if the appropriations and transfers of property, stocks, and credits provided for by this act take effect, the state of West Virginia shall duly account for the same in the settlement hereafter to be made with this state, provided that no such property, stocks, and credits shall have been obtained since the reorganization of the state government.\"\n\n Complainant charged 'that the property which was, by the operation of this act, appropriated and transferred from the state of Virginia to the state of West Virginia, and which was subsequently received and enjoyed by the state of West Virginia, consisted of a number of items, and the vlu e of it amounted, in the aggregate, to several millions of dollars, the exact amount your oratrix is unable at this time more definitely to ascertain and state. That of the bank stocks alone which were transferred under the operation of this act, the state of West Virginia realized and received into her treasury from the sale thereof about $600,000; and that no part of the property so received by West Virginia had been obtained by Virginia since April, 1861. \n\n[206 U.S. 290, 297]\n\u00a0\n\n'9. And by a further act of the general assembly of the restored state of Virginia, passed on the next day, February 4th, 1863, it was enacted:\n\n\"1. That the sum of $150,000 be, and is hereby, appropriated to the state of West Virginia out of moneys not otherwise appropriated, when the same shall have been formed, organized, and admitted as one of the states of the United States.\n\n\"2. That there shall be, and hereby is, appropriated to the said state of West Virginia when the same shall become one of the United States, all balances, not otherwise appropriated, that may remain in the treasury, and all moneys not otherwise appropriated, that may come into the treasury up to the time when the said state of West Virginia shall become one of the United States: provided, however, that when the said state of West Virginia shall become one of the United States, it shall be the duty of the auditor of this state to make a statement of all the moneys that, up to that time, have been paid into the treasury from counties located oustide of the boundaries of the said state of West Virginia, and also of all moneys that, up to the same time, have been expended in such counties, and the unexpended surplus of all such moneys shall remain in the treasury and continue to be the property of this state.'\n\n'And this last named sum of $150,000, together with other sums belonging to the state of Virginia, were turned over to and received or collected by the new state of West Virginia after its formation as aforesaid.\n\n'10. The Constitution of the State of West Virginia, which became operative and was in force when she was admitted into the Union, contained the following provisions:\n\n'By  5 of article 8 of said Constitution it was provided:\n\n\"5. No debt shall be contracted by this state except to meet casual deficits in the revenue, to redeem a previous \n\n[206 U.S. 290, 298]\n\u00a0\n liability of the state, to suppress insurrection, repel invasion, or defend the state in time of war.'\n\n'And by  7 of article 8 it was provided:\n\n\"7. The legislature may, at any time, direct a sale of the stocks owned by the state, in banks and other corporations, but the proceeds of such sale shall be applied to the liquidation of the public debt, and hereafter the state shall not become a stockholder in any bank.'\n\n'And by  8 of article 8 it was provided:\n\n\"8. An equitable proportion of the public debt of the commonwealth of Virginia prior to the 1st day of January, in the year 1861, shall be assumed by this state, and the legislature shall ascertain the same as soon as may be practicable and provide for the liquidation thereof by a sinking fund sufficient to pay the accruing interest and redeem the principal within thirty-four years.'\n\n'At the time the Constitution containing these provisions was adopted, West Virginia did not owe, and could not have owed, any 'public debt' or 'previous liability,' except for her just, contributive proportion of the public debt of the original state of Virginia, and for the money and property of the original state which had been transferred to and received by her under the acts of the general assembly of the restored state of Virginia, above set forth. By the provisions of  8 of article 8, above cited, she expressly assumed her equitable proportion of the debt of the original state as it existed prior to the 1st day of January, 1861. By  5 of the same article 8, above set forth, her Constitution forbade the creation of any debt 'except to meet casual deficits in the revenue, to redeem a previous liability of the state,' etc, and there was not and could not have been any such 'previous liability,' except her portion of the debt of the original state, and her liability for the money and property of the original state which had been transferred to and received by her under the acts of the general assembly of the restored state. And  7 of the same article of her Constitution, above cited, \n\n[206 U.S. 290, 299]\n\u00a0\n authorized a sale of the stocks owned by the state, in banks and other corporations, the proceeds to be applied to the liquidation of the public debt; and she had no such stocks except those acquired, as above stated, from the original state. This section of her Constitution also expressly required the proceeds of such sale to be applied to her public debt, which public debt could only have been her proportion of that of the original state of Virginia, and her liability for the money and property of the original state which had been transferred to her.\n\n'11. After the year 1865, and prior to the year 1872, attempts were made at different times by the public authorities of both the commonwealth of Virginia and the state of West Virginia, respectively, to ascertain their contributive proportions of the common liability resting upon them for the public debt of Virginia, contracted prior to January lst, 1861; but all such attempts proved ineffectual and vain, and no accounting or settlement of any kind was ever had between the two states in regard to this debt.\n\n'12. The efforts looking to a settlement by the concurrent action of the two states having proved abortive, and your oratrix being anxious to adjust the portion of the common debt which it was right that she should assume and pay, upon terms just and equitable alike to the public creditors and to West Virginia, made several efforts to effect such a settlement.\n\n'The first of these was made by the general assembly which was chosen at the close of the period of 'destruction and reconstruction,' which, following closely upon the period of disastrous war, had inflicted upon her people injuries and losses, the harmful effects of which were then by no means realized.\n\n'The purpose of the representatives of the commonwealth, then just emerging from conditions which had impoverished her people and paralyzed their productive energies, to assume and pay to the utmost every dollar which her most exacting creditor could demand of her, was expressed in the act of her general assembly, approved March 30, 1871. \n\n[206 U.S. 290, 300]\n\u00a0\n 'By the terms of settlement embodied in this act, your oratrix undertook to give her obligations bearing 6 per cent interest for two thirds of the principal, and for two thirds of the past-due interest, and also for two thirds of the interest on that accrued interest, which accrued interest, to the extent of nearly $8,000,000, had been funded after the war in new bonds of Virginia, thus capitalizing at 6 per cent not only the interest, but the interest upon that interest.\n\n'It was soon apparent that Virginia had by this measure assumed a heavier burden than she was able to bear, and so other plans for the settlement of the state debt were attempted by the acts of the general assembly of the commonwealth approved March 28, 1879, and February 14, 1882, until at length a final and satisfactory settlement of the portion of the debt of the original state which Virginia should assume and pay was definitely concluded by the act of February 20, 1892. Your oratrix will file copies of each of the acts of her general assembly herein mentioned as exhibits to this bill, and to be read as part thereof.\n\n'13. As farther indicating the great burden which your oratrix, notwithstanding the disaster and loss above referred to, had assumed and met on account of the common debt of the undivided state, she shows your honors that, since January lst, 1861, she has actually paid off, retired, and discharged, or assumed and given her new outstanding obligations for, the aggregate sum of over $71,000,000, as will more particularly appear from a statementth ereof filed as an exhibit herewith and hereinafter referred to as exhibit number 7.\n\n'It is proper in this connection to call attention to the fact that, while your oratrix has made this large contribution toward the settlement of the common debt, West Virginia has not paid one dollar thereof; and although, in the early years of her history, she repeatedly conceded that there was some portion of that debt which should equitably be borne by her, her properly constituted authorities have for a num- \n\n[206 U.S. 290, 301]\n\u00a0\n ber of years refused to recognize that any liability whatever rested upon her on that account, and have declined even to enter into an accounting or to treat with your oratrix in reference thereto.\n\n'It would seem from the above statement that Virginia has already done as much under all the circumstances as she could be fairly expected to do towards paying off the common public debt of the old state. Such was the view and purpose of the general assembly in the several acts above cited.\n\n'A question may be raised as to whether such was the effect of the language used in the act of March 30, 1871, with respect to the certificates issued thereunder; but the great mass of the creditors entitled to whatever may be due upon the unfunded obligations of the undivided state have in effect agreed, as will be hereinafter shown, to waive any such question, and to accept the adjudication of this court in this cause against West Virginia in full discharge of all their claims, thus giving that effect to the act of March 30, 1871, which it was the purpose of your oratrix that it should have.\n\n'14. By each of the acts for the settlement of her debt, above recited, it was provided that the bonds of undivided Virginia, so far as not founded in the new obligations given by your oratrix, should be surrended to and held by your oratrix, who, either by the express terms of the settlement provided for by said acts, or as a just and equitable consequence therefrom, received and holds said original bonds so far as unfunded, in trust for the creditor who deposited the same with her, or his assigns; and certificates to this effect were given by your oratrix to each creditor whose ole Virginia bond was so surrendered to her.\n\n'Having, as an essential part of the contract for the adjustment of the common debt of the original state, entered into this fiduciary relation in reference to these bonds, it became her obligation of duty to the creditors who had confided their securities to her keeping, as well as to her own people, whose credit and fair name required that these obliga- \n\n[206 U.S. 290, 302]\n\u00a0\n tions of the old state should be fairly and honorably adjusted, to do all in her power to bring about a determination of West Virginia's just liability in respect thereto, and, if possible, the recognition and settlement of the same by that state.\n\n'Only after exhausting every means of amicable negotiation, and having her overtures to that end repeatedly refused, and as a last resort, has your oratrix been constrained at length reluctantly to apply to this, the only tribunal which can afford relief, for an adjudication and determination of this question, of such vast importance to your oratrix and to all of her people.\n\n 15. All of the bonds and obligations and other evidences of the indebtedness of the original state of Virginia outstanding and contracted on January 1, 1861, as stated in paragraph 1, of this bill, except a comparatively insignificant sum, not amounting to 1 per cent of the aggregate of those liabilities, have been taken up and are now actually held by your oratrix, and she has the right to call upon West Virginia for a settlement with respect thereto. They are too unmerous and involve too great a number of transactions running through many years, for it to be practicable to exhibit them here in detail, but the original bonds and other evidences of indebtedness so paid off or retired and now held by your oratrix will, when it shall be proper to do so, be exhibited to the master, who shal t ake the accounts hereinafter prayed for.\n'16. Of the evidences of indefiniteness representing principal and interest of the liabilities of Virginia contracted before her dismemberment, those so paid off or retired by your oratrix and now held by her in her own right, exclusive of the amounts represented by the certificates issued under the funding acts aforesaid, amount, in the aggregate, including the interest to be fairly computed thereon to this date, to a very large sum, considerably in excess of $25,000,000, by far the greater part of it being now, of course, on account of the interest computed thereon, at the rate of 6 per cent per annum, the then legal rate in both states. \n\n[206 U.S. 290, 303]\n\u00a0\n 'For all of these obligations taken up and payments made on account of the common debt, your oratrix has, in her own right, a just claim against West Virginia for contribution to the extent of West Virginia's equitable liability therefor.\n\n'17. In addition to the above bonds there were outstanding on the 1st day of January, 1861, certain obligations of the state of Virginia as guarantor upon some of the securities issued by internal improvement companies, which your oratrix was called upon to provide for and settle. They were not comparatively of very large amount, however, and the questions involved in connection therewith can be stated and settled in the account hereinafter prayed for to be taken between the two states; and in such accounts your oratrix will also ask to have included all such items of debit against the state of West Virginia on account of the property and moneys of the original state which were received or appropriated by West Virginia which may not have been specifically or accurately stated herein. These items of accounting between the two states are so numerous and varied and extend throughout a period of so many years' duration that it is impossible, from the nature of the case, to state all of them in this bill; and the account between the two states can only be taken and settled, and the balance due your oratrix thereon ascertained, under the supervision of a court of equity.\n\n'18. Your oratrix charges that the liability of the state of West Virginia, for a just and equitable proportion of the public debt of Virginia, as of the time when the state of West Virginia was created, rests upon the following, among many grounds which might be indicated here:\n\n'First. The area of the territory now known as the state of West Virginia formed about one third of the territory of the commonwealth of Virginia when this public debt was created, and its population included about one third of that of the original state at the time of its dismemberment. And the state of West Virginia did, by the acquisition and appropriation of such territory, with the population thereof, assume \n\n[206 U.S. 290, 304]\n\u00a0\n therewith liability for a just and equitable proportion of the public debt created prior to the partition of such territory.\n\n'Second. The liability of West Virginia for a just proportion of the public debt of the commonwealth of Virginia, as it existed prior to the creation and erection of the state of West Virginia, forms part of her very political existence, and is an essential constituent of her fundamental law as shown in the said ordinance adopted at Wheeling on the 20th day of August, 1861, in which the method of ascertaining her liability on account of said debt is prescribed. And this liability is imbedded in the Constitution under which she was admitted as a state into the Federal Union, and was one of the conditions under which she was created a state and admitted into the Union.\n\n'Third. The state of West Virginia has further, by the repeated enactments and joint resolution of her legislature, recognized her liability for a just proportion of this debt.\n\n'Fourth. The state of West Virginia has, since her creation as a state, received from the state of Virginia real and personal property, amounting in value to many millions of dollars, and held and enjoyed the sam, but upon expressed condition that she should duly account for the same in a settlement thereafter to be had between her and the commonwealth of Virginia.\n\n'Fifth. While the transfer of this property, real and personal, and also of certain moneys of the commonwealth of Virginia, purport to have been made to the state of West Virginia by the act of 'the restored government of Virginia,' there were in fact represented in said 'restored government'$ and in the legislature thereof no other people and no other territory than that which then, as now, constitute the state of West Virginia.\n\n'19. The general assembly of Virginia, being anxious to effect a settlement of the portion of the common debt of the undivided state which remained unadjusted, and, if possible, to bring this about with the friendly co-operation and con- \n\n[206 U.S. 290, 305]\n\u00a0\n currence of West Virginia, adopted: 'A joint resolution to provide for adjusting with the state of West Virginia, the proportion of the public debt of the original state of Virginia proper to be borne by the state of West Virginia, and for the application of whatever may be received from the state of West Virginia to the payment of those found to be entitled to the same,' approved March 6, 1894. A copy of this resolution will be hereinafter shown as an exhibit to this bill, to be read as a part thereof.\n\n'Under this resolution a commission of seven members was appointed for the purpose of carrying into effect the objects expressed therein.\n\n'The efforts made by this commission, acting under the above resolution, to bring about a settlement with West Virginia, having proved ineffectual, and the overture which the commission, with the active cooperation of the Honorable Charles T. O'Ferral, the then governor of the commonwealth, made to the authorities of West Virginia for the purpose of bringing about a friendly adjustment, having been declined, the general assembly of Virginia passed the act approved March 6, 1900, entitled 'An Act to Provide for the Settlement with West Virginia of the Proportion of the Public Debt of the Original State of Virginia Proper to be Borne by West Virginia, and for the Protection of the Commonwealth of Virginia in the Premises,' the purpose of which act is sufficiently set forth in its title, and a copy of the act will also be hereinafter shown as one of the exhibits herewith filed.\n\n'20. The commission, acting under said last-mentioned act, made most earnest efforts to bring about an amicable adjustment of the matters hereinbefore set forth with West Virginia, but all of their efforts in that behalf proved ineffectual and unavailing. An application to this honorable court being thus left as the only alternative for Virginia, this suit has been instituted at the request and direction of the said commission, and in strict conformity with the provisions of the said act of March 6, 1900, all of which will be more fully and completely \n\n[206 U.S. 290, 306]\n\u00a0\n shown by the report of the said commission dated January 6, 1906, made to the general assembly of Virginia, now in session, a copy of which report and the documents accompanying the same, and referred to therein, will be exhibited as a part of this bill.'\n\n 21. Enumerates exhibits attached to the bill and prayed to be regarded as part thereof.\n 22. The bill prayed; 'Forasmuch, therefore, as your oratrix is remediless save in this form and forum, and to the end that the state of West Virginia may be duly served, through her governor and attorney general, with a copy of this bill, your oratrix prays that the said state of West Virginia may be made a party defendant to this bill, and required to answer the same, that all proper accounts may be taken to determine and ascertain the balance due from the state of West Virginia to your oratrix, in her own right and as trustee as aforesaid; that the principles upon which such accounting shall be had may be ascertained and declared, and a true and proper settlement made of the matters and things above recited and set forth; that such accounting be had an  ettlement made, under the supervision and direction of this court by such auditor or master as may by the court be selected and empowered to that end, and that proper and full reports of such accounting and settlement may be made to this court; that the state of West Virginia may be required to produce before such auditor or master, so to be appointed, all such official entries, documents, reports, and proceedings as may be among her public records or official files and may tend to show the facts and the true and actual state of accounts growing out of the matters and things above recited and set forth, in order to a full and correct settlement and adjustment of the accounts between the two states; that this court will adjudicate and determine the amount due to your oratrix by the state of West Virginia in the premises; and that all such other and further and general relief be granted unto your oratrix in the premises as the nature of her case may require or to equity may seem meet.' \n\n[206 U.S. 290, 307]\n\u00a0\n Attached to the bill were the numerous exhibits referred to.\n The state of West Virginia demurred and assigned special causes as follows:\n'First. That it appears by said bill that there is a misjoinder of parties plaintiff and a misjoinder of causes of action. The said bill is brought by the commonwealth of Virginia to recover debts alleged to be due to her in her own right from the defendant for property and money alleged to have been transferred and delivered to the defendant under certain acts of the legislature passed in 1863, and also, as trustee for the owners of certain certificates mentioned and described in said bill, to have an accounting to ascertain and declare the amount claimed to be due from the defendant as her just proportion of the public debt of the plaintiff prior to the 1st day of January, 1861\n\n\n\n'Second. That this court has no jurisdiction of either the parties to or the subject-matter of this action, because it appears by the said bill that the matters therein set forth do not constitute, within the meaning of the Constitution of the United States, such a controversy or such controversies, between the commonwealth of Virginia and the state of West Virginia as can be heard and determined in this court, and this court has no power to render or enforce any final judgment or decree thereon.\n\n'Third. That it appears by said bill that the plaintiff herein sues as trustee for the benefit of a number of individuals who are the alleged owners of certain certificates in the said bill set forth and described.\n\n'Fourth. That the said bill does not state facts sufficient to entitle the commonwealth of Virginia to the relief prayed for, or to any relief, either in her own right or as trustee for the owners of the certificates therein set forth and described.\n\n'Fifth. That it does not appear by said bill that the attorney general has ever been authorized to institute and prosecute this suit in the name of the commonwealth of Virginia in her own right, but only as trustee for the use and \n\n[206 U.S. 290, 308]\n\u00a0\n benefit of the owners of certain certificates mentioned in the act of March 6, 1900, which is referred to and made part of said bill.\n\n Sixth. That the said bill does not sufficiently and definitely set forth the claims and demands relied upon, but the allegations thereof are so indefinite and uncertain that no proper answer can be made thereto.\n'Seventh. That the allegations in the said bill are not sufficient to entitle the plaintiff therein, either in her own right or as trustee, to an account or to a discovery from this defendant.\n\n'Eighth. That the said bill does not contain any prayer for a judgment or decree or any other final relief against this defendant.'\n\n Hearing on the demurrer was had March 11, 12, 1907.\n Messrs. William A. Anderson and Holmes Conrad for complainant.\n\n\n[206 U.S. 290, 310]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John G. Carlisle, Charles E. Hogg, C. W. May, and Mollohan, McClintic, & Mathews for defendant.\n\n\n[206 U.S. 290, 315]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n The state of West Virginia was admitted into the Union June 20, 1863, under the proclamation of the President of the United States of April 20, 1863 [13 Stat. at L. 731], i p ursuance of the act of Congress approved December 31, 1862 [12 Stat. at L. 633, chap. 6], upon the terms and conditions prescribed by the commonwealth of Virginia in ordinances adopted in convention and in acts passed by the general assembly of the restored government of the commonwealth, giving her consent to the formation of a new state out of her territory, with a constitution adopted for the new state by the people thereof. The 9th section of the ordinance adopted by the people of the restored state of Virginia in convention assembled in the city of Wheeling, Virginia, on August 20, 1861, entitled, 'An ordinance to Provide for the Formation of a New State out of a Portion of the Territory of This State,' provided as follows:\n'9. The new state shall take upon itself a just proportion of the public debt of the commonwealth of Virginia, prior to \n\n[206 U.S. 290, 316]\n\u00a0\n the 1st day of January, 1861, to be ascertained by charging to it all state expenditures within the limits theerof, and a just proportion of the ordinary expenses of the state government, since any part of said debt was contracted; and deducting therefrom the moneys paid into the treasury of the commonwealth from the counties included within the said new state during the same period. All private rights and interests in lands within the proposed state, derived from the laws of Virginia prior to such separation, shall remain valid and secure under the laws of the proposed state, and shall be determined by the laws now existing in the state of Virginia. . . .'\n\n The consent of the commonwealth of Virginia was given to the formation of a new state on this condition. February 3 and 4, 1863, the general assembly of the restored state of Virginia enacted two statutes in pursuance of the provisions of which money and property amounting to and of the value of several millions of dollars were, after the admission of the new state, paid over and transferred to West Virginia. The Constitution of the state of West Virginia when admitted contained these provisions, being  5, 7, and 8 of article 8 thereof, as follows:\n'5. No debt shall be contracted by this state except to meet casual deficits in the revenue, to redeem a previous liability of the state, to suppress insurrection, repel invasion, or defend the state in time of war.'\n\n'7. The legislature may at any time direct a sale of the stocks owned by the state in banks and other corporations, but the proceeds of such sale shall be applied to the liquidation of the public debt; and hereafter the state shall not become a stockholder in any bank.\n\n'8. An equitable proportion of the public debt of the commonwealth of Virginia, prior to the first day of January, in the year one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one, shall be assumed by this state; and the legislature shall ascertain the same as soon as may be practicable, and provide for the liquidation thereof by a sinking fund sufficient to pay the accru- \n\n[206 U.S. 290, 317]\n\u00a0\n ing interest and redeem the principal within thirty-four years.'\n\n The 'public debt' and the 'previous liability' manifestly referred to a portion of the public debt of the original state of Virginia and liability for the money and property of the original state, which had been received by West Virginia under the acts of the general assembly, above cited, enacted while the territory and people afterwards forming the state of West Virginia constituted a part of the commonwealth of Virginia, though one may be involved in the other; while the provisions of  7 and 8 were obviously framed in compliance with the conditions on which the consent of Virginia was given to the creation of the state of West Virginia, and the money and property were transferred. From 1865 to 1905 various efforts were made by Virginia, through its constituted authorities, to effect an adjustment and settlement with West Virginia for an equitable proportion of the public debt of the undivided state, proper to be borne and paid by West Virginia, but all these efforts proved unavailing, and t is charged that West Virginia refused or failed to take any action or to do anything for the purpose of bringing about a settlement or adjustment with Virginia.\n The original jurisdiction of this court was, therefore, invoked by Virginia to procure a decree for an accounting as between the two states, and, in order to a full and correct adjustment of the accounts, the adjudication and determination of the amount due Virginia by West Virginia in the premises.\n But is is objected that this court has no jurisdiction because the matters set forth in the bill do not constitute such a controversy or such controversies as can be heard and determined in this court, and because the court has no power to enforce, and therefore none to render, any final judgment or decree herein. We think these objections are disposed of by many decisions of this court. Cohen v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 378, 406, 5 L. ed. 257, 284, 291; Kansas v.

Michigan, \n190 U.S. 379\n, 47 L. ed. 1103, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 742.\n In Cohen v. Virginia, the Chief Justice said: 'In the second class, the jurisdiction depends entirely on the character of the parties. In this are comprehended 'controversies between two or more states, between a state and citizens of another state,' 'and between a state and foreign states, citizens, or subjects.' If these be the parties, it is entirely unimportant what may be the subject of controversy. Be it what it may, these parties have a constitutional right to come into the courts of the Union.'\n And, referring to the 11th Amendment, it was further said:\n'It is a part of our history that, at the adoption of the Constitution, all the states were greatly indebted; and the apprehension that these debts might be prosecuted in the Federal courts formed a very serious objection to that instrument. Suits were instituted, and the court maintained its jurisdiction. The alarm was general; and, to quiet the apprehensions that were so extensively entertained, this Amendment was proposed in Congress, and adopted by the state legislatures. That its motive was not to maintain the sovereignty of a state from the degradation supposed to attend a compulsory appearance before the tribunal of the nation may be inferred from the terms of the Amendment. It does not comprehend controversies between two or more states, or between a state and a foreign state. The jurisdiction of the court still extends to these cases; and in these a state may still be sued. We must ascribe the Amendment, then, to some other cause than the dignity of a state. There is no difficulty in finding this cause. Those who were inhibited from commencing a suit against a state, or from prosecuting one which might be commenced before the adoption of the Amendment, were persons who might probably be its creditors. There was not much reason to fear that foreign or sister states would \n\n[206 U.S. 290, 319]\n\u00a0\n be creditors to any considerable amount, and there was reason to retain the jurisdiction of the court in those cases, because it might be essential to the preservation of peace. The Amendment, therefore, extended to suits commenced or prosecuted by individuals, but not to those brought by states.'\n\n By the cases cited, and there are many more, it is established that, in the exercise of original jurisdiction as between states, this court necessarily in such a case as this has jurisdiction.\n United States v. North Carolina and United States v. Michigan, supra, were controversies arising upon pecuniary demands,an d jurisdiction was exercised in those cases just as in those for the prevention of the flow of polluted water from one state along the borders of another state, or of the diminution in the natural flow of rivers by the state in which they have their sources through and across another state or states, or of the discharge of noxious gases from works in one state over the territory of another.\n The object of the suit is a settlement with West Virginia, and to that end a determination and adjudication of the amount due by that state to Virginia; and when this court has ascertained and adjudged the proportion of the debt of the original state which it would be equitable for West Virginia to pay, it is not to be presumed on demurrer that West Virginia would refuse to carry out the decree of this court. If such reoudiation should be absolutely asserted we can then consider by what means the decree may be enforced. Consent to be sued was given when West Virginia was admitted into the Union, and it must be assumed that the legislature of West Virginia would, in the natural course, make provision for the satisfaction of any decree that may be rendered.\n It is, however, further insisted that this court cannot proceed to judgment because of an alleged compact entered into between Virginia and West Virginia, with the consent of Congress, by which the question of the liability of Virginia to West Virginia was submitted to the arbitrament and award \n\n[206 U.S. 290, 320]\n\u00a0\n of the legislature of West Virginia as the sole tribunal which could pass upon it. As we have seen, the Constitution of West Virginia, when admitted into the Union, contained the provision: 'An equitable proportion of the public debt of the commonwealth of Virginia prior to the first day of January, in the year one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one, shall be assumed by this state, and the legislature shall ascertain the same as soon as may be practicable, and provide for the liquidation thereof by a sinking fund . . . and redeem the principal within thirty-four years.' And it is said that, on May 13, 1862, the legislature of Virginia passed an act entitled 'An Act Giving the Consent of the Legislature of Virginia to the Formation and Erection of a New State within the Jurisdiction of this State,' by which consent was given to the creation of the proposed new state, 'according to the boundaries and under the provisions set forth in the Constitution for the said state of West Virginia, and the schedule thereto annexed, proposed by the convention which assembled at Wheeling on the 26th day of November, 1861;' and that by the act of Congress the consent of that body was given to all those provisions which thus became a constitutional and legal compact between the two states. The act of May 13, 1862, was not made a part of the case stated in the bill, and its validity is denied by counsel for Virginia, but it is unnecessary to go into that, for when Virginia, on August 20, 1861, by ordinance provided 'for the formation of a new state out of the territory of this state,' and declared therein that 'the new state shall take upon itself a just proportion of the public debt of the commonwealth of Virginia prior to the 1st day of January, 1861,' to be ascertained as provided, it is to be supposed that the new state had this in mind when it framed its own Constitution, and that when that instrument provided that its legislature should 'ascertain the same as soon as practicable,' it referred to the method of ascertaining prescribed by the Virginia convention. Reading the Virginia ordinance and the West Virginia constitutional provision in pari materia, it follows \n\n[206 U.S. 290, 321]\n\u00a0\n that what was meant by the expression that the 'legislature shall ascertain' was that the legislature should ascertain, as soon as practicable, the result of the pursuit of the method prescribed, and provide for the liquidation of the amount so ascertained. And it may well be inquired why, in the forty-three years that have elapsed since the alleged compact was ete red into, West Virginia has never indicated that she stood upon such a compact, and, if so, why no step has ever been taken by West Virginia to enter upon the performance of the duty which such 'compact' imposed, and to notify Virginia that she was ready and willing to discharge such duty.\n It is also urged that Virginia had no interest in the subject-matter of the controversy because she had been released from all liability on account of the public debt of the old commonwealth, evidenced by her bonds outstanding on the 1st day of January, 1861. This relates to the acts of the general assembly of Virginia of March 30, 1871, March 28, 1879, February 14, 1882, February 20, 1892, March 6, 1894, and March 6, 1900. According to the bill, Virginia, by the act of March 30, 1871, and subsequent acts, in an attempt to provide for the funding and payment of the public debt, having estimated that the liability of West Virginia was for one third of the amount of the old bonds, provided for the issue of new bonds to the amount of two thirds of the total, and for the issue of certificates for the other third, which showed that Virginia held the old bonds, so far as unfunded, in trust for the holders or their assignees, to be paid by the funds expected to be obtained from West Virginia as her 'just and equitable proportion of the public debt.' The legislation resulted in the surrender of most of the old bonds to Virginia, satisfied as to two thirds, and held as security for the creditors as to one third. We do not care to take up and discuss this legislation. We are satisfied that, as we have jurisdiction, these questions ought not to be passed upon on demurrer. Kansas v. Colorado, \n185 \nU.S. 125, 144\n, 145 S., 46 L. ed. 838, 845, 846, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 552. And this also furnishes sufficient ground for not considering at length the objection of multi- \n\n[206 U.S. 290, 322]\n\u00a0\n fariousness. The observations of Lord Cottenham, in Campbell v. Mackay, 1 Myl. & C. 603, that it is impracticable to lay down any rule as to what constitutes multifariousness, as an abstract proposition; that each case must depend upon its own circumstances; and much must be left where the authorities leave it, to the sound discretion of the court,-have been often affirmed in this court. Oliver v. Piatt, 3 How. 333, 411, 11 L. ed. 622, 657; Gaines v. Chew, 2 How. 619, 642, 11 L. ed. 402, 411. But we do not mean to rule that the bill is multifarious. It is true that the prayer contains, among other things, the request, 'that all proper accounts may be taken to determine and ascertain the balance due from the state of West Virginia to your oratrix in her own right and as trustee aforesaid,' but it also prays that the court 'will adjudicate and determine the amount due to your oratrix by the state of West Virginia in the premises.' And we understand the reference to holding in trust to be in the interest of mere convenience, and that the bill cannot properly be regarded as seeking in chief anything more than a decree for 'an equitable proportion of the public debt of the commonwealth of Virginia on the 1st day of January, 1861,' The objections of misjoinder of parties and misjoinder of causes of action may be treated as resting on matter of surplusage merely, and, at all events, further consideration thereof may wisely be postponed to final hearing.

OF AMERICA v. AUTOMATIC SCALE CO(1907)\nNo. 175\nArgued: January 23, 1907Decided: February 25, 1907\n\n\n\n Messrs. Melville Church and Joseph B. Church for appellant.\n Messrs. H. P. Doolittle and E. Hilton Jackson for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an appeal from the court of appeals of the District of Columbia, affirming a decree of the supreme court of the \n\n[204 U.S. 609, 610]\n\u00a0\n District, dismissing the bill of the Computing Scale Company of America, appellant, against the Automatic Scale Company, based upon the alleged infringement of letters patent No. 700,919, granted to the complainant as the assignee of the inventor, Austin B. Hayden, said letters bearing date May 27, 1902, for an improvement in computing scales.\n The bill contained a prayer for an injunction and accounting. The answer denied the patentability of the alleged invention of the plaintiff, set up the alleged anticipating invention of one Christopher, and denied infringement.\n The alleged improvement of Hayden is shown in the accompanying illustrations taken from the patent. [See next page.]\n To understand these drawings they are to be viewed in the light of the description of the mechanism given by complainant's expert, which has the approval of the expert of the defendant, and was accepted as correct in the court of appeals. This description, somewhat abridged, is as follows:\n'The two principal parts of the mechanism are as follows: 1st, a vertically arranged, nonrotating frame which comprises and includes a vertical cylindrical casing which incloses, conceals, and protects the major portion of the operating portions of the scale, and upon which are marked the price indications which indicate the price per pound at which the articles weighed are to be sold. As clearly shown in the drawings this external casing or frame is provided with a vertically disposed sight opening through which the coacting mechanism is observable, and along one vertical edge of this sight opening are arranged the numerals indicating the price per pound.\n\n'The second of these principal parts is a second cylinder located within the casing, this cylinder constituting a computing cylinder or chart drum upon which are placed indications indicating the weight in pounds of the article weighed, and also having other indications indicating the price of an article weighed corresponding to the weight and to the price per pound. This chart drum or computing cylinder extends vertically within external casing and it is arranged to rotate \n\n[204 U.S. 609, 611]\n\u00a0\n on a vertical axis within the external casing. This casing is appropriately connected to the spring balancing mechanism and to the scale pan so that when the spring balancing mechanism moves up and down on the placing or removing of a load on the scale pan, the chart drum will be rotated in one direction or the other within the external casing or frame.\n\n \n\u00a0\n 'As shown in Fig. 2, the weight and value-indicating figures are placed in horizontal rows on the external surface or periphery of the rotatable chart drum of the computing cylinder, the weight indications being shown in a horizontal row at the bottom, and the price indications in horizontal rows above, there being as many of these horizontal rows of price indicating figures as there are 'price per pound' indicating figures on the fixed external casing. These valueindicating figures on\n [Graphic from this page is combined with the graphic on page 611] \n\n[204 U.S. 609, 613]\n\u00a0\n the chart drum are computed at different rates corresponding to the 'price per pound' figures on the external casing. As indicated in figure 2 of the drawings of the patent, there is supposed to be a weight on the scale pan of 5 pounds, this weight being indicated on the weight scale, and it will be seen that in such instance the various value indications on the chart drum opposite the 'price per pound' indications on the fixed casing are, in each illustrated instance, five times as great as the corresponding 'price per pound' indications. The drawings illustrate only a portion of the indicating figures on the chart drum, but it will be understood in practice that this drum will be entirely covered on its external surface with figures corresponding to the weights multiplied by the figures indicating 'price per pound' on the nonrotatable external casing. Accordingly, whenever the interior chart drum is turned a distance corresponding to the load placed on the scale pan, the value of the load can be read at once opposite the figures on the external casing which correspond to the price per pound of the article weighed.\n'The various price indications on the chart drum are visible through the sight opening in the external casing.\n\n'The mechanism whereby the chart drum is rotated a distance corresponding to the weight of the load placed on the scale pan is as follows: The balancing mechanism is a spring balance comprising two springs which are suspended from a suitable portion of the nonrotating frame of the scale. To the lower ends of these springs is attached a crossbar in the middle of which depends a rod, this crossbar and rod constituting the runner of the scale. (See Fig. 3.) The scale pan is suspended from the lower end of this rod as illustrated in Figure 1. When a load is placed on the scale pan the vertical runner moves vertically downward distending the spring to an extent proportional to the weight of the load. In order to indicate the weight this vertical movement of the spring-supported runner is converted or translated into a rotary movement of the chart drum by suitable intervening mechan- \n\n[204 U.S. 609, 614]\n\u00a0\n ism. This intervening mechanism consists of a spiral groove of high pitch on the vertical rod and two rollers journaled in suitable bearings carried by the rotatable chart drum, the bearings of one of these rollers being spring pressed so that the rollers are held in yielding contact with the spiral groove on the rod. Consequently as the rod moves vertically the spiral groove thereof causes the chart drum or computing cylinder to rotate on its vertical axis.\n\n'Accordingly, the mechanism is such that the vertical movement of the runner is translated into rotary movement of the chart drum, and the chart drum is rotated to an extent proportional to the vertical movement of the runner.'\n\n In his application, Hayden, having set forth a description of his invention, disclaiming any intention to limit his invention by the precise description of the specifications, except as appears from his claims, sets forth eleven (11) claims, which he alleges as new and desires to secure by letters patent.\n The claims alleged to be infringed in this case are numbered 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8. Numbers 1 and 2 are practically alike, except that in No. 2 the spring-supported, load-bearing, and cylinder-revolving rod is described as nonrotatably suspended. Claims 6, 7, and 8 have some trifling variations, but, in the view we take of this case, they are sufficiently embodied in claim No. 6. We shall, therefore, consider, in arriving at a decision, claims 1 and 6. They are as follows:\n'1. In a spring-balance computing scale, the combination of a suitably-supported vertical nonrotatable casing provided with a price index, a vertical rotatable computing cylinder journaled in said casing, provided with cost computations, a spring-supported, load-bearing, and cylinder-revolving rod suspended from said casing, and connecting means between rod and computing cylinder, whereby, by longitudinal movement of the rod, rotary movement is imparted to said cylinder, substantially as and for the purpose set forth.\n\n'6. In a spring balance, the combination of a nonrotating frame providing an external casing and having means for sup- \n\n[204 U.S. 609, 615]\n\u00a0\n porting it from above, weighing springs secured at their upper ends to rigid parts of said frame, a vertically-movable runner which is suspended from the lower ends of said springs and is provided with depending means to support the load, a chart drum rotatably mounted within said casing on a vertical axis and having external horizontal rows of value-indicating figures computed at different rates, said casing having a sight opening through which portions of said value-indicating rows may be seen, and corresponding rate-indicating figures on the outer face of said frame adjacent to the value-indicating rows on the chart drum, and mechanism for translating the vertical movement of the runner into the rotary movements of the chart drum.'\n\n Hayden did not assume to be a pioneer in this field of invention, but he claims to have made an improvement in computing scales of the spring- balance type, and states his object to be specially to increase the computing capacity of scales of that type.\n An examination of the record discloses that computing scales have been the subject of prior inventions and were well known at the time of Hayden's application. It is true that the scales disclosed in the prior art were generally those having a horizontal axis, case, and cylinder, although it was not new to arrange a scale bertically.\n If we are to read the claims as broadly as is contended for, and omit, for the present, vertical construction shown by Hayden, we shall find in the patent of Phinney, No. 106,869, of August 30, 1870, a computing scale having the general elements of a nonrotatable casing, provided with a price index and rotatable cylinder journaled in the case, and having computations thereon, a suspended, spring-supported, load-bearing, and cylinder-revolving rod, and connecting means between the rod and computing cylinder, to impart part rotary motion to the inner cylinder. This is perhaps more emphatically true in the invention of Smith, patent No. 545, 619, of September 3, 1895. \n\n[204 U.S. 609, 616]\n\u00a0\n In the patent of Babcock, No. 421,805, February 18, 1890, a vertical construction is shown. It is true that Babcock's invention was not automatic in its operation, and required the intervention of the operator to complete the required process, but it serves to show that the idea of vertical construction was not new when Hayden entered the field. Taking the state of the art at that time, it is evident that there is little room to claim a broad construction of Hayden's improvement. It is well settled by numerous decisions of this court that, while a combination of old elements producing a new and useful result will be patentable, yet, where the combination is merely the assembling of old elements producing no new and useful result, invention is not shown. Office Specialty Mfg. Co. v. Fenton Metallic Mfg. Co. \n174 U.S. 492\n-498, 43 L. ed. 1058-1060, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 641, and previous decisions of this court there cited.\n It is true that many valuable inventions seem simple when accomplished, and yet are entitled to protection. The books abound in cases showing inventions involving only small departure from former means, yet making the difference between a defective mechanism and a practical method of accomplishing results. In such cases a decision in favor of invention as distinguished from mere mechanical improvement has not infrequently resulted, in view of the fact that the device has made the difference between an impracticable machine and a useful improvement displacing others theretofore occupying the field. Krementz v. S. Cottle Co. \n148 U.S. 556\n, 37 L. ed. 558, 13 Sup. Ct Rep. 719; Consolidated Brake- Shoe Co. V. Detroit Steel & Spring Co. 47 Fed. 894; Star Brass Works v. General Electric Co. 49 C. C. A. 409, 111 Fed. 398.\n In the present case it nowhere appears in the testimony, nor is it claimed in the specifications of Hayden's patent, that the prior mechanisms of horizontal construction were impracticable or inefficient. There is no suggestion that Hayden's invention has been the last step between an inoperative machine and one practically operative and useful. There is no showing that it has been generally accepted in the trade and displaced \n\n[204 U.S. 609, 617]\n\u00a0\n the former machines used for the same purpose. Without resort to the record in the Patent Office, we think it is plain that the invention is but a small advance upon others already in use.\n Broadly considered, the elements of Hayden's invention were in the horizontal machines, and the idea of vertical construction was old. Considering this invention in the light of what occurred in the Patent Office in connection with the other considerations already referred to, and the state of the art at the time, we think Hayden's invention can only be sustained to a limited extent.\n Before taking up the record as disclosed in the file wrapper and contents we may premise that it is perfectly well settled in this court by frequent decisions that where an inventor, seeking a broad claim which is rejected, in which rejection he acquiesces, substitutes therefor a narrower claim, he cannot be heard to insist that the construction of the claim allowed shall cover that which has been previously rejected.

United States, \n179 \nU.S. 77, 80\n, 45 S. L. ed. 95, 98, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 24, 25, as follows:\n'An examination of the history of the appellant's claim, as disclosed in the file wrapper and contents, shows that, in order to get his patent, he was compelled to accept one with a narrower claim than that contained in his original application; and it is well settled that the claim as allowed must be read and interpreted with reference to the rejected claim, and to the prior state of the art, and cannot be so construed as to cover either what was rejected by the Patent Office or disclosed by prior devises.

While not allowed to revive a rejected claim by a broad construction of the claim allowed, yet the patentee is entitled to a fair construction of the terms of his claim as actually granted.'\n\n Looking to the record in the Patent Office, we find that claim 1, as originally presented, read as follows:\n'1. In a spring-balance computing scale, the combination of a suitably supported vertical nonrotatable casing provided with a price index, a vertical rotatable computing cylinder journaled in said casing provided with cost computations, a spring-supported load pan supported from said casing, and means connected with said pan and cylinder for rotating the cylinder as the pan is lowered under pressure, substantially as and for the purpose set forth.'\n\n The examiner rejected this claim upon the patent of Smith, No. 545, 616, price scales, and in view of the patent of Turnbull, No. 378,382, spring scales, saying: 'It would not involve invention to arrange upon Turnbull's scales a vertical stationary casing having within it a revolvable computing chart, the axis being connected with the indexcarrying shaft P shown in the Turnbull patent.'\n To this the applicant, through his attorneys, replied:\n'The first portion of the examiner's letter is not understood, as there are no modifications referred to in lines 6 to 26 of page 3. A reconsideration of the claims is requested, for the reason that it is believed that the references cited do not anticipate any of the claims. In both of the references cited a rack bar extending transversely of the center of rotation of the computing chart serves, by means of engagement with a pinion at the axis of the computing chart, to rotate the latter. This is entirely different from applicant's construction, and it is not seen that the references are pertinent to the issue. Certainly, the references, neither singly nor taken together, anticipate the structure set forth in the claims, and there can hardly be \n\n[204 U.S. 609, 619]\n\u00a0\n any question that the construction which applicant shown is a substantial improvement in the art. It is hoped that all the claims may be allowed.'\n\n But the examiner again rejected claims 1, 8, and 9 upon the references of record, and held that it would not involve invention to arrange upon the vertical shaft of Turnbull's scale a computing chart and inclosing case having the characteristics of Smith's scale. To this the attorneys for applicant answered:\n'These claims are canceled, not because considered unallowable, but because it is not desired to prosecute an appeal, in view of the fact that the allowed claims appear to cover the invention as it would be constructed in practice. The cancelation is made, therefore, without prejudice to the claims which remain.'\n\n The sixth claim was allowed upon the suggestion of the examiner, as follows:\n'In a spring balance, the combination of a nonrotating frame providing an external casing and having means for supporting it from above, weighing springs secured at their upper ends to rigid parts of said frame, a vertically movable runner which is suspended from the lower ends of said springs and is provided with means to support the load, a chart drum rotatably mounted within said casing on a vertical axis and having external horizontal rows of value-indicating figures computed at different rates, said casing having a sight opening through which portions of said value-indicating rows may be seen, and corresponding rate-indicating figures on the outer face of said frame adjacent to the value-indicating rows on the chart drum, and mechanism for translating the vertical movement of the runner into the rotary movements of the chart drum.'\n\n It was afterwards stated by the examiner:\n'Upon consideration of claim 6 preparatory to the declaration of interference it is found that the claim does not clearly and patentably distinguish from the scale shown in the patent to Herr, No. 651,801, June 12, 1900, Price Scales, and it is \n\n[204 U.S. 609, 620]\n\u00a0\n therefore necessary to reject the claim. It is believed, however, that the claim may be rendered allowable by inserting depending before 'means' in line 6,' and, accordingly, the word 'depending' was inserted in the claim, so as to make it in its present form. How this added anything to the patentability of the mechanism described it is difficult to perceive, in view of the presence of 'depending means to support the load' in all scales of this class.\n\n The general rule, as stated, as to the effect of a patentee striking out a broad claim and accepting a narrow one, is conceded by the learned counsel for appellant, but it is contended that if an inventor presents a broad claim and strikes it out and then presents and obtains an equally broad claim, he loses no right by such action, and may justly claim his allowed claim to be a broad one and have relief accordingly. But we think the action of the department in this case cannot be thus eliminated. Claim 1, as presented, had contained the words 'a spring-supported load pan supported from said casing, and means connected with said pan and cylinder for rotating the cylinder as the pan is lowered under pressure,' and as allowed, there was inserted 'a spring-supported, load-bearing, and cylinder-revolving rod suspended from said casing, and connecting means between rod and computing cylinder, whereby, by longitudinal movement of the rod, rotary movement is imparted to said cylinder, substantially as and for the purpose set forth.' This limitation to specific means is certainly a narrowing of the claim.\n It was accepted, as the patentee said, 'in view of the fact that the allowed claims appear to cover the invention as it would be constructed in practice.'\n We cannot think it was the intention of the department, after requiring the insertion of 'a spring-supported, load-bearing, and cylinder- revolving rod' and 'connecting means between rod and computing cylinder' to secure the rotary movement of the inner cylinder as a means of saving claim 1, to then permit the claim to be granted broadly in allowing other \n\n[204 U.S. 609, 621]\n\u00a0\n claims. And we believe it would be a more reasonable construction of the letter of the applicant to say that he rocognized that his invention, 'as constructed in practice,' must have read into it to sustain the claim, the specific means shown for translating the vertical movement of the runner into the rotary movement of the chart drum, rather than as saving a right to construe a claim broadly as including in one claim what had just been refused in another.\n It is to be noted that Hayden, in his specifications, says:\n'The spiral rod passing through the lower ends of the casing, and serving, by means of its connection with the two cylinders, to rotate the computing cylinder, is regarded as the essence of this feature of the invention, however, regardless of the precise details of connection between cylinders and rod.'\n\n In view of the action of the Patent Office in this case and the acquiescence of the applicant, considered also in view of the state of the art, in out opinion it is necessary to have this novel element of the invention read into them in order to save the claims of Hayden's patent.\n Conceding that this spiral rod and its connections with the cylinder in the manner and for the purposes stated is a novel feature in the combination, and entitled to protection, it is of that narrow character of invention which does not entitle the patentee to any considerable range of equivalents, but must be practically limited to the means shown by the inventor. The distinction between pioneer inventions permitting a wide range of equivalents and those inventions of a narrower character, which are limited to the construction shown, has been frequently emphasized in the decision of this court. Cimiotti Unhairing Co. v. American Fur Ref. Co. \n198 \nU.S. 399, 406\n, 49 S. L. ed. 1100, 1103, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 697, and cases therein cited.\n Thus limiting the invention, we do not think the construction of the defendant amounts to an infringement. Its mechanism, by means of which the downward move-ment of the load accomplishes the rotary movement of the cylinder, consists \n\n[204 U.S. 609, 622]\n\u00a0\n of a bar which has a rod extended upward and carrying a rack which meshes with a pinion on a shaft journaled in bearings on a crossbar of the frame of the machine. On this shaft is a gear meshing with the pinion, secured to an upright shaft journaled in bearings in the frame, and projecting above it so as to receive a light frame composed of cross arms and a circular rim to which the chart drum is secured. The downward movement of the load-supporting hook causes the rack to move in the same direction, rotating the horizontal shaft by means of the pinion, and this movement is communicated by means of the gearing to the upright shaft carrying the chart drum. The cylinder-revolving rod with its connections, which, as we have seen, was made an essential element to accomplish invention in Hayden's device, is not found. The complainant's expert is of opinion that it is shown in the hook at the bottom of defendant's scale for holding the load pan. We cannot agree to this conclusion; the hook is not the cylinder- revolving spiral rod and does not accomplish complish its function.\n The court of appeals held the sixth claim void. We are of opinion that it cannot be allowed for the broad claim 'mechanism for translating the vertical movement of the runner into the rotary movement of the chart drum,' but must be limited to Hayden's suspended rod with its spiral, engaging with the rollers, or similar devices on the cylinder, practically in the manner and for the purposes shown by him. If the claim be thus limited, for the reasons we have already stated, the mechanism of the defendant does not infringe.\n We find no error in the decree rendered by the Court of Appeals, and it is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","42":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOPPER QUEEN MINING CO. v. ARIZONA(1907)\nNo. 280\nArgued: April 26, 1907Decided: May 27, 1907\n\n\n\n\n[206 U.S. 474, 475]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William Herring, Everett E. Ellinwood, and Sarah Herring Sorin for appellant.\n\n\n\n[206 U.S. 474, 476]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Elias S. Clark, William C. Prentiss, and Horace F. Clark for appellee.\n\n\n\n[206 U.S. 474, 478]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an appeal from a judgment on demurrer to a petition for a writ of certiorari. The object of the petition was to vacate proceedings of the board of equalization in 1905, by which the board added very largely to the assessed valuation of patented mines and, in a less degree, of work horses and saddle horses, in Cochise county and other counties in Arizona. It was alleged that by these proceedings the board increased the total valuation of property in the territory and increased the valuation of the petitioner's property of the above-mentioned kinds. The writ had been issued by a single justice, returnable before the full bench, but the case was heard on the demurrer by consent, and by the judgment the demurrer was sustained and the writ was quashed.\n The errors alleged are two: First, that while the board, for purposes of equalizing, might add to the total value of the property in one county and diminish that of property in another, it had no power toin crease the total valuation of property in the territory above the sum of the returns from the boards of supervisors of the several counties; and second, that the board was bound to deal with the valuation of each county as a whole, and could not increase or diminish the valuations of particular classes of property within a county. The power of the board depends, of course, upon statute, and it is said that the statute of Arizona was taken almost verbatim from one of Colorado, which had been construed by the supreme court of that state in accordance with the first of the petitioner's above contentions before it was adopted by Arizona. People ex rel. Crawford v. Lothrop, 3 Colo. 428. The construction, it is said, goes with the act. Henrietta Min. & Mill. Co. v. \n\n[206 U.S. 474, 479]\n\u00a0\n Gardner, \n173 \nU.S. 123, 130\n, 43 S. L. ed. 637, 640, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 327. The second contention is based on an interpretation of the statutes, the supposed absence of an express grant of power, and later decisions in Colorado and other states.\n On the other hand, while this court cannot refuse to exercise its own judgment, it naturally will lean toward the interpretation of a local statute adopted by the local court. Sweeney v. Lomme, 22 Wall. 208, 22 L. ed. 727; Northern P. R. Co. v. Hambly, \n154 \nU.S. 349, 361\n, 38 S. L. ed. 1009, 1014, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 983; Fox v. Haarstick, \n156 \nU.S. 674, 679\n, 39 S. L. ed. 576, 578, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 457. And again, when, for a considerable time, a statute notoriously has received a construction in practice from those whose duty it is to carry it out, and afterwards is re-enacted in the same words, it may be presumed that the construction is satisfactory to the legislature, unless plainly erroneous, since otherwise naturally the words would have been changed. New York, N. H. & H. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n200 \nU.S. 361, 401\n, 402 S., 50 L. ed. 515, 525, 526, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 272. The statute of Arizona was re-enacted in 1901 and was said by the supreme court to have been construed by the board against the petitioner's contention ever since the board was created, eighteen years before. Even apart from the re-enactment a certain weight attaches to this fact. United States v. Finnell, \n185 \nU.S. 236, 243\n, 244 S., 46 L. ed. 890, 893, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 633; United States v. Sweet, \n189 U.S. 471\n, 47 L. ed. 907, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 638. The presumption that the codifiers of 1901 knew and approved the practice of the board certainly is as strong as the presumption that the original enactors of the statute knew a single decision in another state; and it is more important, since it refers to a later time.\n As an original question the construction adopted by the supreme court appears to us at least as reasonable as the opposite one contended for, and the variations in the Arizona act from the prototype, if Colorado furnished the prototype, and the different background against which it was to be construed, seem to us to have warranted the refusal to be bound by the Colorado case.\n We give a section of the General Laws of Colorado, 1877, and of the Revised Statutes of Arizona side by side. \n\n[206 U.S. 474, 480]\n\u00a0\n 2282. Sec. 43. Said board shall ascertain whether the valuation of real estate in each county bears a fair relation or proportion to the valuation in all other counties of the state, and on such examination they may increase or diminish the aggregate valuation of real estate in any county as much as, in their judgment, may be necessary to produce a just relation between all the valuations of real estate in the state; but in no instance shall they reduce the aggregate valuation of all the counties below the aggregate valuation as returned by the clerks of the several counties.\n 3880. (Sec. 50.) The said board shall ascertain whether the valuation of property in each county bears a fair relation or proportion to the valuation in all other counties in the territory, and on such examination they may increase or diminish the valuation of property in any county as much as, in their judgmnt , may be necessary to produce a just relation between all the valuations of property in the territory; but in no instance shall they reduce the aggregate valuation of all the counties below the aggregate valuation as returned by the boards of supervisors of the several counties. And said board shall, at the same time, fix the rate of taxes for territorial purposes which is to be levied and collected in each county. For convenience we take up the second of the alleged errors first. It will be seen that the word 'property' takes the place of 'real estate' at the beginning, and that the power given, instead of being only a power to increase or diminish the aggregate valuation of real estate in any county, is to increase or diminish the valuation of property (not the property) in (not of) any county. The word 'aggregate' is left out, and the fact that it was left out favors the construction that apart from that fact would be reasonable, that the power extends to the valuation of any property, and is not confined to the valuation of all the property as one whole. This construction \n\n[206 U.S. 474, 481]\n\u00a0\n is further favored by the purpose of the changes in valuation, which is to 'produce a just relation between all the valuations of property in the territory.' This phrase is interstitial in its working. It does not confine the equality to the valuations by county, but extends it to all the valuations of property. Yet a further argument may be drawn from the language of  3874: 'No assessor, board of supervisors, or the territorial board of equalization shall assess any real estate at a less valuation than 75 cents per acre.' This recognizes the power of the board to deal with a special class of property, and we may add, by way of anticipation, by also recognizing a function of assessment, does much to make inapplicable the reasoning of the Colorado decision upon the other point.\n It seems to have been argued below that at least the board was confined to dealing with property by the classes mentioned in other sections of the statutes, especially  3849, 3861, 3877. But the classifications and specifications provided for in those sections do not affect the power expressly given by  3880, as we have construed the latter, and further, by  3877 the territorial board is given power in very broad terms to change the list. It is not necessary to rely on this power to change the list for the power of the board to change valuations of a particular class of property. It is mentioned simply to show that the powers given by 3880 are not diminished by other provisions.\n The first contention of the petitioner needs but a few words in addition to what we have said. The power to increase the valuation of property in any county is as power to increase it in all, or at least, to increase the valuation of some kinds of property in all, so as to produce a just relation between them and the other valuations left undisturbed. We find nothing in the statute that requires the increase to be so adjusted that the total valuation shall be unchanged. On the contrary, the prohibition against reducing it implies that the board has the power of change, and, but for the prohibition, might reduce \n\n[206 U.S. 474, 482]\n\u00a0\n the total. Therefore it may add to the total since the law does not forbid that. The Colorado decision to the contrary turned partly on the notion, which has been shown to be inapplicable to Arizona, that the board of equalization had no function of assessment. It also turned in part, at least, on the Constitution of the state, to which, of course, the statute was subject. There was no Constitution to be conformed to in Arizona, and therefore the construction of the statute depends on the meaning of the words alone, and the supreme court of the territory, in construing them, was left at large.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","43":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCORTELYOU v. CHARLES ENEU JOHNSON & CO(1907)\nNo. 32\nArgued: Decided: December 2, 1907\n\n\n\n\n[207 U.S. 196, 197]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Edmond Wetmore and Samuel Owen Edmonds for petitioners.\n\n\n\n[207 U.S. 196, 198]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Francis T. Chambers for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a suit to restrain an alleged infringement of a patent granted June 22, 1897, for the stencil duplicating machine known as the rotary Neostyle. The plaintiffs below, petitioners here, represent the entire interest in the patent. There is no claim of any infringement by using or selling the patented machines, but of an indirect infringement in the following maner: For the last few years the rotary Neostyle has been sold subject to this license, which was plainly disclosed on the baseboard of the machine: 'License agreement. This machine is sold by the Neostyle Company with the license restriction that it can be used only with stencil paper, ink, and other supplies made by the Neostyle Company, New York City.' \n\n[207 U.S. 196, 199]\n\u00a0\n The defendant company (which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of ink) is, it is contended, engaged in selling ink to the purchasers of these machines for use thereon; that it is thus inducing a breach of the license contracts, and is responsible as indirectly infringing the patent rights of plaintiffs. The circuit court sustained the contention and entered an interlocutory decree for an injunction and an accounting. 138 Fed. 110. On appeal the circuit court of appeals for the second circuit reversed this decree and remanded the case to the circuit court, with instructions to dismiss the bill (76 C. C. A. 455, 145 Fed. 933), whereupon the case was brought here on certiorari.\n The three judges of the circuit court of appeals concurred in reversing the decree of the circuit court on the ground that the evidence was not sufficient to show that the defendant had notice that the machines for which the ink was ordered had been sold under any restrictions, but they differed upon the question whether there was any liability in case sufficient notice of the license agreement had been brought home to the defendant. The majority were of the opinion that the doctrine of contributory infringement, which they conceded to exist, should not be extended beyond those articles which are either parts of a patented combination or device, or which are produced for the sole purpose of being so used, and should not be applied to the staple articles of commerce. In that view of the case, the article supplied being ink, a thing of common use, its sale to a purchaser of the Neostyle machine would be no infringement.\n While in E. Bement & Sons v. National Harrow Co. \n186 U.S. 70\n, 46 L. ed. 1058, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 747, this court held, in respect to patent rights, that, with few exceptions, 'any conditions which are not in their very nature illegal with regard to this kind of property, imposed by the patentee and agreed to by the licensee for the right to manufacture or use or sell the article, will be upheld by the courts,' it is unnecessary to consider how far a stipulation in a contract between the owner of a patent right and the purchaser from him of a machine manufactured under that right, that it should \n\n[207 U.S. 196, 200]\n\u00a0\n be used only in a certain way, will sustain an action in favor of the vendor against the purchaser in case of a breach of that stipulation. So, although 'if one maliciously interferes in a contract between two parties, and induces one of them to break that contract to the injury of the other, the party injured can maintain an action against the wrongdoer' (Angle v. Chicago, St. P. M. & O. R. Co. \n151 \nU.S. 1, 13\n, 38 S. L. ed. 55, 62, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 240), it is also unnecessary to determine whether this states the full measure of liability resting upon a party interfering and inducing the breaking of a contract, for we concur in the views expressed by all the judges of the court of appeals, that there is no sufficient evidence of notice. True, the defendant filled a few orders for ink to be used on a rotary Neostyle, but it does not appear that it ever solicited an order for ink to be so used, that it was ever notified by the plaintiffs of the rights which they claimed, or that anything which it did was considered by them an infringement upon those rights. Further, none of the chief executive officers of the company had knowledge of the special character of the rotary Neostyle machine or the restrictions on the purchase of supplies. The case of the plaintiffs in this respect rests mainly on the testimony of the witness Gerber, who testified that, at the instance of the manager of the Neostyle Company, he wrote to the defendant for a one- pound can of black ink for use on the rotary Neostyle, saying: 'I will be at my office Friday afternoon, between 1:30 and 3:30, and, if convenient, have your representative call at that time.' A salesman of the defendant, named Randall, did call. The witness directed Randall's attention to the restrictions on the single machine he had in his office, and asked if he would have any trouble with the Neostyle Company if he used the defendant's ink; Randall replied in the negative, and added that 'the ink in question was not patented, that anybody could make or use it; that no trouble would come to me from the use of the ink which he sold.' The restriction on the machine shown to Randall was one formerly used by plaintiffs, but which had been discarded prior to this transaction, and for it the present license agreement \n\n[207 U.S. 196, 201]\n\u00a0\n had been substituted. The restriction shown to Randall stated that the machine was sold 'with the express understanding that it is licensed to be used only with stencil paper and ink (both of which are patented) made by the Neostyle Company of New York city.' Evidently from his reply Randall's attention was not drawn to the question of a patent on the ink. Further, he was not an officer or general agent of the defendant company, but simply a salesman, and it cannot be that this talk with him is notice to and binding on his principal in respect to all future transactions.\n After reviewing all the minor considerations to which our attention has been called by the plaintiffs, we see no sufficient reason for disagreeing with the unanimous opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals in respect to the matter of notice, and its decree is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","44":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCROWE v. TRICKEY(1907)\nNo. 71\nArgued: Decided: January 21, 1907\n\n\n\n\n[204 U.S. 228, 229]\n\u00a0\n This was an action brought by Crowe in the district court of Santa Cruz county, Arizona, against Trickey, administrator of the estate of N. H. Chapin, deceased, to recover the sum of $5,000 as commission on a sale alleged to have been effected by Crowe for Chapin, during his life, of a one-fourth interest in a mine. The case was tried by the district court without a jury, a jury having been waived by agreement of the parties, and that court made findings of fact and stated conclusions of law therefrom, upon which it rendered judgment in Crowe's favor, January 10, 1902, to be paid in due course of administration. From that judgment the case was carried by appeal to the supreme court of the territory of Arizona, which, March 20, 1903, reversed the judgment, and remanded the case to the district court, with directions to render judgment for defendant. 71 Pac. 965.\n The record states:\n'In the above-entitled action the supreme court finds the facts to be as follows:\n\n'1. Previous to March, 1899, a mine known as the Pride of the West mine was owned by three parties. A man named Olsen owned one half thereof, and Norman H. Chapin, the defendant's intestate, and Jerry Neville each owned one fourth interest therein.\n\n'In March, 1899, the plaintiff Crowe brought this mine to the attention of one Emerson Gee and his associate, A. R. Wilfley. Subsequently, in the latter part of March, 1899, Wilfley purchased Olsen's one-half interest, and made an agreement with Chapin and Neville, in pursuance whereof a deed to the remaining one-half interest was executed by Chapin and Neville, and placed in escrow, the terms of the escrow agreement providing that the deed was to be delivered to Wilfley upon the payment by him of the sum of $100,000 in cash, on or before the 1st day of April, 1900\n\n\n\n'2. It was verbally agreed between Crowe on the one part, and Chapin on the other, representing himself and Neville, that Crowe was to receive 10 per cent of the purchase money \n\n[204 U.S. 228, 230]\n\u00a0\n received by them for their interest in the mine, as commission for making the the sale. Such deed and escrow agreement were executed by Chapin and Neville on the 1st day of April, 1899.\n\n'3. Prior to the 1st day of April, 1900, Chapin and Neville both died.\n\n'M. M. Trickey was appointed administrator of Chapin's estate and one Henry H. Harmon was appointed administrator of Jerry Neville's estate.\n\n'Wilfley failed to pay the money and take the property under his option, and after the 1st day of April, 1900, at the expiration of the time mentioned in the escrow agreement, and in accordance with the terms thereof, the deed in escrow was returned to Trickey, the administrator of Chapin's estate.\n\n'4. Thereafter, and on the 7th day of April, 1900, upon the payment of $1,000 by Wilfley, the administrators of these two estates made another agreement with Wilfley, by the terms of which they agreed to execute a deed to a one-half interest owned by the two estates, upon the payment of the purchase price of $100,000, in specific amounts, on different dates therein expressed. This option also lapsed.\n\n'5. After said lapse, and on the 19th day of June, 1900, M. M. Trickey, as administrator of the estate of Chapin, entered into another agreement which was offered in evidence by the plaintiff, and appears in the bill of exceptions as 'Exhibit 3.'\n\n'By this agreement, Trickey, as administrator, gave to Wilfley an option to purchase chase the one-fourth interest in the mine owned by the estate of Chapin, and obligated himself to execute to Wilfley a deed for such interest upon the payment of $5,000 in cash, $5,000 within three months; the further sum of $5,000 within six months; the further sum of $5, 000 within nine months; the further sum of $5,000 within twelve months; and the further sum of $25,000 within eighteen months.\n\n'The plaintiff Crowe had nothing whatever to do with either of the last-mentioned options, or with the sale of the property after the death of Chapin. \n\n[204 U.S. 228, 231]\n\u00a0\n\n'6. In pursuance of this option, Wilfley paid to Trickey the sum of $ 5,000 in cash on the 19th day of June, 1900; and the following sums on the following dates, respectively: $5,000 on September 19, 1900; $5,000 on December 19, 1900; $5,000 on March 20, 1901; $5,000 on June 17, 1901; $25, 000 on December 7, 1901.\n\n\n'7. The above-mentioned agreement (Exhibit 3) was only an option to purchase, and under it there was no obligation on the part of Wilfley to pay any portion of the purchase price, and no obligation on the part of Trickey to deliver the deed mentioned in the agreement until the last payment of $25,000, in December, 1901, had been made.\n\n'8. On the 10th day of December, 1900, Crowe presented to Trickey, as administrator of Chapin's estate, in accordance with the law of the territory of Arizona, his claim against the estate of Chapin for '10 per cent of the purchase price of the Pride of the West mine, agreement for the sale of which was entered into about April 1st, 1899, and which said agreement of sale was made by Chapin and Neville to A. R. Wilfley, and which sale was brought about by the said George W. Crowe, upon the agreement that he was to receive 10 per cent commission upon said purchase price from said Chapin and Neville, one half of said 10 per cent being $5, 000.'\n\n'9. This claim was rejected by the administrator, and he thereupon brought this action in the district court of Santa Cruz county on the 25th day of January, 1901, at which time the estate of N. H. Chapin, deceased, was solvent, and amply able to pay all debts of the said estate, and the said Chapin nor the said Trickey nor anyone else had paid to the plaintiff the said sum of $5,000, or any part thereof, or anything on account thereof.\n\n'The case was tried before the court, without a jury, a jury having been by agreement of parties waived, and the court made the following findings of fact:\n\n [Here follow findings of fact and conclusions of law by the district court, upon which judgment was rendered in favor \n\n[204 U.S. 228, 232]\n\u00a0\n of the plaintiff, and an appeal prayed therefrom to the supreme court as stated.]\n'The only statements of fact in the record were contained in the foregoing findings of fact, and in a bill of exceptions. The said bill of exceptions, which was transmitted to the supreme court of Arizona with the record in this case, did not state that it contained all of the evidence which was introduced upon the trial of the case in the district court, nor upon the points presented to the Arizona supreme court for its decision, nor does it otherwise appear from the record in the case that all of the evidence which was introduced upon the trial of the case in the district court was before the said supreme court of Arizona. The abstract of the transcript which contained the evidence stated that 'the defendant, by his bill of exceptions, which contained all the evidence taken on said trial, and which is as follows:' then follows the bill of exceptions reciting the testimony of the different witnesses, covering some 23 pages, and at the conclusion thereof the following allowance:\n\n\"The foregoing bill of exceptions was presented to me for allowance on the 24th day of January, 1902, and was by me on the same date submitted to Messrs. Hereford & Hazzard, attorneys for the opposite party, who made no objection thereto, whereupon the said bill of exceptions is now by me signed, approved, and allowed as of the said 24th day of January, 1902. Geo. R. Davis, Judge;' but the record contains no certificate from the clerk or court that the evidence contained in the bill of exceptions constituted all of the evidence taken on the trial in the lower court, and that fact is controverted by the counsel for the appellee.\n\n'The Arizona supreme court found the following facts:\n\n'1. That the efforts of the plaintiff, Crowe, resulted in procuring the purchaser Wilfley not to purchase absolutely, but to take an option on the purchase of the property involved, for $100,000; that Crowe's principals accepted a deed to the property and placed it in escrow; that although Chapin died before the expiration of that escrow agreement, \n\n[204 U.S. 228, 233]\n\u00a0\n the deed executed by him remained subject to the order of the purchaser, and that, if he had availed himself of the terms of that agreement, the sale would have been completed and plaintiff Crowe would have been entitled to his commission; but that Wilfley failed to make the payment and take up the deed, and, after the expiration of the option and after Chapin's death, the deed was returned to the administrator of Chapin's estate and the transaction was closed without any sale being made.\n\n'2. That the sale of the property that was subsequently effected was the result of the negotiations between Trickey, the administrator of Chapin's estate, and Wilfley; that before the date of the sale, Crowe's power or authority to act in the matter had been terminated, and his agency revoked by the death of Chapin.\n\n'3. That in regard to the latter negotiations, Crowe rendered no services to Trickey, received no appointment or agreement from Trickey in reference to the matter, and took no part whatever in the ultimate sale.\n\n'4. That the plaintiff, Crowe, did not, between the 8th day of February, 1898, and the 11th day of January, 1900, bring about a sale of Chapin's interest in the property in controversy.\n\n'5. The said A. R. Wilfley paid to the said defendant the sum of $50, 000, as follows; April 7, 1900, $500; June 19, 1900, $4,500; September 19, 1900, $5,000; December 19, 1900, $5,000; March 20, 1901, $5,000: June 17, 1901, $5,000; December 7, 1901, $25,000, not for the right, title, and interest of the said Norman H. Chapin, but for the 'right, title, and interest of the said estate of Norman H. Chapin, deceased, in and to' the said property, in compliance with the terms of the contract of sale and title bond executed to the said Wilfley by Trickey, the administrator of said estate.'\n\n [Here follow conclusions of law and judgment.] \n\n[204 U.S. 228, 234]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. W. C. Keegin, Seth E. Hazzard, and F. H. Hereford for appellant.\n\n Mr. Eugene S. Ives for appellee.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n The supreme court of the territory was called upon to make a statement of the facts of the case in the nature of a special verdict, and also the rulings of the court in the admission or rejection of evidence when excepted to. Our \n\n[204 U.S. 228, 235]\n\u00a0\n jurisdiction is limited to the consideration of such exceptions and to determining whether the findings of fact support the judgment. Harrison v. Perea, \n168 U.S. 311\n, 42 L. ed. 478, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 129; Young v. Amy, \n171 U.S. 179\n, 43 L. ed. 127, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 802.\n The statement of facts required by the statute should present clearly and precisely the ultimate facts. And while it may be objected to the statement in this case that it does not properly comply with that rule, for it is quite confused and gives a mass of unnecessary details, yet we think the imperfections in that regard should not be held fatal, as a sufficient statement finally emerges. This will be understood by reference to the statement itself, which we have set forth for that purpose.\n The bill of exceptions contains some minor rulings on questions propounded to witnesses, but the exceptions thereto were not insisted upon in the supreme court nor considered by that tribunal, so that the question before us is whether the findings of fact support the judgment.\n But several of the errors assigned are to the effect that the supreme court erred in considering or determining the case upon questions of fact, because the bill of exceptions failed to state that it contained all of the evidence given in the case, and the record failed 'to show that the bill of exceptions contains all of the evidence given in the case, or all of the evidence bearing upon the questions involved in the decision' of the court.\n The supreme court proceeded upon the record as containing all the evidence, and we are not inclined to hold that the contention that it should not have done so is open to our consideration under the limitations of the statute. But, be that as it may, we think the record shows that all the evidence was contained in the bill of exceptions, and that that is sufficient, even though the bill itself did not so state in express terms. Gunnison County v. E. H. Rollins & Sons, \n173 U.S. 255\n, 43 L. ed. 689, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 390.\n Paragraphs 1485 and 1582 of the Revised Statutes of Arizona, 1901 (pp. 461, 474), provide: \n\n[204 U.S. 228, 236]\n\u00a0\n 'Every paper filed in a case shall constitute a part of the record of the case, including depositions and all written evidence and exhibits offered or admitted in evidence; and no papers thus filed or admitted in evidence, or offered in evidence and rejected by the court, need be incorporated in a statement of facts in order to make it a part of the record.'\n'On taking an appeal . . . the appellant . . . shall cause to be filed in the supreme court . . . the original record of the case, together with a copy of all minute entries made in the case, the same to be certified to by the clerk of the district court, with the seal of the court affixed, that it contains a true copy of all minute entries made in the case, and that the papers thereunto attached are all the papers constituting the record of the case. . . .'\n\n The clerk accordingly transmitted to the supreme court all of the original records and copies of the minute entries. The case coming on for hearing, the minute entries state:\n'The trial then proceeded upon the pleadings herein, in the presence of and before the court sitting without a jury, a jury having been expressly waived in open court by both parties hereto, and the plaintiff, to maintain upon his part the issues herein, introduced certain documentary evidence, and also called as a witness the following named person, to wit, George W. Crowe, the plaintiff, who was duly sworn, examined, and cross-examined, and thereupon the plaintiff rested his case. The defendant then, to maintain upon his part the issues herein, called as a witness the following named person, to wit, M. M. Trickey, who was duly sworn, examined, and cross-examined, and thereupon the defendant rested his case. The evidence being now adduced and the case closed, arguments of the respective counsel followed, and the cause being now fully submitted, the same was, by the court, taken under advisement.'\n\n The evidence of two witnesses, Wilfley and Gee, was taken by deposition, and their depositions were sent up in the transcript. The minute entries show that only two witnesses, \n\n[204 U.S. 228, 237]\n\u00a0\n Crowe and Trickey, administrator, were examined before the court, and their testimony is given in narrative form in the bill of exceptions, as well as the testimony of Wilfley and Gee. The minute entries, in speaking of the introduction of 'documentary evidence,' were manifestly intended to embrace depositions in that term. There is no room for presuming that any evidence was omitted, and the points to which the evidence adduced was addressed preclude such a suggestion.\n We are brought, then, to the question of the sufficiency of the facts found to support the judgment. The findings may be summarized as follows:\n Chapin and Neville each owned one fourth of the mine, and on April 1, 1899, signed a paper addressed to the Consolidated National Bank of Tuscon, Arizona, which is contained in the bill of exceptions, and, by reference, in the statement of facts, and was couched in these terms:\n Gentlemen: The enclosed deed from N. H. Chapin, Marie Chapin, Jerry Neville, and Refugia Neville, parties of the first part, to Arthur R. Wilfley, party of the second part, is to be delivered to the said Arthur R. Wilfley upon the payment of the sum of $100,000 at or before the expiration of one year from the date hereof.\n And you are further directed that all moneys sent you from time to time by the said Arthur R. Wilfley, with instructions to apply the same to the payment of the aforesaid purchase money, shall be so applied and the same placed to the credit of N. H. Chapin and Jerry Neville.\n Therefore, if the said Arthur R. Wilfley shall pay or cause to be paid the sum of money above mentioned, at or before the time aforesaid, you will then deliver the said deed to the said A. R. Wilfley, his agent or assigns. Otherwise the said deed is to be held subject to the order of the said N. H. Chapin and Jerry Neville.\n Dated Washington, Arizona, April 1st, 1899.\n This paper and the deed therein mentioned were deposited in escrow in the bank on that day. \n\n[204 U.S. 228, 238]\n\u00a0\n The terms of the transaction had been arranged the latter part of March, and it was verbally agreed that Crowe should receive 10 per cent commission on the purchase money received by Chapin and Neville.\n Chapin died January 11, 1900, and Trickey was appointed administrator February 8, 1900, and qualified as such. Neville died January 3, 1900, and Harmon was appointed administrator and qualified as such.\n Wilfley failed to pay the money and take the property, and after the expiration of the time mentioned in the escrow agreement the deed in escrow was returned to Trickey, administrator.\n On April 7, 1900, the administrators of the two estates made an agreement with Wilfley to execute a deed to the half interest on payment of $100,000, in amounts prescribed. This option also expired. Thereafter, and on the 19th of June, 1900, Trickey, as administrator of the estate of Chapin, entered into an agreement with Wilfley to convey to him the right, title, and interest of the estate of Chapin in the mining property ( described as a quarter interest), on payment of $50,000, in designated amounts, and these payments were subsequently made.\n Crowe had nothing whatever to do with either of the last-mentioned options, or with the sale of the property after the death of Chapin.\n And the claim he presented to Trickey as administrator of Chapin's estate was for $5,000, being one half of the commission agreed to be paid to him in March, 1899, on the purchase price which would have been received by Chapin and Neville if the option of April 1, 1899, had been carried out.\n In these circumstances we concur in the judgment of the supreme court of the territory.\n In McGavock v. Woodlief, 20 How. 221, 15 L. ed. 884, it was laid down that in order to be entitled to commission 'the broker must complete to sale; that is, he must find a purchaser in a situation and ready and willing to complete the purchase on the terms agreed on.' But this rule is inapplicable when the \n\n[204 U.S. 228, 239]\n\u00a0\n owner refuses, without sufficient reasons, to fulfil the agreement which the agent has made. Kock v. Emmerling, 22 How. 69, 16 L. ed. 292. Even though he could not have been compelled to carry out his contract if he had chosen to set up the statute of frauds. Holden v. Starks, 150 Mass. 503, 38 Am. St. Rep. 451, 34 N. E. 1069. Or when the agent's authority is revoked in bad faith before the completion of the sale. Sibbald v. Bethlehem Iron Co. 83 N. Y. 378, 38 Am. Rep. 441. In this case the subject was much considered, and Finch, J., in delivering the opinion of the court, said, among other things:\n'It follows, as a necessary deduction from the established rule, that a broker is never entitled to commissions for unsuccessful efforts. . . . The broker may devote his time and labor, and expend his money with ever so much of devotion to the interests of his employer, and yet if he fails,- if, without effecting an agreement or accomplishing a bargain, he abandons the effort, or his authority is fairly and in good faith terminated, -he gains no right to commissions . . . And, in such event, it matters not that, after his failure and the termination of his agency, what he has done proves of use and benefit to the principal. . . . He may have introduced to each other parties who otherwise would have never met; he may have created impressions which, under later and more favorable circumstances, naturally lead to, and materially assist in, the consummation of a sale. . . . This, however, must be taken with one important and necessary limitation. If the efforts of the broker are rendered a failure by the fault of the employer; if capriciously he changes his mind after the purchaser, ready and willing and consenting to the prescribed terms, is produced; or if the latter declines to complete the contract because of some defect of title in the ownership of the seller, -some unremoved encumbrance; some defect which is the fault of the latter,-then the broker does not lose his commissions. . . . One other principle applicable to such a contract as existed in the present case needs to be kept in view. Where no time for the continuance of the contract is fixed, by its terms, either party is at liberty to terminate it at will, subject only to the ordinary requirements of good faith. \n\n[204 U.S. 228, 240]\n\u00a0\n Usually the broker is entitled to a fair and reasonable opportunity to perform his obligation, subject, of course, to the right of the seller to sell independently. But, that having been granted him, the right of the principal to terminate his authority is absolute and unrestricted, except only that he may not do it in bad faith, and as a mere device to escape the payment of the broker's commissions. . . .\n\n'If, after the broker has been allowed a reasonable time within which to produce a buyer and effect a sale, he has failed to do so, and the seller in good faith and fairly has terminated the agency and sought other assistance by the aid of which a sale is consummated, it does not give the original broker a right to commissions because the purchaser is one whom he introduced, and the final sale is in some degree aided or helped forward by his previous unsuccessful efforts.'\n\n In the present case what Crowe had obtained was not an absolute contract of purchase, but an option on the purchase.\n The deaths of Chapin and Neville terminated the authority of Crowe to sell on commission, which was not a power coupled with an interest, that is, an interest in the property on which the power was to operate. Hunt v. Rousmanier, 8 Wheat. 174, 5 L. ed. 589; Missouri ex rel. Walker v. Walker, \n125 U.S. 339\n, 31 L. ed. 769, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 929.\n Nevertheless, up to the first of April, 1900, if Wilfley had availed himself of the terms of the escrow agreement, the sale might have been completed and Crowe have been entitled to his commission; but Wilfley did not do so, and the deed held in escrow was returned in accordance with the terms of that agreement.\n There is no legal basis for the imputation of bad faith, and it is not pretended that Crowe was employed by Trickey or rendered any service to him in the matter of the sale. The bare fact that what he had done in the former negotiations may have contributed to the accomplishment of the sale by Trickey is not enough to sustain his claim for the commission sued for.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","45":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCUNNINGHAM v. SPRINGER(1907)\nNo. 146\nArgued: January 10, 1907Decided: February 25, 1907\n\n\n The plaintiffs brought an action in the district court in the territory of New Mexico, in which they sought to recover $75,000 as the reasonable value of the services of the plaintiff Jones, as an attorney at law, rendered to the defendants at their request. For answer the defendants pleaded a general denial and payment. The jury returned a verdict for the defendants. The plaintiffs alleged exceptions to certain rulings of the judge who presided at the trial, which were overruled by the supreme court of the territory, and are here \n\n[204 U.S. 647, 648]\n\u00a0\n upon writ of error to that court. The exceptions are stated in the opinion.\n Mr. Neill B. Field for plaintiffs in error. \n\n[204 U.S. 647, 649]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Charles A. Spiess, Thomas B. Catron, Aldis B. Browne, and Alexander Britton for defendants in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Moody:\n\n\n[204 U.S. 647, 651]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Moody delivered the opinion of the court:\n The plaintiff Jones was engaged as an attorney at law by the defendants, in an action of ejectment to recover certain lands from one of the defendants, in which the other defendant had an interest. Under his employment Jones rendered services in the preparation and trial of the case in the district and supreme courts of the territory of New Mexico and in the Supreme Court of the United States. The plaintiffs brought this action to recover the reasonable value of Jones's services. The defendants, admitting the employment and the services, contended that they were rendered under a special contract, whereby Jones agreed to accept $500 in full payment for the entire litigation, and that payment was made in conformity with the agreement. The plaintiffs, admitting that a payment of $ 500 was made to and accepted by Jones, contended that it was made and accepted in pursuance of an agreement to accept that sum as full payment for the service to be rendered in the first trial of the case in \n\n[204 U.S. 647, 652]\n\u00a0\n the district and supreme courts of the territory, and did not cover the services in this court, or in the subsequent proceedings in the courts of the territory, for which they claimed the sum of $75,000 as a reasonable compensation. The parties introduced evidence in support of their respective contentions. The jury returned a verdict for the defendants. Exceptions to the rulings and instructions of the court are presented here for consideration.\n Both parties offered testimony of witnesses, who qualified as experts, as to the value of Jones' services, and their estimates ranged from $2,000 to $125,000. Three witnesses called by the defendants on this branch of the case, after testifying to their qualifications and their knowledge of the course of the litigation in which Jones was employed, gave their opinion of the value of Jones's services on the assumption that his fee was not fixed by contract. No objection was made to the testimony at the time it was given, but, it appearing upon cross-examination that each witness assumed in his own mind some value of the land in dispute in the litigation in which Jones was employed, counsel for the plaintiffs, without asking what that value was, in the case of each witness, at the conclusion of his testimony, moved to strike it out, because it was based upon an assumption of the value of the land in controversy in the original case, which was not disclosed to the jury and not based upon the evidence in the case on trial. To the refusal of the court to strike out the testimony the plaintiffs excepted.\n These three exceptions do not materially differ, and may, therefore, by considered together. They illustrate the importance of a strict application of the principle that the excepting party should make it manifest that an error prejudicial to him has occurred in the trial in order to justify an appellate court in disturbing the verdict. The witnesses were testifying in chief in response to hypothetical questions which do not appear in the record. The plaintiffs had the right to the fullest cross-examination for the purpose of determining their competency \n\n[204 U.S. 647, 653]\n\u00a0\n and affecting the weight of their testimony. If there was in the mind of either of the witnesses an assumption of fact not fairly presented by the evidence, or one which the jury might regard as improbable, it might have been elicited upon cross-examination, and the testimony then excluded or discredited accordingly. This course was not pursued by counsel, who preferred to obtain the benefit of an exception. To say the least, it is difficult to detect any error in the rulings. But, assuming, without deciding or intimating, that there was error in the refusal of the court to strike out the testimony of these witnesses, the error was not prejudicial to the plaintiffs, because, by the course of the trial, this branch of the case became entirely immaterial. The defendants' contention was that Jones was employed under a contract by which he agreed to give his services throughout the entire litigation for $500, and that he had been paid in accordance with the terms of the contract. The plaintiffs' contention was that he agreed upon $500 as his compensation for the trial of the case in the district court and the supreme court of the territory, and that for all subsequent services he was entitled to be paid a reasonable compensation. In the charge to the jury these conflicting contentions were clearly submitted for determination. The jury were instructed that if, as the defendants asserted, Jones had agreed to give his services throughout the entire litigation for $500, and that that $500 had been paid to him, that the verdict should be for the defendants. The jury were instructed, on the other hand, that, if the contract between the parties was as asserted by the plaintiffs, the jury should find for the plaintiffs whatever part of the $500 remained unpaid and, in addition thereto, the reasonable value of the services Jones rendered in the subsequent proceedings. In other words, the jury were instructed that, only in the case Jones agreed to give his services throughout the entire litigation for $500, which had been paid, there should be a verdict for the defendants; otherwise there should be a verdict for the plaintiffs in a sum to be fixed by the jury. The jury did return a verdict \n\n[204 U.S. 647, 654]\n\u00a0\n for the defendants. The verdict, therefore, affirmed the defendants' version of the contract and thereby rendered all of the testimony as to the value of Jones's services immaterial. The plaintiffs however, urged in argument before us that the evidence of the value of Jones's services was competent not only as fixing the amount which he might recover in case his version of the contract should be found by the jury to be true, but also in the settlement of the dispute as to the terms of the contract between the parties, upon the theory that if the services of Jones were reasonably worth a far larger sum than $500, that fact would have some tendency to show that he did not agree to render them for $500. However this may be, the testimony on the value of the services was not admitted for any such purpose. Each witness testified upon the assumption that the compensation was not fixed by contract, and it was upon that assumption alone that the testimony was submitted for the consideration of the jury. It was not admitted for the purpose of determining the dispute between the parties as to the terms of the contract. Moreover, in submitting that testimony to the jury under instructions which were clear and adequate, the judge who presided at the trial limited it to the purposes for which it was admitted, and instructed the jury that if they believed from the evidence that the contract was that Jones should give his services throughout the entire litigation for $500, then the jury 'should not consider the evidence of the various attorneys who have testified to the reasonable value of the services of the said Jones, but should disregard the same, for the reason that the contract has limited and fixed the amount to which said Jones is entitled.' To the admission of the evidence for this limited purpose, to the instructions of the judge thus limiting it and directing that it should be disregarded if the jury found the defendants' version of the contract to be true, the plaintiffs did not object. It is too late now to claim that it might have been admissible for a broader purpose. There is, therefore, presented a case of evidence admitted and used solely upon an \n\n[204 U.S. 647, 655]\n\u00a0\n issue which has become immaterial by the verdict of the jury. Any errors, therefore, if such there were, in admitting the evidence, became immaterial. Greenleaf v. Birth, 5 Pet. 132, 8 L. ed. 72; Brobst v. Brock ( Doe ex dem. Brobst v. Roe) 10 Wall. 526, 19 L. ed. 1002; Poland v. Brownell, 131 Mass. 138, 41 Am. Rep. 215; Sullivan v. Lowell & D. Street R. Co. 162 Mass. 536, 39 N. E. 185; Oak Island Hotel Co. v.

For these reasons the three foregoing exceptions should be overruled.\n The thirteenth instruction to the jury was as follows:\n'In this case the burden of proof is upon the plaintiffs as to every material fact, except that of payment, as to which fact the burden of proof is upon the defendants. In order to entitle the plaintiffs to recover in this case, they must establish every such material fact, with the exception aforesaid, by a preponderance of the evidence; and if you find that the evidence bearing upon the plaintiffs' case is evenly balanced, or that it preponderates in favor of the defendant, then the plaintiffs cannot recover, and you shall find for the defendants.'\n\n To this instruction the plaintiffs excepted. Thereupon the judge said to the jury:\n'In the thirteenth instruction given you by the court, in which I spoke about the burden of proof, I have concluded to modify that instruction by striking out the words material fact in the second line and inserting in lieu thereof the word issue; and also in same line the word fact and insert in lieu the word issue, and in the fifth line strike out the words material fact and put in the word issue,-so the instruction will read, gentlemen, as follows:\n\n\"In this case the burden of proof is on the plaintiffs as to every issue, except that of payment, as to which issue the burden of proof is upon the defendants. In order to entitle the plaintiffs to recover in this case they must establish every such \n\n[204 U.S. 647, 656]\n\u00a0\n issue, with the exception aforesaid, by a preponderance of the evidence; and if you find that the evidence bearing upon the plaintiffs' case is evenly balanced, or that it preponderates in favor of the defendants, then the plaintiffs cannot recover, and you should find for the defendants.'\n\n'Now, gentlemen, I will withdraw instruction No. thirteen given to you before, and insert and give this amended instruction instead.'\n\n The court read the foregoing amended instruction from a carbon copy of the original charge, in which the words above mentioned as stricken out were crossed out with a pencil, and the words mentioned as having been inserted were written in with a pencil. After the foregoing amended instruction was read to the jury, the counsel for the plaintiffs said to the court:\n'As thus modified I think the charge is absolutely without objection, if the court please.'\n\n The exception, therefore, was abandoned in open court, but it is argued that reversible error appears in the record because it goes on to say:\n'The amendment to the thirteenth instruction by the court to the jury as thus made was also taken down by the court's stenographer and transcribed by the said stenographer from his notes of the proceedings of the trial and attached to the original charge on file, after the verdict of the jury had been returned.'\n\n In support of this contention it was said that by  2922 of the statute of New Mexico 'all instructions to the jury must be in writing;' and that, by  3002, 'the jury, when it retires, shall be allowed to take the pleadings in the case, instructions of the court, and any instruments in writing admitted as evidence,' and urged that either the record shows that the amended instruction in writing was not taken to the jury room, and therefore the plaintiff is entitled to claim this failure as an error, although it was not alleged at the time of the occurrence, or that, by the failure of the court \n\n[204 U.S. 647, 657]\n\u00a0\n to send the amended instruction to the jury, the plaintiff is entitled to the benefit of the original exception which was abandoned in open court. Whatever merit this contention may have rests upon the assumption that the amended instruction was not taken by the jury when it retired. We do not know whether it was so taken or not. It is enough to say that the record does not affirmatively disclose that the judge failed to give the written amendment to the jury when it retired. If the plaintiffs' counsel did not discover at the time that the instructions were not taken by the jury, in accordance with the terms of the statute, it is too much to expect this court to conjecture that they were not taken, in the absence of any such statement in the record. Grove v. Kansas City, 75 Mo. 672.\n An exception is alleged to the refusal of the court to give the following instruction:\n'If the jury believes from the evidence that the plaintiff A. A. Jones agreed with the defendant Charles Springer to defend the case of the Maxwell Land Grant Co. v. Dawson, for a fee of $500, and that thereafter and before the rendition of all the services agreed to be rendered by said Jones in said cause, the said Springer said to the said Jones, 'You cannot be expected to attend to this business for any $500; go on with the case, and we will see how we come out, and after it is all over, you will be paid what is right,' or words to that effect, and such proposition was accepted and acted on by said Jones, then the plaintiffs in this case are entitled to recover for the services of said Jones in said case whatever the same may be reasonably worth, as shown by the evidence in this case.'\n\n But the instruction requested was substantially as given by the court in instructions 5 and 8, which are as follows:\n'Plaintiffs claim, however, that the original contract in relation to the services of A. A. Jones was modified by a subsequent agreement made with the defendant Charles Springer to the effect that his compensation was not to be limited to \n\n[204 U.S. 647, 658]\n\u00a0\n the $500 originally fixed, but that he was to go on with the litigation, see how it came out, and then Charles Springer would do what was right, and after the property should be sold he would pay said Jones a big cash fee.\n\n'(8) If the jury believes from the evidence that the original contract in relation to Mr. Jones's compensation was afterward modified so that such compensation was not to be the $500 agreed upon, then you should find for the plaintiffs in such sum as you believe from the evidence to be the reasonable value for the services of Jones, less whatever sum may have been paid thereon.'\n\n The plaintiff excepted to the refusal of the court to instruct the jury as follows:\n'The court instructs the jury that the credibility of the witnesses is a question exclusively for the jury; and the law is that where two witnesses testify directly opposite to each other, the jury are not bound to regard the weight of the evidence as evenly balanced. The jury have a right to determine from the appearance of the witnesses on the stand, their manner of testifying, their apparent candor and fairness, their apparent intelligence or the lack of intelligence, and from all of the other surrounding circumstances appearing on the trial, which witness is the more worthy of credit, and to give credit accordingly.'\n\n But, so far as the plaintiffs were entitled to this instruction, it was given to the jury by instruction 14. A judge is not bound to charge the jury in the exact words proposed to him by counsel. The form of expression may be his own. If he instructs the jury correctly and in substance covers the relevant rules of law proposed to him by counsel, there is no error in refusing to adopt the exact words of the request.

U.S.(1907)\nNo. 220\nArgued: March 1, 1907Decided: March 25, 1907\n\n\n\n Messrs. Charles E. Kremer and Hermon A. Kelley for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[205 U.S. 187, 188]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General Purdy for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[205 U.S. 187, 189]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n On April 1, 1902, the United States commenced this action in the circuit court of the United States for the district of Minnesota to recover for injuries charged to have been done through the negligence of the Davidson Steamship Company to a government breakwater at Two Harbors, Lake Superior. The defendant answered, denying the negligence, and alleging that the result was due to the negligence of the government, the plaintiff. No question was made as to the amount of the injury. Trial was had before a jury, which returned a verdict for the government. Judgment thereon was entered by the circuit court. This judgment was affirmed by the circuit court of appeals for the eighth circuit (73 C. C. A. 425), and from that court brought here on writ of error.\n In a general way, the facts are that on the night of July 24, 1901, the steamer Shenandoah, the property of the steamship company, ran into the government breakwater at Two Harbors, Minnesota. Agate bay, Lake Superior, is the harbor of the village of Two Harbors, and is an open bay, across the mouth of which there are breakwaters extending from either shore, running in an easterly and westerly direction, and leaving an open space as an entrance to the iron ore and other docks in the bay. The breakwater extending from the easterly side had been constructed for a number of years, extending into the bay for a distance of about 750 feet, and its outer end indicated in the nighttime by a fixed, large red light, 15 or 20 feet high. In 1899 the government projected an extension of this breakwater of about 300 feet in length, and at an angle of 45 degrees from the original breakwater. At the time of the injury this extension, composed of wooden cribs filled with stone, had been carried to its full length, but not built up to its intended height, and, in fact, rising only a few inches above the surface of the water. On the extreme outward end of the new extension was a mast or pole about 12 feet \n\n[205 U.S. 187, 190]\n\u00a0\n high, and on it was hung an ordinary white light or lantern. The original fixed red light on the old breakwater had been moved back some 30 feet, in order that the new work could be properly joined to the old.\n On the evening named the Shenandoah loaded a cargo of iron ore at Superior, Wisconsin, and proceeded to Two Harbors, to take in tow a barge that was being loaded there. When the vessel left Superior the night was dark and stormy and the sky covered with clouds, with a heavy wind blowing from the northeast, making a high sea. Arriving off Two Harbors at about 11 o'clock, the steamer headed for the entrance, intending to enter port, as she had formerly done, close to the easterly breakwater. When she had approached within about 200 feet the surf was seen breaking over the extension of the breakwater. Her engines were promptly stopped and reversed, but, notwithstanding this, she struck this extension about 125 feet from the fixed red light, and did considerable damage to it, but without injury to herself. The port of Two Harbors is on the north side of Lake Superior, about 27 miles from Duluth, and one of the most important iron ore loading points on the Great Lakes.\n Now, whether the injury was the result of negligence, and which party was guilty, of negligence, are questions of fact properly determinable by a jury. These questions are the only ones discussed by counsel for the steamship comapny, and therefore to them alone we direct our attention. It is true in the assignment of errors some other matters are named, but they are not called to our attention in brief or argument, and an examination of them shows that very properly counsel for the steamship company considered them not sufficiently important to justify any discussion.\n It is well, before noticing the testimony, to consider the extent to which our inquiry may properly go. The settled rule is that where negligence is a mere question of fact, and nothing appears which is negligence per se, the determination \n\n[205 U.S. 187, 191]\n\u00a0\n of the question is peculiarly the province of a jury, and its conclusions will not be disturbed unless it is entirely clear that they were erroneous. Courts do not approach the question as an original one, and consider whether, in their judgment, the testimony does or does not prove negligence, but accept the determination of the jury, if there is any evidence upon which it can be rested. This is the general rule in respect to all mere questions of fact. Authorities in this court, as well as in others, are abundant and clear on this point. It is sufficient to refer to one or two.\n Sioux City & P. R. Co. v. Stout, 17 Wall. 657, 21 L. ed. 745, was an action to recover damages in behalf of a boy, six years of age, for injuries sustained upon a turntable belonging to the railroad company. This turntable was in an open space, about 80 rods from the company's depot, in a village of from 100 to 150 persons. The railroad ground was not inclosed or visibly separated from the adjoining property, and was about three quarters of a mile distant from the house of the child's parents. The boy, with two older boys, went to the turntable and commenced playing on it. It was not attended or guarded by any servant of the company. It was not fastened or locked, and revolved easily on its axis. While so playing he was injured. The jury found the company guilty of negligence. In affirming the judgment this proposition was stated (664, L. ed. 749):\n'It is this class of cases and those akin to it that the law commits to the decision of a jury. Twelve men of the average of the community, comprising men of education and men of little education, men of learning and men whose learning consists only in what they have themselves seen and heard,-the merchant, the mechanic, the farmer, the laborer,-these sit together, consult, apply their separate experience of the affairs of life to the facts proven, and draw a unanimous conclusion. This average judgment thus given it is the great effort of the law to obtain. It is assumed that twelve men know more of the common affairs of life than does one man, that they \n\n[205 U.S. 187, 192]\n\u00a0\n can draw wiser and safer conclusions from admitted facts thus occurring than can a single judge.'\n\n In New York C. & H. R. R. Co. v. Fraloff, \n100 \nU.S. 24, 31\n, 25 S. L. ed. 531, 534, one question was as to the value of property for which the company was responsible. Sustaining a judgment against it, we said:\n'If the jury acted upon a gross mistake of facts, or were governed by some improper influence or bias, the remedy therefor rested with the court below, under its general power to set aside the verdict. But that court, finding that the verdict was abundantly sustained by the evidence, and that there was no ground to suppose that the jury had not performed their duty impartially and justly, refused to disturb the verdict, and overruled a motion for new trial. Whether its action in that particular was erroneous or not, our power is restricted by the Constitution to the determination of the questions of law arising upon the record. Our authority does not extend to a re-examination of facts which have been tried by the jury under instructions correctly defining the legal rights of parties. Parsons v. Bedford, 3 Pet. 446, 7 L. ed. 736; Barreda v. Silsbee, 21 How. 167, 16 L. ed. 93; Mercantile Mut. Ins. Co. v. Folsom, is Wall. 249, 21 L. ed. 833.'\n\n In Dunlap v. Northeastern R.

Rep. 647, 648, this was the ruling:\n'The circuit court erred in not submitting the question of contributory negligence to the jury, as the conclusion did not follow, as matter of law, that no recovery could be had upon any view which could be properly taken of the facts the evidence tended to establish. Kane v. Northern C. R. Co. \n128 U.S. 91\n, 32 L. ed. 339, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 16; Jones v. East Tennessee, V. &G. R. Co. \n128 U.S. 443\n, 32 L. ed. 478, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 118.'\n\n In Richmond & D. R.

Rep. 748, 749, the jury having found the railroad company guilty of negligence, we sustained the verdict and judgment, saying:\n'It is well settled that where there is uncertainty as to the existence of either negligence or contributory negligence, the question is not one of law, but of fact, and to be settled by a \n\n[205 U.S. 187, 193]\n\u00a0\n jury; and this, whether the uncertainty arises from a conflict in the testimony, or because the facts, being undisputed, fair-minded men will honestly draw different conclusions from them. Sioux City & P. R. Co. v. Stout, supra; Washington & G. R. Co. v. McDade, \n135 U.S. 554\n, 34 L. ed. 235, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1044; Delaware, L. & W. R. Co. v. Converse, \n139 U.S. 469\n, 35 L. ed. 213, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 569.'\n\n From these authorities, and many more of a kindred nature could be cited, it is obvious that the question for us to consider is whether there was testimony from which the jury might rightfully find the defendant guilty of negligence. It appears that the captain of the steamship had been for many years on the lakes, and that he was acting as pilot of the ship at the time of the collision. The harbor was one of great importance, although he had not been in it for over a year. He knew that harbor improvements on the Great Lakes were being made by the government, that information of the condition of those improvements was given from time to time by circulars from the Departments, and still made no efforts to ascertain the then condition of the harbor, the only chart he had being an old one. In addition to the fact that he knew where information could be obtained, might have assumed that he would be likely to be sent to any one of the many important harbors, and ought to have prepared himself therefor, there was testimony that official circulars and notices were mailed to him at his postoffice address, although he states that he failed to receive them, and relied upon the knowledge which he had from his visit of more than a year theretofore, and upon what he should find as he entered the harbor. Now there is an obligation on all persons to take the care which, under ordinary circumstances of the case, a reasonable and prudent man would take, and the omission of that care constitutes negligence. It was said by Mr. Justice McLean, delivering the opinion in Culbertson v. The Southern Belle, 18 How. 584, 587, 15 L. ed. 493, 495:\n'When a steamer is about to enter a harbor great caution is required. There being no usage as to an open way, the \n\n[205 U.S. 187, 194]\n\u00a0\n vigilance is thrown upon the entering vessel. Ordinary care, under such circumstances, will not excuse a steamer for a wrong done.'\n\n In Atlee v. Northwestern Union Packet Co. 21 Wall. 389, 396, 22 L. ed. 619, 621, Mr. Justice Miller, commenting on the duty of a pilot of a river steamer, makes these observations:\n'But the pilot of a river steamer, like the harbor pilot, is selected for his personal knowledge of the topography through which he steers his vessel. In the long course of a thousand miles in one of these rivers, he must be familiar with the appearance of the shore on each side of the river as he goes along. Its banks, towns, its landings, its houses and trees, and its openings between trees, are all landmarks by which he steers his vessel. The compass is of little use to him. He must know where the navigable channel is, in its relation to all these external objects, especially in the night. He must also be familiar with all dangers that are permanently located in the course of the river, as sand bars, snags, sunken rocks or trees, or abandoned vessels or barges. All this he must know and remember and avoid. To do this he must be constantly informed of changes in the current of the river, of sand bars newly made, of logs, or snags, or other objects newly presented, against which his vessel might be injured. In the active life and changes made by the hand of man or the action of the elements in the path of his vessel, a year's absence from the scene impairs his capacity, his skilled knowledge, very seriously in the course of a long voyage.'\n\n It would not be strange if the jury found that a captain engaged in the navigation of the waters of Lake Superior was guilty of negligence in not keeping himself informed of changes going on from time to time in the different harbors which he was likely to be called upon to visit. His very want of knowledge, when he had the means of ascertaining the facts, could properly be regarded as negligence. Clearly, it could not be held as matter of law not to be so.\n It is true he was apparently misled by the lights on the \n\n[205 U.S. 187, 195]\n\u00a0\n breakwater, and we do not mean to intimate that there was no evidence from which the jury would have been warranted in finding that the government was guilty of negligence in the way in which it left those lights. But no omission or negligence on the part of the government avoids the fact that there was testimony from which the jury was justified in finding the captain guilty of negligence, and for that negligence the steamship company was responsible. The jury might have thought that if he had kept himself properly informed in reference to the condition of that as of other important harbors he would not have been misled by the condition of the lights. At any rate, the verdict of the jury was against the contention of contributory negligence on the part of the government, and the jury was the tribunal to determine this, as well as the question of negligence. We could not set aside the verdict of the jury, approved as it was by the trial court and the court of appeals, without ourselves exercising the function of triers of fact, when, under the law, such questions are committed to the determination of a jury.\n The judgment is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","47":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDELAMATER v. STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA(1907)\nNo. 149\nArgued: Decided: March 11, 1907\n\n\n\n\n[205 U.S. 93, 94]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Herbert Jackson for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Aubrey Lawrence, S. M. Howard, and Philo Hall for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[205 U.S. 93, 96]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n A firm established in St. Paul, Minnesota, which was engaged in dealing in intoxicating liquors, employed Delamater, the plaintiff in error, as a traveling salesman. As such salesman Delamater, in the state of South Dakota, carried on the business of soliciting orders from residents of that state for the purchase, from the firm in St. Paul, of intoxicating liquors in quantities of less than 5 gallons. The course of dealing was this: The orders were procured in the form of proposals to buy, and when accepted by the firm the liquor was shipped from St. Paul to the persons in South Dakota who made the proposals, at their risk and cost, on sixty days' credit. At the time Delamater engaged in South Dakota in the business just stated the law of that state imposed an annual license charge upon 'the business of selling or offering for sale' intoxicating liquors within the state, 'by any traveling salesman who solicits orders by the jug or bottle in lots less than 5 gallons.' A violation of the statute was made a misdemeanor punishable by fine or imprisonment, or both, in the discretion of the court. Delamater, not having paid the license charge, was prosecuted under the statute. At the trial, although the uncontradicted proof established the carrying on of business within the state, as above mentioned, Delamater requested a binding instruction to the jury in his favor, on the ground that the statute did not apply, \n\n[205 U.S. 93, 97]\n\u00a0\n and if it did, that it was void because repugnant to the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States. Exception was taken to the refusal to give the instruction. The Federal ground was reiterated in motions to arrest and for a new trial, and the supreme court of the state, to which the cause was taken, in affirming the judgment of conviction, expressly considered and disposed of such Federal ground. 104 N. W. 537.\n All the assignments of error involve the proposition that the state statute, as construed and applied by the court below, is repugnant to the commerce clause of the Constitution. It is manifest, as the subject dealt with is intoxicating liquors, that the decision of the cause does not require us to determine whether the restraints which the statute imposes would be a direct burden on interstate commerce if generally applied to subjects of such commerce, but only to decide whether such restraints are a direct burden on interstate commerce in intoxicating liquors as regulated by Congress in the act commonly known as the Wilson act. 26 Stat. at L. 313, chap. 728, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3177. For this reason we at once put out of view decisions of this court, which are referred to in argument and which are noted in the margin,1 because they concerned only the power of a state to deal with articles of interstate commerce other than intoxicating liquors, or which, if concerning intoxicating liquors, related to controversies originating before the enactment of the Wilson law.\n The general power of the states to control and regulate the business of dealing in or soliciting proposals within their borders for the purchase of intoxicating liquors is beyond question. With the existence of this general power we are \n\n[205 U.S. 93, 98]\n\u00a0\n not, therefore, concerned. We are hence called upon only to consider whether the general power of the state to control and regulate the liquor traffic and the business of dealing or soliciting proposals for the dealing in the same within the state was inoperative as to the particular dealings here in question, because they were interstate commerce, and therefore could not be subjected to the sway of the state statute without causing that statute to be repugnant to the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States.\n It is well at once to give the taxt of the Wilson act, which is as follows (26 Stat. at L. 313, chap. 728):\n'That all fermented, distilled, or other intoxicating liquors or liquids transported into any state or territory or remaining therein for use, consumption, sale, or storage therein, shall, upon arrival in such state or territory, be subject to the operation and effect of the laws of such state or territory enacted in the exercise of its police powers, to the same extent and in the same manner as though such liquids or liquors had been produced in such state or territory, and shall not be exempt therefrom by reason of being introduced therein in original packages or otherwise.'\n\n It is settled by a line of decisions of this court, noted in the margin,1 that the purpose of the Wilson act, as a regulation by Congress of interstate commerce, was to allow the states, as to intoxicating liquors, when the subject of such commerce, to exert ampler power than could have been exercised before the enactment of the statute. In other words, that Congress, sedulous to prevent its exclusive right to regulate commerce from interfering with the power of the states over intoxicating liquor, by the Wilson act adopted a special rule enabling the states to extend their authority as to such liquor shipped \n\n[205 U.S. 93, 99]\n\u00a0\n from other states before it became commingled with the mass of other property in the state by a sale in the original package.\n The proposition relied upon, therefore, when considered in the light of the Wilson act, reduces itself to this: Albeit the state of South Dakota had power within its territory to prevent the sale of intoxicating liquors, even when shipped into that state from other states, yet South Dakota was wanting in authority to prevent or regulate the carrying on within its borders of the business of soliciting proposals for the purchase of liquors, because the proposals were to be consummated outside of the state, and the liquors to which they related were also outside the state. This, however, but comes to this: That the power existed to prevent sales of liquor, even when brought in from without the state, and yet there was no authority to prevent or regulate the carrying on of the accessory business of soliciting orders within the state. Aside, however, from the anomalous situation to which the proposition thus conduces, we think to maintain it would be repugnant to the plain spirit of the Wilson act. That act, as we have seen, manifested the conviction of Congress that control by the states over the traffic of dealing in liquor within their borders was of such importance that it was wise to adopt a special regulation of interstate commerce on the subject. When, then, for the carrying out of this purpose, the regulation expressly provided that intoxicating liquors coming into a state should be as completely under the control of a state as if the liquor had been manufactured therein, it would be, we think, a disregard of the purposes of Congress to hold that the owner of intoxicating liquors in one state can, by virtue of the commerce clause, go himself or send his agent into such other state, there, in defiance of the law of the state, to carry on the business of soliciting proposals for the purchase of intoxicating liquors.\n Passing from these general considerations, let us briefly more particularly notice some of the arguments relied upon.\n As we have stated, decisions of this court interpreting the \n\n[205 U.S. 93, 100]\n\u00a0\n Wilson act have held that that law did not authorize state power to attach to liquor shipped from one state into another before its arrival and delivery within the state to which destined. From this it is insisted, as none of the liquor covered by the proposals in this case had arrived and been delivered within South Dakota, the power of the state did not attach to the carrying on of the business of soliciting proposals, for, until the liquor arrived in the state, there was nothing on which the state authority could operate. But this is simply to misapprehend and misapply the cases and to misconceive the nature of the act done in the carrying on the business of soliciting proposals. The rulings in the previous cases to the effect that, under the Wilson act, state authority did not extend over liquor shipped from one state into another until arrival and delivery to the consignee at the point of destination, were but a recognition of the fact that Congress did not intend, in adopting the Wilson act, even if it lawfully could have done so, to authorize one state to exert its authority in another state by preventing the delivery of liquor embraced by transactions made in such other state. The proposition here relied on is widely different, since it is that, despite the Wilson act, the state of South Dakota was without power to regulate or control the business carried on in South Dakota of soliciting proposals for the purchase of liquors, because the proposals related to liquor situated in another state. But the business of soliciting proposals in South Dakota was one which that state had a right to regulate, wholly irrespective of when or where it was contemplated the proposals would be accepted or whence the liquor which they embraced was to be shipped. Of course, if the owner of the liquor in another state had a right to ship the same into South Dakota as an article of interstate commerce, and, as such, there sell the same in the original packages, irrespective of the laws of South Dakota, it would follow that the right to carry on the business of soliciting in South Dakota was an incident to the right to ship and sell, which could not be burdened \n\n[205 U.S. 93, 101]\n\u00a0\n without directly affecting interstate commerce. But, as by the Wilson act, the power of South Dakota attached to intoxicating liquors, when shipped into that state from another state, after delivery, but before the sale in the original package, so as to authorize South Dakota to regulate or forbid such sale, it follows that the regulation by South Dakota of the business carried on within its borders of soliciting proposals to purchase intoxicating liquors, even though such liquors were situated in other states, cannot be held to be repugnant to the commerce clause of the Constitution, because directly or indirectly burdening the right to sell in South Dakota,-a right which, by virtue of the Wilson act, did not exist.\n\n 2. \nNor is there merit in the arguments based on the ruling in Vance v. W. A. Vandercook, \n170 U.S. 438\n, 42 L. ed. 1100, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 674. The controversies in that case and the matters therein decided were recapitulated in Pabst Brewing Co. v. Crenshaw, \n198 U.S. 17\n, 49 L. ed. 925, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 552, as follows (p. 25, L. ed. p. 928, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 553):\n'In Vance v. W. A. Vandercook, supra, the operation of a liquor law of South Carolina was considered. By the act in question the state of South Carolina took exclusive charge of the sale of liquor within the state, appointed its agents to sell the same, and empowered them to purchase the liquor which was to be brought into the state for sale. The fact was that, by the act in question, the state of South Carolina, instead of forbidding the traffic in liquor, authorized it, and engaged in the liquor business for its own account, using it as a source of revenue. The act, in addition, affixed prerequisite conditions to the shipment into South Carolina from other states of liquor to a consumer who had purchased it for his own use, and not for sale. Considering the Wilson act and the previous decisions applying it, . . . in so far as it took charge in behalf of the state of the sale of liquor within the state, and made such sale a source of revenue, was not an interference with interstate commerce. In so far, however, as the state law imposed burdens on the right to ship liquor from another state to a resident of South Carolina, intended for his own use, and not for sale within the state, the law was held to be repugnant to the Constitution, because the Wilson act, whilst it delegated to the state plenary power to regulate the sale of liquors in South Carolina shipped into the state from other states, did not recognize the right of a state to prevent an individual from ordering liquors from outside of the state of his residence for his own consumption, and not for sale.'\n\n It having been thus settled that under the Wilson act a resident of one state had the right to contract for liquors in another state and receive the liquors in the state of his residence \n\n[205 U.S. 93, 102]\n\u00a0\n for his own use, therefore, it is insisted, the agent or traveling salesman of a nonresident dealer in intoxicating liquors had the right to go into South Dakota and there carry on the business of soliciting from residents of that state orders for liquor, to be consummated by acceptance of the proposals by the nonresident dealer. The premise is sound, but the error lies in the deduction, since it ignores the broad distinction between the want of power of a state to prevent a resident from ordering from another state liquor for his own use, and the plenary authority of a state to forbid the carrying on within its borders of the business of soliciting orders for intoxicating liquors situated in another state, even although such orders may only contemplate a contract to result from final acceptance in the state where the liquor is situated. The distinction between the two is not only obvious, but has been foreclosed by a previous decision of this court. That a state may regulate and forbid the making within its borders of insurance contracts with its citizens by foreign insurance companies or their agents is certain. Hooper v. California, \n155 U.S. 648\n, 39 L. ed. 297, 5 Inters. Com. Rep. 610, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 207. But that this power to prohibit does not extend to preventing a citizen of one state from making a contract of insurance in another state is also settled. Allgeyer v. Louisiana, \n165 U.S. 578\n, 41 L. ed. 832, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 427. In Nutting v. Massachusetts, \n183 U.S. 553\n, 46 L. ed. 324, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 238, the court was called upon to consider these two subjects,-that is, the power of the state, on the one \n\n[205 U.S. 93, 103]\n\u00a0\n hand, to forbid the making within the state of contracts of insurance with unauthorized insurance companies, and the right of the individual, on his own behalf, to make a contract with such insurance companies in another state as to property situate within the state of residence. The case was brought to this court to review a conviction of Nutting, a citizen of Massachusetts, for having negotiated insurance with a company not authorized to do business in Massachusetts, contrary to the statutes of that state. Briefly, the facts were that Nutting, an insurance broker, solicited in Massachusetts a contract of insurance on property belonging to McKie situated in that state. The proposal was accepted outside of the state of Massachusetts and the policy also issued outside of that state. The contention of the plaintiff in error was that, as the contract was consummated outside of Massachusetts, the conviction was repugnant to the 14th Amendment, because the acts done did not fall within the general principle announced in Hooper v. California, supra, but were within the ruling in Allgeyer v. Louisiana. The conviction was affirmed, not because the contract was consummated in Massachusetts, but upon the ground that the right of an individual to obtain insurance for himself outside of the state of his residence did not sanction the conduct of Nutting, as an insurance broker, in carrying on the business in Massachusetts of soliciting unauthorized insurance. After reviewing the Hooper and Allgeyer decisions and pointing out that there was no conflict between the two cases, the court said (p. 558, L. ed. p. 327, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 240):\n'As was well said by the supreme judicial court of Massachusetts: 'While the legislature cannot impair the freedom of McKie to elect with whom he will contract, it can prevent the foreign insurers from sheltering themselves under his freedom in order to solicit contracts which otherwise he would not have thought of making. It may prohibit not only agents of the insurers, but also brokers, from soliciting or intermeddling in such insurance, and for the same reasons.' 175 Mass. 156, 78 Am. St. Rep. 485, 55 N. E. 895.' \n\n[205 U.S. 93, 104]\n\u00a0\n The ruling thus made is particularly pertinent to the subject of intoxicating liquors and the power of the state in respect thereto. As we have seen, the right of the states to prohibit the sale of liquor within their respective jurisdictions in and by virtue of the regulation of commerce embodied in the Wilson act is absolutely applicable to liquor shipped from one state into another, after delivery, and before the sale in the original package. It follows that the authority of the states, so far as the sale of intoxicating liquors within their borders is concerned, is just as complete as is their right to regulate within their jurisdiction the making of contracts of insurance. It hence must be that the authority of the states to forbid agents of nonresident liquor dealers from coming within their borders to solicit contracts for the purchase of intoxicating liquors which otherwise the citizen of the state 'would not have thought of making' must be as complete and efficacious as is such authority in relation to contracts of insurance, especially in view of the conceptions of public order and social well-being which it may be assumed lie at the foundation of regulations concerning the traffic in liquor.\n\n\n 3. \nThe contention that the law of South Dakota was a taxing law, and not a police regulation, and therefore not within the purview of the Wilson act, is in conflict with the purpose of that law as interpreted by the supreme court of South Dakota. State ex rel. Grigsby v. Buechler, 10 S. D. 156, 72 N. W. 114. Besides, the contention is foreclosed by the ruling of this court in Pabst Brewing Co. v.

LONDON GUARANTEE & ACCIDENT CO.(1907)\nNo. 155\nArgued: January 11, 1907Decided: February 25, 1907\n\n\n\n Messrs. E. Clinton Rhoads and John C. Bell for Doyle et al.\n\n\n[204 U.S. 599, 600]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Thomas Raeburn White for the London Guarantee & Accident Company.\n\n\n\n[204 U.S. 599, 601]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case is here upon certificate from the circuit court of appeals for the third circuit. From the facts stated it appears that William J. Doyle and James G. Doak were adjudged guilty of contempt of court in the circuit court of the United States for the eastern district of Pennsylvania. After the bringing of the action, upon the petition of the London Guarantee & Accident Company, Limited, the plaintiff below, the court made the following order:\n'And now, June 25th, 1904, the court orders the defendants to produce, within twenty days, in the office of the clerk of said court, their pay sheets, time books, cash books, and all other books of original entry which contain information as to the amount of compensation paid to employees of themselves or of their subcontractors or of any other persons contemplated in the contracts upon which suit is brought in this case during the period of said contracts, as set forth in the petition filed.'\n\n After that order was made the certificate recites:\n'Thereafter the plaintiff presented to the court a petition \n\n[204 U.S. 599, 602]\n\u00a0\n alleging disobedience by the defendants of the above order and praying that an attachment issue against them for contempt of court. Thereupon the court granted a rule upon the defendants to show cause why an attachment should not issue against them for contempt of court by reason of their violation and disobedience of said order. To this rule the defendants filed an answer under oath, denying intentional noncompliance with said order, and stating that they were not able to produce all the books and papers called for, because, upon a thorough search, the absent ones could not be found, and averring their belief that they were accidentally lost or by mistake were destroyed at a time when alterations were made in their office and a removal of its contents to another place occurred. Subsequently, to wit, on January 3d, 1905, upon the hearing of the rule, the court gave and entered judgment that the 'defendants are guilty of contempt in disobeying the order referred to,' and further adjudged as follows:\n\n'If the defendants produce in the office of the clerk of the circuit court on or before January 15th, 1905, the ledger of 1902-1904, the pay rolls or time sheets from March to May 28, 1903, and the cash book from May 28 to December 1, 1902, or, if they produce the cash book alone, they are ordered to pay no more than the costs accruing upon this motion, including the stenographer's charges, on or before January 20, or, in default of such payment, to suffer imprisonment in the jail of this county for the period of sixty days. If the foregoing books and papers are not produced on or before January 15, the defendants are ordered to pay a fine of $250, and also the cost accruing upon this motion, including the stenographer's charges, on or before January 20, or, in default of such payment, to suffer imprisonment in the jail of this county for the period of sixty days.'\n\n A writ of error was allowed to the circuit court of appeals. Upon the facts stated the following question was certified to this court: \n\n[204 U.S. 599, 603]\n\u00a0\n 'Has the circuit court of appeals jurisdiction upon the writ of error sued out by the defendants to review the above-recited judgment of January 5th, 1905, adjudging that the defendants are guilty of contempt of court in disobeying the above-recited order of court of June 25th, 1904, and imposing upon the defendants a fine of $250.00 on the specified conditions and terms?'\n Cases involving the right to review orders of the Federal courts in matters of contempt have been so recently before this court that an extended discussion of the principles involved is unnecessary. Bessette v. W. B. Conkey Co. \n194 U.S. 324\n, 48 L. ed. 997, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 665; Re Christensen Engineering Co. \n194 U.S. 458\n, 48 L. ed. 1072, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 729; Alexander v. United States, \n201 U.S. 117\n, 50 L. ed. 686, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 356.\n In Bessette v. W. B. Conkey Co. supra, a question was certified here from the circuit court of appeals of the seventh circuit, involving the jurisdiction of that court to review an order in a contempt proceeding finding the petitioner guilty of contempt for violation of an order of the circuit court, and imposing a fine. In that case the subject underwent a full examination and the previous cases in this court were cited and reviewed. As a result of those decisions we deem it settled that an order punishing for contempt, made in the progress of the case, when not in the nature of an order in a criminal proceeding, is regarded as interlocutory, and to be reviewed only upon appeal from a final decree in the case.\n Re Christensen Engineering Co. supra. In Bessette v. W. B. Conkey Co. supra, it was pointed out that this court had no jurisdiction to review judgments in contempt proceedings criminal in their nature, under the power to punish for contempt defined by Congress (1 Stat. at L. 83, chap. 20) and limited by the act of March 2, 1831. 4 Stat. at L. 487, chap. 99, Rev. Stat.  725, U. S. Comp Stat. 1901, p. 583.\n The right to review a judgment in a contempt proceeding in the circuit court of appeals was derived from the circuit court of appeals act ,  6 [26 Stat. at L. 828, chap. 517, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 550], of which Mr. Justice Brewer, speaking for the court in the Bessette case said:\n'So when, by  6 of the courts of appeals act, the \n\n[204 U.S. 599, 604]\n\u00a0\n circuit courts of appeals are given jurisdiction to review the 'final decision in the district court and the existion circuit courts in all cases other than those provided for in the preceding section of this act, unless otherwise provided by law,' and the preceding section gives to this court jurisdiction to review convictions in only capital or otherwise infamous crimes, and no other provision is found in the statutes for a review of the final order in contempt cases, upon what satisfactory ground can it be held that the final decisions in contempt cases in the circuit or district courts are not subject to review by the circuit courts of appeals? Considering only such cases of contempt as the present,-that is, cases in which the proceedings are against one not a party to the suit, and cannot be regarded as interlocutory,-we are of opinion that there is a right of review in the circuit court of appeals.'\n\n And again, in the same case, it is said:\n'As, therefore, the ground upon which a review by this court of a final decision in contempt cases was denied no longer exists, the decisions themselves cease to have controlling authority, and whether the circuit courts of appeals have authority to review proceedings in contempt in the district and circuit courts depends upon the question whether such proceedings are criminal cases.'\n\n It therefore appears that the only right of review given to the circuit court of appeals in contempt proceedings is derived from the act giving that court such right in criminal cases. In the course of the discussion in the Bessette Case it is said that proceedings for contempt may be divided into those which have for their purpose the vindication of the authority and dignity of the court, and those seeking to punish parties guilty of a disregard of such orders as are remedial in their character, and intended to enforce the rights of private parties, to compel obedience to orders and decrees made to enforce their rights, and to give them a remedy to which the court deems them entitled. And it is said that the one class is \n\n[204 U.S. 599, 605]\n\u00a0\n criminal and punitive in its nature, in which the government and the public are interested, and the other civil, remedial, and coercive in its character, in which those chiefly concerned are individuals whose private rights and remedies are undertaken to be protected and enforced. From the discussion in that case it clearly appears that proceedings which are criminal in their nature and intended for the vindication of public justice, rather than the coercion of the opposite party to do some act for the benefit of another party to the action, are the only ones reviewable in the circuit court of appeals under its power to take jurisdiction of and determine criminal cases.\n In that case, and in cases generally where the right of review has been recognized, the party prosecuted has been other than one directly interested in the suit, and brought into it for the purpose of punishing a known violation of an order in defiance of the authority and power of the court. In such case the proceeding is entirely independent and its prosecution does not delay the conduct of the action between the parties to final decree. True it is that in some cases, as in the Christensen Case, 194 U. S., the punishment for contempt which has been held reviewable is for a past act of a party in violation of an order made for the benefit of the other party. In that case one half of the fine imposed went to the United States, and was not intended for the enforcement of an order in favor of a party, but rather for the vindication of the authority of the court, and punishment for an act done in violation of the court's order, and it was held that such judgment was in a criminal proceeding and reviewable in the circuit court of appeals. In the present case, while it is true that the fine imposed is not made payable to the opposite party, compliance with the order relieves from payment, and, in that event, there is no final judgment of either fine or imprisonment.\n'It may not be always easy,' said the learned justice, speaking for the court in the Conkey Case, 'to classify a particular act as belonging to either one of these two classes \n\n[204 U.S. 599, 606]\n\u00a0\n [speaking of vindicatory and remedial proceedings]. It may partake of the characteristics of both. A significant and general determinative feature is that the act is by one party to a suit, in disobedience of a special order made in behalf of the other. Yet sometimes the disobedience may be of such a character and in such a manner as to indicate a contempt of the court rather than a disregard of the rights of the adverse party.'\n\n In view of the principles which we deem settled by the adjudications referred to, the question decisive of the present case, therefore, is: Was the judgment rendered in the contempt proceeding criminal in its nature, and having for its object the vindication of the authority of the court, or was it one in the nature of a proceeding to enforce an order seeking the protection of the rights of the party to the suit for whose benefit it was made?\n The certificate does not fully indicate the character of the action in which the order was made; yet sufficient appears from which it is to be inferred that the action before the court was one in which it was necessary for the protection of the plaintiff that an inspection of the books and papers of the defendant be had. The defendants were required to produce in the office of the clerk the time books, cash books, etc., containing information as to the amount of compensation paid to the employees of themselves or subcontractors, or to any other persons contemplated in the contracts upon which suit was brought. The court deemed it proper, in view of certain contracts between the parties, that these books and papers be opened for inspection for the benefit of the plaintiff. And, after hearing the parties, it was adjudged that if they produce the books they should be liable only for the costs of the proceedings, or, in default of payment, suffer imprisonment for a period of sixty days. And if the books and papers were not produced on or before January 15 a fine of $250 and costs was imposed, or, in default of payment thereof, imprisonment in the county jail for the period of sixty days. We think it is apparent from a perusal of this order, in the light of the state- \n\n[204 U.S. 599, 607]\n\u00a0\n ment of facts under which it was made, that its object and purpose was to obtain information for the benefit of the plaintiff in the suit to which the court found it entitled, and that the punishment of fine and imprisonment, which was in the alternative, was imposed not for the vindication of the dignity or authority for the court, in the interests of the public, but in order to secure, for the benefit of the plaintiff, a compliance with the order of the court as to the production of the books. The case clearly falls within the class of contempt proceedings which are not criminal in their nature, and are not reviewable before final decree. The proceeding is against a party, the compliance with the order avoids the punishment, and there in nothing in the nature of a criminal suit or judgment imposed for public purposes upon a defendant in a criminal proceeding.\n It may be true, as said in argument, that, unless the party complies with the order, he may be subjected to fine or imprisonment; and, if the order cannot be reviewed until after final decree, it may come too late to be of any benefit to the party aggrieved. But the power to punish for contempt is inherent in the authority of courts, and is necessary to the administration of justice, and part of the inconvenience to which a citizen is subject in a community governed by law regulated by orderly judicial procedure. As has been said, while the party may suffer imprisonment, 'he carries the keys of the prison in his own pocket' (Re Nevitt, 54 C. C. A. 622, 117 Fed. 461), and, by compliance with the order of the court, may deliver himself from punishment.\n But, whatever the hardship, the question now before the court is as to the authority of the circuit court of appeals to review judgments in contempt proceedings. In the circuit court of appeals act, as construed by this court, the jurisdiction of the circuit court of appeals is extended to the right to review judgments entered before final decree in the action out of which the contempt proceedings arose where the order is final and in a proceeding of a criminal nature. \n\n[204 U.S. 599, 608]\n\u00a0\n Beyond this, the jurisdiction of the court has not been carried, and, in our opinion, no right of review exists in such a case as is shown in the certificate before us, in advance of a final decree in the case in which the order was made.\n It is urged by counsel for plaintiff in error that the only authority of the circuit court to make an order for the production of books and papers in a common-law action is under  724 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 583), providing for the productions of papers after issue joined. But the question certified is not as to the lack of authority of the circuit court to make the order for want of jurisdiction,-a question which might arise upon a habeas corpus proceeding,-but concerns the right of the circuit court of appeals to review an order made in the circuit court, undertaking to punish for contempt for violation of an order made in other than a proceeding of a criminal character. The court of appeals act of 1891 gives no right to review other than final judgments in the district and circuit courts, except in injunction orders, as provided in  7 of the act. McLish v. Roff, \n141 \nU.S. 661, 668\n, 35 S. L. ed. 893, 895, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 118.\n For the reasons stated we think the Circuit Court of Appeals has no jurisdiction to review the judgment set forth in the certificate, and the question certified will be answered in the negative.\n Mr. Justice Peckham took no part in the decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","49":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDUKE v. TURNER(1907)\nNo. 178\nArgued: Decided: February 25, 1907\n\n\n\n Messrs. A. H. Huston, L. E. Payson, William R. Benham, James Hepburn, and Laurence & Huston for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n[204 U.S. 623, 624]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Frank Dale and A. G. C. Bierer for defendants in error.\n\n\n[204 U.S. 623, 625]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n The original action was a proceeding in mandamus commenced in the district court of Logan county, Oklahoma territory, July 23, 1903, by Turner and Kirkwood against the mayor and councilmen of the city of Guthrie. The petitioners obtained a writ of mandamus in the district court to compel the city officials, for the payment of certain warrants, to levy a tax upon the property of persons residing in the territory covered by various former 'provisional governments,' and known as Guthrie proper, East Guthrie, West Guthrie, and Capitol Hill, now included in the city of Guthrie.\n These warrants were issued in pursuance of a special act of the territorial legislature, approved December 25, 1890. 1 Wilson's Rev. & Anno. Stat. 260, 261. This act was the subject of consideration in this court, its validity was sustained, and its history will be found in Guthrie Nat. Bank v. Guthrie, \n173 U.S. 528\n, 43 L. ed. 796, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 513. The act is set forth in the margin of the report of that case at p. 530, L. ed. at p. 797, Sup. Ct. Rep. at p. 514. The warrants sued upon are seventeen in \n\n[204 U.S. 623, 626]\n\u00a0\n number, all bearing the date of July 1, 1893, and maturing in various years, from July 1, 1894, to July 1, 1898, inclusive. These warrants are in the following form:\n Warrant of the city of Guthrie, Oklahoma territory.\n $554.15. No. 6.\n Treasurer of the city of Guthrie:\n One year after date pay to the order of Harper S. Cunningham, receiver National Bank, Guthrie, the sum of five hundred and fifty- four and 15.100 dollars with interest thereon at the rate of 6 per centum per annum, from June 3, 1891, from any moneys which shall arise from special levy for the payment of city warrants issued under the provisions of chapter No. 14, of the Statutes of Oklahoma, providing for the payment of indebtedness of the provisional governments of the cities of Guthrie, East Guthrie, West Guthrie, and Capitol Hill, upon the subdivision of Guthrie known as East Guthrie.\n By the order of the city council, July 1, 1893\n\n\n A. M. McElhinney, Mayor.\n Attest: E. G. Milliken, City Clerk.\n The supreme court of the territory preceded its opinion with the following statement:\n'This is the third time that these warrants have been brought before this court. W. H. Gray, receiver of the National Bank of Guthrie, and successor to Harper S. Cunningham, on the 7th day of September, 1895, commenced a mandamus proceeding, identical with this, in the district court of Logan county, for the purpose of compelling the then mayor and councilmen of the city of Guthrie to levy a tax to provide a fund for the payments of these warrants; the district court allowed the writ, but the case was appealed to this court, and, on the twelfth day of February, 1897, was reversed. [5 Okla. 188, 48 Pac. 106.] After this reversal nothing whatever was done by the holder of these warrants in the way of taking any steps towar 1 collecting them for more than four years \n\n[204 U.S. 623, 627]\n\u00a0\n thereafter. But after the dicision in the case of the Guthrie Nat. Bank v. Guthrie was rendered in the Supreme Court of the United States [\n173 U.S. 528\n, 43 L. ed. 796, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 513] the holders of these warrants who had lain dormant during the years made another move. The old case of Gray v. Martin, after it had been reversed and remanded, had been dropped from the docket, and on the 28th day of June, 1901, Turner and Kirkwood filed their motion as the successors in interest of Gray, to have the case redocketed, and also filed on the same day an application to have the case revived in their names, as the successors in interest of Gray, and on the same day they filed their motion to dismiss said action, which motion was sustained, and the case dismissed. Shortly after the dismissal of the original mandamus case Turner and Kirwood brought suit against the city of Guthrie upon these same warrants, wherein a judgment against the city for the amount of the warrants was prayed for; they failed in this suit in the district court and appealed to the supreme court, where the judgment of the lower court was affirmed. [13 Okla. 26, 73 Pac. 283.]\n\n'On the 23d day of July, 1903, after the final decision in this court in the case of Turner v. Guthrie, this mandamus proceeding was commenced against the mayor and councilmen, the same being in all respects similar to and identical with the original mandamus proceeding brought by W. H. Gray, receiver, upon the same warrants in 1895. The return and answer of the alternative writ sets forth the same defense as was alleged in the return to the proceedings brought by Gray, receiver, and also alleges the bar to the action of the statute of limitations. Trial was had before the court, wherein it was agreed that the allegations set forth in the fourth answer or return of the defendants to the alternative writ are true, and which show the facts substantially as above set forth. Thereupon the court rendered judgment for the plaintiffs below, and allowed a peremptory writ of mandamus against plaintiffs in error, \n\n[204 U.S. 623, 628]\n\u00a0\n from which judgment and final order the plaintiffs in error appeal to this court.' [14 Okla. 285, 78 Pac. 108.]\n\n The supreme court of the territory affirmed the judgment of the district court upon the ground that the statute of limitations, which is also the defense made in the case upon which the decision of the appeal to this court turns, did not begin to run in favor of the municipal corporation upon the obligation evidenced by the warrants until the municipality had provided funds by which payment could be made.\n The authorities are much in conflict as to whether a statute of limitations, without express words to that effect, governs a proceeding in mandamus as though it were an ordinary civil action. Some of the cases hold that the statute of limitations applies which would govern an ordinary action to enforce the same right.\n Other cases hold that the statute of limitations does not apply as it would to ordinary civil actions, but the relator is only barred from relief where he has slept upon his right an unreasonable time, particularly when the delay has been prejudicial to the rights of the respondent. The cases pro and con are collected in a note to  30b, High on Extraordinary Legal Remedies, 3d ed.\n The question is not a new one in this court; it was under consideration in Chapman v. Douglas County, \n107 U.S. 348\n, 27 L. ed. 378, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 62. That case was a bill in equity filed September 10, 1877, to compel the county of Douglas to surrender possession of two certain tracts of land to which the county had acquired title through deed made by Chapman, March 5, 1859, or, in case the county elected to retain and hold the land, that it be compelled to pay the reasonable price and value thereof to the complainant. The land had been conveyed for a 'poor farm.' The county made a payment on the land and gave its notes, secured by mortgage, payable in one, two, three, and four years. Afterwards the supreme court of the state decided that, by the purchase of lands for such a purpose, a county could not be bound to pay the purchase money at any \n\n[204 U.S. 623, 629]\n\u00a0\n specified time or to secure it by mortgage upon the land, but was limited to a payment in cash and to the levy of an annual tax to create a fund wherewith to pay the residue. The notes remaining unpaid, the bill was filed in equity for the purpose above stated. In considering the nature of the relief and the applicability of the statute of limitations Mr. Justice Matthews, speaking for the court (p. 355, L. ed. p. 381, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 68), said:\n'And if in such cases a proceeding in mandamus should be considered to be the more appropriate, and, perhaps, the only effective, remedy, it also is not embraced in the statute of limitations prescribed generally for civil actions. The writ may well be refused when the relator has slept upon his rights for an unreasonable time, and especially if the delay has been prejudical to the defendant, or to the rights of other persons, though what laches, in the assertion of a clear legal right, would be sufficient to justify a refusal of the remedy by mandamus, must depend, in a great measure, on the character and circumstances of the particular case. Chinn v. Trustees, 32 Ohio St. 236; Moses, Mandamus, 190. There is no statute of limitations in Nebraska applicable to that proceeding.'\n\n It will be observed that the learned justice refers in the citation just given to Chinn v. Trustees, supra, and Moses on Mandamus, 190. In that treatise the author gives his preference for the English rule, that the party should suffer no unreasonable delay in the opinion and discretion of the court, as more just and equitable than the rule countenanced by some of the American cases.\n The case of Chinn v. Trustees, supra, holds that under the Ohio Code there is no strict limitation as to the time wherein a writ of mandamus may be obtained, and the case is directly in point, owing to the similarity of the Codes of Ohio and Oklahoma.\n The statute of limitation relied upon in the case at bar is the three years' limitation, contained in second paragraph,  18, Oklahoma Code, 2 Wilson's Rev. & Anno. Stat. 973, 975, as to statutory liabilities, and  23, regulating the time \n\n[204 U.S. 623, 630]\n\u00a0\n for the beginning of a new action to one year after reversal or failure of a former action. These sections in article 3, 'Time of Commencing Civil Actions,' are as follows:\n'Sec. 18. Civil actions, other than for the recovery of real property, can only be brought within the following periods, after the cause of action shall have accrued, and not afterwards:\n\n'First. Within five years, an action upon any contract, agreement, or promise in writing.\n\n'Second. Within three years, an action upon a contract not in writing, express or implied; an action upon a liability created by statute other than forfeiture or penalty.\n\n ... * *\n'Sec. 23. If any action be commenced within due time, and a judgment thereon for the plaintiff be reversed, or if the plaintiff fail in such action otherwise than upon the merits, and the time limited for the same shall have expired, the plaintiff, or, if he die and the cause of action survive, his representatives, may commence a new action within one year after the reversal or failure.'\n\n The limitation of three years, said to be applicable here, is upon an action created by statute other than forfeiture or penalty; but this language is in a section limiting civil actions other than for the recovery of real property, and the language used in  23 has reference to actions of like character.\n The proceeding in mandamus is regulated in article 33, Oklahoma Code, 2 Wilson's Rev. & Anno. Stat. 1130. That the proceeding is not regarded as a civil action is shown in  694, Code, 2 Wilson's Rev. & Anno. Stat. 1131, which provides that pleadings are to be construed and may be amended in the same manner 'as pleadings in a civil action,' and issues joined, tried, and the proceedings had, 'in the same manner as in a civil action.' The Oklahoma Code ( 687) also declares that writs of mandamus may not be issued where there is a plain and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law.\n In Chinn v. Trustees, ubi supra, Judge Scott, delivering the opinion of the Ohio supreme court, said: \n\n[204 U.S. 623, 631]\n\u00a0\n 'The Code of Civil Procedure limits the time within which an action can be brought 'upon a liability created by statute, other than a forfeiture or penalty,' to six years.  14. This provision is found in title 2 of the Code, the object of which is to define and prescribe 'the time of commencing civil actions.' The civil action of the Code is a substitute for all such judicial proceedings as, prior thereto, were known either as actions at law or suits in equity.  3. By  8, the limitations of this title are expressly confined to civil actions. But proceedings in mandamus were never regarded as an action at law, or a suit in equity, and are not, therefore, a civil action within the meaning of the Code. Mandamus is an extraordinary or supplementary remedy, which cannot be resorted to if the party has any adequate, specific remedy. The Code provides for and regulates this remedy, but does not recognize it as a civil action.'\n This language is no less applicable to the Oklahoma Code. The proceeding in mandamus is not a civil action, and therefore not within the terms of the statute of limitations.\n Following, then, the rule recognized and approved in Chapman v. Douglas County, supra, the question is, Should the writ be refused because the relator has slept upon his rights for an unreasonable time, and has the delay caused prejudice to the defendant, or to the rights of other interested persons?\n We perceive nothing in the record to warrant that conclusion. Gray, as receiver of the National Bank of Guthrie and successor of Cunningham, to whom the warrants were payable, on September 7, 1895, began a suit in mandamus in Logan county, Oklahoma. He prevailed in that court. The case was reversed on February 12, 1897, by the supreme court of the territory ( 5 Okla. 188, 48 Pac. 106), and was remanded and refiled in the district court, April 7, 1897.\n The validity of the act was in controversy in the case of Guthrie Nat. Bank v. Guthrie, and sustained in this court, April 3, 1899 (\n173 U.S. 528\n, 43 L. ed. 796, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 513), reversing the supreme court of the territory. \n\n[204 U.S. 623, 632]\n\u00a0\n On the 28th day of June, 1901, Turner and Kirkwood, as the successors in interest to Gray, having purchased the warrants, as they allege, on January 5, 1901, filed their motion to dismiss the original action, which was sustained. They then (on June 28, 1901) brought suit against the city of Guthrie for judgment upon the warrants against the city, in which they failed in the district court, and on appeal to the supreme court, that court holding that the remedy, if any, was by mandamus. 13 Okla. 26, 73 Pac. 283. On the 23d day of July, 1903, this mandamus proceeding was begun.\n These facts do not disclose any laches in asserting their rights such as would bar the right to obtain a writ of mandamus, nor does it appear that the municipal corporation has been in anywise prejudiced by the delay. In some form legal warfare seems to have been waged for the collection of these warrants by various holders in different courts without beneficial results until the present action.\n While we do not put our decision upon the same grounds as the Supreme Court of the territory, we think its conclusion was right, and its judgment will be affirmed. \n\n\n\n","50":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEARLE v. MYERS(1907)\nNo. 12\nArgued: October 15, 1907Decided: December 2, 1907\n\n\n\n The appeals in the above numbers involve the judgment of the court of appeals of the District of Columbia (25 App. D. C. 582), which modified the decree of the supreme court, confirming the report of an auditor. The action was brought by the appellees against the administrator of Earle's estate for an accounting, and after issue joined it was referred to an auditor to state the account upon the pleadings and proof placed before him. The auditor reported in favor of allowing the complainant, as due the Causten estate, the sum of $7,462.20. After the report had been confirmed by \n\n[207 U.S. 244, 245]\n\u00a0\n the supreme court, each side took an appeal and the court of appeals reversed some of the findings and conclusions of law of the court below, and directed a new decree to be entered, in accordance with the opinion of the court. The defendants appealed from that order to this court, and that appeal is the above number 12.\n Fearing that there might be some doubt as to the finality of this decree for the purpose of an appeal to this court, the parties, pursuant to the decree of the court of appeals, took the case down to the trial court, which referred it to the auditor, who restated the account in accordance with the direction of the court of appeals, to which exceptions were filed by the defendant, which were overruled, the auditor's report confirmed and another decree entered, from which an appeal was taken to the court of appeals and there affirmed, and from the decree of affirmance an appeal has been taken to this court and allowed, which is number 388.\n The material facts which appear in the record are the following: For many years a series of attempts had been made to secure legislation from Congress looking to the payment of claims made by American citizens for damages arising from illegal seizure of their vessels by the government of France, which the United States had, by treaty, undertaken to pay. Such attempts had been unsuccessful, until at length an act was passed by Congress, chapter 25 of the Laws of 1885 (23 Stat. at L. 283, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 750), which provided for the ascertaining of claims of American citizens for spoliation prior to the 31st of July, 1801\n\n\n During quite a number of years preceding the act of 1885 one James H. Causten, a resident of the District of Columbia, had accumulated papers which were regarded as of considerable value in facilitating proofs of these claims. Mr. Causten died before the passage of the act of Congress, leaving these papers in the hands of Mr. William E. Earle, who was also interested in the prosecution of said claims, and therefore desired the benefit of the use of these papers, and, after the act of Congress, Mr. Earle and Mr. Waggaman, the administrator of the estate \n\n[207 U.S. 244, 246]\n\u00a0\n of Mr. Causten, entered into a contract as of the date of June 12, 1885, by which Mr. Earle was to be allowed to continue in the possession and exclusive use of these papers in the prosecution of the spoliation claims, for which possession and exclusive use he was to pay to the administrator ( Waggaman) 25 per cent of all fees which he should receive on account of these claims, 'after deducting from all such fees received, or which shall hereafter be received by him, the proper expenses incurred by him, since the passage of the act of Congress, referring said cases to the court of claims in the prosecution of said French spoliation claims, such as clerk hire, printing, advertising, office rent, and the compensation of other attorneys necessarily associated with him, and in whose compensation said Earle does not share. And settlements between said Earle and said Waggaman, administrator as aforesaid, or his successor in office, shall be made every six months, and the proportionate part of said fees due said administrator shall be paid over to said administrator or his successor in office, at such settlement.'\n Earle agreed to keep true books of account of all fees and retainers received by him, and also of all expenses attending the prosecution of the claims in which he should be engaged as counsel or otherwise, the books of account to be open at all times for the inspection of the administrator, or his successor in office.\n Thereafter proceedings were taken by Earle in the court of claims towards proving the claims of his clients, and the action of that court recognizing such claims among others, to a certain extent, was certified to Congress, as rpovided in the act of 1885.\n On March 3, 1891 (26 Stat. at L. 897, chap. 540), Congress made an appropriation in payment of a portion of all claims so certified, and out of this appropriation Mr. Earle received as fees up to July, 1893, the sum of about $38,000, while his books showed an expenditure of over $57,000, leaving Mr. Earle some $18,000 behind. Future legislation was expected, which would turn \n\n[207 U.S. 244, 247]\n\u00a0\n this deficit into a profit. It was hoped that a further appropriation would be made in 1893, but that hope was not realized. Mr. Earle died in August, 1893, and an administrator was thereafter appointed. No further appropriation was made until March 3, 1899 (30 Stat. at L. 1161, 1191, chap. 426, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 751). Under this appropriation the estate of Earle received some $50,000 in fees.\n Negotiations for the settlement of the accounts between the administrator of Earle's estate and the administrator of Causten's estate were proceeded with, but proved unsuccessful, when this suit was instituted by the Causten administrator for an accounting. Pleadings were had in due form, and the case was referred to an auditor of the court for a statement of the account, who, after considerable testimony had been adduced, filed his report and found the sum of $7,462.20 to be due from the defendant to the complainant. Exceptions were filed by both parties, which were overruled by the supreme court, and the auditor's report was confirmed.\n The court of appeals modified the decree entered by the supreme court, as already stated.\n Messrs. John C. Gittings and Henry E. Davis for appellant.\n Messrs. T. Percy Myers, M. J. Colbert, and S. T. Thomas for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n In making up the account, the representative of the Earle estate claimed a credit for the sum of $19,558.05 as part of the proper expenses incurred by or in behalf of defendant in obtaining the appropriations above mentioned. The auditor struck out $13,058.05 of such claimed credit, leaving $6,500 as a proper credit in favor of the administrator of Earle. The thirteen thousand and some odd dollars were stricken out by the auditor because of the fact, as he found, that these moneys \n\n[207 U.S. 244, 248]\n\u00a0\n were paid for lobbying services, in efforts to secure the appropriation by Congress, which services he held were contrary to public policy and discountenanced by the courts, and therefore not to be allowed as a proper credit. The balance, $6,500, the auditor held that the proof showed had been paid by the defendant for legal services by the individuals named, and that such services were valuable, and the amount paid was not excessive or unreasonable. This amount consisted of three separate items, two items for $2,000 and one item for $2,500.\n Upon the argument in the court of appeals, the defendant's counsel insisted that the whole $19,000 should have been allowed as a proper credit, while the plaintiffs' counsel asserted that the disallowance of the 13,000-dollar credit was right, but that the court erred in admitting the $6,500 as a proper credit. The court of appeals, as we have said, affirmed that portion of the decree in which the auditor disallowed the $ 13,000 claimed for credit, but reversed that portion of the decree by which the auditor allowed the credit of $6,500, and directed the decree to be amended by striking out the above credit for that sum. This was upon the ground that the $6,500 claimed was also illegal. The court said that it was impossible to read the record without coming to the conclusion that these alleged services were of the kind known as lobbying services; that, although proof on the subject was meager, yet, so far as it went, it tended unmistakably to show the illicit character of the services, being personal influence and personal solicitation with members of Congress, and that courts had branded services of a like nature as improper, and for which no recovery would be allowed.\n The auditor before whom the case was tried and who heard the witnesses, while holding that certain of the credit claims were illegal, as claims for lobbying services, yet held that these particular claims for services performed by members of the bar, and representing the $6,500 allowed, were for proper professional services, and as such should be allowed. The supreme \n\n[207 U.S. 244, 249]\n\u00a0\n court of the District confirmed the report of the auditor, and thereby held that the credit claimed for the payment of these services was proper.\n After a careful examintion of the testimony in the case we are unable to concur with the court of appeals on this question. We cannot find any evidence to justify a reversal of the report of the auditor, confirmed as it is by the supreme court. The payments were proved to have been made, and there is no evidence of any illegality connected with the services performed sufficient to justify an appellate tribunal in reversing the finding of the auditor and the supreme court upon this question of fact. It is unnecessary to embody in this opinion a reference to the testimony in the case or to make extracts therefrom, but it is enough to say that we are satisfied, from a careful perusal thereof, that we are right in the conclusions which we have come to.\n As to the 13,000-dollar credit which the auditor and the supreme court and the court of appeals have all disallowed, we are of the opinion that there was sufficient evidence to justify its disallowance. The evidence would seem to justify the finding of the auditor that these particular services thus paid for were of the character generally disignated as lobbying services, and in such case it is proper to follow the general rule of affirming a finding of fact made and confirmed by the courts below, unless the same be clearly erroneous.\n Again, the auditor disallowed in part a claim of some $15,000, which the defendant asserts was paid to two other attorneys for their services, under a special agreement which was made between the administrator of the Earle estate and such attorneys. The auditor made a finding of the facts in regard to such employment, and carefully considered the conditions as they appeared in the proof, and stated that he was of the opinion that the services in question did not require the time and attention of these three gentlemen, and that it would not be just to impose the burden of the payment to them upon this case in such a manner as to diminish the small \n\n[207 U.S. 244, 250]\n\u00a0\n amount which would be found due and payable to the complainant. He therefore in the account allowed a credit for but one half of the amount, which he said was, in his 'judgment, a liberal allowance for the present account.' Counsel for the defendant have failed to show from the evidence in the record that this item was improperly disposed of by the auditor.\n As to the alleged laches on the part of the complainant in bringing this suit, we think the courts below have committed no error in their judgments. The evidence showed that during the time of the life of Mr. Earle, although the books of account were quite meager, yet, such as there were, had been examined by the administrator of Causten, in the office of Mr. Earle, and that objection had been made to the payment of the moneys to these persons in regard to whom the charge of lobbying services was made. There was no account stated, and the failure to bring suit for an accounting until January, 1901, two years after the appropriation act of 1899, from which payment might be made, cannot be regarded as laches to prevent a recovery in this suit.\n The objection that there was in reality no liability on the original contract arising out of services performed by the administrator after the death of William E. Earle cannot be sustained. The accounting has been treated by both parties as one proper to be made for the whole period, including that which elapsed subsequently to the death of Mr. Earle. The defendant recognized this right by making the accounting not only for fees received prior to the death of Mr. Earle, but for such fees as were received under the appropriation act of 1899. The account presented by the Earle estate to the Causten estate admits an indebtedness due from the administrator of the former of something over $2,000, and the account purports to be one between the estate of Earle and the estate of Causten, and it embraces not only fees received by William E. Earle in his lifetime under the appropriation act of 1891, but fees received by the estate of Earle under the appropriation act of 1899. Thus both parties seem to have treated the account as \n\n[207 U.S. 244, 251]\n\u00a0\n one account, with reference to the act of 1891 and also to that of 1899, and we think that, under the circumstances, the defendant should be held liable to account therefor as indicated.\n The account should be restated by allowing credit to the defendant of $ 6,500, the amount paid the attorneys as already stated. As to all other matters, the decree is right. The proper disposition of the case is to dismiss the appeal in No. 12, because the decree appealed from is not a final one, and to reverse the decree in No. 388, for the purpose of making the proper credit to defendant in the account.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","51":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEAST CENTRAL EUREKA MIN CO. v. CENTRAL EUREKA MIN CO(1907)\nNo. 141\nArgued: Decided: January 21, 1907\n\n\n\n Messrs. Jackson H. Ralston, Frederick L. Siddons, William E. Richardson, Campbell, Metson, & Campbell, and Galpin & Bolton for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n[204 U.S. 266, 267]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. S. S. Burdett, Curtis H. Lindley, and Henry Eickhoff for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a writ of error to reverse a decree in favor of the defendant in error, the original plaintiff and hereinafter called \n\n[204 U.S. 266, 268]\n\u00a0\n the plaintiff, which was ordered by the superior court and affirmed by the supreme court of California. 146 Cal. 147, 79 Pac. 834. The decree was made on a bill to quiet title, upon the following facts, which appeared at the trial of the case. The plaintiff is the owner of the 'Summit quartz mine' in California. The apex of a vein runs through this mine between and nearly parallel with the surface side lines. This vein dips under the easterly side line and enters the adjoining land of the defendants, known as the Toman ranch. The controversy concerns the portion of the vein under the defendants' land. The main ground of defense is that the end lines of the mine are not parallel, but converge towards each other in the direction of the ranch, and that the plaintiff's patent was granted on November 25, 1873, when the act of May 10, 1872, chap. 152, 17 Stat. at L. 91, Rev. Stat.  2320, 2322, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 1424, 1425, was in force. Iron Silver Min. Co. v. Elgin Min. & Smelting Co. \n118 U.S. 196\n, 30 L. ed. 98, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1177; Del Monte Min. & Mill. Co. v. Last Chance Min. & Mill. Co. \n171 \nU.S. 55, 67\n, 43 S. L. ed. 72, 77, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 895. But the patent was issued upon an application made on February 7, 1871, based upon two locations of March 20, 1863, and June 22, 1865, respectively. The question is whether the requirement of parallelism in  2 of the act of 1872 (Rev. Stat. 2320) applies to such a case.\n The patent of the mine recites proceedings in pursuance of the Acts of 1866 [14 Stat. at L. 251, chap. 262], 1870 [16 Stat. at L. 217, chap. 235], and 1872, and describes and grants the premises by metes and bounds, with the exclusive right of possession and enjoyment of the same and of 1165 56\/100 linear feet of the vein throughout its entire depth, although it may enter the land adjoining, with similar rights in other veins having their apex within the surface bounds; the extralateral or outside rights in the veins being confined, as by the act of 1872,  3, to such portions as lie between vertical planes drawn downward through the end lines of the survey at the surface, and so continued in their own direction as to intersect the exterior part of the veins. In short, the patent purports to convey the rights claimed by the plaintiff in this suit, and \n\n[204 U.S. 266, 269]\n\u00a0\n also the additional rights that would have been gained by a location and patent under the act of 1872 alone. The defendants derive title from later patents issued under the laws of the United States concerning the sale of agricultural land, and admit that, if the plaintiff's patent conveyed what it purported to convey, then, subject to a question to be mentioned later, the plaintiff must prevail.\n Before the act of 1872 it was not required that the end lines should be parallel (\n118 U.S. 208\n, 30 L. ed. 102, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1177); and when, with some dissent, it was decided that that requirement of that act made a condition to the right of a patentee to follow his vein outside of the vertical planes drawn through his side lines, the decision was confined in terms to cases where the location was made since the passage of the act. Ibid. That there is no such condition when the patent was issued in pursuance of proceedings under the earlier statutes has been decided, so far as we know, when the question has arisen. See e. g. Argonaut Min. Co. v. Kennedy Min. & Mill. Co. 131 Cal. 15, 82 Am. St. Rep. 317, 63 Pac. 148; Carson City Gold & S. Min. Co. v. North Star Min. Co. 28 C. C. A. 333, 48 U. S. App. 724, 83 Fed. 658, 669. The granting of the patent indicates what we believe to be a fact, that the construction of the act of 1872 adopted at the time by the land office agreed with the decisions of the courts. Unless, therefore, the meaning of the act of 1872 is pretty plainly the other way, this consensus of opinion and practice must be accorded considerable weight.\n Apart from the last-mentioned considerations we are of opinion that the act of 1872 authorized the plaintiff's patent. Under the former law the miner located the lode. Calhoun Gold Min. Co. v. Ajax Gold Min. Co. \n182 \nU.S. 499, 508\n, 45 S. L. ed. 1200, 1206, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 885. When the act of 1872 substituted the location of a piece of land by surface boundaries, it preserved the rights of locators to all mining locations previously made in compliance with law and local regulations, and provided that they should 'have the exclusive right of possession and enjoyment of all the surface included within the lines of their locations, and of \n\n[204 U.S. 266, 270]\n\u00a0\n all veins, lodes, and ledges throughout their entire depth, the top or apex of which lies inside of such surface-lines extended downward vertically, although such veins, lodes, or ledges may so far depart from a perpendicular in their course downward as to extend outside the vertical side lines of said surface locations.'  3. Rev. Stat. 2322. It is argued that this refers only to possessory rights, and that when a patent was applied for it was required to conform to the new law; that under the old law the miner got but a single vein, while the new law gave him all veins having their apex within the surface, and that when he accepted this advantage he had to comply with the conditions, as otherwise he would be given a preference over later comers. It is said further that in the present case no rights had been acquired. These arguments do not command our assent, for reasons which we will state.\n A broader construction of the passage quoted from  3 is favored by other provisions in the act. It provided that the repeal of certain sections of the act of 1866 'shall not affect existing rights. Applications for patents for mining claims now pending may be prosecuted to a final decision in the General Land Office; But, in such cases, when adverse rights are not affected thereby, patents may issue in pursuance of the provisions of this act.'  9. So in  12. 'nor shall this act affect any right acquired under said act' (of 1866). And in  16, 'Provided, that nothing contained in this act shall be construed to impair, in any way, rights or interests in mining property acquired under existing laws.' Whatever ambiguity may be found in the first of these quotations, the last is plain. The chance of a possible advantage to outstanding applicants does not seem to us to outweigh the injustice of preventing them from getting what the law had promised as the reward for the steps they had taken in accordance with its invitation.\n The provision that the acts shall not impair existing rights is, perhaps, some indication that it extends to inchoate rights which constitutionally it might have impaired. At all events, \n\n[204 U.S. 266, 271]\n\u00a0\n it should be taken in a liberal sense. There was no sufficient reason why the United States should not be liberal, and, as we have said, it was just that it should be. We are of opinion that in the present case rights had been acquired within the meaning of the act. It is said that the survey of the mineral patent was not approved or payment made to the United States until after the passage of the act of 1872. But the location had been made and the proceedings under the act of 1866 so far advanced as to exclude adverse claims. The locator had done all that he could do, and we are satisfied that the act of 1872 intended to treat parties that were in that position as having rights that were to be preserved. If Congress were unrestricted by the Constitution, the word 'rights' still would be the natural word to express the relation of persons to this kind of property, where the facts required the officers of the government to take steps necessary to permit them to acquire it, and they were seeking to acquire it, and had manifested their intent and desire by occupation, labor, and expenditures. Yet, on that supposition, there could be no technically legal right. We believe that Congress used the word in a somewhat popular sense, as no doubt it would have used it in the case supposed, without considering what injustice might be within its constitutional power to commit. See Clipper Min. Co. v. Eli Min. & Land Co. \n194 U.S. 220\n, 48 L. ed. 944, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 632; Creede & C. C. Min. & Mill. Co. v. Uinta Tunnel Min. & Transp. Co. \n196 \nU.S. 337, 342\n, 49 S. L. ed. 501, 505, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 266.\n The plaintiff is not responsible for the form of the patent. It grants the rights that would have been granted under the act of 1866, and the fact that it also purports to grant all that would have been acquired by a location under the act of 1872 does not import an election by the grantee to abandon the former. We do not mean to disparage the additional grant, but, as was pointed out by the California court, the question before us does not touch that point.\n The defendants rely, for a further defense, upon a quitclaim deed, from the plaintiff, of the land under which lies the por- \n\n[204 U.S. 266, 272]\n\u00a0\n tion of the vein in dispute. The land was described as lying east of the mining ground known as the Summit quartz mine. Assuming, in accordance with its decision, that the part of the vein under this land was embraced in the patent to the plaintiff, and severed from the surface, the California court held that this instrument did not purport to convey the portion of the vein beneath the surface and within the converging lines, produced, of the plaintiff's location. The court also adverted to the fact, which sufficiently appeared that the real object of the deed was to free the defendants' title from a previous contract on their part to convey the land, and simply to replace the grantees in their former position; and it sustained a finding of the court below. The construction and effect of a conveyance between private parties is a matter as to which we follow the court of the state. Brine v. Hartford F. Ins. Co. \n96 \nU.S. 627, 636\n, 24 S. L. ed. 858, 861; De Vaughn v. Hutchinson, \n165 U.S. 566\n, 41 L. ed. 827, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 461. The assumption upon which that construction proceeded we have decided to be correct, and it is enough to add that there is nothing in the decision rendered last week in Montana Min. Co. v. St. Louis Min. & Mill. Co. \n204 U.S. 204\n, 51 L. ed. 444, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 254, that prevents our agreeing with the result.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","52":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEAU CLAIRE NAT. BANK v. JACKMAN(1907)\nNo. 163\nArgued: Decided: February 25, 1907\n\n\n\n This action was brought by defendant in error, hereafter called the trustee, in the circuit court of Eau Claire county, state of Wisconsin, against the plaintiff in error, hereafter called the bank, under  60b of the bankrupt act of 1898 [30 Stat. at L. 562, chap. 541, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3445], to recover the value of property which, it is alleged, was transferred by the bankrupt to the bank, for the purpose of giving the latter a preference over other creditors. Judgment was recovered by the trustee, which, on appeal, was affirmed by the supreme court of the state. 125 Wis. 465, 104 N. W. 98. Thereupon this writ of error was sued out.\n The complaint of the trustee alleges that on the 7th of June, 1902, John H. Young duly filed his petition in bank- \n\n[204 U.S. 522, 523]\n\u00a0\n ruptcy in the United States district court for the western district of Wisconsin, pursuant to the act of Congress, and was on said day duly declared a bankrupt. Subsequently defendant in error was duly elected and appointed by the creditions of the bankrupt as trustee in bankruptcy, and duly qualified as such trustee.\n The plaintiff in error is and was, at all the times mentioned in the complaint, a national bank. Young, during the four months immediately preceding the filing of his petition, was the owner and in possession of certain lumber, shingles, and lath, located at Cadott, Chippewa county, Wisconsin, and certain logs in or near the Yellow river and Chippewa river in Chippewa county, which were reasonably worth the sum of $35,000. The value of all other property owned by him did not exceed the sum of $500.\n On the 10th of February, 1902, Young was wholly insolvent, and owed debts which largely exceeded the value of his property, which fact was well known to him and the bank. The aggregate amount of his indebtedness exceeded the sum of $40,000, and the value of his property was substantially $35,000. He was indebted to the bank in the sum of $27,000 for moneys borrowed from time to time for a period of about two years previous to that time. On said day Young executed to the bank a chattel mortgage on 2,100,000 feet of saw logs, to secure the sum of $15,900, then owing from him to the bank, and also executed a chattel mortgage, transferring 1,000,000 feet of lumber, about 600,000 shingles, and about 200,000 lath, to secure the sum of $11,100, owing by him to the bank. This indebtedness existed long prior to said mortgages, and the property transferred constituted substantially all of the property then owned by Young not exempt from execution, which facts were well known by him and the bank. The effect of the foreclosure of the mortgages would be to enable the bank to obtain a much larger percentage of its debt than would the other creditors of Young in the same class as the bank. The mortgages were given by Young and taken \n\n[204 U.S. 522, 524]\n\u00a0\n by the bank for the sole purpose of hindering and delaying the other creditors, and were executed and received for that purpose, and the bank, at the time of their execution, had reasonable cause to believe that they were given with the intention to give it a preference over other creditors.\n The Waters-Clark Lumber Company is a corporation of the state of Minnesota, and D. S. Clark is the president thereof and also a director in the bank, and W. K. Coffin is the cashier of the latter. On or about the 10th of March, 1902, Coffin, acting for the bank, requested Young to transfer to the lumber company, for the benefit of the bank, all of the property embraced in the mortgages, together with certain other property. Pursuant to such request Young did, on or about the 10th of March, 1902, transfer, by absolute bills of sale, to the lumber company, all of the property described in the mortgages, and other saw logs owned by him. The property transferred was reasonably worth the sum of $35,000. Immediately on the execution of the bills of sale the lumber company, acting pursuant to the directions by and in behalf of the bank, took possession of the property transferred, and thereafter sold the same and applied the proceeds to the payment of the indebtedness secured by the mortgages. At the time the bills of sale were made the lumber company and the bank though the property transferred constituted all of the available assets of Young, and that the result of such transfer and the appropriation of the proceeds thereof would result in the other creditors of Young losing all of his indebtedness to them. The lumber company, acting as vendee of said property, was in reality acting as trustee for the bank, and made such pretended purchase with the understanding and agreement with the bank and Young that it would account to the bank for the proceeds of the property transferred to the amount of his indebtedness, and that any sums realized in excess of his indebtedness should be paid to Young. The bills of sale were not executed in compliance with the statutes of the state. Except as to the agreement \n\n[204 U.S. 522, 525]\n\u00a0\n to pay said indebtedness, no consideration was paid by the lumber company for the property, and, at the time of the transfer of the property, nothing was paid to Young therefor. By reason of said transactions the bank, within four months, appropriated to the payment of its claims substantially all of the property of Young, which said time was and has been ever since worth $35,000. There is no other property in the possession of the trustee, belonging to Young, out of which his other creditors can be paid.\n The bank demurred to the complaint on the following grounds: The court had no jurisdiction of the subject of the action; the trustee had no legal capacity to sue, in that the complaint did not allege that authority or permission was given him to bring suit; defect of parties, in that Young and the lumber company were not made parties; and that the complaint did not state a cause of action. The demurrer was overruled, and the bank, availing itself of the permission granted, filed an answer, in which it admitted its corporate character and that of the lumber company, and the execution of the mortgages and the bills of sale, and that the instruments were not executed in the manner provided by the statutes of the state. It denied all the other allegations of the complaint, and alleged that a portion of the proceeds of the sale of the property was paid to the bank to discharge valid and existing liens which it held against the property. And it alleged that the mortgages were given for a good and valuable consideration, and that neither of them nor the payments to the bank were made or received for the purpose of giving the bank a preforence over other creditors of Young, 'contrary to the provisions of the bankruptcy laws,' and 'that, prior to the commencement of this action, the plaintiff commenced an action in this court against said Waters-Clark Lumber Company to recover from said Waters-Clark Lumber Company the purchase price of logs and other material sold by said Young to said Waters-Clark Lumber Company, and thereby elected to treat and consider said contract between \n\n[204 U.S. 522, 526]\n\u00a0\n said Young and said Waters-Clark Lumber Company as legal and valid, and elected to look to and hold the said Waters-Clark Lumber Company, instead of this defendant, as liable to said trustee for all sums of money which the said plaintiff may be entitled to recover on account of the transactions mentioned in plaintiff's complaint.'\n Questions were submitted to the jury covering the issues in the case, except the value of the property, which, by stipulation of parties, was reserved for the court. The jury, in response to the questions, found that at all the days mentioned in the complaint the property transferred at a fair valuation was insufficient to pay Young's debts; that the lumber company, acting for the bank and pursuant to the arrangement between it and the bank, took the legal title to the lumber and logs for the benefit of the bank under an agreement with it and Young to account to the bank for a portion of the proceeds; that it was the intention of Young, by the execution of the mortgages and the transfer of the property, to give the bank a preference, and that the bank and officers and agents had reasonable cause to believe that Young intended to give it such preference and to enable it to obtain a greater percentage of its indebtedness than any other of his creditors of the same class would be able to obtain.\n The court found that the lumber which was included in the bank's mortgage was worth $3,452.85, and that a note for that sum and value was given by the lumber company to Young and by him transferred to the bank; that the Cadott logs, included in the mortgage and sold by Young to the lumber company, were worth $10,077.84; that the up-river logs not included in the mortgage, but sold to the lumber company by Young, were worth $11, 055.84; and that a note which was given as the net proceeds of the sale of both quantities of logs over and above certain labor liens was worth $2, 508.14. This note was given by the lumber company to Young and transferred by him to the bank. The trustee contended in the trial court that he was entitled to recover \n\n[204 U.S. 522, 527]\n\u00a0\n for the entire value of the logs and lumber, and that no credit should be allowed the bank for the sums paid by it to discharge certain liens on the property for labor claims and unpaid purchase money. The court rejected the contentions and gave judgment for the trustee in the sum of $6,254.99. In this sum was included the value of the notes.\n The assignments of error are that the supreme court erred in the following particulars: (1) In determining that the complaint stated a cause of action. (2) In determining that the bank was liable for the value of the logs and lumber to the extent of the chattel mortgage interest of the bank therein. (3) In determining that the bank was liable for having received a preference contrary to  60a and 60b of the bankrupt act of July 1, 1898, as 'a portion of its chattel mortgage interest in said logs, the sum of $1,335.62 as the proceeds of the sale of the portion of said logs known as the 'up-river logs,' on which logs said defendant never held any chattel mortgage, and which logs were never transferred to said defendant.' (4) In determining that the bank was liable for the value and moneys it received as a preference, although the trustee had not elected to avoid such preference by bringing suit to recover the same, and had not elected to avoid such preference in any manner. (5) And in holding that, in determining a question of preference, it was immaterial, under the bankrupt act, whether the bank and the other creditors were of the same class, and in refusing to reverse the judgment because of the error of the circuit court in charging the jury that all of the creditors were of the same class. (6) In its construction of the bankrupt act in the following particulars: (a) In holding that a transfer made within four months of the bankruptcy proceedings, which enabled a creditor to obtain any portion of his debt, constituted a preference. (b) That, although the effect of the transfer in question did not operate to give the bank a greater percentage of its debts than other creditors of the same class, such transfer constituted a preference. (c) In determining, \n\n[204 U.S. 522, 528]\n\u00a0\n by such rules of construction of the bankrupt act, that the evidence was sufficient to establish that the bank had reasonable cause to believe that a preference was intended. (7) (8) (9) In holding that the bank was liable for the full value of the preference received in an amount in excess of what was necessary to pay all the other creditors of the bankrupt, and claims of fictitious creditors and claims of creditors who had themselves received preference, and in not limiting the recovery to such sum as would be sufficient to pay the claims of creditors whose claims were provable. ( 10) (11) In affirming the judgment against the bank, and not rendering judgment for it.\n Messrs. James Wickham, Burr W. Jones, and Frank R. Farr for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[204 U.S. 522, 530]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. C. T. Bundy, W. P. Bartlett, and R. P. Wilcox for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice McKenna: \n\n[204 U.S. 522, 531]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna, after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the court:\n A motion is made to dismiss on the ground that the record \n\n[204 U.S. 522, 532]\n\u00a0\n presents nothing but questions of fact. It is contended that neither in the pleadings of the bank nor in any way was any right, privilege, or immunity under a Federal statute specifically set up or claimed in the state courts. The only questions presented by the pleadings, it is urged, were, did the bankrupt give the bank a preference, and did the bank accept it with reasonable grounds to believe that a preference was intended? The supreme court, however, considered the pleadings to have broader meaning, and answered some of the contentions of the bank by the construction it gave to the bankrupt act. The case, therefore, comes within the ruling in Nutt v. Knut, \n200 U.S. 12\n, 50 L. ed. 348, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 216. It was there said: 'A party who insists that a judgment cannot be rendered against him consistently with the statutes of the United States may be fairly held, within the meaning of  709 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901 p. 575), to assert a right and immunity under such statutes, although the statutes may not give the party himself a personal or affirmative right that could be enforced by direct suit against his adversary. See also Rector v. City Deposit Bank Co. \n200 U.S. 405\n, 50 L. ed. 527, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 289.\n On the merits of the case we start with the facts established against the bank, that the property of Young, at the time he executed the chattel mortgages and when he executed the deed to the lumber company, at a fair valuation, was insufficient to pay his debts, and that, by the execution of those instruments, and the transfer of his property effected thereby, he intended to give the bank a preference over his other creditors, and that the bank had reasonable cause to believe that he intended thereby to give it a preference, and to enable it to obtain a greater percentage of its debt than any other creditor of Young of the came class. These, then, are the prominent facts, and seemingly justified the judgment. Against this result what does the bank urge? It urges, first, that there is included in the judgment the sum of $1,335.62, the net proceeds of the sale of certain logs, called the 'up-river-logs,' which, it is contended, were not covered by either of \n\n[204 U.S. 522, 533]\n\u00a0\n the mortgages, and that the supreme court, in its opinion, apparently supposed that those logs were covered by the mortgages, and erred in giving judgment therefor. This is a misunderstanding of the opinion. While the court did not explicitly distinguish between the mortgages and the deed to the lumber company, we think it is clear that the court regarded the deed, and what was to be done under it, as the consummation of the 'legal wrong,' to use the language of the court, which went back to the time of the mortgages. In other words, that the upriver logs as well as the other property were conveyed to the lumber company for the purpose of giving a preference to the bank.\n The bank also attempts to urge against this conclusion the different views expressed by the trial court and the supreme court upon the finding of the jury as to the relation which the lumber company stood to the bank. The jury found, in answer to questions 4 and 5, that the lumber company, acting for the bank, took the legal title for the benefit of the latter under an agreement with Young and the bank to account to it for a portion of the proceeds. The trial court said that this was not a finding 'that the lumber company was the agent of the bank.' The supreme court thought that the jury 'pretty clearly decided' that the bank was a principal and the lumber company 'a mere agent' in the matter. It is true the supreme court immediately added: 'However, the evidence seems to clearly establish that the lumber company purchased the property from Young in the regular course of business, without any understanding with the defendant, other than that its interest in the property as mortgagee and claimant under numerous statutory labor liens should be recognized, and the equivalent thereof in money delivered to it out of the proceeds.' [125 Wis. 478, 104 N. W. 102.] And this was deemed sufficient to accomplish the preference which Young intended to give the bank. The court passed over, as not important, the distinction between the notes given by the lumber company to Young as the purchase price of the lumber. \n\n[204 U.S. 522, 534]\n\u00a0\n These minor matters out of the way, we come to the more important contentions of the bank. These contentions are expressed in the form of questions, the first of which is: 'Can a trustee in bankruptcy, under the provisions of the bankruptcy act, lawfully maintain a suit to recover the value of a voidable preference without first electing to avoid such preference by notice to the creditor receiving such preference, and by demand for its return?'\n It is urged by the bank that it cannot, and to sustain this contention, that a preference is not void, but voidable. And voidable solely at the election of the trustee, who must indicate a purpose to do so. The argument is that, a preference being voidable, the creditor receiving it is not in default until he fail to or refuse to surrender it on demand. Prior to that time his possession is rightful and lawful, and he is not guilty of any wrong, tort, or conversion. And the demand, it is further urged, must be made before suit, for, it seems also to be contended, that the creditor must be given an opportunity to exercise the election given him by subdivision g of  57 of the bankrupt act to surrender the preference and prove his claim. We say, 'seems to be contended,' because we are not clear that counsel for the bank claims that the rights of a creditor under 57g depend upon the action of the trustee. Counsel say:\n'The bankrupt act, therefore, contemplates that the trustee shall exercise his election as to whether or not he shall avoid a preference, and it also contemplates that the creditor receiving such alleged preference must exercise an election as to what course he shall take. Until the trustee exercises his election, no cause of action accrues. The creditor is not called upon to elect what course he shall take until the trustee has acted. It therefore follows that the trustee should exercise his election and make his demand before commencing suit.'\n\n And this, it is argued, is more than a mere question of state practice, and involves the question whether the property consisting of the alleged preference is any part of the trust \n\n[204 U.S. 522, 535]\n\u00a0\n estate. If it be intended by this to assert that the action of the creditor under 57g is to wait upon or depends upon the action of the trustee under  60, we do not assent, and nothing can be deduced, therefore, from the supposed relation of those sections as to the necessity of a demand before suit. We do not see how such a demand can even be an element in the consideration of the creditor, whether he will surrender the preference and prove his debt. The right of surrender exists as well after suit as before suit. Keppel v. Tiffin Sav. Bank, \n197 U.S. 356\n, 49 L. ed. 790, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 443.\n Independently of such considerations, whether the election by a trustee to avoid a preference should be exercised by a demand before suit or can be exercised by the suit itself might be difficult to determine if it were necessary on the record. 1 Chitty, Pl. 176, and cases cited; Shuman v. Fleckenstein, 4 Sawy. 174, Fed. Cas. No. 12,826; Brooke v. McCraken Fed. Cas. No. 1,932; Wright v. Skinner, 136 Fed. 694; Goldberg v. Harlan, 33 Ind. App. 465, 67 N. E. 707. But we do not think it is open to the bank to urge the first. The bank, it is true, demurred to the complaint and urged as a ground of demurrer the absence of an allegation of a demand. But the bank did not stand on the demurrer. It answered, and not only traversed the allegations of the plaintiff, but set up an independent defense, and showed that a demand would have been unavailing, and a demand is not necessary where it is to be presumed that it would have been unavailing. Davenport v. Ladd, 38 Minn. 545, 38 N. W. 622; Bogle v. Gordon, 39 Kan. 31, 17 Pac. 857. Besides, it appears that a demand was made before suit. In determining from what date interest should be given the trial court said: 'There is evidence of a demand, but I think only a short time elapsed until action was commenced, so that it will make little difference whether interest is computed from the time of the demand or the commencement of the action.'\n The trial court instructed the jury substantially, in the words of subdivision a of  60 of the bankrupt act, as \n\n[204 U.S. 522, 536]\n\u00a0\n to when a debtor should be deemed to have given a preference, and, in explanation of the intention of the debtor, said to 'intend to prefer would be to make a transfer for the purpose of enabling the bank to obtain a greater percentage of its debt than any other debtors of the same class.' And, defining this class of creditors, said further: 'So far as creditors' rights are involved in this action, they are all of the same class, by which is meant they would receive the same percentage of their claims. Claims for taxes or wages within certain times, so as to be preferred, would be of a different class. But claims of general creditors, like those approved in the Young bankruptcy proceedings, are all of the same class.' The bank excepted, and assigned as error the charge that all of the creditors were of the same class. Disposing of the assignment the supreme court said: 'Whether that is right or wrong does not seem to in any way concern the case. This action, as we have indictated, is simply one in trover to recover the value of property which, as is alleged, was, in fraud of the bankrupt act, wrongfully converted by defendant to its own use. Whether there was one or more classes of creditors, and in what manner the property sought to be recovered would, if the suit were successful, be administered, did not vary in the slightest degree the legal rights of the plaintiff. If the property was obtained by the defendant in fraud of the bankrupt act, plaintiff was entitled to recover the same, and this is the only question involved.'\n The bank contests this view, and contends that, if accepted, 'it would be impossible to ascertain whether or not the preference had been received without first determining the question of whether the enforcement of the transfer would enable the bank to recover a greater percentage of its debt than other creditors of the same class.' But there is a question of fact to be considered. It was a question of fact what claims were proved against the estate. At the trial the learned judge who presided described them in his instructions as claims of general creditors. In his memorandum opinion \n\n[204 U.S. 522, 537]\n\u00a0\n he said that, from his minutes and the statements of the evidence in the briefs of counsel, he was inclined to believe that the point was not well taken that the evidence did not show that the effect of the enforcement of the transfer would be to enable the bank to obtain a greater percentage of its debt than other creditors of the same class. The bank, in its brief in this court, says, 'certain other claims were filed and allowed in the bankruptcy proceedings as preferred claims. These were probably claims for wages after the time of the transfers in question.' In the list of claims referred to some only are marked preferred. But, granting that they all were, they were represented by the trustee.\n The other questions propounded by the bank are based on the sixth assignment of error. We will not examine the arguments of counsel for the bank in detail. Their fundamental contention is that the transfers to the bank were not invalid as a preference if their enforcement would not operate to give the bank a greater percentage of its debt than other creditors of the same class would receive. And such, it is further contended, was not the result, and it is intimated that claims of possible and fictitious creditors were in effect considered. But this contention encounters the facts found by the jury and the trial court. We have already seen what, in the opinion of the trial court, the evidence established as to the effect of the transfers, and the jury found that Young was insolvent at the time they were made, and that the purpose of their execution was to give the bank a preference and to enable it to obtain a greater percentage of its debt than other creditors of Young of the same class. These findings were not disturbed by the supreme court, and we must accept them as stating the facts established by the evidence, although counsel seem to invoke an examination by us of the record against them. Taking them as true, they show a case of preference and grounds to set it aside. The bank also contends, in effect, that in such suit the validity of all other claims against the bankrupt can be litigated, and \n\n[204 U.S. 522, 538]\n\u00a0\n whether they have received voidable preferences and have not been required to surrender them. The broad effect of the contention repels it as unsound. To yield to it would transfer the administration of a bankrupt's estate from the United States district court to the state court.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","53":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nELDER v. PEOPLE OF STATE OF COLORADO EX INF STIDGER EX REL(1907)\nNo. 132\nArgued: Decided: January 7, 1907\n\n\n\n This was a proceeding, in the nature of quo warranto, brought in a district (state) court of Colorado, to test, as between conflicting claimants (Charles W. Badgley and Charles S. Elder), the title to the office of county treasurer of the city and county of Denver. The relator ( Badgley) relied upon a general election held pursuant to the general statutes of Colorado on November 8, 1904, while the defendant (Elder) claimed to be the legal incumbent of the office by virtue of his election to the office of treasurer of the city and county of Denver in May, 1904, under authority of the charter of said city and county of Denver. The question presented for decision was whether the election held in May, 1904, under the charter, of officers to per- \n\n[204 U.S. 85, 86]\n\u00a0\n form the duties required of county officers in the city and county of Denver, was lawful, or whether such officers should have been voted for under the general statutes of the state at the election held in November, 1904. A determination of this question made necessary a consideration of certain provisions of article 20 of the state Constitution, providing for the creation, from the old county of Arapahoe and the old city of Denver and other municipalities, of a new entity to be known as the city and county of Denver, and conferring authority to provide in the charter for the appointment or election of officers of such city and county. In particular, a construction was required of a clause providing that 'every charter shall designate the officers who shall respectively perform the acts and duties required of county officers to be done by the Constitution or the general laws, as far as applicable.' The district court sustained a demurrer to the complaint and entered judgment for the defendant. This judgment was reversed by the supreme court of the state, upon the authority of People ex rel. Miller v. Johnson (86 Pac. 233) and judgment was entered in that court in favor of the relator (86 Pac. 250), deciding in effect that the charter provision under which defendant claimed was repugnant to the Constitution of Colorado. The case was then brought here.\n Messrs. Charles R. Brock, Robert H. Elder, and Milton Smith for plaintiff in error. \n\n[204 U.S. 85, 87]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Henry J. Hersey for defendants in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice White:\n\n Mr. Justice White, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The assignments of error are twenty-one in number. All of them rest upon the assumption that the supreme court of Colorado held that article 20 of the state Constitution, particularly  2 and 3, were repugnant to the provision of the Constitution of the United States guaranteeing to every state a republican form of government and to the act of Congress known as the Colorado enabling act, and that by such ruling rights possessed by the people of the state of Colorado and rights vested in the people of the city and county of Denver were invaded. And upon the assumption that such rulings were made all the Federal questions relied on are based.\n On behalf of the defendant in error it is insisted that the supreme court of Colorado did not decide any question under the Constitution of the United States, but merely disposed of the case before it upon its construction of the meaning of the provision of the state Constitution which was involved and upon the authority of a previous decision rendered by the Colorado court. It is not denied that in the course of the opinion of the supreme court of Colorado it was said that if the article of the state Constitution in question was susceptible of a contrary \n\n[204 U.S. 85, 88]\n\u00a0\n construction to that affixed to it by the court, it would be repugnant to the guaranty of a republican form of government, etc. This, it is said, was mere obiter, as the court considered and held the provision valid.\n If we were to indulge in the hypothesis that the assumptions upon which the assignments of error rest were sustained by the record, and were besides to assume that, at the proper time and in the proper manner, it had been asserted that to hold article 20 invalid would be repugnant to the Constitution of the United States, the case would yet not be within the purview of  709, Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 575). Under this section the power to review the judgment of a state court exists only in the following classes of cases: a Where is drawn in question the validity of a treaty or statute of, or an authority exercised under, the United States, and the decision is against their validity; b. Where is drawn in question the validity of a statute of, or an authority exercised under, any state, on the ground of their being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States, and the decision is in favor of their validity; c. 'Where any title, right, privilege, or immunity is claimed under the Constitution, or any treaty or statute of, or commission held or authority exercised under, the United States.'\n It is plain that the case is not embraced within subdivision a. Nor can it be said to be embraced within subdivision b, for if we consider that the court below, instead of construing and upholding the constitutional provision in question, actually held it to be invalid because repugnant to the Constitution of the United States, such decision was against, and not in favor of, the validity of the article. Nor is the case embraced within subdivision c, for nowhere in the record does it appear that the plaintiff in error, specially or otherwise, set up or claimed in the courts of Colorado any title, right, privilege, or immunity under the Constitution of the United States.\n Indeed, under the circumstances disclosed, if there had been an assertion of a right, title, privilege, or immunity under the Constitution of the United States it would have been so friv- \n\n[204 U.S. 85, 89]\n\u00a0\n olous as not to afford a basis of jurisdiction, since it is foreclosed that a mere contest over a state office, dependent for its solution exclusively upon the application of the Constitution of a state or upon a mere construction of a provision of a state law, involves no possible Federal question.

Carlton for defendant in error.\n\n\n[206 U.S. 246, 254]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n These are an indictment and informations under the act of August 1, 1892, chap. 352, 27 Stat. at L. 340, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2521, 'Relating to the Limitation of the Hours of Daily Service of Laborers and Mechanics Employed upon the Public Works of the United States and of the District of Columbia.' They all bring up the question of the constitutionality of the act, and they severally present some subordinate matters, which will be considered under the respective cases.\n The act limits the service and employment of all laborers and mechanics employed by the United States, by the District of Columbia, or by any contractor or subcontractor upon any of the public works of the United States or the District, to eight hours in any one calendar day, and makes it unlawful 'to require or permit any such laborer or mechanic to work more than eight hours in any calendar day except in case of extraordinary emergency.' By  2 'any officer or agent of the government of the United States or of the District \n\n[206 U.S. 246, 255]\n\u00a0\n of Columbia, or any contractor or subcontractor whose duty it shall be to employ, direct, or control any laborer or mechanic employed upon any of the public works of the United States or of the District of Columbia, who shall intentionally violate any provision of this act, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and for each and every such offense shall upon conviction, be punished by a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars or by imprisonment for not more than six months, or by both such fine and imprisonment, in the discretion of the court having jurisdiction thereof.' The plaintiffs in error were contractors within the scope of the act, were found guilty, and were fined. They all requested rulings that the act was unconstitutional, excepted to the refusal so to rule, and on that ground brought their cases to this court.\n The contention that the act is unconstitutional is not frivolous, since it may be argued that there are relevant distinctions between the power of the United States and that of a state. But the arguments naturally urged against such a statute apply equally for the most part to the two jurisdictions, and are answered, so far as a state is concerned, by Atkin v. Kansas, \n191 U.S. 207\n, 48 L. ed. 148, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 124. In that case a contractor for work upon a municipal boulevard was sentenced to a fine under a similar law of Kansas, and the statute was upheld. We see no reason to deny to the United States the power thus established for the states. Like the states, it may sanction the requirements made of contractors employed upon its public works by penalties in case those requirements are not fulfilled. It would be a strong thing to say that a legislature that had power to forbid or to authorize and enforce a contract had not also the power to \n\n[206 U.S. 246, 256]\n\u00a0\n make a breach of it criminal; but, however that may be, Congress, as incident to its power to authorize and enforce contracts for public works, may require that they shall be carried out only in a way consistent with its views of public policy, and may punish a departure from that way. It is true that it has not the general power of legislation possessed by the legislatures of the states, and it may be true that the object of this law is of a kind not subject to its general control. But the power that it has over the mode in which contracts with the United States shall be performed cannot be limited by a speculation as to motives. If the motive be conceded, however, the fact that Congress has not general control over the conditions of labor does not make unconstitutional a law otherwise valid, because the purpose of the law is to secure to it certain advantages, so far as the law goes.\n One other argument is put forward, but it hardly needs an answer. A ruling was asked in Ellis's case, and is attempted to be sustained, to the effect that the government waived its sovereignty by making a contract, and that even if the act of 1892 were read into the contract, a breach of its requirements would be only a breach of contract, and could not be made a crime. This is a mere confusion of ideas. The government, purely as contractor, in the absence of special laws, may stand like a private person; but, by making a contract, it does not give up its power to make a law, and it may make a law like the present for the reasons that we have stated. We are of opinion that the act is not contrary to the Constitution of the United States.\n We pass to the subordinate matters not common to all the cases. In Ellis's case the plaintiff in error agreed to construct and complete pier No. 2 at the Boston navy yard, within six months, according to certain specifications, and at a certain price. He found more difficulty than he expected, although he expected some trouble, in getting certain oak and pine piles called for by the contract, and, having been delayed by that cause, he permitted his associate in the business to employ men for nine hours, in the hurry to get the work done. The \n\n[206 U.S. 246, 257]\n\u00a0\n judge instructed the jury that the evidence did not show an 'extraordinary emergency' within the meaning of the act. The judge was right in ruling upon the matter. Even if, as in other instances, a nice case might be left to the jury, what emergencies are within the statute is merely a constituent element of a question of law, since the determination of that element determines the extent of the statutory prohibition and is material only to that end. The ruling was correct. It needs no argument to show that the disappointment of a contractor with regard to obtaining some of his materials-a matter which he knew involved some difficulty, of which he took the risk-does not create such an emergency as is contemplated in the exception to the law. Again, the construction of the pier was desirable for the more convenient repair of war ships, but it was not essential. Vessels had been docked without it since 1835 or 1836, so that there was no hot haste on that account, if, under any circumstances, that kind of need would have been enough.\n There is only one other question raised in Ellis's case. It is admitted that he was a contractor within the meaning of the act, and that the workmen permitted to work more than eight hours a day were employed upon 'public works,' and it is not denied that these workmen were 'mechanics.' The jury were instructed, subject to exception, that, if the defendant intended to permit the men to work over eight hours on the calendar day named, he intended to violate the statute. The argument against the instruction is that the word 'intentionally' in the statute requires knowledge of the law; or at least that, to be convicted, Ellis must not have supposed, even mistakenly, that there was an emergency extraordinary enough to justify his conduct. The latter proposition is only the former a little disguised. Both are without foundation. If a man intentionally adopts certain conduct in certain circumstances known to him, and that conduct is forbidden by the law under those circumstances, he intentionally breaks the law in the only sense in which the law ever considers intent. The judgment in this case must be affirmed. \n\n[206 U.S. 246, 258]\n\u00a0\n The three cases against the Eastern Dredging Company were informations for employing certain men alleged to be laborers or mechanics more than eight hours a day upon what was alleged to be one of the public works of the United States; viz., dredging a portion of the 35-foot channel, so called, in Boston harbor. The cases against the Bay State Dredging Company were similar, except that the place was Chelsea creek in Boston harbor. Of the former, No. 664 was in three counts for employing two deck hands and an assistant crane man and deck hand upon a dredge; No. 665 was for employing the master, crane man, and fireman of the dredge; and No. 666 was for employing the captain, mate, engineer, and foreman of a tug that towed a scow, etc., and a man in charge of the scow. Of the Bay State Dredging Company cases, No. 667 was for employing the captain, mate, and fireman of a dredge; No. 668 was for employing a crane man and deck hand on the dredge; and No. 669 was for employing a scow man and the captain and engineer of a tug. The offenses were admitted or proved subject to the questions that already have been considered, and to the further questions whether the dredging was upon one of the public works of the United States, and whether the persons employed were laborers or mechanics within the meaning of the act, with one or two lesser points that will not need to be discussed.\n Both of the phrases to be construed admit a broad enough interpretation to cover these cases, but the question is whether that interpretation is reasonable, and, in a penal statute, fair. Certainly they may be read in a narrower sense with at least equal ease. The statute says, 'laborers and mechanics . . . employed . . . upon any of the public works.' It does not say, and no one supposes it to mean, 'any public work.' The words 'upon' and 'any of the,' and the plural 'works' import that the objects of labor referred to have some kind of permanent existence and structural unity, and are severally capable of being regarded as complete wholes. The fact that the persons mentioned as employed upon them are laborers and \n\n[206 U.S. 246, 259]\n\u00a0\n mechanics, words admitted not to include seamen, points in the direction of structures and away from the sea. The very great difficulty, if not impossibility, of dredging in the ocean if such a law is to govern it, is a reason for giving the defendants the benefit of a doubt; and the fact that until last year the government worked dredging crews more than eight hours is a practical construction not without its weight. A change seems to have been made simply for the sake of consistency between the different departments of the government, as is stated in an order of the Secretary of War. A different conclusion is sought to be drawn from some appropriation acts, but they simply refer to the improvement of harbors in general terms among the public works for which appropriations are made. The improvement of a harbor may consist in the erection of structures as well as in the widening of a channel, or the explosion of a rock. It is unnecessary to lay special stress on the title to the soil in which the channels were dug, but it may be noticed that it was not in the United States. The language of the acts is 'public works of the United States.' As the works are things upon which the labor is expended, the most natural meaning of 'of the United States' is 'belonging to the United States.'\n The words 'laborers and mechanics' are admitted not to apply to seamen as that name commonly is used. Therefore it was contended but faintly that the masters of the tugs could not be employed more than eight hours. But the argument does not stop with masters of tugs, or even with mates, engineers, and firemen of the same. Wilson v. The Ohio, Gilpin, 505, Fed. Cas. No. 17,825; Holt v. Cummings, 102 Pa. 212, 48 Am. Rep. 199. The scows and the floating dredges were vessels. Rev. Stat.  3, 4612, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 4, 3120. They were within the admiralty jurisdiction of the United States. The Robert W. Parsons (Perry v. Haines) \n191 U.S. 17\n, 48 L. ed. 73, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 8. A number of cases as to dredges in the circuit and district courts are referred to in Bowers Hydraulic Dredging Co. v. Federal Contracting Co. 148 Fed 290. Therefore all of the hands mentioned in the informations were seamen within the definition in an earlier statute of the \n\n[206 U.S. 246, 260]\n\u00a0\n United States. Rev. Stat.  4612. Saylor v. Taylor, 23 C. C. A. 343, 42 U. S. App. 206, 77 Fed. 476. See also act of March 3, 1875, chap. 156,  3. 18 Stat. at L. 485, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3324; Bean v. Stupart, 1 Dougl. K. B. 11; Disbrow v. The Walsh Brothers, 36 Fed. 607.\n They all require something of the training and are liable to be called upon for more or less of the services required of ordinary seamen. The reasons which exclude the latter from the statute apply, although perhaps in a less degree, to them. Whatever the nature of their work, it is incident to their employment on the dredges and scows, as in the case of an engineer or coal shoveler on board ship. Without further elaboration of details we are of opinion that the persons employed by the two defendant companies were not laborers or mechanics, and were not employed upon any of the public works of the United States within the meaning of the act. As in other cases where a broad distinction is admitted, it ultimately becomes necessary to draw a line, and the determination of the precise place of that line in nice cases always seems somewhat technical, but still the line must be drawn.\n Judgment in 567 affirmed.\n Judgments in 664, 665, 666, 667, 668, and 669 reversed.\n Mr. Justice Moody took no part in the decision of 567.\n Mr. Justice McKenna is of opinion that the work upon the dredging of Chelsea creek was within the act. In other particulars he agrees with the judgment of the court.\n\n Mr. Justice Moody, dissenting:\n I am unable to agree with the opinion of the court, so far as it relates to the employment for more than eight hours a day of the men engaged in work on the dredges and scows. The eases are of such general importance that I am unwilling to allow the reasons for my disagreement to remain undisclosed. \n\n[206 U.S. 246, 261]\n\u00a0\n The first question is whether the men named in the informations were employed by the defendants 'upon any of the public works of the United States' within the meaning of those words as Congress used them. Let it be conceded, as I think it should be, that 'any of the public works' is a narrower expression than 'any public work' would be; that public works must 'have some kind of permanent existence and structural unity, and be severally capable of being regarded as complete wholes,' and still the works here in question fall within the description. The dredging of channels in our water ways is not mere digging. It has for its purpose the creation of something with as visible a form as a cellar to a house, a sunken road, a well, a tidal basin, or a sea-level canal. Surely all these are 'works,' and, if constructed by the government, 'public works.' Artificial water ways may not be so easily read out of the statute by any definition, and I cannot resist the belief that the definition accepted in the opinion of the court does not accomplish it.\n Let us consider the history of one of these artificial approaches from the sea, such as the channel in Boston harbor, and see whether, when it is completed, it ought not to be regarded as a complete whole, having a permanent existence and structural unity. When a work of this kind is proposed, the engineers of the Army, first obtaining the authority from Congress, survey the region, consider the commercial reasons which support the project, and make plans for it and estimates of its cost. Upon consideration of the engineers' report, Congress, if it approves the project, makes an appropriation for its construction, designating it expressly as of the 'public works' of the United States. For example, the appropriation for one of the works in question in these cases is in the following terms: 'The following sums of money . . . are hereby appropriated . . . for the construction . . . of the public works hereinafter named; . . . for improving said harbor in accordance with the report report submitted in House Document, number one hundred and nineteen, \n\n[206 U.S. 246, 262]\n\u00a0\n Fifty-sixth Congress, Second Session, by providing channels thirty-five feet deep, . . . six hundred thousand dollars.' That is to say, at the very threshold of the inquiry, we find that the Congress which had forbidden a longer day's work than eight hours upon 'the public works of the United States' had, upon undertaking this very work, deliberately called it a 'public work.' The cogency of the argument arising from the use of the same words in the eight-hour law as in the appropriation law cannot be met by the suggestion that it is easy to read the words in the eight-hour law in a narrower sense than they were used in the appropriation law. The question here is not how the words may be interpreted, but how they ought to be interpreted. There is no necessity to explore the possibilities of escape from the intention which Congress has made sufficiently plain.\n In the Digest of Appropriations, made and published under the direction of Congress, these constructions are constantly denominated as 'works,' and of course they are 'public.' After the channel is completed, it is buoyed and lighted by the government, and frequently defended by land fortifications constructed for that purpose. Sometimes breakwaters or jetties are constructed for the purpose of preserving it from impairment. The general appropriation act of September 19, 1890 (26 Stat. at L. 426, chap. 907), contains some provisions of permanent law, which are material here. It begins by appropriating 'for the construction, completion, repair, and preservation of the public works hereinafter named.' Then follow many specific appropriations for the improvement of rivers and harbors. Section 3717 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2496) was as follows: 'Whenever the Secretary of War invites proposals for any works, or for any material or labor for any works, there shall be separate proposals and separate contracts for each work, and also for each class of material or labor for each work.' Section 2 of this act (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3527) provided that that section of the Revised Statutes should not be construed to prohibit 'the cumulation of two or more works of river and harbor improvement in \n\n[206 U.S. 246, 263]\n\u00a0\n the same proposal and contract, where such works are situated in the same region and of the same kind or character.' Of course, the works here referred to are public works. Section 6 prohibits the deposit of material in harbors, navigable rivers or waters of the United States. Section 7, as amended by  3 of the act of July 13, 1892 (27 Stat. at L. 88-110, chap. 158), makes it unlawful 'to excavate or fill, or in any manner to alter or modify the course, location, condition, or capacity of, any port, roadstead, haven, harbor, harbor of refuge, or inclosure within the limits of any breakwater or of the channel of any navigable water of the United States, unless approved and authorized by the Secretary of War.' The act of March 3, 1899 (30 Stat. at L. 1151, chap. 425, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3540), makes additional safeguard against the obstruction of navigable channels. Thus Congress, which has created these artificial channels, keeps them under the constant repair, supervision, control, and protection of the government. When the work is done the government, through the Navy Department and the Coast and Geodetic Survey, makes, publishes, and issues charts which show their length, depth, and width in the minutest detail, and the buoys and lights which enable the mariner to use them with safety. He, like Congress, enters upon the channels, regarding them as completed wholes, as having a permanent existence, and, if he strays beyond their limits, he will quickly discover that they have a tangible form and structural unity. Doubtless they are subject to alteration by the action of the elements, but so is a building; and, given the constant repair and care which all structures need in order to prevent their disintegration, they are as permanent as the Capitol building itself. Quotations from acts of Congress might be multiplied indefinitely showing that, with respect to channels, Congress had appropriated for them as 'works,' and for their repair and maintenance as 'works;' but if the acts already referred to will not show that Congress regarded such water ways as public works, no number of others will do it. I suppose it would be conceded that breakwaters or jetties were public works. Is it to be supposed that Congress \n\n[206 U.S. 246, 264]\n\u00a0\n intended that men who work on them should work only eight hours a day, while those who work near by on the channel itself should be exempted from this restriction? I conclude, therefore, that the labor performed was upon 'the public works of the United States.'\n The eight-hour day is prescribed by the statute only for laborers and mechanics. These words of description have never been supposed to include, and would not include, all those who do work of any kind. Although the extent of these words is somewhat vague, nevertheless they were used in a technical sense, to describe classes of employees. The second question is whether the men named in the information were laborers or mechanics.\n Seamen, whether employed in the Navy or other marine service of the United States, or by contractors with the United States, are not laborers or mechanics. They, while laboring as seamen, could no more be brought within the limits of an eight-hour day than a physician, a lawyer, or a clergyman. They have always been regarded with special favor by all governments, and a series of laws specially applicable to them control and affect their conditions of labor. The men employed on the seagoing tug, from the master down, were seamen, and their work was the work of seamen, and the conviction with respect to them was, I agree, erroneous. Those who are employed upon the dredges and scows were not, in respect of the work they were actually doing, in any proper sense, seamen. The master and engineer of the dredge were not licensed, and the men employed upon it seemed not to have entered into any contract of shipment. They were employed usually from those who had served in the merchant marine. They had doubtless acquired the skill and aptitude which especially fitted them for work upon the dredges, which required some handling of lines and some other minor things in which sailors become expert. But, because a man has acquired in one occupation skill which fits him for another, it does not follow that, when he passes from one occupation to the other, the work \n\n[206 U.S. 246, 265]\n\u00a0\n which he does in the new employment entitles him rightfully to be called by the old name. The sailor who is appointed the keeper of a lighthouse may have received his appointment because he was once a sailor, but, nevertheless, when he enters into the new service, he is a lighthouse keeper, and not a sailor. The occupation of dredging is not the only one for which life on the sea educates a man. There is a constant demand, for instance, for those who have an honorable discharge from the Navy for employment in civil life. The qualities of obedience, of daring, of fidelity, of the capacity for quick adaptation of insufficient means to the end which may be desired,-all the result of training upon the sea,-are qualities which are needed in many stations of civil life; but, when men have reached those stations by reason of qualities developed in them while seamen, they are no longer sailors. The work of the dredge men and scow men may be described in a sentence. They were digging a channel and emptying the material excavated in the sea. All those who were engaged in the work may fairly be described as either laborers or mechanics. They had nothing whatever to do with navigation. Neither the dredges nor the scows had steering gear, sails, or other methods of self-propulsion. They were towed to the place where the work was to be done, and there left to do it.\n It does not seem to be important that, for some purposes, the scows and dredges were vessels, or those employed upon them, for some purposes, are deemed seamen. The question here is, What were the men when they were engaged in the work of excavation? Were the men at that time employed as seamen, doing the work of seamen, or as laborers and mechanics, doing the work of laborers and mechanics? I think they then were laborers or mechanics, and employed as such, and that their occupation is determined not by what they have done in the past, or by what their employers chose to call them, but by what they were doing when the government invoked the law for their benefit. If they were then doing the work of laborers and mechanics, whatever they may have done in the past, \n\n[206 U.S. 246, 266]\n\u00a0\n which constitutes a motive for their employment, or by whatever name they were employed, they were, or rather their labor was, within the restrictions as to hours prescribed by the law. Nor was their work in dredging incident to their employment on the dredges, but quite the reverse. They never would have been employed at all except for dredging. They never would have set foot on the dredge save to use it as a platform on which to do the work of laborers and mechanics. It should not be forgotten that the object of this statute, in which is embodied an expression of a great public policy, is to regulate labor of the kind named, and the men concerned are in or out of its prohibitions solely by reason of the kind of labor they perform. How can it be material here whether the dredge is or is not a vessel within the admiralty jurisdiction, or that, in the construction of two specifically named statutes, all those upon it are deemed to be seamen? There is no artificial statutory construction prescribed for this act, and what the men on it are is left, under this act, to be determined according to the truth and fact, and the test to be applied is the nature of the labor they actually perform. They were employed to do the work of laborers and mechanics; in the main they actually did that work; and whatever they did which was of the nature of seamen's work was a mere incident to the fact that they labored upon a floating platform instead of upon the dry land.\n It is conceded in the opinion of the court that the statute admits of an interpretation which brings these cases within it. May not more be said? Are not these cases fairly within the plain words of the act? If this be so, then the rule of strict interpretation, applicable to penal laws, a rule which has lost all of its ancient rigor, if indeed it is now more than a lifeless form (United States v. Lacher, \n134 \nU.S. 624, 628\n, 33 S. L. ed. 1080, 1083, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 625), cannot be used to take them out. When the intention of the legislature is reasonably clear, the courts have no duty except to carry it out. The rule for the construction of penal statutes is satisfied if the words are not enlarged beyond their natural mean- \n\n[206 U.S. 246, 267]\n\u00a0\n ing, and it does not require that they shall be restricted to less than that.\n The impossibility or difficulty of applying this law to the operations of dredging, which, upon the evidence, I think, amounts to no more than that it would result in an inconvenience, which the defendants may readily avoid by refusing to contract with the government, is a consideration fit to be addressed to Congress rather than to this court.\n I am authorized to say that Mr. Justice Harlan and Mr. Justice Day concur in this dissent. \n\n\n\n","55":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEMPIRE STATE-IDAHO MINING & DEVELOPING CO. v. HANLEY(1907)\nNo. 206\nArgued: February 1, 1907Decided: March 25, 1907\n\n\n\n The defendant in error, complainant below, brought suit in the circuit court of the United States for the district of Idaho against the Empire State-Idaho Mining & Developing Company and the Federal Mining & Smelting Company, appellants herein. The bill, filed July 27, 1904, alleged diversity \n\n[205 U.S. 225, 226]\n\u00a0\n of citizenship as the ground of jurisdiction, and averred that the Empire State-Idaho Mining & Developing Company, the Federal Mining & Smelting Company, and complainant are the owners and possessors, as tenants in common, of the Skookum mine and mining claim and the ores therein contained, situated in Yreka mining district, Shoshone county, Idaho. The complainant was alleged to be the owner of an undivided one-eighth interest in the fee thereof, and the Empire State-Idaho Mining & Developing Company the owner of the undivided seven eighths of said mine and claim.\n There are other allegations, not necessary to be here set out, and then, in the eighth paragraph of the bill, it is alleged:\n'8. That prior to May 17, 1902, the defendant Empire State-Idaho Mining & Developing Company extracted from said mine, through said tunnels, large quantities of ore, and sold the same, and received all of the proceeds thereof, and paid no part of the same to complainant; that complainant brought suit on March 19, 1899, in the United States circuit court, district of Idaho (a court having jurisdiction of the parties and subject-matter), against said defendant and Charles Sweeny and F. Lewis Clark, to recover his share of the proceeds, and to quiet his title to said mine and ore bodies; and in said suit recovered a decree against said defendant Empire State-Idaho Mining & Developing Company, duly given and made in said United States circuit court at Moscow, Idaho, on or about November 17, 1902, for the sum of one hundred seventy-five thousand dollars ($175,000), and which decree quieted the title of this complainant to said one-eighth interest in said claim and ore bodies, a certified and attested copy of which decree was, on the___day of November, 1902, recorded in Shoshone county, Idaho, and the amount decreed to complainant therein remains unpaid and unsatisfied, excepting the sum of $5,523.42; that, as the result of an appeal from said decree by complainant, the same was, on the 10th day of May, 1904, so modified as to make the amount thereof $255,061.40, with interest thereon from February 15 until \n\n[205 U.S. 225, 227]\n\u00a0\n paid, at 7 per cent per annum, and the said amount and every part thereof is now unpaid.'\n\n The bill avers the extraction of a large amount of ore in which the complainant alleges he is entitled to an interest, and that the defendants the Empire State-Idaho Mining & Developing Company and the Federal Mining & Smelting Company deny the title of the complainant to the mining and ore bodies. It further avers that the defendants are appropriating the ores mined to their own use, and, after other allegations not necessary to be set out, prays for an injunction restraining the defendants from extracting ore from the Skookum mine pending the suit, and for an accounting for the ores extracted from the mines and claim since May 17, 1902\n\n\n By the amended answer the defendants, among other defenses, set up that the ores which they are extracting belong to a vein or lode not having its apex within the Skookum mining claim, but belonging to a vein having its apex within the lode mining claim lying to the north of the Skookum claim and a part of the San Carlos claim, owned by the defendants, and deny that the defendants are mining any ores in which the complainant has any right, and avers that the claim thereto is without merit; and, coming to answer the eighth paragraph of the bill, setting up the decree upon which the plaintiff relied for his title, the defendants set up paragraphs 6 and 7:\n'6. Answering paragraph eighth of the bill, these defendants admit that an action was brought against the parties named in said paragraph as alleged therein, but deny that said action was brought to quiet title to said ore bodies, or that the decree therein did in fact quiet title to said ore bodies or to an undivided one-eighth interest therein in the complainant, and allege further concerning said decree in said action that the court, in the said action, had no jurisdiction to determine title to the said Skookum mine or to the ore bodies lying within or beneath the said mining claim, for the reason that the bill of complaint in the said action does \n\n[205 U.S. 225, 228]\n\u00a0\n not purport to be an action to quiet title to the said mine or ore bodies, nor does the same make a case for the quieting of title thereto, nor is it such as to authorize the decree rendered in said action, purporting to quiet the title to said mine and ore bodies, and for the further reason alleged by defendants to be a fact, that no opportunity was given to the defendants therein to litigate the title to said ore bodies before the decree in said action purporting to quiet title was rendered, and for the further reason that, at the time of the commencement of said action, the defendant herein, Empire State-Idaho Mining & Developing Company, was, as shown by the complaint herein, in exclusive possession of such ore bodies, and the complainant was out of possession thereof, and an action of law alone would lie in the Federal court to determine title to such ore bodies, and that the defendant therein, being the defendant Empire State-Idaho Mining & Developing Company, had a right, under the laws and Constitution of the United States, to a trial by jury of the question of title to said ore bodies, and defendants allege that so much of the decree in said action as undertook or purported to quiet title to such ore bodies was and is absolutely void as to the Empire State-Idaho Mining & Developing Company, because the same constituted and was in fact an attempt to deprive it of its property without due process of law within the meaning of article 5 of the amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and because the same constituted an adjudication of its property rights without its consent by the court without a jury, contrary to the provisions of article 7 of the amendments to the Constitution of the United States.\n\n'7. The defendants attach hereto, marked Exhibit A, and pray that the same may be taken as a part of this answer, copies of the complaint, answer, and replication in the action referred to in the eighth paragraph in the bill, and allege that the same constituted the sole pleadings in the said action, and, together with the evidence, constituted the sole basis for the final decree rendered therein, a copy of which is attached \n\n[205 U.S. 225, 229]\n\u00a0\n hereto and marked Exhibit B, and made a part hereof; that after the replication in said cause was filed testimony was taken before an examiner, on the part of the complainant, in support of the allegations contained in the bill, to wit, the allegations that the defendants Clark and Sweeney had acquired the one-eight interest in the Skookum mine from the complainant by fraud, covin, and deceit, and testimony was introduced by the defendants contradicting the testimony of the complainant, and tending to support the affirmative allegations of the answer, and no testimony was offered or taken, either for complainant or defendants, concerning the said one-eighth interest except the evidence for and against fraud, covin, and deceit, as before alleged. Thereupon the said cause was submitted to the court for decision, and the said circuit court entered a decree in favor of the defendants therein. Thereupon complainant in that suit appealed to the United States court of appeals for the ninth circuit from the said decree, and the said court, after a hearing upon the pleadings and the evidence before it, found that the allegations of the bill relating to the fraud in procuring title to the one-eighth interest claimed by the said Hanley were sustained by the evidence, and the decree was reversed and the cause sent back to the circuit court for the further proceedings in accordance with the opinion. Thereupon an order was made by the circuit court directing an accounting, and evidence was introduced by complainant to show the amount and value of ores extracted from the Skookum mine prior to May, 1902, by the defendants in said suit. That defendants in the said action thereupon offered to prove that the said ore so extracted from underneath the Skookum mine prior to that time was part of the vein having its apex in the said San Carlos claim, above referred to, owned by defendants, and that the said San Carlos claim was so located that its extralateral rights included the ore bodies from which the said ores were extracted. The said offer to prove the said fact was thereupon denied by the said court, acting under \n\n[205 U.S. 225, 230]\n\u00a0\n the order of the United States circuit court of appeals for the ninth circuit, in a certain mandamus proceeding brought in said court to test the question; that defendants in the said action thereafter, and at all times, contended and insisted that they had a right to show in the accounting that the ores taken from under the Skookum claim were a part of the vein apexing in the San Carlos claim, of which the defendants were the owners, and that the court was without jurisdiction to render a decree in the said action quieting title to the Skookum mine, or to the ore bodies referred to in the bill of complaint, but its contentions and objections and were overruled and the decree averred by the complainant was rendered notwithstanding such protests and objections; and defendants aver that the said decree purporting to quiet title in said ore bodies was rendered without evidence being taken upon the said contention of the defendants, and without any evidence whatever being heard which threw any light upon the contention; and said decree was thereafter, upon appeal to the United States circuit court of appeals for the ninth circuit, affirmed, the court in said cause holding as ground for its action that the bill of complaint made a cause for quieting title to the one-eighth interest in the said Skookum mine and to the ore bodies in the limits thereof, and that the defendants in said cause, having failed to plead title to the ore bodies in themselves by virtue of the facts hereinbefore set up, were estopped to litigate the said facts.'\n\n The complainant below filed exceptions to this amended answer, in which he averred that, in the former decree, the title to the ore bodies in question was quieted, and that the issues made in that case were within the jurisdiction and power of the court to determine, and that the question of the right and title to one eighth of the Skookum mine and mining claim and ores therein contained had been determined in the former suit in favor of the complainant, and the said question had become res judicata in a court having jurisdiction of the parties and the subject- matter. \n\n[205 U.S. 225, 231]\n\u00a0\n Upon hearing the exceptions to the amended answer, they were sustained and the answer held insufficient. Thereupon the defendants, averring that the court was in error and that the said amended answer constituted a defense, declined to plead further, and elected to stand upon the amended answer. The complainant thereupon moved the court for a final decree for one eighth of the amounts stated in paragraph 9 of the answer to have been mined as therein stated. A final decree was rendered accordingly, and thereupon a direct appeal was taken to this court.\n Messrs. George Turner and F. T. Post for appellants.\n Mr. Myron A. Folsom for appellee.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Day:\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n In the brief and argument of the learned counsel for the appellants it is said: 'The sole question in the case is whether, on the facts set up and pleaded in the answer, there was jurisdiction in the United States circuit court in the former suit to render the judgment quieting in the complainant, Hanley, title to one eighth of all the ore bodies found within the boundaries of the Skookum mining claim. The lower court thought the answer failed to show want of jurisdiction, and sustained complainant's exceptions.'\n A preliminary question for examination in this court, although not made in argument by counsel, is whether this court has jurisdiction of this case by direct appeal from the judgment rendered in the circuit court of Idaho. It is apparent from the statement preceding this opinion that the extent and effect of the adjudication in the first case, wherein the complainant alleges title was decreed to him, was the real controversy between the parties. The complainant contended \n\n[205 U.S. 225, 232]\n\u00a0\n that the court in the former case had adjudicated title to all of the ore bodies found within the boundaries of the Skookum claim.' The defendants contended that the ore bodies in controversy belonged to another mine, the San Carlos, the property of the defendants, by reason of the fact that they are of a vein which has its apex in the San Carlos mining claim, and not in the Skookum; and that the decree in the former suit was without jurisdiction in so far as it undertook to quiet title for such ore bodies, because the pleadings in that suit made no case for such decree.\n If this case can come here by direct appeal it must be because it is within  5 of the court of appeals act 1891, providing for direct appeals in certain cases from the circuit court to this court. 26 Stat. at L. 827, chap. 517,  5, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 488. It cannot be brought directly here as a case in which the jurisdiction of the court is in issue; for the jurisdiction challenged is not that of the court rendering the decree from which this appeal is taken, but is that of the court rendering the former decree, which is set up in the complaint as the basis of the title sued upon. Re Lennon, \n150 U.S. 393\n, 37 L. ed. 1120, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 123.\n If the case is properly here, it must be because it is one which involves the construction or application of the Constitution of the United States. It has been repeatedly held that it is only when the Constitution of the United States is directly and necessarily drawn in question that such an appeal can be taken, and the case must be one in which the construction or application of the Constitution of the United States is involved as controlling. We think this case is not of that character. It is evident that the real issue as to the former judgment was whether it was res judicata between the parties, or, as contended by the appellants, rendered without jurisdiction. The court, in deciding against the appellants, decided that the court had jurisdiction, and that the former decree was conclusive. This decision does not necessarily and directly involve the construction or application of the Constitution of the United States. \n\n[205 U.S. 225, 233]\n\u00a0\n In World's Columbian Exposition v. United States, 6 C. C. A. 71, 18 U. S. App. 159, 56 Fed. 657, Mr. Chief Justice Fuller, speaking for the court, said: 'Cases in which the construction or application of the Constitution is involved, or the constitutionality of any law of the United States is drawn in question, are cases which present an issue upon such construction or application or constitutionality, the decision of which is controlling; otherwise every case arising under the laws of the United States might be said to involve the construction or application of the Constitution, or the validity of such law.'\n Re Lennon, supra, was a proceeding in habeas corpus to discharge a party held upon an order for imprisonment for failing to pay a fine imposed for contempt. The petitioner alleged that the circuit court had no jurisdiction of the case in which the order of injunction had been issued, for violation of which the petitioner was alleged to be guilty of contempt; and that it had no jurisdiction either of the subject-matter or of the person of the petitioner. The application being denied and direct appeal being taken to this court, it was held that it would not lie under  5, act of March 3, 1891, because the jurisdiction of the circuit court of the petition for habeas corpus was not in issue, nor was the construction or application of the Constitution involved. Of the latter phase of the case Mr. Chief Justice Fuller, speaking for the court, said:\n'Nor can the attempt be successfully made to bring the case within the class of cases in which the construction or application of the Constitution is involved in the sense of the statute, on the contention that the petitioner was deprived of his liberty without due process of law. The petition does not proceed on any such theory, but entirely on the ground of want of jurisdiction in the prior case over the subjectmatter and over the person of petitioner, in respect of inquiry into which the jurisdiction of the circuit court was sought. If, in the opinion of that court, the restraining order had been absolutely void, or the petitioner were not bound \n\n[205 U.S. 225, 234]\n\u00a0\n by it, he would have been discharged, not because he would otherwise be deprived of due process, but because of the invalidity of the proceedings for want of jurisdiction. The opinion of the circuit court was that jurisdiction in the prior suit and proceedings existed, and the discharge was refused; but an appeal from that judgment directly to this court would not, therefore, lie on the ground that the application of the Constitution was involved as a consequence of an alleged erroneous determination of the questions actually put in issue by the petitioner.'\n\n In Carey v. Houston & T. C. R. Co. \n150 U.S. 170\n, 37 L. ed. 1041, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 63, in which a bill in equity had been filed in order to impeach and set aside a decree of foreclosure on the ground of fraud and want of jurisdiction in the foreclosure suit, it was held that no case for appeal directly to this court was made as one that involved the construction or application of the Constitution of the United States. In that case Mr. Chief Justice Fuller, delivering the opinion of the court, said:\n'It is argued that the record shows that complainants had been deprived of their property without due process of law, by means of the decree attacked, but because the bill alleged irregularities, errors, and jurisdictional defects in the foreclosure proceedings and fraud in respect thereof and in the subsequent transactions, which might have enabled the railroad company, upon a direct appeal, to have avoided the decree of sale, or which, if sustained on this bill, might have justified the circuit court in setting aside that decree, it does not follow that the construction or application of the Constitution of the United States was involved in the case in the sense of the statute. In passing upon the validity of that decree the circuit court decided no question of the construction or the application of the Constituion, and, as we have said, no such question was raised for its consideration. Our conclusion is that the motion to dismiss the appeal must be sustained.'\n\n The cases cited were followed and the principles deducible \n\n[205 U.S. 225, 235]\n\u00a0\n therefrom applied in Cosmopolitan Min. Co. v. Walsh, \n193 U.S. 460\n, 48 L. ed. 749, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 489. In that case it was contended, in a replication to an answer setting up certain former judgments rendered against the complainant as a bar to the suit brought by it to recover possesion of the real property sold under the judgments, that they were awarded without due process of law, in violation of the 14th Amendment. And this was upon the theory that the service of process in the state courts upon the corporation's agent in the suits where the judgments were rendered was unauthorized by the laws of the state or the general principles of law. It was held that the case was not one directly involving the construction or application of the Federal Constitution within the meaning of  5 of the act of March 3, 1891, and the writ of error was dismissed.\n We think the principles involved in these cases decisive against jurisdiction in this court of this appeal. It is true that it is averred in the sixth paragraph of the amended answer above set forth that, in the action to determine title to the ore bodies, the mining company had the right, under the laws and Constitution of the United States, to a trial by jury, of which it was deprived; and that so much of the decree as undertook to quiet title to the ore bodies was rendered without jurisdiction, because the same constituted and was in fact an attempt to deprive the defendant of its property without due process of law, in violation of the Federal Constitution. But these averments of conclusions as to constitutional rights do not change the real character of the controversy and make it a case in which the controlling rule of decision involves the construction or application of the Constitution of the United States.\n The thing relied upon in this case was the controlling effect as res judicata of a decree rendered between the parties in another suit. And the real issue was as to the jurisdiction of the court to render the decree. The determination of that question did not involve the construction or application of \n\n[205 U.S. 225, 236]\n\u00a0\n the Constitution of the United States. The circuit court held that the court rendering the first decree had jurisdiction to determine the ownership of the ore bodies underneath the surface of the Skookum claim. The court thus really decided a question of res judicata between the parties upon general principles of law. And it does not convert the decision into one involving the construction and application of the Constitution of the United States to aver, argumentatively, that to give such effect to a former adjudication under the circumstances amounts to depriving a party of due process of law.\n We are of opinion, therefore, that the case does not come within the 5th section of the circuit court of appeals act as one directly appealable to this court.\n The appeal is dismissed for want of jurisdiction in this court. \n\n\n\n","56":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nERIE R.

Johnson for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[204 U.S. 220, 222]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Harvey D. Goulder, Frank S. Masten, and S. H. Holding for respondent.\n\n\n\n[204 U.S. 220, 223]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a libel in admiralty, brought by the petitioner as successor in corporate identity to the Union Steamboat Company, to recover a part of a sum paid by it to the respondent \n\n[204 U.S. 220, 224]\n\u00a0\n as the result of previous admiralty proceedings which came before this court several times. The former proceedings were begun by the respondent, as owner of the propeller Conemaugh and bailee of her cargo, to recover for damages to both by a collision between her and the propeller New York. After hearings below (53 Fed. 553, 27 C. C. A. 154, 54 U. S. App. 248, 82 Fed. 819, 30 C. C. A. 628, 56 U. S. App. 146, 86 Fed. 814) it was decided by this court, on certiorari, that both vessels were in fault, and that the representatives of the cargo could recover their whole damages from the New York. The New York, \n175 U.S. 187\n, 44 L. ed. 126, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 67. Thereupon the district court entered a decree dividing the damages sustained by the steamers, requiring the New York to pay to the Conemaugh on that account $13,083.33 and interest, and further required it to pay all the damages to the cargo of the latter,-the insurers on cargo who had intervened receiving their share, and the Conemaugh receiving the residue as trustee. The owners of the New York then applied to this court for a mandamus directing the district court to divide the damages to cargo. This was denied on the ground that, if the court below erred, the remedy was by appeal. Ex parte Union S. B. Co. \n178 U.S. 317\n, 44 L. ed. 1084, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 904. Upon that intimation an appeal was taken to the circuit court of appeals for the sixth circuit, and after a motion to dismiss had been denied (44 C. C. A. 38, 104 Fed. 561) the decree was affirmed (47 C. C. A. 232, 108 Fed. 102). On a second certiorari that decree was affirmed by this court. \n189 U.S. 363\n, 47 L. ed. 854, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 504. The New York paid the damages and brought this suit.\n The ground of the last-mentioned decree was that the claim of the New York was not open, and the circuit court of appeals denied leave to amend the pleadings, for the reason that the petitioner would be left free to assert its claim in an independent proceeding. 47 C. C. A. 232, 108 Fed. 107. In the present case the district court followed this expression of the circuit court of appeals, and made a decree giving the petitioner one half of the damages paid by it on account of cargo. The circuit court of appeals for the seventh circuit, however, \n\n[204 U.S. 220, 225]\n\u00a0\n before which the present case came on appeal, held that the whole matter was res judicata by the final decree in the former cause, and ordered the libel dismissed. 142 Fed. 9. Thereupon a third certiorari was granted by this court, and the record is now before us.\n The respondent set up three defenses, below and here. It argued that there was no jurisdiction in admiralty over the claim in its present form, that the petitioner had no case upon the merits, and that it was concluded by the former decree. The circuit court of appeals decided against the first two points before sustaining the third. We shall take them up in their order. The jurisdiction appears to us tolerably plain. If it be assumed that the right to contribution is an incident of the joint liability in admiralty, and is not res judicata, it would be a mere historical anomaly if the admiralty courts were not free to work out their own system, and to finish the adjustment of maritime rights and liabilities. Indeed, we imagine that this would not have been denied very strenuously had the question been raised by proper pleadings in connection with the original suit. But if the right is not barred by the former decree, it would be still more anomalous to send the parties to a different tribunal to secure that right at this stage. For the decree was correct as far as it went, and, by the hypothesis, might stop where it did without impairing the claim to contribution. That claim is of admiralty origin and must be satisfied before complete justice is done. It cannot be that, because the admiralty has carried out a part of its theory of justice, it is prevented by that fact alone from carrying out the rest. See The Mariska, 47 C. C. A. 115, 107 Fed. 989.\n On the merits also we have no great difficulty. The rule of the common law, even, that there is no contribution between wrongdoers, is subject to exception. Pollock, Torts, 7th ed. 195, 196. Whatever its origin, the admiralty rule in this country is well known to be the other way. The North Star (Reynolds v. Vanderbilt) \n106 U.S. 17\n, 27 L. ed. 91, 1 Sup. Ct. Rep. 41; The Sterling (The Sterling v. Petersen) \n106 U.S. 647\n, 27 L. ed. 98, 1 Sup. Ct. Rep. 89; Admiralty rule, 59. Compare The Frankland \n\n[204 U.S. 220, 1901]\n\u00a0\n P. 161. \n\n[204 U.S. 220, 226]\n\u00a0\n And it is established, as it logically follows, that the division of damages extends to what one of the parties pays to the owners of cargo on board the other. The Chattahoochee, \n173 U.S. 540\n, 43 L. ed. 801, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 491. The right to the division of the latter element does not stand on subrogation, but arises directly from the tort. The liability of the New York, under our practice, for all the damage to cargo, was one of the consequences plainly to be foreseen, and, since the Conemaugh was answerable to the New York as a partial cause of the tort, its responsibility extended to all the manifest consequences for which, on the general ground that they were manifest, the New York could be held. Therefore the contract relations between the Conemaugh and her cargo have nothing to do with the case. See The Chattahoochee, supra. More specifically, the last-named vessel's liability to the New York is not affected by provisions in the Conemaugh's bills of lading, giving her the benefit of insurance, and requiring notice of any claim for damage to be made in writing within thirty days, and suit to be brought within three months.\n It only remains, then, to consider whether the petitioner is concluded by the former decree. If the liability of the Conemaugh arises, as we have said, out of the tort, then it is said to follow that the New York either is attempting to split up its cause of action, or to recover in excess of a decree covering the case. It is true that the New York was the defendant in the former suit, but the damage to the New York was allowed for in the division. If the allowance was by way of recoupment, then it may be said that the New York, by asserting a counterclaim for its damages, bound itself to present its whole claim to the same extent as if it had brought the suit; at least, until it had neutralized the claim made against it in the Conemaugh's own right. If the allowance was because division is the very form and condition of any claim for damage to vessels in case of mutual fault (The North Star, supra; Stoomvaart Maatschappy Nederland v. Peninsular & O. Steam Nav. Co. L. R. 7 App. Cas. 795, 801, 806), and the mutual rights \n\n[204 U.S. 220, 227]\n\u00a0\n cancel each other pro tanto as they arise, just as in an account current, as distinguished from set-off, then it might be contended that the claim in respect of the payment of damage to cargo is an item in the same account with the one for damage to the ship, and that a decree as to one involves a disposition of the other, and makes the whole matter res judicata. See The Manitoba (Beatty v. Hanna), \n122 \nU.S. 97, 111\n, 30 S. L. ed. 1095, 1100, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1158\n\n\n But, whatever be the technical theory, the right of a defendant to a division of the damage to the vessels when both are in fault, and its contingent claim to partial indemnity for payment of damage to cargo, must be separable, from the necessity of to case. To illustrate. Suppose, in a case of collision, one vessel to be sued for damage to the other vessel alone. It could not set up the possibility that the cargo owners might sue, some time within six years, and suspend the decree on the ground that otherwise the defendant might be barred from demanding indemnity in case the cargo owners should sue and succeed. If cargo owners should sue one or the other vessels after a division of the damages to the vessels themselves, it must be that the libellee would be free to require the other to exonerate or indemnify it to the same extent as if no such division had taken place. It would be impossible to do justice otherwise. As to the English law, see Stoomvaart Maatschappy Nederland v. Peninsular & O. Steam Nav. Co. L. R. 7 App. Cas. 795, 806.\n If we are right, then this is a strong case for holding that the petitioner is not barred. It stands adjudicated that its pleadings did not open its present claim. They could not have done so, because, at that stage, the petitioner not having paid, it had no claim for indemnity, but only for exoneration. It was not bound to adopt the procedure permitted to it by rule 59. It did ask leave to amend so as to protect its rights, but was met by the argument of the respondent and the opinion of the circuit court of appeals that it could bring a new suit. This court said the same thing in affirming the decree against the New York. 'If, as between her and the Conemaugh, \n\n[204 U.S. 220, 228]\n\u00a0\n she have a claim for recoupment, the way is open to recover it.' \n189 U.S. 368\n, 47 L. ed. 857, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 504. The same proposition was implied in The Juniata (United States v. Juniata), \n93 \nU.S. 337, 340\n, 23 S. L. ed. 930, 931.

On certiorari this court held that the circuit court of appeals had no jurisdiction of the appeal, and that the district court, having found that the receiver and trustee was not in possession of the fund, had no jurisdiction to proceed further. It thereupon rendered a judgment and issued a mandate reversing the decree of the circuit court of appeals, and directing that court to dismiss the appeal and to remand the case to the district court for further proceedings in conformity with the opinion upon which the mandate was based.\n The circuit court of appeals thereupon dismissed the appeal and remanded the cause for further proceedings as directed. The opinion to which the proceedings of the district court were to conform concluded with these words: 'In our \n\n[207 U.S. 61, 65]\n\u00a0\n view the district court should have declined upon its findings to retain jurisdiction, and in that event the decrees for the return of the money should have been without prejudice to the right of respondents to litigate in a proper court, which modification we direct to be made.' The district court made a decree 'without prejudice to the rights of the Chicago Title & Trust Company, the trustee herein, if this court shall so authorize, to litigate in any proper court the question of the right of said trustee to recover said funds as a part of the bankrupt's general estate.' The trustee complained of the form of this decree, especially because of the insertion of the words 'if this court shall so authorize,' and moved in this court for leave to file a petition for mandamus requiring the district judge to modify it, but leave was denied. \n200 U.S. 613\n, 50 L. ed. 620, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 753.\n The trustee next made a similar application to the circuit court of appeals, whereupon that court granted it and issued a peremptory writ requiring modifications to be made. 77 C. C. A. 408, 146 Fed. 742. The petitioners and plaintiffs in error, claiming an interest in the fund, then applied for leave to intervene for the purpose of prosecuting a writ of error; their application was allowed, and leave was granted them to sue out the writ, the order reciting that the district judge was present by counsel, but declined to sue out or join in the same. On the same day the circuit court of appeals refused to make the writ act as a supersedeas, and on the next day the district judge entered a decree conforming to the mandate of the circuit court of appeals. The present proceedings are brought for the purpose of reversing the action of the circuit court of appeals and of reinstating the former decree of the district court.\n There is a motion to dismiss the writ of error on the grounds that the judge, who was the only party to the mandate alleged to be erroneous, did not sue out the writ, but that, on the contrary, he has obeyed the order, and that the plaintiffs in error are not privy to the judgment. We deem it a sufficient answer \n\n[207 U.S. 61, 66]\n\u00a0\n to this motion to say that it appears on the record that the judge declined to join (Masterson v. Herndon [Masterson v. Howard] 10 Wall. 416, 19 L. ed. 953; Hardee v. Wilson, \n146 U.S. 179\n, 36 L. ed. 933, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 39), that he has no personal interest in the judgment (Davis v. Mercantile Trust Co. \n152 \nU.S. 590, 593\n, 38 S. L. ed. 563, 564, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 693), and that the plaintiffs have such an interest, and were made parties for the purpose of protecting their rights. The fact that the judge obeyed the order in force against him cannot prejudice the position of the plaintiffs. They have the same interest in having the former decree of the district court reinstated that they had in having it stand.\n We are of opinion that the order of the circuit court of appeals was wrong. The mandate of this court was addressed to it alone, it is true, in point of form. It is customary to issue but a single mandate. But the directions as to the further proceedings of the district court were not an order to the circuit court of appeals to issue an order to the district court. They were directions which the circuit court of appeals was simply to communicate to the district court, and which the district court was to follow on the authority of this court, not of the circuit court of appeals. The suggestion of the need of speedy relief seems to have counted for something in the making of the order appealed from, and the denial of a mandamus by this court was treated as an intimation that the final direction to the district court was to be regarded as proceeding from the circuit court of appeals. Such was not the import of the action of this court. The circuit court of appeals had no jurisdiction in the matter, and the denial of a mandamus by this court did not confer or declare jurisdiction to grant what this court denied. It follows that the judgment of the circuit court of appeals must be reversed.\n As the judgment reversed has been acted upon by the district court it becomes necessary to consider whether the former or the present decree of the district court was the proper one to enter. The present one might be right not withstanding the want of jurisdiction on the part of the higher court to order it to be made. We need not determine whether the language \n\n[207 U.S. 61, 67]\n\u00a0\n quoted from our former opinion was improvidently used. It is enough to say that the opinion did not purport to fix the words of the new decree. It merely gave a general direction which was to be carried out in a form to be settled by the district court. It declared, perhaps unnecessarily, that the decree was to be without prejudice to whatever right the respondents might have to litigate in a proper court, not that they were entitled to litigate, or that the authority given by the bankruptcy law,  2(7), 11 c, 47(2),* to the district court to control such litigation, was superseded. We are of opinion that the decree first entered by the district court complied with the language of the opinion, and that the subsequent decree, having been entered only in obedience to an unwarranted judgment, should be set aside.

Fields was indicted in the supreme court of the District of Columbia at the January term, 1905, for embezzlement. Of eight counts in the indictment seven were disposed of by demurrer or by verdict in favor of the defendant. The trial, begun on May 8, and ending May 15, 1905, resulted in a verdict of guilty under the third count. Motions in arrest of judgment and for a new trial having been overruled, he was sentenced to imprisonment and labor in the penitentiary for five years. The court of appeals of the District modified the judgment of the supreme court by striking out the order for 'labor,' and, as so modified, affirmed it. 27 App. D. C. 433. The case was brought to this court on writ of error. A motion to dismiss and a petition for certiorari were presented by the respective parties, the consideration of both of which was postponed to the hearing on the merits. The indictment was found under  841 of the District Code, which is as follows: \n\n[205 U.S. 292, 293]\n\u00a0\n 'Any executor, administrator, guardian, trustee, receiver, collector, or other officer into whose possession money, securities, or other property of the property or estate of any other person may come by virtue of his office or employment, who shall fraudulently convert or appropriate the same to his own use, shall forfeit all right or claim to any commissions, costs, and charges thereon, and shall be deemed guilty of embezzlement of the entire amount or value of the money or other property so coming into his possession and converted or appropriated to his own use, and shall be punished by a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not exceeding ten years, or both.' [31 Stat. at L. 1326, chap. 854.]\n The statute under which the writ of error was sued out is  233 of the District Code, which reads:\n'Sec. 233. Any judgment or decree of the court of appeals may be re- examined and affirmed, reversed, or modified by the Supreme Court of the United States, upon writ of error or appeal, in all cases in which the matter in dispute, exclusive of costs, shall exceed the sum of five thousand dollars, in the same manner and under the same regulations as existed in cases of writs of error on judgments or appeals from decrees rendered in the supremen court of the District of Columbia on February ninth, eighteen hundred and ninety-three, and also in cases, without regard to the sum or value of the matter in dispute, wherein is involved the validity of any patent or copyright, or in which is drawn in question the validity of a treaty or statute of, or an authority exercised under, the United States.' [31 Stat. at L. 1227, chap. 854.]\n\n Messrs. Frank J. Hogan, John C. Gittings, and Henry E. Davis for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[205 U.S. 292, 295]\n\u00a0\n Mr. J. S. Easby-Smith and Solicitor General Hoyt for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Brewer:\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n The petition for certiorari must be first considered. A certiorari can be issued only when a writ of error cannot. 26 Stat. at L. 828,  6, chap. 517, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 550, last two paragraphs. There have been two or three instances in which, after a writ of error has been allowed, an application for a certiorari has been filed, the latter because of doubt whether the former would lie. It must not be supposed that because we have before us both a writ of error and an application for certiorari that the rules laid down by this court governing the latter applications are to be ignored, and the case held in this court by either the writ of error or the certiorari. \n\n[205 U.S. 292, 296]\n\u00a0\n In this case there is no sufficient ground for a certiorari. The application comes within none of the conditions therefor declared in the decisions of this court. However important the case may be to the applicant, the question involved is not one of gravity and general importance. There is no conflict between the decisions of state and Federal courts or between those of Federal courts of different circuits. There is nothing affecting the relations of this nation to foreign nations, and indeed no matter of general interest to the public.\n Will a writ of error lie? Is the case one of which this court has jurisdiction? It is settled that a criminal case, as such, cannot be brought here on a writ of error from the court of appeals of the district. Chapman v. United States, \n164 U.S. 436\n, 41 L. ed. 504, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 76, and cases cited in the opinion; Sinclair v. District of Columbia, \n192 U.S. 16\n, 48 L. ed. 322, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 212.\n The authority of these cases is not questioned, but it is contended that the forfeiture of all right or claim to any commissions, etc., was determined by the judgment in the case at bar, and that, therefore, it comes within the pecuniary provisions of  233. Smith v. Whitney, \n116 U.S. 167\n, 29 L. ed. 601, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 570, is cited as authority. In that case we sustained our jurisdiction over a judgment of the supreme court of the District, dismissing a petition for a writ of prohibition to a court- martial convened to try an officer for an offense punishable by dismissal from the service and consequent deprivation of salary, which, during the term of his office, would exceed the sum of $5,000. But that case is very different from this. There the direct result of an adverse judgment of the court-martial was the deprivation of an office with a salary of over $5, 000. That sum, therefore, was involved in the trial sought to be restrained. But no such result follows in this case. The act of the defendant in fraudulently converting or appropriating the moneys in his possession operates to forfeit all right or claim to any commissions, etc., and this, irrespective of the question whether he is or is not convicted of any crime in respect thereto. It is true such fraudulent conversion or appropriation is declared \n\n[205 U.S. 292, 297]\n\u00a0\n to be embezzlement, and the defendant was prosecuted and convicted of that offense, but the forfeiture of commissions does not follow the judgment, but follows the wrongful conversion or appropriation of the moneys. The only direct pecuniary result of a conviction is a fine not exceeding $1, 000, and that as a punishment for the offense. United States v. More, 3 Cranch, 159, 174, 2 L. ed. 397, 402. It adjudges no forfeiture of commissions. It may be that it furnishes evidence in respect to the forfeiture of commissions, but, if so, it is simply evidence. Nor does the criminal offense depend at all upon the amount of the appropriation. If the official fraudulently converts or appropriates $1,000 the crime is the same as though he fraudulently converts or appropriates $50,000. All that can be accomplished by the criminal prosecution is the statutory punishment for the offense, which cannot exceed a fine of $1,000, or imprisonment for ten years, or both. The conviction is conclusive as to the fact of a fraudulent conversion and appropriation, but not as to the amount thereof, any more than a conviction of larceny is a conclusive adjudication that the larceny was committed at a day named or of the precise amount or value of the property charged to have been stolen. Those are incidental and minor facts, which may or may not be proved exactly as stated. All that is necessary to sustain the judgment before us is that there was a fraudulent conversion or appropriation of some amount of money in the possession of the official. For these reasons the writ of error cannot be sustained.\n The application for a certiorari is denied and the writ of error is dismissed.\n Mr. Justice White concurred in the judgment. \n\n\n\n","59":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFLEMISTER v. U S(1907)\nNo. 70\nArgued: Decided: December 16, 1907\n\n\n\n\n[207 U.S. 372, 373]\n\u00a0\n Mr. E. J. Bowers for plaintiff in error.\n Solicitor General Hoyt and Assistant Attorney General Russell for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n The plaintiff in error was convicted of a criminal attempt against an agent of the authorities by striking one Feliciano \n\n[207 U.S. 372, 374]\n\u00a0\n Celimin, a policeman, who was trying to arrest him, and by using vile, abusive, and threatening language to the same officer, contrary to article 249, clause 2, of the Penal Code of the Philippines. He was sentenced under article 250, which provides the punishment for such attempts. He was convicted in the court of first instance of the same facts, but was sentenced under article 252, which punishes those who, without being included in article 249, should resist the authorities or their agents. He then appealed, whereupon the supreme court decided that the offense fell within article 249, and increased the sentence. The errors assigned are that the supreme court had no jurisdiction to increase the sentence, this being stated in various forms, and that 'the decision of the court places the accused in jeopardy for the same offense according to the corresponding provisions of  5 of the act of Congress of July 1, 1902 [32 Stat. at L. 692, chap. 1369].' There is also the usual averment that the decision deprives the accused of his liberty without due process of law; but that may be passed over, as there is nothing in the record to justify it. It is not necessary to consider what would amount to denial of due process of law. The plaintiff in error was convicted after a full trial, with all the usual forms, upon a specific and definite complaint and evidence warranting the result.\n The objection to the power of the supreme court to increase the sentence is disposed of by the recent decision in Trono v. United States, \n199 U.S. 521\n, 50 L. ed. 292, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 121. The only assignment of error that needs a words is that which was intended to rely upon a previous conviction that was pleaded and put in evidence. This was a conviction by a municipal court of a violation of ordinances of the city of Manila by disorderly conduct, a breach of the peace, and the assault upon one Domingo Salvador at the same time and place as the assault alleged in the complaint before us. Perhaps it should be added that a second complaint under the ordinances for slanderous, threatening, and abusive language to Captain Jose Crame of the Manila police department was dismissed by the municipal judge on the \n\n[207 U.S. 372, 375]\n\u00a0\n ground that the offense could not be split up. None of the acts alleged in these complaints was the assault upon Celimin, relied upon in the present case, and it does not appear that the assault upon Celimin was relied on or proved as part of the disorderly conduct for which the plaintiff in error was punished in the municipal court. It is unnecessary to consider whether the same conduct could be punished at the same time on the same grounds by both a superior and subordinate authority in the same jurisdiction. There is nothing in the Philippine Bill of Rights that forbids assaults on two individuals being treated as two offenses, even if they occur very near each other, in one continuing attempt to defy the law. We cannot revise the finding of the courts below that the two offenses were distinct.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice Harlan dissents. \n\n\n\n","60":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFRANK v. VOLLKOMMER(1907)\nNo. 184\nArgued: Decided: April 29, 1907\n\n\n\n\n[205 U.S. 521, 522]\n\u00a0\n This was a suit commenced in December, 1902, in the supreme court of New York for the county of Kings by Joseph Vollkommer, Jr., as trustee in bankruptcy of the estate of Jacob Vogt, bankrupt, against Solon L. Frank and Samuel Frank, doing business as S. L. & S. Frank, and Jacob Vogt, to set aside an alleged chattel mortgage on certain horses, harness, wagons, etc., given by Vogt to defendants Frank, April 16, 1902, as fraudulent, and intended to hinder, delay, and defraud creditors.\n The mortgagees had taken possession, and creditors immediately thereafter filed petitions in bankruptcy against Vogt in the district court of the United States for the eastern district of New York, whereupon and on June 30, 1902, one Stoutenburgh was appointed temporary receiver and duly qualified as such.\n As alleged in the complaint, by agreement between the Franks and the petitioning creditors, which was approved by the district court and entered of record therein July 2, A. D. 1902, it was provided that the property in question should be sold at pubnlic auction on July 3 by the temporary receiver; 'that the expenses of the sale be paid out of the proceeds thereof; that the said temporary receiver deposit the net proceeds of said sale at the People's Trust Company of Brooklyn as a special fund, there to await the further order of the court upon due notice to all creditors who have or may hereafter appear; that the lien, if any, of the alleged chattel mortgage of the said defendants Frank be transferred to and attached to said special fund, or deposit, in lieu of and to the same extent as if attached to the said property thereinbefore directed to be sold; that, in pursuance thereof, said sale was had on the 3d of July, A. D. 1902, and the net proceeds thereof, amounting to about $ 5,482.47, were, on or about the 10th day of July, 1902, duly deposited in the People's Trust Company of Brooklyn, as provided by said agreement.'\n July 10, A. D. 1902, Vogt was duly adjudicated an involuntary bankrupt, and on November 12, A. D. 1902, Voll- \n\n[205 U.S. 521, 523]\n\u00a0\n kommer, Jr., was appointed trustee in bankruptcy of Vogt, duly qualified November 21, and entered upon the duties of his office as trustee. He thereafter filed this complaint against the Franks and Vogt, setting up the proceedings, and averring that defendants Frank claimed a lien upon the special fund to the whole extent thereof, which constituted a cloud on plaintiff's title to the fund, and he demanded judgment that the chattel mortgage be declared null and void, and canceled and discharged of record, and that the special fund be declared free of the encumbrance of the alleged chattel mortgage, and from any lien or claim by the Franks under the mortgage or otherwise. The trial court held that the mortgage was made 'with the intent and purpose of said Vogt and said defendants Frank to hinder, defeat, defraud, and delay said Vogt's creditors.' And decreed the annulment of the mortgage, and that it was 'no lien upon the moneys, viz., $ 5,481.47, deposited on July 9th, 1902, by Arthur T. Stoutenburgh, temporary receiver, in the People's Trust Company of Brooklyn, New York, under an order of the district court of the United States for the eastern district of New York, made July 2d, 1902.' The case was carried to the appellate division of the supreme court and the decree was affirmed. Leave to appeal to the court of appeals was denied by the appellate division, and subsequently by an associated judge of the court of appeals. This writ of error was then allowed.

Frank Yawger for defendant in error Vollkommer.\n\n Statement by Mr. Chief Justice Fuller. \n\n[205 U.S. 521, 526]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n Counsel for plaintiffs in error contended below that the state courts had no jurisdictuion because the suit was brought to determine title to property or a fund in the possession of the district court of the United States. The bankruptcy act of July 1,1898, provided that 'suits by the trustee shall only be brought or prosecuted in the courts where the bankrupt, whose estate is being administered by such trustee, might have brought or prosecuted them if proceedings in bankruptcy had not been instituted, unless by consent of the proposed defendant.' 30 Stat. at L. 544, chap. 541,  23b, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3431\n\n\n In Bardes v. First Nat. Bank, \n178 U.S. 524\n, 44 L. ed. 1175, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1000, we held that the bankruptcy court, except by the consent of the defendant, had no jurisdiction to try and determine a suit brought by a trustee in bankruptcy to recover property alleged to be part of the bankrupt's estate, or to have been transferred by him in fraud of the act, but that such suits must be prosecuted either in the state courts or in the circuit courts of the United States where diversity of citizenship existed. The act of 1898 was amended by the act of February 5, 1903 (32 Stat. at L. 797, chap. 487, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1905, p. 682),  19 of which provided that the act should 'not apply to bankruptcy cases pending when this act takes effect, but such cases shall be adjudicated and disposed of comfortably to the provisions of the said act of July first, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight.'\n The present case was commenced in 1902, and, besides, the amendment gave the bankruptcy court concurrent, and not exclusive, jurisdiction.\n We give in the margin1 quotations from the acts of July 1, \n\n[205 U.S. 521, 527]\n\u00a0\n 1898, and February 5, 1903, the amendments made by the latter act being italicized.\n Undoubtedly the state court, in which the trustee brought \n\n[205 U.S. 521, 528]\n\u00a0\n this suit, was the court 'where the bankrupt, whose estate is being administered by such trustee, might have brought or prosecuted them [suits ], if proceedings in bankruptcy had not been instituted,' and its jurisdiction under the applicable general rule must be conceded.\n But plaintiffs in error contend that the possession by the bankruptcy court of the proceeds of the sale of the mortgaged chattels deprives the state court of its conceded jurisdiction to set aside the mortgage as fraudulent.\n The contention is wholly inadmissible. The mortgaged property consisted of horses, vehicles, harness, etc., and the order of sale of the temporary receiver, agreed to by plaintiffs in error, was evidently in the interest of all parties, and provided for the deposit of the proceeds, not in the general funds of the estate, but as a special fund, to which the lien, if any, of the chattel mortgage was transferred, and clearly contemplated a plenary suit to determine the validity thereof, which, at that time, there being no diversity of citizenship, and no such possession as might lead to a different result, could only be commenced in the state court. The trustee himself commenced it there and obtained the decree, which was in its nature self-executing, and merely set aside the mortgage, and, as incident thereto, declared that the special fund was free from its lien, and, without seeking to interfere with the possession, left it to the bankruptcy court to carry the decree into effect by placing the money in the custody of its officer, the trustee. \n\n[205 U.S. 521, 529]\n\u00a0\n No principle of comity was violated and there was no interference with the bankruptcy court.

In the latter case the court of appeals by Cullen, Ch. J., in sustaining the jurisdiction of the state court, admirably expounds the applicable principles, with a full citatuion of authorities. That was a suit against the trustee, while the present case was brought by the trustee.\n The possession of the temporary receiver of the special fund was not, in the circumstances, in any sense sufficient to change the ordinary rule giving the state courts jurisdiction any more than the constructive possession in every case created by adjudication. Mueller v. Nugent, \n184 U.S. 1\n, 46 L. ed. 405, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 269; York Mfg. Co. v. Cassell, \n201 U.S. 344\n, 50 L. ed. 782, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 481.\n It is objected that the trustee had no right to attack the validity of the chattel mortgage because it did not appear that he represented any but simple contract creditors. But the record before us shows that the entire record of the proceedings in the bankruptcy court was in evidence before the trial court, though it was not returned here, so that if it were necessary that the trustee should represent judgment creditors, which we do not decide that it was, it must be presumed that the trial court, in passing upon all the evidence, found that he did. This may explain why the point was not made in the trial court, and it comes too late here.\n Judgment affirmed.\n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 23b: 'Suits by the trustee shall only be brought or prosecuted in the courts where the bankrupt, whose estate is being administered by such \n trustee, might have brought or presecuted them if proceedings in bankruptcy had not been instituted, unless by consent of the proposed defendant, except suits for the recovery of property under section sixty, subdivision b, and section sixty-seven, subdivision e.'\n Section 60b: 'If a bankrupt shall have given a preference within four months before the filing of a petition, or after the filing of the petition, and before the adjudication, and the person receiving it, or to be benefited thereby, or his agent acting therein, shall have had reasonable cause to believe that it was intended thereby to give a preference, it shall be voidable by the trustee, and he may recover the property or its value from such person.'\n'If a bankrupt shall have given a preference, and the person receiving it, or to be benefited thereby, or his agent acting therein, shall have had reasonable cause to believe that it was intended thereby to give a preference, it shall be voidable by the trustee and he may recover the property or its value from such person. And, for the purpose of such recovery, any court of bankruptcy, as hereinbefore defined, and any state court which would have had jurisdiction if bankruptcy had not intervened, shall have concurrent jurisdiction.'\n\n Section 67e: 'That all conveyances, transfers, assignments, or encumbrances of his property, or any part thereof, made or given by a person adjudged a bankrupt under the provisions of this act, subsequent to the passage of this act and within four months prior to the filing of the petition, with the intent and purpose on his part to hinder, delay, or defraud his creditors, or any of them, shall be null and void as against the creditors of such debtor, except as to purchasers in good faith and for a present fair consideration; and all property of the debtor conveyed, transferred, assigned, or encumbered as aforesaid, shall, if he be adjudged a bankrupt, and the same is not exempt from execution and liability for debts by the law of his domicil, be and remain a part of the assets and estate of the bankrupt, and shall pass to his said trustee, whose duty it shall be to recover and reclaim the same by legal proceedings or otherwise for the benefit of the creditors. And all conveyances, transfers, or encumbrances of his property made by a debtor at any time within four months prior to the filing of the petition against him, and while insolvent, which are held null and void as against the creditors of such debtor by the laws of the state, territory, or district in which such property is situate, shall be deemed null and void under this act against the creditors of such debtor, if he be adjudged a bankrupt, and such property shall pass to the assignee and be by him reclaimed and recovered for the benefit of the creditors of the bankrupt.

DASTAS(1907)\nNo. 72\nArgued: Decided: January 7, 1907\n\n\n\n\n[204 U.S. 64, 65]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles M. Boerman and Fritz von Briesen for appellants.\n\n\n\n[204 U.S. 64, 66]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Frederic D. McKenney; Francis H. Dexter, and John Spalding Flannery for appellee.\n\n\n\n[204 U.S. 64, 67]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n In the district court of Ponce, in October, 1891, through a representative (next friend), Juana Dastas, alleged to be a resident of Porto Rico and a married woman, commenced this suit against her husband, Tomas Garrozi y Pietri, as also against Juana Maria Gonzalez and Domingo Piazzi y Pietri, all three of whom were alleged to be residents of Porto Rico. We shall hereafter after speak of the plaintiff as the wife and the principal defendant, Garrozi, as the husband.\n As far as essential to be considered, the facts alleged, the cause of action relied on, and the proceedings had, up to the pleading by the defendants, are summarized as follows: The marriage took place in May, 1886, and as no antenuptial contract was made, their property relations were governed by the community system under the Code of Porto Rico. They lived together until November, 1898, when they separated, and the wife, under the direction of the husband, resided in a house provided by him. There she lived until December, 1899, when, owing to the failure of the husband to support her, she removed to Ponce.\n The husband in 1901 sued for a divorce on the ground of \n\n[204 U.S. 64, 68]\n\u00a0\n the wife's adultery and she, by a reconventional demand (cross bill), prayed for a divorce on the same ground, and because of cruel treatment. In this suit the court awarded the wife $75 a month alimony pendente lite. This not having been paid, the wife issued execution and realized from a sale of certain furniture one month's alimony. The remainder of the alimony up to the commencement of this suit, aggregating $225 and 598 pesos, Porto Rican currency, the amount of legal expenses incurred by the wife in defending the divorce suit, and which had been allowed by the court, were yet unpaid. These amounts were uncollected because of the apparent insolvency of the husband. This insolvency was, however, only apparent, because there was a large amount of real and personal property belonging separately to the husband, or to the community, which the husband had, with the object of defrauding the wife, apparently disposed of by simulated transfers to the defendants Maria Gonzalez and Domingo Piazzi. The character and extent of this property were detailed as well as the various alleged simulated contracts, which it was averred had been made concerning the same. The prayer was that the contracts in question be set aside as mere fraudulent simulations, so as to enable the wife to exert her rights therein or thereagainst. The court admitted the petition to be filed and authorized the suit by the wife in the name of her representative or next friend. Before the day for pleading, the husband, alleging himself to be a citizen and subject of France, and that by operation to law the wife was of the same nationality, obtained an order for removal to the court below. Subsequently the two other defendants also prayed and were allowed a removal. On the filing of the record a motion to remand was made, based upon the fact that the husband's petition for removal contained no averment of residence. The court refused to remand and allowed an amendment alleging the residence of the husband to be in France.\n Without attempting to state the many pleadings which \n\n[204 U.S. 64, 69]\n\u00a0\n followed, the ultimate issues and the action of the court may be thus summarized: The petition of the wife was amended and reformed, authority being given by the court for the prosecution of the suit on her behalf by her representative or next friend. The petition in its final form was less prolix, and the allegation was added that the divorce proceeding between the husband and wife, referred to in the original petition, had gone to the supreme court of Porto Rico, and had by that court been finally decided, decreeing a divorce in favor of the husband. The prayer for relief was amended to conform to this situation; that is, it was prayed not only that the simulated contracts be set aside, but, further, that the community be liquidated, and the wife he awarded her share. The defense, as finally made on the part of the husband, as well as the other defendants, was an averment of the good faith and reality of all the contracts alleged to have been simulated. Moreover, the husband denied that there was community property, because nothing had been acquired during marriage which fell into the community, and because all the property which he possessed, even assuming that the assailed contracts were simulated, was separate property, either owned at the date of the marriage or thereafter acquired as a reinvestment of separate funds. It was, moreover, specially alleged that, as the divorce had been decreed against the wife on account of her adultery, she had forfeited all her interest in the community if any community property existed. Besides, the right of the wife to compel the liquidation of the community, even if she had not forfeited her right to a participation in the community assets, if any, was specially challenged.\n The court appointed an examiner, who took and reported the testimony. Under a stipulation and order the cause was referred for report to a special master upon the facts and law. Before the master reported the wife prayed a receiver and an injunction, upon averments that the two defendants, to whom it was charged the property of the husband had been seem- \n\n[204 U.S. 64, 70]\n\u00a0\n ingly transferred or encumbered by simulated contracts, were dealing with the same so as to dissipate the estate and frustrate the relief prayed. A receiver was appointed, and the defendants were enjoined as prayed. The report of the special master, as to both the facts and law, substantially sustained the claims of the wife. Exceptions taken to the report were overruled and the report was confirmed. The court below adopted the facts found by the master and reiterated them in the findings in the nature of a special verdict, made for the purposes of the present appeal. By those findings all the charges of fraudulent simulation relied upon by the wife were found to be true, and, as a legal conclusion, all the property and assets to which the simulated contracts related were held to belong to the husband. Concerning the community and its liquidation, it was found, as a matter of fact, that the wife, at the time of the marriage, had no property, and subsequently acquired none, whilst the husband, at the time of the marriage, was the owner of various assets and described property, which was found to have been of the value, at the time of the marriage, of $ 71,500. The net property of the husband at the date of the dissolution of the marriage, including all reinvestments or avails of his separate property existing at the time of the marriage, and, allowing for community debts, was found by the court to be $77,000, thus leaving $5,500 as the acqu et or gain of the community, which was subject to be divided equally between the husband and wife. In addition, the court found that during the marriage the husband had spent, out of the revenues of his property, which revenues fell into the community, the sum of $47,000, during various trips made by him to Europe, and that these expenditures by the husband, from revenue which belonged to the community, were unreasonable to the extent of $22,000. From the facts thus found, as a matter of law, it was concluded that the $22,000 should be treated as an existing acqu et of the community, subject to be equally divided between the parties. The sum, therefore, of the community property for distribution, was \n\n[204 U.S. 64, 71]\n\u00a0\n fixed at $27,500, the wife's share, therefore, being $13,750. The court in its final decree annulled the simulated contracts, and decreed the property to which such contracts related to belong to the husband, and, fixing the sum of the community as above stated, a money decree was entered in favor of the wife for her share thereof,-$13,750. The decree reserved the right of the court to make such further orders as might be necessary, the receiver was directed to make full report, and a special master was appointed with power to sell the property in the custody of the receiver, if necessary, to pay the decree in favor of the wife. On the day after the entry of the final decree, on motion of the wife, the court passed a further decree in her favor, directing the payment to her, first, of the sum of $598, awarded to her by the district court of Ponce as her expenses in the divorce litigation, and the sum of $133.50, interest thereon to the date of the decree; second, the sum of $885, due for alimony awarded by the district court of Ponce to the date of the decree of divorce; and, third, the sum of $1,500, on account of solicitors' fees in the pending litigation,-a total of $3,116.50. The receiver was directed to pay these several sums out of any money in his hands, and, in default of sufficient funds, execution to enforce against the husband was authorized.\n The court, in its findings, has stated the rulings which were excepted to with respect to the admission or rejection of evidence, accompanied with such portions of the evidence as it deemed adequate to enable a review of such rulings.\n Before coming to the merits we must dispose of three preliminary questions. First. The suggestion of a want of jurisdiction in this court is without merit. Royal Ins. Co. v. Martin, \n192 U.S. 149\n, 48 L. ed. 385, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 247. Second. The contention that the court below was without jurisdiction, and that the cause, therefore, should not be passed upon on the merits, but should be remanded to the court below, with directions to remand to the local court from which it was removed, is also without merit. That the case was within the original jurisdiction of \n\n[204 U.S. 64, 72]\n\u00a0\n the United States district court of Porto Rico clearly results from the broad grant of jurisdiction conferred by the 3d section of the act of March 2, 1901 (31 Stat. at L. 953, chap. 812), reading as follows:\n'That the jurisdiction of the district court of the United States for Porto Rico in civil cases shall, in addition to that conferred by the act of April twelfth, nineteen hundred [31 Stat. at L. 77, chap. 191], extend to and embrace controversies where the parties, or either of them, are citizens of the United States, or citizens or subjects of a foreign state or states, wherein the matter in dispute exceeds, exclusive of interest or costs, the sum or value of one thousand dollars.'\n\n The assertion of the want of jurisdiction in the court below rests, however, not upon a denial of power in that court to have entertained the controversy if the suit had been originally brought there, but upon the contention that, as a defendant other than the husband was a resident and citizen of Porto Rico, the cause was improperly removed from the local court. And the proposition goes to the extent of insisting that such want of jurisdiction may be asserted by the person who procured the removal, who resisted the effort to remand, and when the want of jurisdiction is only suggested after trial and final decree. The premise upon which these contentions are based is a portion of the text of the 34th section of what is known as the Foraker act (act of April 12, 1900, 31 Stat. at L. 84, chap. 191) which provides that--\n'The laws of the United States relating to appeals, writs of error and certiorari, removal of causes, and other matters and proceedings as between the courts of the United States and the courts of the several states, shall govern in such matters and proceedings as between the district court of the United States [for Porto Rico] and the courts of Porto Rico.'\n\n Without so deciding, we concede, for the sake of the argument, that where the power to remove from a state court to a court of the United States is restricted by statute to a certain class of cases, a removal operated contrary to the statute \n\n[204 U.S. 64, 73]\n\u00a0\n does not devest the state court of jurisdiction, and, therefore, does not confer jurisdiction on the court to which the cause has been wrongfully removed, even although the cause may have been one of which such court might have taken jurisdiction originally. So, also, we concede for argument sake that in such a case the party wrongfully procuring the removal may escape the effect of a judgment rendered against him in the forum to which he voluntarily resorted, by suggesting after judgment the want of power to remove. But these concessions are not decisive of the case at bar, because of the extent of the jurisdiction conferred upon the United States court in Porto Rico by the act of 1901; that is to say, in consequence of the enlarged character of the jurisdiction conferred by that act, and the obvious departure which it manifests from the principles controlling the jurisdiction of a United States court as contradistinguished from a state court, we do not think the rule which demarks the line between the courts of the United States and state courts within the removal act should be held applicable to Porto Rico to the extent which might have obtained had the act of 1901 not been enacted. We conclude, therefore, that where a case is removed from the local Porto Rican court to the United States court, over which case the latter court would have had jurisdiction as to all the parties impleaded if the case had been there originally brought, even though the removal was irregular, the party who caused the removal cannot be heard, after judgment against him, to assert that the United States court was wanting in jurisdiction solely on the ground that the case was erroneously removed.\n\n 3. \nThe objections to rulings made by the court in admitting and rejecting evidence are numerous. We shall not undertake to review them in detail or state at length our conclusions concerning them, contenting ourselves with saying that, after examining them all, we think they are without foundation, either because fundamentally unsound or because the objections concerned not the admissibility but the mere weight of \n\n[204 U.S. 64, 74]\n\u00a0\n the evidence offered or rejected, or because the record is not in such a condition as to enable us to overcome the strong impression we form that no prejudicial error resulted from the rulings complained of.\n The conclusive effect of the facts found below narrows the issues. Thus the finding that the contracts were fraudulent simulations sustains the legal conclusion that the property to which the contracts related belonged to the husband, and therefore that subject is put out of view. Again, as the facts found concerning the sum of the property owned by the husband at the date of the marriage and the amount owned by him at the date of the dissolution of the community by the divorce sustain the conclusion that the difference between the two was an acqu et or gain of the community, to be divided equally, that question need not be further considered. In order, therefore, to dispose of the entire controversy, it will be necessary to decide only four questions: First, whether the wife, as a consequence of the judgment of divorce rendered against her, had forfeited her interest in the community, if there was any such interest. Second, whether error of law was committed in crediting the community with $ 22,000, the amount expended by the husband for traveling and medical expenses during the years 1889 and 1890, and during the years 1895 to 1898, both inclusive, upon the ground that such expenditures were unreasonable and extravagant, and therefore created an obligation on his part to return the amount to the community as an acqu et or gain thereof. Third, if there was due the wife any amount on account of her interest in the community, and such interest had not been forfeited, was she entitled, as a divorced wife, to provoke a liquidation of the community, and to a degree in her favor for the amount, if any, of her interest in such community? Fourth, did the court below err as a matter of law, in addition to giving the wife a decree for her interest in the community, in allowing her the sum of the alimoney pendente lite decreed in her favor by the local court up to the date of the divorce, the sum of her \n\n[204 U.S. 64, 75]\n\u00a0\n expenses in the divorce suit which had been approved by the local court, and an additional sum of $1,500 for the services of the counsel of the wife in the cause.\n\n 1. \nIt may be conceded that, by the law of Spain, prior to the adoption of the Spanish Civil Code, the wife against whom a judgment of divorce for adultery was decreed forfeited all right to her share in the community existing between herself and husband. But that rigorous rule was not incorporated into the Spanish Civil Code, which was in force in the island of Porto Rico when the territory was acquired. Spanish Code of 1889, War Department translation, title 4,  5, articles 67 et seq. Such forfeiture, moreover, did not obtain in the Porto Rican Civil Code, adopted after the acquisition of the island by the United States, and which was in force in that island when the decree of divorce which was here involved was rendered. Porto Rico, Civil Code 1902, title 5, chap. 5 ,  173, 174. To the contrary, the Code of 1889 provided that, in case of a divorce for adultery, the guilty spouse should forfeit or lose, not his or her interest in the community, but 'all that may have been given or promised him or her by the innocent one, or by any other person, in consideration for the latter.' Code of 1889, art. 73, 3. And a similar provision was incorporated in the Code of 1902, as follows:\n'The party against whom the judgment is rendered (of divorce) shall forfeit to the party obtaining the divorce all gifts which the other party may have conferred upon such party during the marriage, or when the same was contracted, and the innocent party shall retain everything which has been acquired from the other.' Sec. 174.\n\n Both these provisions were plainly intended to depart from the rule of forfeiture prevailing in the more ancient Spanish law and to incorporate the rule of limited forfeiture, as existing in the Louisiana ( article 156) and Napoleon (article 299) Codes; a similar provision to which has been enacted in the codes of some other countries, which have modeled their \n\n[204 U.S. 64, 76]\n\u00a0\n codes on the Code Napoleon. 1 De Saint-Joseph, Concordance, pp. 24 et seq. This conclusion is reinforced by the consideration that, at the time of the adoption of the Spanish and Porto Rican Codes, the provision of the Napoleon Code on that subject had been conclusively determined not to operate a forfeiture of the community property. See authorities collected in note to article 299 in the Fuzier-Herman edition of the Code Napoleon, Paris, 1896\n\n\n The argument advanced in the brief of one of the counsel, that, despite the change in the Code to which we have referred, the old rule of forfeiture should be held to obtain, because of the provision of article 1417 of the Code of 1889 and  1330 of the Code of 1902, saying: 'The spouse who, by bad faith, has been the cause of the nullity (of the marriage), shall not have a share in the common property,' rests upon a mere misconception. The provision relied on in both the Codes relates not to the dissolution of a marriage by a decree of divorce or for any other cause, but to the recognition of the nullity of a seeming marriage for causes which have operated to prevent the marriage from having ever existed. In other words, the distinction between the article relied upon and the other articles to which we have previously referred is that which obtains between a decree of a court dissolving a marriage which has existed and a decree establishing that there never had been a marriage to dissolve. The pertinency of this distinction again becomes manifest when it is observed that a similar distinction and consequence exists in the Code Napoleon.\n\n 2. \nOwing to an apparent ambiguity in the finding of fact concerning the liability of the husband to the community for $22,000 it becomes necessary, before reviewing the legal conclusion of the court below on that subject, to fix the exact meaning of the facts found upon which that legal conclusion was based. As a preliminary to so doing we reproduced in the margin the finding of fact on the subject, as well as the legal conclusion drawn by the court therefrom. \n\n[204 U.S. 64, 77]\n\u00a0\n Whilst there are expressions in the finding referred to which, isolatedly considered, might lead to the inference that it was the intention of the court to find that the husband had not expended the money, but had concealed it or yet had it in his possession, we think the context of the finding and the result of the other findings establish that the court intended to and did find that the money was expended, and that the legal conclusion as to the liability of the husband to the community was arrived at because it was deemed that the expenditure of the money by the husband was unreasonable and extravagant. We say this results from the context, because, taking the whole finding, it seems to us clear that the purpose of the court was as stated. We say also it results from the other findings, because the facts found as to the sum of the property owned by the husband at the time of the marriage \n\n[204 U.S. 64, 78]\n\u00a0\n and the sum possessed by him at the time of the divorce exclude, by necessary implication, the possession by the husband of the $22,000.\n It is provided in both the Code of 1889 (article 1412) and the Code of 1902 ( 1327) the husband 'is the administrator of the conjugal partnership.' By the first of these Codes (article 1413) this power of the husband was so complete as to endow him with authority to sell and encumber, not only all the movable, but also the immovable, property of the community. In the second Code, however ( 1328), the power of the husband to sell or encumber the immovable property is not given, except a contract to that effect is made with the consent of the wife. And by both Codes all contracts of the husband in violation of definite provisions of the Code or in fraud of the rights of the wife are made null and void against the wife or her heirs. Code of 1889, art. 1413; Code of 1902,  1328. The provisions in both Codes making the husband the administrator of the community are here again like unto those obtaining in other countries where the community system prevails. Code Napoleon, art. 1421; Louisiana Code, art. 2404. The question, therefore, is this: Is the power of the husband, as the head and master and administrator of the community, in its nature so restricted that, in the absence of express limitation, he can, after the dissolution of the community, be called to account and compelled to return to the community money which he has actually expended during the existence of the community, because, in the judgment of a court, such expenses may be deemed to have been not suitable to his situation in life, extravagant, or even reckless? To answer this question in the affirmative would be to destroy the whole fabric of the community system as prevailing, not only under the Spanish and Porto Rican Code, but as obtaining in those countries of the continent of Europe and here where that system prevails. We need not consider whether the community was derived from the Roman law, from an express provision of the early Saxon law, or from \n\n[204 U.S. 64, 79]\n\u00a0\n the ancient customary law of the continent. For, however derived, the very foundation of the community and its efficacious existence depends on the power of the husband, during the marriage, over the community, and his right, in the absence of fraud or express legislative restriction, to deal with the community and its assets as the owner thereof. The purpose of the community, as expounded from the earliest times, whilst securing to the wife, on the dissolution of the marriage, an equal portion of the net results of the common industry, common economy, and common sacrifice, was yet, as a matter of necessity, during the existence of the community, not to render the community inept and valueless to both parties by weakening the marital power of the husband as to his expenditures and contracts, so as to cause him to be a mere limited and consequently inefficient agent. See a very full citation of authority in Journal du Palais Repertoire, verbo, 'Communaut e,' pp. 739, 741 et seq.\n In determining the authority of the husband as to the common property two considerations are essential: The character of the right of the wife to the common property during the existence of the marriage, and the scope of the power of the husband during the same period. In speaking on the nature of the right of the wife, Troplong says:\n'The rights of the wife are dormant during the marriage, because the husband is charged to watch over and conduct the affairs of the conjugal society. But this right, which is inert as long as the husband is at the head of the affairs of the community, becomes active when the marital authority ceases to exist. The wife is like a silent partner, whose rights arise and reveral themselves when the partnership ceases.' 2 Troplong, Contrat de Mariage, p. 136, No. 855.\n\n Under the law of France prior to the Napoleon Code the extent of the power of the husband as to the community property was so great that it was considered in theory that the rights of the wife in or to the community were not merely dormant during the marriage, but had no existence whatever. \n\n[204 U.S. 64, 80]\n\u00a0\n In other words, the doctrine was upheld that the wife, during the existence of the community, had but a mere hope or expectancy, and hence no interest whatever in the property or goods of the community until the community was dissolved. Dumoulin, Sur Part. 25, Cout. de Paris. And from this arose the expression that the community was a partnership which only commenced on its termination. As the result, however, of the right conferred upon the wife by some of the customs of France before the Code Napoleon, and also expressly given by that Code (Code Napoleon, 1443 et seq.), to procure a decree dissolving the community when the affairs of the husband were in such disorder as to entail risk upon the wife, it is the generally accepted doctrine under the Napoleon Code that the wife's interest in the community prior to the dissolution is subsisting, though dormant. But this implies no limit on the power of the husband whilst the community exists. In other words, although the right to a separation of property arises from the reckless conduct of the husband, thus affording a means of guarding against the consequences of such conduct in the future, the right to ask a separation does not give rise to the inference that the husband, after the dissolution of the community, may be held to account for money expended by him during the community because of reckless or extravagant conduct. Speaking on this subject, Rodiere and Pont (Trait e du Contrat de Mariage) say (p. 596, No. 657):\n'The husband can then sell [the immovable property of the community] by onerous title; he has in this respect an absolute power, and if, in disregard of the confidence which the law reposes in him, the husband, in disposing of the property, is impelled by the wish to indulge extravagant tastes or to provide for reckless dissipation, and not by the purpose of protecting the rights of the wife, the latter, even under these circumstances, has no recourse but to obtain a judicial termination of the community.'\n\n Referring to the power of the husband over the community, Troplong says: \n\n[204 U.S. 64, 81]\n\u00a0\n 'This power of the husband, which effaces the personality of the wife, and which is manifested by the name of lord and master of the community, given to the husband,-this power, which seems like unto an absolute sovereignty,-exists as well in the relations of the spouses between themselves as in their dealings between third parties. In effect, the husband can dissipate the goods of the community; he can lose, destroy, break, and dilapidate. Maritus potest perdere, dissipare, abuti; this is an elementary axiom of the Palace (of Justice). The wife has no right to call the husband to account, no damage to obtain for his acts. Hence it is true, indeed, that the husband is more than an administrator: he is an administrator com libera.' Ibid. p. 138, No. 158.\n See, to the same effect, the copious collection of authority found under article 1421 of the Code Napoleon, in the Fuzier-Herman edition of that Code, supra.\n That there is a substantial similarity between the law of the community under the Napoleon Code and the law on the same subject of Spain, prior to the Civil Code, and as now existing under that and the Code of Porto Rico, was conceded in the argument of the appellee. Indeed, that argument refers to and rests on some of the provisions of the Napoleon Code. Besides, when it is considered that the ancient Spanish law, and that law as formulated in the Code of 1889 or in the Porto Rican Code of 1902, confers no authority upon the wife to obtain a judicial dissolution of the community merely because of the disorder of the husband's affairs, it follows that the power of the husband under the Spanish system is in principle more extensive than it is under the Code Napoleon and the law of the countries which have followed that Code. The practical identity of the husband's general authority, as head and master of the community, under the law of Louisiana, the Code Napoleon, and the Spanish law, was clearly expounded by the supreme court of Louisiana, in Guice v. Lawrence, 2 La. Ann. 226, as follows:\n'The laws of Louisiana have never recognized a title in the \n\n[204 U.S. 64, 82]\n\u00a0\n wife during marriage to one half of the acqu ets and gains. The rule of the Spanish law on that subject is laid down by Febrero with his usual precision. The ownership of the wife, says that author, is revocable and fictitious during marriage. As long as the husband lives and the marriage is not dissolved, the wife must not say that she has gananciales, nor is she to prevent the husband from using them, under the pretext that the law gives her one half. But, soluto matrimonio, she became irrevocably the owner of one undivided half, in the manner provided by law for ordinary joint ownership. The husband is, during marriage, real y verdadero due no de todos, y tiene en el efecto de su dominio irrevocable. Febrero, Adic. tomo 1 y 4, pt. 2d, bk. 1st, chap. 4, 1, nos. 29 and 30; Pothier, Communaut e, p. 35 and following; 12 Toullier, chap. 2, nos. 22 to 31; 14 Duranton, Droit Francais, p. 281 and following; 10 Dalloz, Jurisp. p. 198 and following.\n\n'The provisions of our Code on the same subject are the embodiment of those of the Spanish law, without any change. The husband is head and master of the community, and has power to alienate the immovables which compose it by an encumbered title, without the consent or permission of his wife. Civil Code, art. 2373.'\n\n True it is that in the Porto Rican Code of 1902 there was inserted a provision, previously commented on ( 1328), limiting the power of the husband to dispose of the immovable property of the community without the consent of the wife. But this express limitation as to one particular class of property, by inverse reasoning, is a reaffirmance of the power of the husband as head and master of the community in all other respects. The contention that because both by the Code of 1889 and of 1902 acts done by the husband as head and master of the community in fraud of the wife shall be void, therefore the expenses of the husband made during the community are subject to be reviewed on the dissolution of the community because of their unreasonable character, is without merit. The fraud referred to of necessity relates to acts done by the \n\n[204 U.S. 64, 83]\n\u00a0\n husband beyond his lawful authority, or which, if within his authority, have been done for the purpose of enriching himself or his separate estate or some third person, and which, therefore, whilst seemingly acts of community administration, are really not of that character.\n\n 3. \nThe contention that the wife, even after the dissolution of the marriage, was without power to obtain the liquidation of the community and a payment to her of her share thereof, is based upon what is asserted to be the correct interpretation of articles 73, 1733, 1434, and 1435 of the Code of 1889. By these articles, it is insisted, where the dissolution of the marriage has been decreed because of the fault of one of the parties, the separation of property does not follow as a legal right in favor of the party for whose wrong conduct the divorce has been decreed, and may only be allowed by a court at the request or option of the one in whose favor the decree was rendered. And it is, moreover, insisted that if the divorce has been rendered in favor of a husband and against a wife for her fault, and a separation of property has been thereafter decreed at the instance of the husband, the power of the husband to administer the wife's share of the community remains whilst her interest in future acqu ets or gains disappears. But this reduces itself to the contention that in the case stated the community is dissolved, yet continued. But whilst this reduction may point to the want of coherency in the proposition, it is no reason why the Code should not be enforced, if so it is plainly written. We do not stop to analyze the texts of the Code of 1889, relied on, for we think they are not controlling, even if they have the peculiar meaning contended for. We so conclude because of a change made by the Code of 1902. As we have already said, we are of the opinion that that Code was in effect at the date of the rendering of the divorce decree. Now, that Code not only eliminated the provisions of article 73 of the Code of 1889, relied on, but substituted a wholly different provision, directly repugnant to the contention we are considering. The provision referred to is  173 of the Code \n\n[204 U.S. 64, 84]\n\u00a0\n of 1902, saying: 'A divorce carries with it a complete dissolution of all matrimonial ties and the division of all property and effects between the parties to the marriage.' The argument made in the brief of one of the counsel that, even although the wife was entitled to a liquidation of the community and to a decree for her share, the court below erred in giving a money judgment in her favor, because in any event it could only have lawfully awarded an aliquot share of the community property subject to be subsequently realized by a partition in kind or by licitation (sale), is unsound. As to the merit of the contention, if any, as a general proposition, we are not called upon in this case to express an opinion. We say this because, as a necessary result of the findings below, all the property either belonged to the husband at the date of the marriage or was afterwards acquired by him as a reinvestment of funds derived from such property owned by him at the marriage. It follows, therefore, that the rights of the wife arose simply either from an increased value of property or assets brought by the husband into marriage, or as a result of the falling into the community of the revenues of the property of the husband. Under these circumstances we think the decree below was right.\n\n 4. \nThe amount of the decree for alimony pendente lite and for expenses incurred by the wife in the divorce suit had been sanctioned by the local court and were binding upon the husband. We see no reason, therefore, why the court below should not have allowed those items. So far as the sum of $1,500 for counsel fees in the pending litigation, which the court allowed as a charge against the husband, we have been referred to no authority sustaining the right to allow it, and our own researches have enabled us to discover no sanction for such an award.\n It follows that whilst the court below was right in allowing the wife the sum of $2,750 as her share of the acqu ets and gains of the community as established by the findings of fact, the court was wrong in allowing the $22,000, and the $1,500 \n\n[204 U.S. 64, 85]\n\u00a0\n attorney's fee. The decree below must therefore be reversed and the cause be remanded with directions to enter a decree for the $2,750 and the alimony and expenses incurred in the divorce suit with the approval of the court as previously allowed, but rejecting the claim for $22,000 and $1, 500, the costs of this court to be borne by the appellee and those of the court below by the appellants.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n That said defendant Garrozi made several trips to Europe during the \n continuance of his marital partnership, and spent large sums of money by reason thereof, which were, as near as can be determined from his testimony, the following amounts:\n In 1889 $10,000.00 In 1890 7,000.00 In 1895 5,000.00 1n 1896-98 25,000.00 ___ Total $47,000.00\n Said defendant claims in his testimony that these trips to Europe and the expenditure of these large sums of money was rendered necessary by reason of his serious and continued illness. But said testimony is not substantiated by that of any other credible witness, while, if true, it could have been easily proven by the testimony of some of the physicians who attended him, and who must have had full knowledge of his condition during these times. But even granting that the journeys were necessary to defendant's health, the court is forced to the conclusion, either that said defendant has exaggerated the amounts expended or that such extravagant expenditures were not either necessary or reasonable, and hence not a proper charge against the property of the marital partnership.\n It seems that twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) would have been a liberal expenditure under the circumstances for a man in defendant Garrozi's condition of life.\n The court therefore concludes that twenty-two thousand dollars ($22, 000.00) of the amount should be charged against the separate property of defendant Garrozi. \n\n\n\n\n","62":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGILA BEND RESERVOIR & IRRIGATION CO. v. GILA WATER CO.(1907)\nNo. 226\nArgued: Decided: April 8, 1907\n\n\n\n Messrs. Hugh T. Taggart and William C. Prentiss for appellant.\n Mr. C. F. Ainsworth for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n During the October term, 1905, and on May 14, 1906 (\n202 U.S. 270\n, 50 L. ed. 1023, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 615), the decree of the supreme court of the territory of Arizona in this case was affirmed. On May 26 (the last day \n\n[205 U.S. 279, 280]\n\u00a0\n of the term) an order was entered which in effect continued the jurisdiction of this court to the present term, giving opportunity to appellant to present a petition for rehearing during the vacation. That petition was presented, and, in the early part of this term, after full consideration, was denied. Subsequently, lest in the confused state of the record it might be supposed by either of the parties that the facts had been misapprehended, we, on January 7, 1907, entered an order withdrawing the memorandum denying the petition for rehearing, and granting leave to counsel on both sides to file such additional briefs as they desired. In pursuance of this leave briefs on both sides have been filed, and we have again examined the record.\n This consists of the pleadings, the decree in favor of the defendant, a bill of exceptions divided into two parts,-one being a statement of exceptions, and the other a narrative of the 'circumstances and evidence,'- the decree and opinion of the supreme court, and a statement of facts prepared for the review by this court. The opinion was filed March 26, 1904, and the statement of facts allowed February 21, 1905, nearly a year after the decision. In addition there appears a motion made in the supreme court by the appellee to strike from the files the abstract of record for several reasons, one of which was that it did not contain the findings of fact and the conclusions of law of the district court. This is followed by the suggestion of a diminution of the record in what purports to be these findings and conclusions. It does not appear that any action was taken by the supreme court upon this motion, or any leave given to amend the record by the addition of the findings and conclusions.\n We copy in full the statement of facts prepared and allowed by the supreme court:\n'Statement of facts in this case in the nature of a special verdict made by the supreme court of the territory of Arizona, and also rulings of the court below on the admission and rejection of evidence as excepted to on the foregoing transcript \n\n[205 U.S. 279, 281]\n\u00a0\n of the record in the above-entitled cause, to be used by appellant herein in its appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States.\n\n'That the above-entitled cause was tried in the court below upon the complaint, which was the statement of a cause of action to quiet title to the property described in said complaint against the defendants therein mentioned; the amended answer of the Gila Water Company, one of the said defendants, denying the plaintiff in said complaint being the owner of the property therein described, said defendant further alleging peaceable and adverse possession of the property described in plaintiff's complaint under the title and color of title for more than three years preceding the date of the commencement of the above action, and also alleging peaceable and adverse possession of said property for more than five years before the commencement of the suit, using and enjoying the same, paying taxes thereon, claiming under deeds duly recorded; the cross complaint of said defendant, Gila Water Company, claiming to be the owner in fee simple of all the property described in plaintiff's complaint in said cause, and the answer of appellant herein to said Gila Water Company's cross complaint;\n\n'That all of the other defendants mentioned in said complaint answered and disclaimed any right, title, and interest in and to the property described in said complaint;\n\n'That this supreme court adopts and makes a part of this statement of facts the bill of exceptions in this case, part I., exceptions, part II., circumstances and evidence, as certified and signed on the 24th day of November, 1902, by Hon. Edward Kent, the presiding judge who tried this cause below, the same as if it were set forth at length herein;\n\n'That no order was made in the court below consolidating the case known as No. 1728 in the trial court and the case known as No. 1996 in the same court, said cases being those the record of which is referred to in the above-mentioned bill of exceptions; \n\n[205 U.S. 279, 282]\n\u00a0\n 'That the receiver appointed in said case No. 1728 made the sale and executed the deed under which the Gila Water Company, appellee, claims title to the property in dispute; that no order was in terms made extending the receivership in said case No. 1728 to said case No. 1996, the latter case being the one in which said receiver made said sale, and, by the judgment rendered therein, assumed to convey the title to said property; that the only orders made in said case No. 1996 relating to said receivership are those dated May 29, 1894, November 23, 1898, July 21, 1894, November 20, 1894, and January 10, 1895, referred to in said bill of exceptions.\n\n'That from the foregoing record and facts, the court finds that plaintiff and appellant herein, Gila Bend Reservoir & Irrigation Company, a corporation, has not and did not have, at the commencement of this action, any cause of action in respect to, nor did it have and has not now any right, title, or interest in and to the property or any part thereof mentioned and described in the complaint herein; that the defendant appellee, Gila Water Company, a corporation, was, at the time of the commencement of this action and is now, the owner in fee simple and in possession of all the property mentioned and described in plaintiff's complaint herein.'\n\n Appellant invokes the doctrine laid down in Herrick v. Boquillas Land & Cattle Co. \n200 \nU.S. 96, 98\n, 50 S. L. ed. 388, 389, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 192; Harrison v. Perea, \n168 \nU.S. 311, 323\n, 42 S. L. ed. 478, 482, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 129, and cases cited in the opinion, to the effect that our jurisdiction on an appeal from the supreme court of a territory, 'apart from exceptions duly taken to rulings on the admission or rejection of evidence, is limited to determining whether the findings of facts support the judgment.' Of course, if there are no findings or statement of facts and no exceptions in respect to the introduction or rejection of testimony, the decree will be affirmed, if responsive to the allegations of the pleadings.\n The statement of facts prepared by the supreme court, standing by itself, is incomplete, but it is helped by a reference to the bill of exceptions in the trial court, which is adopted \n\n[205 U.S. 279, 283]\n\u00a0\n and made part of the statement. True, much of the matter in this bill is a mere recital of testimony, but we find in it copies of certain orders and decrees. Putting all together, we are enabled to see clearly the scope of the inquiry. It appears that prior to this litigation two suits were brought in the trial court, one numbered 1728 and the other 1996. The appellant was defendant in the latter. In the first an order was made December 6, 1893, appointing James McMillan receiver of the property now in question. The complaint in suit No. 1996, alleging that the court had already appointed a receiver in the prior case, prayed the appointment of a receiver or an enlargement of the powers of the one then acting, and that he take possession of the property and sell the same to pay the debts. No order appears of record in terms either consolidating the two cases or extending the receivership in case No. 1728 to case No. 1996. A decree was entered in suit No. 1996, of date November 20, 1894, which, after finding the amounts due certain creditors, adjudged and decreed 'that James McMillan, the receiver heretofore appointed by this court, and now in possession of said premises, under the orders of this court, proceed to advertise and sell said property and distribute the proceeds as directed in the decree.' On January 3, 1895, a report, bearing a double heading, to wit the titles and headings of both suits Nos. 1728 and 1996, and purporting to be of a sale of the property by James McMillan, receiver, under the order and decree in suit No. 1996, was filed in the court, and on January 10, 1895, an order bearing the same double heading of the two suits was entered, confirming that sale. Subsequently a deed of the property to the purchaser was executed, purporting to be from the receiver duly appointed in the two equity suits, with titles and numbers as above.\n The decree in suit No. 1996 was appealed to the territorial and United States Supreme Courts, and affirmed by each of them. The briefs of appellant in the territorial supreme court show that the question of the jurisdiction of a court, in \n\n[205 U.S. 279, 284]\n\u00a0\n a particular case, over property in its actual possession, was not presented. In the brief of appellant filed in this case this statement appears:\n'So confident were counsel of the lack of equity in the bill and of reversal by the appellate courts that the fundamental question of jurisdiction, now urged, was overlooked.\n\n'Indeed, the attention of counsel was so centered upon that point and the question of change of venue that in the brief in this court it was even stated that the receiver had been appointed upon motion of the plaintiffs in suit No. 1996, and that the decree therein of November 20, 1894, provided for the appointment of a receiver.'\n\n It is now contended that, inasmuch as the question is one of jurisdiction, neither the omission to call attention to the matter in the prior litigation nor the misrecital of fact operates to render the decree in that case res judicata upon the question, but leaves the matter open for present inquiry. Counsel are mistaken. In that litigation the present appellant was the defendant. The property was in the possession of the court, even if held under a prior receivership. The decree directed its sale. It was sold. The sale was confirmed, the deed made, and the property delivered to the purchaser. The appellant at least cannot now question the jurisdiction of the court in that suit, or the title which it conveyed to the purchaser at the sale. A failure to make a defense by a party who is in court is, generally speaking, equivalent to making a defense and having it overruled.\n Further, in the opinion heretofore filed, after referring to the declaration of the supreme court of the territory that the trial 'court, by its action, ratified the acts of the receiver in the second suit, and thereby, in effect, extended his power and authority as such receiver to such second suit,' we said (p. 274, L. ed. p. 1025, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 616):\n'The objection made by the appellant to it is, as we have indicated, that suit No. 1996 was a proceeding in rem, and that the court did not acquire jurisdiction of the property \n\n[205 U.S. 279, 285]\n\u00a0\n for the reason that it was in the custody of the court in suit No. 1728, and that the court in the latter case did not extend the receivership to the No. 1996, nor consolidate the suits, and, therefore, had no power to order the sale of the property by the receiver in No. 1728.\n\n'This is tantamount to saying that the absence of formal orders by the court must prevail over its essential action. It is clear from the record that the district court considered the cases pending before it at the same time, considered No. 1996 as the complement of No. 1728, regarded the cases in fact as consolidated, and empowered the receiver appointed in 1728 to sell the property and distribute the proceeds as directed by the decree in 1996.'\n\n Nothing further need be added to show that the case was rightly decided. The petition for a rehearing is denied.\n Mr. Justice Moody took no part in the decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","63":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGOAT & SHEEPSKIN IMPORT CO. v. U S(1907)\nNo. 261\nArgued: April 18, 1907Decided: May 13, 1907\n\n\n\n\n[206 U.S. 194, 195]\n\u00a0\n This case comes here by virtue of a writ of certiorari issued from this court to the United States circuit court of appeals for the second circuit, for the purpose of reviewing the action of the courts and of the customs authorities in relation to an assessment of duty on certain importations made by the petitioner, appellant, at the port of New York.\n The merchandise on which duty was assessed was a growth upon certain skins of the Mocha sheep, imported from Hodeida, Arabia, which growth was classified by the collector as wool on the skin of the third class, and assessed for duty at 3 cents per pound, under the provisions of paragraph 360 of the tariff act of July 24, 1897 (30 Stat. at L. pages 151, 183, chap. 11, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 1626, 1666). The importer duly protested against the classification, and insisted that the merchandise was entitled to entry free of duty under paragraph 571 (30 Stat. at L. supra, page 198, chap. 11, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1684), or under paragraph 664 of such act. Page 201 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1688). Paragraphs 351, 358, 360, under which the government claims duty, and paragraphs 571 and 664, under which the importer claims free entry, are set forth in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[206 U.S. 194, 196]\n\u00a0\n The collector having returned the merchandise in question as wool of the third class, under paragraph 360, the importer appealed to the board of general appraisers, where the ruling of the collector was sustained, and the importer then appealed to the circuit court, and then to the circuit court of appeals, each of which courts sustained the ruling of the board of general appraisers and the collector.\n Before the board of general appraisers the importer produced six witnesses, who testified as to the character, use, and commercial designation of the merchandise. On the appeal to the circuit court a referee was there appointed, and the importer offered further evidence to sustain his claim that the merchandise was entitled to free entry.\n No testimony was offered by the government. It is not claimed by the government that the merchandise in question comes under paragraph 351 as wool of the third class (except as it may be wool of like character), as it is not Donskoi, native South American, Cordova, Valparaiso, native Smyrna or Russian camel's hair, but it is asserted that the growth on the skins was wool on the skin under paragraph 360, or was a wool of like character as that above enumerated in paragraph 351.\n The evidence shows that the hair or wool (whichever it is called) grows on the Mocha white sheep, imported from Hodeida, Arabia. The growth to be found on this breed of sheep is not bought or sold in this country as wool, but as hair. It would not be accepted as a delivery of wool of any grade by those dealing in that article. Although there might have been a very small proportion of what might possibly be termed very inferior wool on these skins (not more than 10 per centum in any case, and frequently less), yet there was no substantial use of any portion of the growth on the skins for purposes for \n\n[206 U.S. 194, 197]\n\u00a0\n which wool is generally used. To some extent, but very little, it had been tried in mills to spin, and it might be used sometimes by carpet manufacturers in a small way, and efforts had been made to use it, mixed with wool, in spinning, but it was not practically successful, nor was it practicable to use it for other purposes for which wool is used. The chief, or predominant, and almost sole use of the substance is as hair for stuffing, and for the saddlery trade, and by bed manufacturers for stuffing purposes. It is bought and sold all over the country as Mocha hair. The skin upon which the substance grows is the thing that is valuable. A large part of the skins imported into this country is used in the manufacture of glove leather. One witness testified that his firm so used from 75 to 90 per cent of the skins imported, and the growth thereon was bought and sold as Mocha hair. It costs more to remove the growth from the skin than it sells for after its removal. It cannot be used for spinning purposes because it would not hold together. It might be carded, but there would not be much left after carding. The price of the skins on which this growth is found is not influenced by the quantity of the growth on them. The more of a growth there is, the less the skin will bring, or, as is said, the more hair, the poorer the skin. The skins are sold by the importers to tanners of gloves and shoe leather, just as they arrive. After the growth is washed and removed from the skin it may be sold for from 3 to 5 cents per pound, which is less than the cost of removing it. In buying the skins no notice is taken of the growth, the only consideration being the value of the pelt, and the pelts are worth no more with long hair on than short hair. The growth has never been accepted or sold as wool, but, on the contrary, prior to July 24, 1897, when the tariff act was passed, it was uniformly regarded and bought and sold in the United States as hair. 'Mocha hair' was the trade nomenclature prior to 1899, and as such the trade name was definite and uniform throughout the United States, and dealers in it never knew it to be called anything else than Mocha hair. It has not the appearance of \n\n[206 U.S. 194, 198]\n\u00a0\n wool, does not feel like wool, and has none of the qualities of wool. It is bought from tanners after it has been taken from the skin by them, and it is thus sold and bought as Mocha hair, and the skins are used for leather by the tanners.\n One of the witnesses called on behalf of the importers was an examiner of wool fibers and skins at the port of New York, which position he had held for about fifteen years. He said that when he first went into the government employ such skins as those in question were returned free, the hair as well as the skin, but that practice has since been changed. The witness further said that if the growth in question were found on a goat he would return it as hair of a goat, and entitled to free entry; that wool could be run down, or deteriorate, to such a condition as the growth in question, but that it was, in fact, mostly 'what they call dead hair or kemp;' that although it could possibly be carded, it was not commercially suitable, and there would not be much left after they got through carding it. On cross-examination the witness said that he would return the article in question as Mocha sheepskin with the wool on. On such a skin as the one in question the witness said there was a substance which he would call wool, which was about 10 per cent only of the growth; that he examines such skins as the ones in question and throws out those he considers dutiable when there is enough wool to call it dutiable, and lets the skins go not dutiable when you could not make anything out of the growth in any way, although some use might possibly be made of it.\n The cross-examination of other witnesses was to the effect that this growth had been tried in mills for the purpose of spinning, but very little, being used with other stock to make into yarn, but it has not been successfully used for that purpose; it might be used sometimes by carpet manufacturers in a small way, and, while it could not be used or spun alone, it might be carded. It was also said on cross-examination of one of the witnesses that if such growth ran pretty white it is sometimes used in those low-grade carpet yarns where they put in such stuff as jute packing is made of and some hair like the growth \n\n[206 U.S. 194, 199]\n\u00a0\n in question. The evidence is, however, overwhelming and the witnesses substantially unanimous, that this substance is not known as wool, and is neither bought nor sold as such, and is commercially known as Mocha hair, and is not used as wool.\n Messrs. J. Stuart Tompkins, Edward S. Hatch, and Hatch, Keener, & Clute for petitioner.\n\n\n[206 U.S. 194, 200]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General Sanford for respondent.\n\n\n\n[206 U.S. 194, 202]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The evidence in this case, taken before the board of appraisers and also before the circuit court, is uncontradicted. It shows that the substance in question is not wool, has none of its characteristics, and is not put to any of its uses, and does not appear like wool. On the contrary, it is composed mostly of dead hair or kemp and cannot be remuneratively carded, nor is it commercially suited for carding, nor for spinning. Its commercial designation is Mocha hair, and it is not known or regarded or recognized as wool in any of the markets of the country.\n It is not denied that the commercial designation of an article, which designation was known at the time of the passage of a tariff act, is the name by which the article should be classified \n\n[206 U.S. 194, 203]\n\u00a0\n for the payment of duty, and, as is stated, 'without regard to their scientific designation and material of which they may be made, or the use to which they may be applied.' Two Hundred Chests of Tea, 9 Wheat. 430, 438, 6 L. ed. 128, 130; Arthur v. Morrison, \n96 U.S. 108\n, 24 L. ed. 764; American Net & Twine Co. v. Worthington, \n141 U.S. 468\n, 35 L. ed. 821, 12 Sup.

As was said by Mr. Justice Story in Two Hundred Chests of Tea, supra, Congress did not 'suppose our merchants to be naturalists or geologists or botanists. It applied its attention to the description of articles as they derived their appellantions in our own markets, in our domestic as well as our foreign traffic.' And in Hedden v. Richard, supra, it was said: 'The language of commerce . . . must be construed, . . . particularly when employed in the denomination of articles, according to the commercial understanding of the terms used.' The commercial designation should prevail unless Congress has clearly manifested a contrary intention. Cadwalader v. Zeh, \n151 \nU.S. 171, 176\n, 38 S. L. ed. 115, 117, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 288.\n We are of opinion that the use of the word 'wool' in the tariff act excluded a substance which, while it was a growth upon a sheepskin, was nevertheless commercially known, designated, and dealt in as Mocha hair, having none of the characteristics of wool, and which would not be accepted by dealers therein as a good delivery of wool.\n In this case the evidence is uncontradicted that the growth on these skins was commercially known as Mocha hair, and that it was not used in the way wool is used, or as a substitute for wool. It ought not, simply for the reason that the skin upon which it grows is the skin of a sheep, to be classified as wool, under paragraph 360 of the tariff act, and thereby be subjected to a duty as high as the value of the substance itself.\n Although it has been so classified, and that classification has been affirmed all through, yet the question is not presented to this court as if it were a question of fact decided upon contradictory evidence, and concluding this court for that reason. There is, in truth, no contradictory evidence in the case. It is one where, in our opinion, the courts below have given undue \n\n[206 U.S. 194, 204]\n\u00a0\n weight to the evidence elicited on cross-examination of witnesses called on the part of the importer, which showed that there possibly was, in some cases, a very little inferior wool found on these skins, while the courts ignored the other facts, as testified to by the same witnesses and already mentioned, which showed beyond the possibility of successful contradiction that the substance was erroneously classified as wool.\n Upon the facts, the substance ought not to have been so classified. The growth being still on the skin should have been regarded as part of such skin, and classified under paragraph 664, in the free list, and not as a sheepskin with the wool on.\n We do not agree that the word 'wool' in this act is used in a generic sense so far as this particular point is concerned. The word does not necessarily include all growth upon the coat of a sheep, even though the substance is like that in question here.\n Counsel for the government cites from the Encyclopedia Britannica, where, in speaking of the difficulty in determining the dividing line between hair and wool, it is said: 'At what point, indeed, it can be said that an animal fiber ceases to be hair and becomes wool it is impossible to determine, because in every characteristic the one class by imperceptible gradations merges into the other, so that a continuous chain can be formed from the finest and softest merino to the rigid bristles of the wild boar.'\n It may be difficult in some cases to define the line between 'wool' and 'hair' as a growth upon skins, but we do not regard that difficulty as an argument for the construction contended for by counsel for the government. That argument leads to the classification of a substance like that in question as wool, when in fact it bears no resemblance to it, is not used as wool, and has none of its characteristics, and is known commercially as Mocha hair, and is so bought and sold over the whole country. The case is one of degree; and because, in some few cases, the points may closely approach each other, and there may be, in such cases, some difficulty in telling wool from hair, \n\n[206 U.S. 194, 205]\n\u00a0\n yet that fact furnishes no reason for refusing to adopt the general test which, in most cases, is easily applied,-fitness, identity of use, commercial designation. To adopt the claim of counsel eliminates all inquiry as to whether an article is wool or hair, and leaves simply the question whether it is to be found on what may be called the wool-bearing animals or on the alpaca or other like hair-coated animals. Some sheep are wool-bearing animals; therefore the hair on the skin of the Mocha sheep is wool and must be classified as such. We do not agree with this claim. If an article does not, to a dealer, look like wool, cannot be used as wool, is not commercially known as wool, but, on the contrary, is bought and sold throughout the country as Mocha hair, and is so designated commercially by those dealing in it, it ought not to be classified as wool or made to pay duty as such, simply because it grows on a sheep.\n We have looked over the various authorities cited by counsel for the government, but we see nothing in any of them tending to the conclusion that, upon the facts in this case, the growth on the skin of the Mocha sheep was properly classified as wool.\n Taking all the evidence in this case, uncontradicted as it is, we feel compelled to the conclusion that the classification in this case, adopted by the courts below and by the appraisers and collector, was wrong, and that the merchandise in question was entitled to free entry.\n The judgments of the courts below are reversed and the case remanded to the Circuit Court with instructions to take such further proceedings as may be necessary, not inconsistent with this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice Moody took no part in the decision of this case.\n\nFootnotes\n Paragraphs from tariff act of 1897, under which the government claims. 30 Stat. at L. 151, 183, chap. 11, U.

U S(1907)\nNo. 358\nArgued: Decided: May 27, 1907\n\n\n\n\n[206 U.S. 333, 334]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Clarence S. Nettles, John H. Atwood, and Frederic D. McKenney for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[206 U.S. 333, 336]\n\u00a0\n Solicitor General Hoyt for defendant in error.\n\n\n[206 U.S. 333, 340]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of the court:\n The writ of error brings up for review a judgment of the supreme court of the Philippine Islands, affirming a judgment of the court of first instance in the province of Iloilo, by which the plaintiff in error, Grafton, was adjudged guilty \n\n[206 U.S. 333, 341]\n\u00a0\n of homicide as defined by the Penal Code of the Philippines, and sentenced to imprisonment for twelve years and one day.\n The history of this criminal prosecution, as disclosed by the record, is as follows:\n Homer E. Grafton, a private in the Army of the United States, was tried before a general court-martial convened in 1904 by Brigadier General Carter, commanding the department of the Visayas, Philippine Islands, upon the following charge and specifications: 'Charge: Violation of the 62d Article of War: Specification 1. In that Private Homer E. Grafton, Company G, 12th Infantry, being a sentry on post, did unlawfully, wilfully, and feloniously kill Florentino Castro, a Philippino, by shooting him with a U. S. magazine rifle, caliber .30. This at Buena Vista Landing, Guimaras, P. I., July 24th, 1904. Specification 2. In that Private Homer E. Grafton, Company G, 12th Infantry, being a sentry on post, did unlawfully, wilfully, and feloniously kill Felix Villanueva, a Philippino, by shooting him with a U. S. magazine rifle, caliber .30. This at Buena Vista Landing, Guimaras, P. I., July 24th, 1904.'\n By the 58th Article of War it is provided: 'In time of war, insurrection, or rebellion, larceny, robbery, burglary, arson, mayhem, manslaughter, murder, assault and battery with an intent to kill, wounding, by shooting or stabbing, with an intent to commit murder, rape, or assault and battery with an intent to commit rape, shall be punishable by the sentence of a general court-martial, when committed by persons in the military service of the United States, and the punishment in any such case shall not be less than the punishment provided for the like offense by the laws of the state, territory, or district in which such offense may have been committed.'\n The 62d Article of War is in these words: 'All crimes not capital, and all disorders and neglects which officers and soldiers may be guilty of to the prejudice of good order and military discipline, though not mentioned in the foregoing Articles of War, are to be taken cognizance of by a general, or a \n\n[206 U.S. 333, 342]\n\u00a0\n regimental, garrison, or field officers' courtmartial, according to the nature and degree of the offense, and punished at the discretion of such court.'\n The accused pleaded not guilty to each specification as well as to the charge. At the trial he made the following admission in writing: 'I admit that on July 24th, 1904, I was a member of a detachment of Company G, 12th Infantry, on duty at Buena Vista Landing, Guimaras, P. I.; that on July 24th, 1904, I was regularly detailed on guard and was a member of the first relief. That I was on post between the hours of 2 and 4 p. m. In the execution of my duty I shot two male Philippinos with a U. S. magazine rifle, caliber .30.'\n The court found the soldier not guilty as to each specification, and not guilty of the charge. His acquittal was approved by the department commander on August 25th, 1904, and he was released from confinement and restored to duty. It appeared in proof that the accused was of excellent character; and it is stated in the opinion of the supreme court of the Philippines that, before holding the court-martial, the department commander offered to submit the case to the court of first instance of the province, but it did not appear what action was taken by the judge of that court in reference to that offer.\n On the 28th day of November, 1904, the prosecuting attorney of the province of Iloilo, Philippine Islands, filed a criminal information or complaint in the name of the United States, in the court of first instance of that province, as follows: 'The subscriber accuses Homer E. Grafton of the crime of assassination, committed in the manner following: That on the 24th of July, 1904, and in the barrio of Santo Rosario, within the jurisdiction of the municipality of Buena Vista, Guimaras island, pov ince of Iloilo, Philippine Islands, the said accused, with illegal intention, and maliciously, and without justification, and with treachery and deliberate premeditation, killed Felix Villanueva in the manner following: That on said day and in said barrio the said accused, Homer E. \n\n[206 U.S. 333, 343]\n\u00a0\n Grafton, with the rifle that he carried at the time, known as the United States magazine rifle c. .30, fired a shot directly at Felix Villanueva, causing, with said shot, a serious and necessarily fatal wound, and in consequence of said wound the aforesaid Felix Villanueva died immediately after the infliction thereof, in violation of the law.'\n When the above information was filed, as well as when the court- martial convened, the Philippines Penal Code provided as follows:\n'Art. 402. He who shall kill his father, mother, or child, whether legitimate or illegitimate, or any other of his ascendants or descendants or his spouse, shall be punished as a parricide, with the penalty of cadena perpetua to death.\n\n'Art. 403. He who, without being included in the preceding article, shall kill any person, is guilty of assassination if the deed is attended by any of the following circumstances: (1) With treachery; (2) for price or promise of reward; (3) by means of flood, fire, or poison; (4) with deliberate premeditation; (5) with vindictiveness, by deliberately and inhumanly increasing the suffering of the person attacked. A person guilty of assassination shall be punished with the penalty of cadena temporal in its maximum degree to death.\n\n'Art. 404. He who, without being included in the provisions of article 402, shall kill another without the attendance of any of the circumstances specified in the foregoing article, is guilty of homicide. A person guilty of homicide shall be punished with the penalty of reclusi on temporal.'\n\n At the trial in the court of first instance the accused interposed a demurrer, alleging that that court had no jurisdiction to try him for the offense charged, for the following reasons: The acts constituting the alleged offense were committed within the limits of a military reservation of the United States and by a soldier duly enlisted in the Army of the United States, in the line of duty; the court of first instance of the Philippine Islands had no jurisdiction of the persons of officers or enlisted men of the United States Army for offenses com- \n\n[206 U.S. 333, 344]\n\u00a0\n mitted by them in the performance of military duty; such courts were not constitutional courts, as contemplated by the 3d article of the Constitution of the United States, and were without jurisdiction to try causes of which such constitutional courts have exclusive jurisdiction; the courts of the Philippine Islands could not deprive the accused of his constitutional privilege of trial by jury; and no court other than a military tribunal, constituted by the authority of the United States, could try the accused upon an indictment which had not been found or presented by a grand jury.\n The demurrer also stated that if the court held that it had jurisdiction to try the accused, then he pleaded, in bar of the proceedings against him, the judgment of the general court-martial, acquitting him of the offense of which he was found guilty in the court of first instance.\n The demurrer and plea were both overruled, the trial court holding that it had jurisdiction to try the accused, and that the plea of jeopardy based on his trial by court-martial was insufficient, in that the military court could not legally have taken cognizance of the crime of assassination charged in the information, but only of a violation of the 62d Article of War.\n A trial was then had in the court of first instance before the judge thereof, without a jury, and resulted in a judgment declaring Grafton guilty of 'an infraction of article 404 of said Penal Code, and of the crime of homicide, in killing the said Felix Villanueva, at the time and place and in the manner hereinbefore stated, and, in view of the extenuating ir cumstances before remarked upon, he is sentenced by the court to imprisonment in such prison as the law directs, for the term of twelve years and one day, it being the minimum term of the minimum degree of reclusi on temporal which is the penalty for homicide, and to pay the costs of the prosecution, and to suffer all the other accessories of said sentence.' The case was carried to the supreme court of the Philippines, where the judgment was affirmed by a divided court. The plea of double jeopardy was overruled by that court and three of the sevan \n\n[206 U.S. 333, 345]\n\u00a0\n judges were of opinion that, under the facts proved at the trial, the accused should have been acquitted.\n The principal contention of the accused is that his acquittal by the court-martial forbade his being again tried in the civil court for the same offense. He bases this contention, in part, upon that clause of the 5th Amendment of the Constitution, providing: 'Nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb;' and, in part, upon the act of Congress of July 1st, 1902, providing temporarily for the administration of the affairs of civil government in the Philippine Islands, and which act declared that 'no person, for the same offense, shall be twice put in jeopardy of punishment.' 32 Stat. at L. 691, chap. 1369. That the prohibition of double jeopardy is applicable to all criminal prosecutions in the Philippines was settled upon full consideration in the recent case of Kepner v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 100, 124\n, 129 S., 130, 49 L. ed. 114, 122-125, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 797, in which it was held that by force of the above act of Congress such prohibition was carried to the Philippines and became the law of those islands. In the same case it was said-what may be repeated as applicable to the present case-that 'this case does not call for a discussion of the limitations of such power [the power of Congress], nor require determination of the question whether the jeopardy clause became the law of the islands after the ratification of the treaty without congressional action, as the act of Congress made it the law of these possessions when the accused was tried and convicted.'\n We assume as indisputable, on principle and authority, that before a person can be said to have been put in jeopardy of life or limb the court in which he was acquitted or convicted must have had jurisdiction to try him for the offense charged. It is alike indisputable that if a court- martial has jurisdiction to try an officer or soldier for a crime, its judgment will be accorded the finality and conclusiveness as to the issues involved which attend the judgments of a civil court in a case of which it may legally take cognizance. In Ex parte Reed, \n\n[206 U.S. 333, 346]\n\u00a0\n \n100 \nU.S. 13, 23\n, 25 S. L. ed. 538, 539, the court, referring to a court- martial, said: 'The court had jurisdiction over the person and the case. It is the organism provided by law and clothed with the duty of administering justice in this class of cases. Having had such jurisdiction, its proceedings cannot be collaterally impeached for any mere error or irregularity, if there were such, committed within the sphere of its authority. Its judgments, when approved as required, rest on the same basis, and are surrounded by the same considerations, which give conclusiveness to the judgments of other legal tribunals, including as well the lowest as the highest, under like circumstances. The exercise of discretion, within authorized limits, cannot be assigned for error and made the subject of review by an appellate court.'\n In Ex parte Mason, \n105 \nU.S. 696, 699\n, 26 S. L. ed. 1213, 1214, the question arose whether a court-martial could lawfully sentence an officer of the Army, charged with the offense of attempting to kill a prisoner in the custody of the United States, to be imprisoned at hard labor in the penitentiary. The accused was tried under the 62d Article of War. The court said: 'He has offended both against the civil and the military law. As the pop er steps were not taken to have him proceeded against by the civil authorities, it was the clear duty of the military to bring him to trial under that jurisdiction. Whether, after trial by the courtmartial, he can be again tried in the civil courts, is a question we need not now consider. It is enough if the court-martial had jurisdiction to proceed, and what has been done is within the powers of that jurisdiction.' It was objected, in that case, that the sentence was in excess of what the law allowed. The court referred to the 97th Article of War, which provided that 'no person in the military service shall, under the sentence of a court-martial, be punished by confinement in a penitentiary unless the offense of which he may be convicted would, by some statute of the United States or by some statute of the state, territory, or district in which such offense may be committed, or by the common law, as the same exists \n\n[206 U.S. 333, 347]\n\u00a0\n in such state, territory, or district, subject such convict to such imprisonment.' It then proceeded: 'Under this article, when the offense is one not recognized by the laws regulating civil society, there can be no punishment by confinement in a penitentiary. The same is true when the offense, though recognized by the civil authorities, is not punishable by the civil courts in that way. But when the act charged as 'conduct to the prejudice of good order and military discipline' is actually a crime against society which is punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary, it seems to us clear that a courtmartial is authorized to inflict that kind of punishment. The act done is a civil crime, and the trial is for that act. The proceedings are had in a court-martial because the offender is personally amenable to that jurisdiction, and what he did was not only criminal according to the laws of the land, but prejudicial to the good order and discipline of the Army to which he belonged. The 62d article provides that the offender, when convicted, shall be punished at the discretion of the court, and the 97th article does no more than prohibit the court from sentencing him to imprisonment in a penitentiary in a case where, if he were tried for the same act in the civil courts, such imprisonment could not be inflicted.' In Carter v. Roberts, \n177 \nU.S. 496, 498\n, 44 S. L. ed. 861, 862, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 713, which was a case of the punishment under the judgment of a general court-martial of an officer of the Army, the court, after observing that every officer, before entering on the duties of his office, subscribes to the Articles of War enacted by Congress and places himself within the power of courtsmartial to pass on any offense which he may have committed in contravention of them, said: 'Courts-martial are lawful tribunals, with authority to finally determine any case over which they have jurisdiction, and their proceedings, when confirmed as provided, are not open to review by the civil tribunals, except for the purpose of ascertaining whether the military court had jurisdiction of the person and subject-matter, and whether, though having such jurisdiction, it had exceeded its powers \n\n[206 U.S. 333, 348]\n\u00a0\n in the sentence pronounced.' This language was repeated in Carter v. McClaughry, \n183 \nU.S. 365, 380\n, 46 S. L. ed. 236, 242, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 181.\n It thus appears to be settled that the civil tribunals cannot disregard the judgments of a general court-martial against an accused officer or soldier, if such court had jurisdiction to try the offense set forth in the charge and specifications; this, notwithstanding the civil court, if it had first taken hold of the case, might have tried the accused for the same offense or even one of higher grade arising out of the same facts.\n We are now to inquire whether the courtmartial in the Philippines had jurisdiction to try Grafton for the offenses charged against him. It is unnecessary to enter upon an extended discussion of that question, for it is entirely clear that the courtmartial had jurisdiction to try the accused upon the charges preferred agin st him. The 62d Article of War, in express words, confers upon a general, or a regimental, garrison, or field officers' court-martial, according to the nature and degree of the offense, jurisdiction to try 'all crimes' not capital, committed in time of peace by an officer or soldier of the Army. The crimes referred to in that article manifestly embrace those not capital, committed by officers or soldiers of the Army in violation of public law as enforced by the civil power. No crimes committed by officers or soldiers of the Army are excepted by the above article from the jurisdicrtion thus conferred upon courts-martial, except those that are capital in their nature. While, however, the jurisdiction of general courtsmartial extends to all crimes, not capital, committed against public law by an officer or soldier of the Army within the limits of the territory in which he is serving, this jurisdiction is not exclusive, but only concurrent with that of the civil courts. Of such offenses courts-martial may take cognizance under the 62d Article of War, and, if they first acquire jurisdiction, their judgments cannot be disregarded by the civil courts for mere error or for any reason not affecting the jurisdiction of the military court.\n We are next to inquire whether, having been acquitted by a \n\n[206 U.S. 333, 349]\n\u00a0\n court-martial of the crime of homicide as defined by the Penal Code of the Philippines, could Grafton be subjected thereafter to trial for the same offense in a civil tribunal deriving its authority, as did the court- martial, from the same government, namely, that of the United States? That he will be punished for the identical offense of which he has been acquitted, if the judgment of the civil court, now before us, be affirmed, is beyond question, because, as appears from the record, the civil court adjudged him guilty and sentenced him to imprisonment specifically for 'an infraction of article 404 of said Penal Code and of the crime of homicide.'\n It was said by the trial judge that the offense charged against Grafton in the civil court was 'assassination,' which offense, he said, was punishable under  403 of the Philippines Penal Code by death, and of which crime the military court could not, under the Articles of War, have taken cognizance; whereas, the offense for which he was tried by court- martial was only homicide, as defined by  404 of the Penal Code. But if not guilty of homicide, as defined in the latter section of the Penal Code,- and such was the finding of the court-martial,-he could not, for the same acts and under the same evidence, be guilty of assassination, as defined in the former section of the Code. Looking at the matter in another way, the above suggestion by the trial judge could only mean that simply because, speaking generally, the civil court has jurisdiction to try an officer or soldier of the Army for the crime of assassination, it may yet render a judgment by which he could be subjected to punishment for an offense included in the charge of assassination, although of such lesser offense he had been previously acquitted by another court of competent jurisdiction. This view is wholly inadmissible. Upon this general point the supreme court of the Philippines, referring to the defense of former jeopardy, said: 'The circumstance that the civil trial was for murder, a crime of which courts-martial in time of peace have no jurisdiction, while the prior military trial was for manslaughter only, does not defeat the \n\n[206 U.S. 333, 350]\n\u00a0\n defense on this theory. The identity of the offenses is determined, not by their grade, but by their nature. One crime may be a constituent part of the other. The criterion is, Does the result of the first prosecution negative the facts charged in the second? It is apparent that it does. The acquittal of the defendant of the charge of manslaughter pronounces him guiltless of facts necessary to constitute murder and admits the plea of jeopardy.' The offense, homicide or manslaughter, charged against Grafton, was the unlawful il ling of a named person. The facts which attended that killing would show the degree of such offense, whether assassination, of which the civil court might take cognizance if it acquired acted, or homicide, of which the military acted, or homicide, of when the military court could take cognizance if it acted before the civil court did. If tried by the military court for homicide, as defined in the Penal Code, and acquitted on that charge, the guaranty of exemption from being twice put in jeopardy of punishment for the same offense would be of no value to the accused if, on trial for assassination, arising out of the same acts, he could be again punished for the identical offense of which he had been previously acquitted.\n In Chitty's Criminal Law, vol. 1, pp. 452, 455, 462, the author says: 'It is not in all cases necessary that the two charges should be precisely the same in point of degree, for it is sufficient if an acquittal of the one will show that the defendant could not have been guilty of the other. Thus, a general acquittal of murder is a discharge upon an indictment of manslaughter upon the same person, because the latter charge was included in the former, and if it had so appeared on the trial the defendant might have been convicted of the inferior offense; and, on the other hand, an acquittal of manslaughter will preclude a future prosecution for murder, for, if he were innocent of the modified crime, he could not be guilty of the same fact, with the addition of malice and design.' Mr. Bishop, in his Treatise on Criminal Law, 7th ed.  1050, says: It is not necessary, to establish the defense 'autrefois acquit' or 'co- \n\n[206 U.S. 333, 351]\n\u00a0\n nvict,' that the offense in each indictment should be the same in name. If the transaction is the same, or if each rests upon the same facts between the same parties, it is sufficient to make good the defense. In Com. v. Roby, 12 Pick. 503, the court said: 'Thus an acquittal on an indictment for murder will be a good bar to an indictment for manslaughter, and, e converso, an acquittal on an indictment for manslaughter will be a bar to a prosecution for murder; for, in the first instance, had the defendant been guilty, not of murder, but of manslaughter, he would have been found guilty of the latter offense upon that indictment; and in the second instance, since the defendant is not guilty of manslaughter, he cannot be guilty of manslaughter under circumstances of aggravation which enlarge it into murder. 1 Starkie, Crim. Pl. 2d ed. 322.'\n It must, then, be taken on the present record that an affirmance of the judgment of the civil court will subject the accused to punishment for the same acts, constituting the same offense as that of which he had been previously acquitted by a military court having complete jurisdiction to try and punish him for such offense. it is attempted and punish him for such offense. It is attempted that Grafton committed two distinct offenses,- one against military law and discipline, the other against the civil law, which may prescribe the punishment for crimes against organized society, by whomsoever those crimes are committed,-and that a trial for either offense, whatever its result, whether acquittal or conviction, and even if the first trial was in a court of competent jurisdiction, is no bar to a trial in another court of the same government for the other offense. We cannot assent to this view. It is, we think, inconsistent with the principle, already announced, that a general court-martial has, under existing statutes, in time of peace, jurisdiction to try an officer or soldier of the Army for any offense, not capital, which the civil law declares to be a crime against the public. The express prohibition of double jeopardy for the same offense means that wherever such prohibition is applicable, either by operation of the Constitu- \n\n[206 U.S. 333, 352]\n\u00a0\n tion or by action of Congress, no person shall be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb for the same offense. Consequently, a civil court proceeding under te authority of the United States cannot withhold from an officer or soldier of the Army the full benefit of that guaranty, after he has been once tried in a military court of competent jurisdiction. Congress, by express constitutional provision, has the power to prescribe rules for the government and regulation of the Army, but these rules must be interpreted in connection with the prohibition against a man's being put twice in jeopardy for the same offense. The former provision must not be so interpreted as to nullify the latter. If, therefore, a person be tried for an offense in a tribunal deriving its jurisdiction and authority from the United States, and is acquitted or convicted, he cannot again be tried for the same offense in another tribunal deriving its jurisdiction and authority from the United States. A different interpretation finds no sanction in the Articles of War; for the 102d Article of War (which is the same as article 87, adopted in 1806, 2 Stat. at L. 369, chap. 20) declares that 'no person'-referring, we take it, to persons in the Army-'shall be tried a second time for the same offense.' But we rest our decision of this question upon the broad ground that the same acts constituting a crime against the United States cannot, after the acquittal or conviction of the accused in a court of competent jurisdiction, be made the basis of a second trial of the accused for that crime in the same or in another court, civil or military, of the same government. Congress has chosen, in its discretion, to confer upon general courtsmartial authority to try an officer or soldier for any crime, not capital, committed by him in the territory in which he is serving. When that was done the judgment of such military court was placed upon the same level as the judgments of other tribunals when the inquiry arises whether an accused was, in virtue of that judgment, put in jeopardy of life or limb. Any possible conflict in these matters, between civil and military courts, can be obviated either by withholding from courts-martial all \n\n[206 U.S. 333, 353]\n\u00a0\n authority to try officers or soldiers for crimes prescribed by the civil power, leaving the civil tribunals to try such offenses, or by investing courts-martial with exclusive jurisdiction to try such officers and soldiers for all crimes not capital.\n In support of the view that the judgment of a military court against an officer or soldier of the Army for acts constituting a crime against both the civil law and the military organization is no bar to a second trial in the civil courts for the same acts, we are referred to Fox v. Ohio, 5 How. 410, 435, 12 L. ed. 213, 224; United States v. Marigold, 6 How. 560, 13 L. ed. 257, and Moore v. Illinois, 14 How. 13, 19, 20, 14 L. ed. 306, 308, 309. Nothing said or determined in either of those cases conflicts with the decision in this case. In the above cases, especially in Moore's Case, the question was mooted whether the same acts could be treated as crimes both against the United States and a state. It was there suggested that a person could not be punished by two governments on account of or for the same act constituting crime, without violating the 5th Amendment. But this court, speaking by Mr. Justice Grier, said: 'An offense, in its legal signification, means the transgression of a law. A man may be compelled to make reparation in damages to the injured party, and be liable also to punishment for a breach of the public peace, in consequence of the same act; and may be said, in common parlance, to be twice punished for the same offense. Every citizen of the United States is also a citizen of a state or territory. He may be said to owe allegiance to two sovereigns, and may be liable to punishment for an infraction of the laws of either. The same act may be an offense or transgression of the laws of both. Thus, an assault upon the marshal of the United States, and hindering him in the execution of legal process, is a high offense against the United States, for which the perpetrator is liable to punishment; and the same act maybe also a gross breach of the peace of the state,-a riot, assault, or a murder,-and subject the same person to a punishment, under the state laws, for a misdemeanor or felony. That either or both may (if they see fit) punish such an offender, cannot be doubted. \n\n[206 U.S. 333, 354]\n\u00a0\n Yet it cannot be truly averred that the offender has been twice punished for the same offense; but only that by one act he has committed two offenses, for each of which he is justly punishable. He could not plead the punishment by one in bar to a conviction by the other; consequently, this court has decided, in the case of Fox v. Ohio, 5 How. 432, 12 L. ed. 222, that a state may punish the offense of uttering or passing false coin, as a cheat or fraud practised on its citizens; and, in the case of the United States v. Marigold, supra, that Congress, in the proper exercise of its authority, may punish the same act as an offense against the United States.'\n It is clear that the cases above cited are not in point here. The government of the United States and the governments of the several states, in the exercise of their respective powers, move on different lines. The government of the United States has no power, except as expressly or by necessary implication has been granted to it, while the several states may exert such powers as are not inconsistent with the Constitution of the United States nor with a republican form of government, and which have not been surrendered by them to the general government. An offense against the United States can only be punished under its authority and in the tribunals created by its laws; whereas, an offense against a state can be punished only by its authority and in its tribunals. The same act, as held in Moore's Case, may constitute two offenses, one against the United States and the other against a state. But these things cannot be predicated of the relations between the United States and the Philippines. The government of a state does not derive its powers from the United States, while the government of the Philippines owes its existence wholly to the United States, and its judicial tribunals exert all their powers by authority of the United States. The jurisdiction and authority of the United States over that territory and its inhabitants, for all legitimate purposes of government, is paramount. So that the cases holding that the same acts committed in a state of the Union may constitute an offense \n\n[206 U.S. 333, 355]\n\u00a0\n against the United States and also a distinct offense against the state do not apply here, where the two tribunals that tried the accused exert all their powers under and by authority of the same government,-that of the United States.\n It may be difficult at times to determine whether the offense for which an officer or soldier is being tried is, in every substantial respect, the same offense for which he had been previously tried. We will not therefore attempt to formulate any rule by which every conceivable case must be solved. But, passing by all other questions discussed by counsel, or which might arise on the record, and restricting our decision to the above question of double jeopardy, we adjudge that, consistently with the above act of 1902, and for the reasons stated, the plaintiff in error, a soldier in the Army, having been acquitted of the crime of homicide, alleged to have been committed by him in the Philippines, by a military court of competent jurisdiction, proceeding under the authority of the United States, could not be subsequently tried for the same offense in a civil court exercising authority in that territory. This is sufficient to dispose of the present case.\n The judgment must be reversed, and the case remanded with directions to the Supreme Court of the Philippines to order the complaint or information in the Court of First Instance to be dismissed and the plaintiff in error discharged from custody.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","65":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGREEN v. CHICAGO, B & Q R CO(1907)\nNo. 435\nArgued: Decided: April 29, 1907\n\n\n\n Messrs. John G. Johnson and Frank P. Prichard for plaintiff in error. \n\n[205 U.S. 530, 531]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Francis Rawle for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Moody delivered the opinion of the court:\n The plaintiff in error, a citizen of Pennsylvania, brought an action in the circuit court for the eastern district of Pennsylvania to recover damages for personal injuries alleged to have been incurred in Colorado through the negligence of the defendant, against the defendant in error, a corporation \n\n[205 U.S. 530, 532]\n\u00a0\n created by the laws of the state of Iowa, and, therefore, for jurisdictional purposes, a citizen of that state. The return upon the writ shows a service 'on Chicago, Burlington, & Quincy Railway Company, a corporation which is doing business in the eastern district of Pennsylvania . . . by giving a true and attested copy to Harry E. Heller, agent of said corporation.' The defendant appeared specially for the purpose of disputing jurisdiction. The circuit court held that the service was insufficient, because the defendant was not doing business within the district, and that decision is brought here by writ of error for review.\n The jurisdiction of the circuit court in this case was founded solely upon the fact that the parties were citizens of different states. In such a case the suit may be brought in the district of the residence of either. Act of March 3, 1875, chap. 137,  1 [18 Stat. at L. 470, chap. 137], as corrected by act of August 13, 1888, chap. 866,  1 (25 Stat. at L. 434, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 508). But to obtain jurisdiction there must be service, and the service was upon the corporation in the eastern district of Pennsylvania. Its validity depends upon whether the corporation was doing business in that district in such a manner and to such an extent as to warrant the inference that, through its agents, it was present there.\n The eastern point of the defendant's line of railroad was at Chicago, whence its tracks extended westward. The business for which it was incorporated was the carriage of freight and passengers, and the construction, maintenance, and operation of a railroad for that purpose. As incidental and collateral to that business it was proper, and, according to the business methods generally pursued, probably essential, that freight and passenger traffic should be solicited in other parts of the country than those through which the defendant's tracks ran. For the purpose of conducting this incidental business the defendant employed Mr. Heller, hired an office for him in Philadelphia, designated him as district freight and passenger agent, and in many ways advertised to the public these facts. The business of the agent was to solicit and procure passengers and freight to be transported over the defendant's line. For conducting this business several clerks and various traveling passenger \n\n[205 U.S. 530, 533]\n\u00a0\n and freight agents were employed, who reported to the agent and acted under his direction. He sold no tickets and received no payments for transportation of freight. When a prospective passenger desired a ticket, and spplied to the agent for one, the agent took the applicant's money and procured from one of the railroads running west from Philadelphia a ticket for Chicago and a prepaid order, which gave to the applicant, upon his arrival at Chicago, the right to reccive from the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad a ticket over that road. Occasionally he sold to railroad employees, who already had tickets over intermediate lines, orders for reduced rates over the defendant's lines. In some cases, for the convenience of shippers who had received bills of lading from the initial line for goods routed over the defendant's lines, he gave in exchange therefor bills of lading over the defendant's line. In these bills of lading it was recited that they should not be in force until the freight had been actually received by the defendant.\n The question here is whether service upon the agent was sufficient; and one element of its sufficiency is whether the facts show that the defendant corporation was doing business within the district. It is obvious that the defendant was doing there a considerable business of a certain kind, although there was no carriage of freight or passengers. In support of his contention that the defendant was doing business within the district in such a sense that it was liable to service there, the plaintiff cites Denver & R. G. R. Co. v. Roller, 49 L.R.A. 77, 41 C. C. A. 22, 100 Fed. 738, and Tuchband v. Chicago & A. R. Co. 115 N. Y. 437, 22 N. E. 360. The facts in those cases were similar to those in the present case. But in both cases the action was brought in the state courts, and the question was of the interpretation of a state statute and the jurisdiction of the state courts.\n The business shown in this case was, in substance, nothing more than that of solicitation. Without undertaking to \n\n[205 U.S. 530, 534]\n\u00a0\n formulate any general rule defining what transactions will constitute 'doing business' in the sense that liability to service is incurred, we think that this is not enough to bring the defendant within the district so that process can be served upon it. This view accords with several decisions in the lower Federal courts. Maxwell v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. 34 Fed. 286; N. K. Fairbank & Co. v. Cincinnati, N. O. & T. P. R. Co. 4 C. C. A. 403, 9 U.

STATE OF TEXAS(1907)\nNo. 3845\nArgued: October 11, 1906Decided: February 25, 1907\n\n\n\n\n[204 U.S. 403, 404]\n\u00a0\n In the district court of Tarrant county, Texas, on July 28 ,1902, the state of Texas recovered a judgment against the Gulf, Colorado, & Santa F e Railway Company for $100 as a penalty for extortion in a charge for the transportation of a car load of corn from Texarkana, Texas, to Goldthwaite, Texas. This judgment was sustained by both the court of civil appeals (32 Tex. Civ. App. 1, 73 S. W. 429) and the supreme court of the state. 97 Tex. 274, 78 S. W. 495. Thereupon the railway company brought the case here on a writ of error.\n The case was tried in the district court without a jury. Findings of fact were made, which were sustained by the appellate courts. From them it appears that on January 13, 1902, the Texas & Pacific Railway Company, which owns and operates a railroad from Texarkana, Texas, to Fort Worth, Texas, executed a bill of lading by which it acknowledged the receipt from the Samuel Hardin Grain Company at Texarkana, Texas, of one car of sacked corn consigned to shippers, with orders to deliver to Saylor & Burnett, at Goldthwaite, Texas. This car of corn was transported by the Texas & Pacific Railway Company to Fort Worth, there delivered to the defendant railway company, and by it transported to Goldthwaite, where it arrived on the 17th day of January, 1902. When it reached Goldthwaite, Saylor & Burnett, who were acting for the Samuel Hardin Grain Company, tendered the charges prescribed by the state railroad commission, which the agent declined to accept, and demanded and collected a larger sum. The following findings state the important facts upon which the controversy turns:\n'8. On December 23d, 1901, the Samuel Hardin Grain Company, at Kansas City, Missouri, offered to sell Saylor & Burnett, at Goldthwaite, Texas, No. 2 mixed corn at 86 1\/2 cents per bushel for delivery on railway track at Goldthwaite, and this offer was accepted for two car loads of corn. This offer and acceptance was by telegraphic communication between the parties at their respective places of business. The Hardin Grain Company did not at that time have the corn, but on December 24th, \n\n[204 U.S. 403, 405]\n\u00a0\n 1901, to fill the order, it contracted with the Harroun Commission Company of Kansas City for the purchase,-two 66,000-pound cars of No. 2 mixed corn at 75 1\/2 cents per bushel, to be delivered at Texarkana, Texas, to the Hardin Grain Company. Previously to this the Harroun Commission Company had contracted for the purchase of two cars of corn to be delivered to it at Texarkana, Texas, and with these two cars it expected to and did fill the order of the Hardin Grain Company. These cars had originated in Hudson, South Dakota. The receiving carrier at Hudson was the Chicago, Milwaukee, & St. Paul Railway company, who issued bills of lading limiting its liability to losses occurring on its road, with a like limitation of liability of all other carriers who should handle said corn in transit to its destination. By the terms of said bills of lading the corn was consigned to 'Forrester Bros., Texarkana, Texas,' and shipment made in cars of C. M. & St. P. Ry. Co., care of Kansas City Southern Ry. at Kansas City, Missouri, with the privilege to stop the corn at Kansas City for inspection and transfer. The corn reached Kansas City on December 17th, 1901, was there unloaded, sacked, and transferred to the Kansas City Southern Railway Co. who, on December 31st, 1901, issued bills of lading reciting that the corn was loaded in cars No. 3845 P. G. and No. 4189 P. G ., that same was received of Forrester Bros. and consigned as follows: 'Shipper's order, notify Harroun Commission Company, Texarkana, Texas,' and reciting further that freight 14 cents per hundred pounds was prepaid, and one of these cars, to wit, car 'No. 3845 P. G.' is the car in controversy in this suit.\n\n'9. The Harroun Commission Company paid no freight on the corn from Hudson, South Dakota, to Texarkana, Texas, as it had purchased it to be delivered at Texarkana.\n\n'10. The freight on the corn from Hudson to Texarkana was as follows: 18 cents per 100 pounds from Hudson to Kansas City and 14 cents from Kansas City to Texarkana, all of which was paid by the vendors of Harroun Commission Company. The minimun interstate rate from Hudson, South Dakota, to \n\n[204 U.S. 403, 406]\n\u00a0\n Goldthwaite, Texas, was 46 cents per 100 pounds, which would have been apportioned as follows: 18 cents from Hudson to Kansas City, and 28 cents from Kansas City to Goldthwaite, Texas. The G. C. & S. F. Ry. Co., the T. & P. Ry. Co. and the Kansas City Southern Ry. Co. together with other connecting lines from Kansas City, Missouri, to Goldthwaite, Texas, had established a joint tariff of 35 cents per 100 pounds on shipments from Kansas City to Goldthwaite via Texarkana and originating in Kansas City, had agreed on a division of that rate between them, and had filed tariffs establishing such rate with the Interstate Commerce Commission, and by such steps had brought itself within the provisions of the interstate commerce laws.\n\n'11. The Hardin Grain Company's officers kept themselves informed of interstate commission freight rates and of the state commission rates, and the reason why they contracted for the corn to be delivered to them at Texarkana was because they could fill their contract with Saylor & Burnett at Goldthwaite at about 1 1\/2 cents per bushel cheaper than they could if they bought the corn for delivery to them at Kansas City and had it shipped from Kansas City to Goldthwaite.\n\n'12. At the time of the purchase contract between the Hardin Grain Company and the Harroun Commission Company, Hardin, the manager of the former company, intended that the corn to be thereby acquired should go to Saylor & Burnett and should be shipped to Goldthwaite, from Texarkana, as soon as practicable, and, on December 26th, 1901, two days after this contract for purchase had been made, Hardin was informed that the corn with which Harroun Commission Company expected to fill his order would be sacked in Kansas City and be shipped out of Kansas City to Texarkana, but at the time of making the contract he did not know from whence the corn would come.\n\n'13. On December 31st, 1901, the date of shipment from Kansas City to Texarkana, Harroun Commission Company informed the Hardin Grain Company that the corn to fill the \n\n[204 U.S. 403, 407]\n\u00a0\n latter's order had been loaded to start to Texarkana, and requested instruction as to how the corn should be shipped from Texarkana for the guidance of F. L. Atkins, their agent at that place, who would attend to such reshipping for the Hardin Grain Company, as per former understanding. Thereupon and in compliance with such request blank bills of lading were made out by the Hardin Grain Company in Kansas City and furnished to the Harroun Commission company, to be forwarded to F. L. Atkins. These bills of lading were to be executed by the Texas & Pacific Railway Company, and F. L. Atkins, as agent for the Hardin Grain Company, and were for shipment of the corn to Goldthwaite, Texas, consigned to 'Shipper's order, notify, etc.' giving the numbers and initials of cars, which information had been furnished by the Harroun Commission Company, and on January 14, 1902, the reshipment having been made as per instructions, the bills of lading duly executed by the Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. were by Harroun delivered to Hardin Grain Company, who thereupon paid the Harroun Commission Company $1, 779.64, the purchase price previously agreed upon for the corn, and the receipt of said blank bills of lading by the Harroun Commission Company was the first information had by that company of the intended final destination and disposition of the corn.\n\n'14. Neither Hardin Grain Company nor Harroun Commission Company had any store or warehouse at Texarkana, but, under the agreement between the two companies (Hardin and Harroun), one F.L.Atkins, who was the agent of the Harroun Commission Company, and stationed at Texarkana, reshipped the corn at Texarkana for the Hardin Grain Company. That shipment was to Goldthwaite, Texas, over the Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. and the G. C. & S. F. Ry. Co., by bill of landing reciting its receipt from Hardin Grain Company, and consigned to 'Shipper's order, notify Saylor & Burnett, Goldthwaite, Texas,' and was transferred under original seals and without breaking packages, to the Texas & Pacific Ry. Co., after having remained in Texarkana five days; the only \n\n[204 U.S. 403, 408]\n\u00a0\n thing done by F. L. Atkins was to surrender the Kansas City Southern bill of lading, have the cars set over on the T. & P. Ry., and take a bill of lading from the latter company. The corn reached Texarkana January 7th, 1902, and was shipped out from Texarkana January 13th, 1902; the defendant was not a party to the bill of lading executed at Texarkana.\n\n'15. On December 31st, 1901, Hardin Grain Co. mailed to Saylor & Burnett an invoice of the corn in the form of an account, stating the car numbers and initial, the amount of corn, and price to be paid by Saylor & Burnett.'\n\n Messrs. Gardner Lathrop, A. B. Browne, and J. W. Terry for plaintiff in error. \n\n[204 U.S. 403, 409]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Robert Vance Davidson for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Brewer:\n\n\n[204 U.S. 403, 411]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n The single question in the case is whether, as between Texarkana and Goldthwaite, this was an interstate shipment. If so, the regulations of the state railroad commission do not control, and the court erred in enforcing the penalty. If, however, it was a purely local shipment, the judgment below was right and should be sustained.\n The facts are settled by the special findings, those findings being conclusive upon this court. Dower v. Richards, \n151 U.S. 658\n, 38 L. ed. 305, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 452; Egan v. Hart, \n165 U.S. 188\n, 41 L. ed. 680, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 300; Thayer v. Spratt, \n189 U.S. 346\n, 47 L. ed. 845, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 576; Adams v. Church, \n193 U.S. 510\n, 48 L. ed. 769, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 512; Clipper Min. Co. v. Eli Min. & Land Co. \n194 U.S. 220\n, 48 L. ed. 944, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 632.\n The corn was carried from Texarkana, Texas, to Goldthwaite, Texas, upon a bill of lading which, upon its face, showed only a local transportation. It is, however, contended by the railway company, that this local transportation was a continuation of a shipment from Hudson, South Dakota, to Texarkana, Texas; that the place from which the corn started was Hudson, South Dakota, and the place at which the transportation ended was Goldthwaite, Texas; that such transportation was interstate commerce, and that its interstate character was not \n\n[204 U.S. 403, 412]\n\u00a0\n affected by the various changes of title or issues of bills of lading intermediate its departure from Hudson and its arrival at Goldthwaite.\n It is undoubtedly true that the character of a shipment, whether local or interstate, is not changed by a transfer of title during the transportation. But whether it be one or the other may depend on the contract of shipment. The rights and obligations of carriers and shippers are reciprocal. The first contract of shipment in this case was from Hudson to Texarkana. During that transportation a contract was made at Kansas City for the sale of the corn, but that did not affect the character of the shipment from Hudson to Texarkana. It was an interstate shipment after the contract of sale as well as before. In other words, the transportation which was contracted for, and which was not changed by any act of the parties, was transportation of the corn from Hudson to Texarkana,-that is, an interstate shipment. The control over goods in process of transportation, which may be repeatedly changed by sales, is one thing; the transportation is another thing, and follows the contract of shipment, until that is changed by the agreement of owner and carrier. Neither the Harroun nor the Hardin company changed or offered to change the contract of shipment or the place of delivery. The Hardin company accepted the contract of shipment theretofore made, and purchased the corn to be delivered at Texarkana,-that is, on the completion of the existing contract. When the Hardin company accepted the corn at Texarkana the transportation contracted for ended. The carrier was under no obligations to carry it further. It transferred the corn, in obedience to the demands of the owner, to the Texas & Pacific Railway Company, to be delivered by it, under its contract with such owner. Whatever obligations may rest upon the carrier at the terminus of its transportation to deliver to some further carrier, in obedience to the instructions of the owner, it is acting not as carrier, but simply as a forwarder. No new arrangement having been made for transportation, the corn \n\n[204 U.S. 403, 413]\n\u00a0\n was delivered to the Hardin company at Texarkana. Whatever may have been the thought or purpose of the Hardin company in respect to the further disposition of the corn was a matter immaterial so far as the completed transportation was concerned.\n In this respect there is no difference between an interstate passenger and an interstate transportation. If Hardin, for instance, had purchased at Hudson a ticket for interstate carriage to Texarkana, intending all the while after he reached Texarkana to go on to Goldthwaite, he would not be entitled, on his arrival at Texarkana, to a new ticket from Texarkana to Goldthwaite at the proportionate fraction of the rate prescribed by the Interstate Commerce Commission for carriage from Hudson to Goldthwaite. The one contract of the railroad companies having been finished, he must make a new contract for his carriage to Goldthwaite, and that would be subject to the law of the state within which that carriage was to be made.\n The question may be looked at from another point of view. Supposing a car load of goods was shipped from Goldthwaite to Texarkana under a bill of lading calling for only that transportation, and supposing that the laws of Texas required, subject to penalty, that such goods should be carried in a particular kind of car,-can there by any doubt that the carrier would be subject to the penalty, although it should appear that the shipper intended, after the goods had reached Texarkana, to forward them to some other place outside the state? To state the question in other words,-if the only contract of shipment was for local transportation, would the state law in respect to the mode of transportation be set one side by a Federal law in respect to interstate transportation, on the ground that the shipper intended, after the one contract of shipment had been completed, to forward the goods to some place outside the state? Coe v. Errol, \n116 U.S. 517\n-527, 29 L. ed. 715-718, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 475.\n Again, it appeared that this corn remained five days in Texarkana. The Hardin company was under no obligation to \n\n[204 U.S. 403, 414]\n\u00a0\n ship it further. It could, in any other way it saw fit, have provided corn for delivery to Saylor & Burnett, and unloaded and used that car of corn in Texarkana. It must be remembered that the corn was not paid for by the Hardin company until its receipt in Texarkana. It was paid for on receipt and delivery to the Hardin company. Then, and not till then, did the Hardin company have full title to and control of the corn, and that was after the first contract of transportation had been completed.\n It must further be remembered that no bill of lading was issued from Texarkana to Goldthwaite until after the arrival of the corn at Texarkana, the completion of the first contract for transportation, the acceptance and payment by the Hardin company. In many cases it would work the grossest injustice to a carrier if it could not rely on the contract of shipment it has made, know whether it was bound to obey the state or Federal law, or, obeying the former, find itself mulcted in penalties for not obeying the law of the other jurisdiction, simply because the shipper intended a transportation beyond that specified in the contract. It must be remembered that there is no presumption that a transportation when commenced is to be continued beyond the state limits, and the carrier ought to be able to depend upon the contract which it has made, and must conform to the liability imposed by that contract.\n We see no error in the proceedings, and the judgment of the Supreme Court of Texas is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","67":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHALTER v.

It expressly excepted, however, from its operation any newspaper, periodical, book, etc., on which should be printed, painted, or placed a representation of the flag ' disconnected from any advertisement.' 1 Cobbey's Anno. Stat. (Neb.) 1903, chap. 139.\n The plaintiffs in error were proceeded against by criminal information upon the charge of having, in violation of the statute, unlawfully exposed to public view, sold, exposed for sale, and had in their possession for sale, a bottle of beer upon which, for purposes of advertisement, was printed and painted a representation of the flag of the United, states. \n\n[205 U.S. 34, 39]\n\u00a0\n The defendants pleaded not guilty, and at the trial insisted that the statute in question was null and void, as infringing their personal liberty guaranteed by the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, and depriving them, as citizens of the United States, of the right of exercising a privilege impliedly, if not expressly, guaranteed by the Federal Constitution; also, that the statute was invalid in that it permitted the use of the flag by publishers, newspapers, books, periodicals, etc., under certain circumstances, thus, it was alleged, discriminating in favor of one class and against others. These contentions were overruled, and the defendants, having been found guilty by a jury, were severally adjudged to pay a fine of $50 and the costs of the prosecution. Upon writ of error the judgments were affirmed by the supreme court of Nebraska, and the case has been brought here upon the ground that the final order in that court deprived the defendants, respectively, or rights specially set up and claimed under the Constitution of the United States.\n It may be well at the outset to say that Congress has established no regulation as to the use of the flag, except that in the act approved February 20th, 1905, authorizing the registration of trademarks in commerce with foreign nations and among the states, it was provided that no mark shall be refused as a trademark on account of its nature 'unless such mark . . . consists of or comprises the flag or coat of arms or other insignia of the United States, or any simulation thereof, or of any state or municipality, or of any foreign nation.' 33 Stat. at L. 724,  5, chap. 592, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1905, p. 670.\n The importance of the questions of constitutional law thus raised will be recognized when it is remembered that more than half of the states of the Union have enacted statutes1 \n\n[205 U.S. 34, 40]\n\u00a0\n substantially similar, in their general scope, to the Nebraska statute. That fact is one of such significance as to require us to pause before reaching the conclusion that a majority of the states have, in their legislation, violated the Constitution of the United States. Our attention is called to two cases in which the constitutionality of such an enactment has been denied,-Ruhstrat v. People, 185 Ill. 133, 49 L.R.A. 181, 76 Am. St. Rep. 30, 57 N. E. 41; People ex rel, McPike v. Van De Carr, 178 N.Y. 425, 66 L.R.A. 189, 102 Am. St. Rep. 516, 70 N. E. 965. In the Illinois case the statute was held to be unconstitutional as depriving a citizen of the United States of the right of exercising a privilege impliedly, if not expressly, granted by the Federal Constitution, as unduly discriminating and partial in its character, and as infringing the personal liberty guaranteed by the state and Federal Constitutions. In the other case, decided by the court of appeals of New York, the statute, in its application to articles manufactured and in existence when it went into operation, was held to be in violation of the Federal Constitution, as depriving the owner of property without due process of law, and as taking private property for public use without just compensation.\n In our consideration of the questions presented we must not overlook certain principles of constitutional construction, long ago established and steadily adhered to, which preclude a judicial tribunal from holding a legislative enactment, Federal or State, unconstitutional and void, unless it be manifestly so. Another vital principle is that, except as restrained by its own fundamental law, or by the supreme law of the land, a state possesses all legislative power consistent with a republican form of government; therefore each state, when not \n\n[205 U.S. 34, 41]\n\u00a0\n thus restrained, and so far as this court is concerned, may, by legislation, provide not only for the health, morals, and safety of its people, but for the common good, as involved in the well-being, peace, happiness, and prosperity of the people.\n Guided by these principles, it would seem difficult to hold that the statute of Nebraska, in forbidding the use of the flag of the United States for purposes of mere advertisement, infringes any right protected by the Constitution of the United States, or that it relates to a subject exclusively committed to the national government. From the earliest periods in the history of the human race, banners, standards, and ensigns have been adopted as symbols of the power and history of the peoples who bore them. It is not, then, remarkable that the American people, acting through the legislative branch of the government, early in their history, prescribed a flag as symbolical of the existence and sovereignty of the nation. Indeed, it would have been extraordinary if the government had started this country upon its marvelous career without giving it a flag to be recognized as the emblem of the American Republic. For that flag every true American has not simply an appreciation, but a deep affection. No American, nor any foreign-born person who enjoys the privileges of American citizenship, ever looks upon it without taking pride in the fact that he lives under this free government. Hence, it has often occurred that insults to a flag have been the cause of war, and indignities put upon it, in the presence of those who revere it, have often been resented and sometimes punished on the spot.\n It may be said that, as the flag is an emblem of national sovereignty, it was for Congress alone, by appropriate legislation, to prohibit its use for illegitimate purposes. We cannot yield to this view. If Congress has not chosen to legislate on this subject, and if an enactment by it would supersede state laws of like character, it does not follow that, in the absence of national legislation, the state is without power to \n\n[205 U.S. 34, 42]\n\u00a0\n act. There are matters which, by legislation, may be brought within the exclusive control of the general government, but over which, in the absence of national legislation, the state may exert some control in the interest of its own people. For instance, it is well established that, in the absence of legislation by Congress, a state may, by different methods, improve and protect the navigation of a water way of the United States, wholly within the boundary of such state. So, a state may exert its power to strengthen the bonds of the Union, and therefore, to that end, may encourage patriotism and love of country among its people. When, by its legislation, the state encourages a feeling of patriotism towards the nation, it necessarily encourages a like feeling towards the state. One who loves the Union will love the state in which he resides, and love both of the common country and of the state will diminish in proportion as respect for the flag is weakened. Therefore a state will be wanting in care for the well-being of its people if it ignores the fact that they regard the flag as a symbol of their country's power and prestige, and will be impatient if any open disrespect is shown towards it. By the statute in question the state has in substance declared that no one subject to its jurisdiction shall use the flag for purposes of trade and traffic,-a purpose wholly foreign to that for which it was provided by the nation. Such a use tends to degrade and cheapen the flag in the estimation of the people, as well as to defeat the object of maintaining it as an emblem of national power and national honor. And we cannot hold that any privilege of American citizenship or that any right of personal liberty is violated by a state enactment forbidding the flag to be used as an advertisement on a bottle of beer. It is familiar law that even the privileges of citizenship and the rights inhering in personal liberty are subject, in their enjoyment, to such reasonable restraints as may be required for the general good. Nor can we hold that anyone has a right of property which is violated by such an enactment as the one in question. If it be said that there is a right of property \n\n[205 U.S. 34, 43]\n\u00a0\n in the tangible thing upon which a representation of the flag has been placed, the answer is that such representation-which, in itself, cannot belong, as property, to an individual-has been placed on such thing in violation of law, and subject to the power of government to prohibit its use for purposes of advertisement.\n Looking, then, at the provision relating to the placing of representations of the flag upon articles of merchandise for purposes of advertising, we are of opinion that those who enacted the statute knew, what is known of all, that to every true American the flag is the symbol of the nation's power,-the emblem of freedom in its truest, best sense. It is not extravagant to say that to all lovers of the country it signifies government resting on the consent of the governed; liberty regulated by law; the protection of the weak against the strong; security against the exercise of arbitrary power; and absolute safety for free institutions against foreign aggression. As the statute in question evidently had its origin in a purpose to cultivate a feeling of patriotism among the people of Nebraska, we are unwilling to adjudge that in legislation for that purpose the state erred in duty or has infringed the constitutional right of anyone. On the contrary, it may reasonably be affirmed that a duty rests upon each state in every legal way to encourage its people to love the Union with which the state is indissolubly connected.\n Another contention of the defendants is that the statute is unconstitutional in that, while applying to representations of the flag placed upon articles of merchandise for purposes of advertisement, it does not apply to a newspaper, periodical, book, pamphlet, etc., on any of which shall be printed, painted, or placed, the representation of the flag, disconnected from any advertisement. These exceptions, it is insisted, make an arbitrary classification of persons, which, in legal effect, denies to one class the equal protection of the laws.\n It is well settled that, when prescribing a rule of conduct for persons or corporations, a state may, consistently with \n\n[205 U.S. 34, 44]\n\u00a0\n the 14th Amendment, make a classification among its people based 'upon some reasonable ground,-some difference which bears a just and proper relation to the attempted classification, and is not a mere arbitrary selection.' Gulf, C. & S. F. R. Co. v. Ellis, \n165 \nU.S. 150, 159\n, 160 S., 165, 41 L. ed. 666, 669, 670, 671, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 255. In Cotting v. Kansas City Stock Yards Co. (Cotting v. Godard) \n183 U.S. 79\n, 46 L. ed. 92, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 30, there was a difference of opinion in the court as to what was necessary to be decided, but all agreed that a state enactment regulating the charges of a certain stock-yards company, and which exempted other like companies from its operation, was a denial of the equal protection of the laws, and forbidden by the 14th Amendment. In Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co. \n184 \nU.S. 540, 552\n, 562 S.-564, 46 L. ed. 679, 686, 691, 692, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 431, 436, 440, 441, the question arose as to the validity, under the equality clause of the Constitution, of a statute of Illinois, forbidding, under penalty, the existence of combinations of capital, skill, or acts for certain specified purposes, but exempting from its operation agricultural products or live stock while in the hands of the producer. By reason of this exemption the statute was adjudged to operate as a denial of the equal protection of the laws, and was, therefore, void. The court observed that such a statute was not a legitimate exertion of the power of classification, rested upon no reasonable basis, was purely arbitrary and therefore denied the equal protection of the laws to those against whom it discriminated. It said: 'We conclude this part of the discussion by saying that to declare that some of the class engaged in domestic trade or commerce shall be deemed criminals if they violate the regulations prescribed by the state for the purpose of protecting the public against illegal combinations formed to destroy competition and to control prices, and that others of the same class shall not be bound to regard those regulations, but may combine their capital, skill, or acts to destroy competition and to control prices for their special benefit, is so manifestly a denial of the equal protection of the laws that further or extended argument to establish that position would seem to be unnecessary.' \n\n[205 U.S. 34, 45]\n\u00a0\n The present case is distinguishable from the Connolly Case. The classification there involved was of persons alike engaged in domestic trade, which trade, the court said, was, of right, 'open to all, subject to such regulations, applicable alike to all in like conditions, as the state may legally prescribe.' Now, no one can be said to have the right, secured by the Constitution, to use the country's flag merely for purposes of advertising articles of merchandise. If everyone was entitled of right to use it for such purposes, then, perhaps, the state could not discriminate among those who so used it. It was for the state of Nebraska to say how far it would go by way of legislation for the protection of the flag against improper use,-taking care, in such legislation, not to make undue discrimination against a part of its people. It chose not to forbid the use of the flag for the exceptional purposes specified in the statute, prescribing the fundamental condition that its use for any of those purposes should be 'disconnected from any advertisement.' All are alike forbidden to use the flag as an advertisement. It is easy to be seen how a representation of the flag may be wholly disconnected from an advertisement, and be used upon a newspaper, periodical, book, etc., in such way as not to arouse a feeling of indignation nor offend the sentiments and feelings of those who reverence it. In any event, the classification made by the state cannot be regarded as unreasonable or arbitrary, or as bringing the statute under condemnation as denying the equal protection of the laws.\n It would be going very far to say that the statute in question had no reasonable connection with the common good and was not promotive of the peace, order, and well-being of the people. Before this court can hold the statute void it must say that, and, in addition, adjudge that it violates rights secured by the Constitution of the United States. We cannot so say and cannot so adjudge.\n Without further discussion, we hold that the provision against the use of representations of the flag for advertising articles of merchandise is not repugnant to the Constitution \n\n[205 U.S. 34, 46]\n\u00a0\n of the United States. It follows that the judgment of the state court must be affirmed.\n It is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice Peckham dissented. \n\nFootnotes\n ' 2375g.

WHITTREDGE(1907)\nNo. 164\nArgued: Decided: February 25, 1907\n\n\n\n The defendant in error, Whittredge, who was trustee of certain property held in trust under the will of Solon O. Richardson, who died in 1873, filed this bill for instructions in the supreme judicial court of the state of Massachusetts.\n There was bequeathed by said will $35,000, on the following trusts:\n'The income to be paid to his three sisters for life, namely \n\n[204 U.S. 538, 539]\n\u00a0\n Mary A. Sweetser, Martha Hutchinson, and Louisa Richardson; and 'at the decease of my said sisters, or either of them, my will is that the share belonging to the deceased sister shall revert to her children, to be shared by them each and each alike; if either of my said sisters shall die childless, the income belonging to her I direct shall revert to the said sisters surviving, to be shared equally between them. At the decease of all my three said sisters, I direct that the fund from which they have derived an income from my property be divided equally between the children of my said sisters, and I direct my executors to pay to them each their respective part, the same to be the property of the children of my said sisters forever.\"\n\n The three life tenants survived the testator. Louisa never had any child; Martha Hutchinson had one child; Mary A. Sweetser had one child, a son, Elbridge L. Sweetser. He and the child of Martha were born in the lifetime of the testator. Mary A. Sweetser survived her sisters, leaving her son and niece surviving her.\n This bill was brought February 1, 1901, to determine who was entitled to receive Elbridge L. Sweetser's half of the fund,-whether his assignees in bankruptcy, appointed in proceedings instituted by him in 1878, by voluntary petition in bankruptcy in the district court of the United States for the district of Massachusetts, or the plaintiff in error, who claims, under an equitable attachment made in 1881, as hereafter stated, and an assignment made in October, 1885, to secure two debts incurred after Sweetser's bankruptcy. There are other defendants besides the plaintiff in error, but their rights are not before us.\n The facts are stipulated, and the most pertinent are the following:\n On February 23, 1878, Elbridge L. Sweetser filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy in the district court of the United States, district of Massachusetts, and was, on that day, adjudged a bankrupt. On the 16th of March, 1878, \n\n[204 U.S. 538, 540]\n\u00a0\n William B. H. Dowse and Horace P. Biddle were appointed the assignees of his estate, and there was duly conveyed to them all the estate which the bankrupt owned or was entitled to on February 23, 1878\n\n\n During the year 1878 claims amounting to $13,940.47 were proved against the estate. No other claims have since been proved.\n The only assets disclosed by Sweetser in his schedules consisted of a stock of goods subject to mortgage. The proceeds of these goods were consumed in paying the mortgage and certain expenses of the assignees, and the balance, of about $280, was paid to the assignees on account of services.\n The Florence Machine Company, in 1881, filed a bill in equity against Elbridge L. Sweetser and Solon O. Richardson, then the sole trustee of Solon O. Richardson, deceased, to reach and apply in payment of five notes held by that company against Sweetser, his equitable interest under the will of said deceased. The suit was brought under the provision of General Statutes of Massachusetts, chap. 113,  2, and is called equity suit No. 386. Subpoena was issued November 28, 1881, and served on Sweetser and Richardson, trustee, November 29, 1881. Sweetser filed an answer February 1, 1882, in which, among other things, he denied that he had any such interest under the will as could be reached and applied to the payment of the claim of the company, and also denied the validity of the claim, but did not deny making the notes. On the same date Solon O. Richardson, trustee, also filed an answer, setting up the proceedings in bankruptcy and the appointment of assignees, and suggested that any interest that Sweetser had in the fund passed to them. The suit is still pending, no hearing upon the merits having ever been had.\n In 1882 the assignees filed a bill in equity against Sweetser and Solon O. Richardson, then the sole trustee under the will of said Solon O. Richardson, in the United States district court, alleging an interest in Sweetser in the fund, that it had \n\n[204 U.S. 538, 541]\n\u00a0\n accrued before the bankruptcy, but was not set forth in his schedule of property, and that they had no knowledge of such interest until a few days before filing the bill. The bill prayed, among other things, 'that the said Elbridge L. Sweetser might be directed to execute and deliver such instruments as would convey to said assignees all of his interest as legatee under the said will, and that the said trustee, Solon O. Richardson, might be enjoined from paying to the said Elbridge L. Sweetser, or any person or persons claiming under him, any part of the said trust fund, or the income thereof, which might accrue and become payable to the said Elbridge L. Sweetser.'\n On November 15, 1882, the Florence Machine Company, by its attorney, Warren O. Kyle, filed a general replication in suit No. 386.\n On December 2, 1882, Sweetser and Solon O. Richardson, trustee, filed general demurrers to the bill. No hearing, however, has ever been had in the case, either upon the demurrers or the merits, and the case is still pending.\n On October 24, 1885, Sweetser executed and delivered to the Monitor Oil Stove Company a note for $1,809 and a note to Solon O. Richardson, individually, for the sum of $506.05. As a security for said notes Sweetser gave a written mortgage or assignment, under seal, of all his interest under the will of Solon O. Richardson, deceased, to Richardson and the company. Sweetser's wife signed the notes and mortgage as joint maker. Notice of the mortgage assignment was acknowledged by William Morton, the then trustee under the will. On the same day Sweetser and his wife conveyed to one Sidney P. Brown their interest under the will, subject to the mortgage, and Brown conveyed to Hannah Sweetser. Notice of these conveyances was acknowledged by said trustee, William Morton.\n On October 24, 1885, the Florence Machine Company brought an action at law in the superior court of Suffolk county against Sweetser, in which the then assignees in \n\n[204 U.S. 538, 542]\n\u00a0\n bankruptcy were summoned as trustees, to recover the sum of $7,620.13, amount due on eight promissory notes which had been proved in his bankruptcy proceedings, and and also to recover upon an account based on ledger entries made by the company in 1881. The assignees in bankruptcy were duly served with process, but did not appear, and were defaulted.\n On October 26, 1885, in equity suit No. 386, Solon O. Richardson, trustee, filed a further answer, stating that he had resigned as trustee, and that William Morton had been appointed sole trustee, and had accepted the trust.\n On June 16, 1891, on motion of W. B. H. Dowse, Warren O. Kyle was joined with him as a party plaintiff in the suit of Dibble v. Sweetser, in the United States district court, and Daniel G. Walton, the then trustee under the will, was summoned as a defendant. He accepted service July 30, 1891, and on November 4, 1891, filed a general demurrer to the bill.\n On April 19, 1893, the Florence Machine Company was dissolved by an act of the legislature, chap. 215 of the Acts of 1893.\n On August 13, 1894, the Florence Machine Company filed a motion in equity suit No. 386 that Daniel G. Walton, who had become trustee of the trust under the will of Solon O. Richardson, deceased, and the then assignees in bankruptcy, Dowse and Kyle, might be made parties defendant and summoned to answer the plaintiff's bill. Service was made on Walton August 18, 1894, and accepted by the assignees August 30. In September, 1894, Walton's appearance was entered. On May 15, 1899, Hammond, plaintiff in error, having become assignee of the claim in suit, entered his appearance for the plaintiff, and also entered his appearance pro se, and filed a motion setting forth the assignment to him of the claim, and asking to be permitted to prosecute the suit in his own name.\n May, 1899, the assignees filed an answer, alleging upon information and belief that Sweetser had, at the time of the \n\n[204 U.S. 538, 543]\n\u00a0\n assignment in bankruptcy, a vested interest in the trust fund under the will of Richardson, and that, by the operation of the United States bankruptcy act, said interest had been transferred to them.\n On February 1, 1901, William W. Whittredge, being then the sole succeeding trustee under said will, filed this suit for instructions. On April 22 he was summoned to appear as party defendant in the case of Dibble v. Sweetser, in the United States district court. He accepted service and appeared by counsel June 12, 1901. July 1, 1901, Hammond filed a petition in said case to be made a party. In the petition he alleged, among other things, that the assignees were not entitled to Sweetser's interest as against him as assignee of the Florence Machine Company; among other reasons, because such rights as said assignees had, if any, were barred by the statute of limitations. U. S. Rev. Stat.  5057. Whittredge, trustee, also filed an answer, alleging the pendency of the suit in equity No. 386, brought by the Florence Machine Company, and that his predecessor had been made a party therein; and also alleging that he, Whittredge, had filed his suit for instructions, and also that the right of action of the assignees was barred by the limitations of law.\n On February 10, 1904 (the said assignees Dowse and Kyle having disputed the right of said John C. Hammond to be subrogated to the rights of the Florence Machine Company as to the claims proved by said company against the estate in bankruptcy of said Sweetser in 1878, and having petitioned to have said claims expunged), the United States district court made a decree in favor of said Hammond.\n The decree has since been affirmed by the United States circuit court of appeals. Dowse v. Hammond, 64 C. C. A. 437, 130 Fed. 103.\n The suit in equity in the United States district court, brought by the assignees of Sweetser in the first bankruptcy, has been continued from time to time at the request of the assignees, who have appeared for that purpose at the callings \n\n[204 U.S. 538, 544]\n\u00a0\n of the docket to await the termination of the life interests in the trust fund.\n As already stated, no hearing has been had either upon the said demurrers or upon the merits.\n That part of the trust fund held by Whittredge, as trustee, which is the subject-matter of this suit, consists of property worth about $18,000.\n The supreme judicial court decreed that Sweetser's interest in the fund passed to his assignees in bankruptcy. 189 Mass. 45, 75 N. E. 222. And it was decreed that Hammond, as assignee of the Florence Machine Company and as assignee of the Monitor Oil Stove Company, had 'no rights in said equitable interest either by reason of the provisions of the United States Revised Statutes,  5057, or otherwise.'\n Mr. Hollis R. Bailey for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[204 U.S. 538, 545]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Warren Ozro Kyle and Fred Joy for defendants in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice McKenna:\n\n\n[204 U.S. 538, 547]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna, after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the court:\n A motion is made to dismiss, which, we think, should be denied. Plaintiff in error sets up rights under  5057, which were adjudged against him. The court said:\n'The defendant Hammond admits that when the testator died Elbridge had either a vested remainder in one half of the trust fund of $35,000, subject to the life estates created by this item of the will, and subject to the class being opened on the birth of further child or children of the life tenants, or a vested interest in a contingent remainder, and that 'in either case' his interest was 'assignable.'\n\n'His contention, however, is that the assignees are barred by U. S. Rev. Stat.  5057.'\n\n The court decided against the contention, and decided, besides, that 'the title of the assignees in bankruptcy became complete on the assignment to them of this interest in remainder,' and that 'the ownership drew after it the possession,' which has continued ever since, 'and all persons are barred by U. S. Rev. Stat.  5057, from controverting it.' In other words, the court decided that  5057 did not preclude the assignees from asserting rights against plaintiff in error, but precluded him from asserting rights against them. Defendants in error, however, urge that the court's decision resulted from facts found or admitted and from general principles of law, and 'there remained in the case no question as to any title, right, privilege, or immunity under a statute of the United States; and that the court expressly declined to choose 'between the opinion in Dushane v. Beall, \n161 U.S. 513\n, 40 L. ed. 791, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 637, and the decision in Rock v. Dennett, 155 Mass. 500, 30 N. E. 171.\" But rights under a statute of the United states were claimed by plaintiff in error, and that statute was referred to by the \n\n[204 U.S. 538, 548]\n\u00a0\n supreme judicial court, and was an element in its decision. We think also that the decree rendered was final for the purposes of this writ of error. We therefore overrule the motion to dismiss and go to the merits.\n On the merits nine errors are assigned, but plaintiff in error asserts that the questions really involved are only four, namely: Had Sweetser such 'amount of title' in the trust fund that the Florence Machine Company could make an equitable attachment? Did  5057 render it necessary for the assignees to intervene and contest the attachment within two years? If not within two years, then within a reasonable time? Was the machine company, in November, 1881, barred by  5057 from bringing the attachment suit?\n Section 5044 of the Revised Statutes required the register in bankruptcy to transfer by instruments under his hand all of the estate of the bankrupt. The assignment related back to the commencement of the proceedings, and operated to vest the title in the assignee. Section 5046, in most comprehensive terms, vested in the assignees all rights in equity and choses in action which the bankrupt had, and 5047, all of his remedies. Section 5057 reads as follows:\n'No suit, either at law or in equity, shall be maintainable in any court between an assignee in bankruptcy and a person claiming any adverse interest touching any property or rights of property transferable to or vested in such assignee, unless brought within two years from the time when the cause of action accrued for or against such assignee.'\n\n Under these provisions the contention of plaintiff in error is, that, notwithstanding the bankruptcy and the broad language of the sections referred to, Sweetser had an interest in the trust fund that could be assigned or attached, and in such way a title could be acquired good against all the world except the assignees, and good against the assignees by their inaction within the time prescribed by  5057 or by their abandonment. Applying this principle plaintiff in error contends that 'three years having elapsed without anything \n\n[204 U.S. 538, 549]\n\u00a0\n having been done by the assignees in the way of disposing of this equitable asset, the bankrupt, in November, 1881, had such an amount of title that he could have brought a suit against the trustees under the will to obtain his share, assuming that the contingency had then happened upon which the right to a distribution depended.' And that Sweetser, having such title, it followed, it is contended, that the Florence Machine Company, a subsequent creditor, could make an equitable attachment and make it incumbent upon the assignees to assert their rights within two years, in accordance with  5057. The supreme judicial court met this contention by the effect of the local law. The court said:\n'The title of the assignees in bankruptcy became complete on the assignment to them of this interest in remainder. In this commonwealth notice to the trustees is not necessary to complete the title of an assignee of an interest in the property held in trust by them. Thayer v. Daniels, 113 Mass. 129, and cases there cited. See also Putnam v. Story, 132 Mass. 205; Butterfield v. Reed, 160 Mass. 362, 35 N. E. 1128. By virtue of the assignment in bankruptcy, the complete ownership in this incorporeal interest in this personal property became vested in the assignees, and the ownership drew after it possession, so far as the interest here in question (an incorporeal interest, because an interest in remainder) is capable of possession. This result is not affected by the fact that the assignees were for a time ignorant of the existence of this property of the bankrupt. This ownership and possession in the assignees has continued ever since, and all persons are barred by U. S. Rev. Stat.  5057, from controverting it. The contention that one in possession of property is barred from exercising the rights which that ownership confers on the owner, by not having brought an action, is groundless. Under these circumstances we have not found it necessary to choose between the opinion in Dushane v. Beall, supra, and the decision in Rock v. Dennett, supra.' \n\n[204 U.S. 538, 550]\n\u00a0\n The cases referred to are antagonistic in their construction of  5057. In Rock v. Dennett, it was held that the limitations expressed by that section applied to adverse claims arising after the assignment in respect to property vested in the assignee.\n\n In Dushane v. Beall the court said: 'That limitation [ 5057] is applicable only to suits growing out of disputes in respect of property and of rights of property of the bankrupt which came to the hands of the assignee to which adverse claims existed while in the hands of the bankrupt, and before assignment.'\n Plaintiff in error contends for the construction expressed in Rock v. Dennett against that expressed in Dushane v. Beall, and insists that the latter case does not overrule prior cases upon which Rock v. Dennett was based. We will not stop to reconcile Dushane v. Beall with prior cases. It is a later utterance by this court, and disposes of the contention of plaintiff in error based on  5057.\n The supreme judicial court also found adversely to plaintiff in error's contention that the assignees had abandoned the property. The court said: 'The only other contention made by the defendant, Hammond, is equally groundless; to wit, that the assignees abandoned this property. The contention is put on the ground that they did not sell their interest in remainder in this fund. Were that all that appeared the argument would be without merit. But that is not all.' And, referring to the suit brought by the assignees in the district court in 1882. said further: 'This bill apparently was brought by the assignees as soon as they learned of the existence of the fund and of the fact that creditors of Elbridge were seeking to reach and apply this interest of Elbridge in satisfaction of the debt due from him to them. The bringing of this bill (which seems to have been a bill in the nature of a bill quia timet) disposes of the contention \n\n[204 U.S. 538, 551]\n\u00a0\n that it was in fact the intention of the assignees to abandon this property.'\n We think that the record sustains the conclusion of the court.\n These views dispose of all the questions in the case.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","69":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHARRISON v. MAGOON(1907)\nNo. 107\nArgued: Decided: April 22, 1907\n\n\n\n Mr. Thomas Milner Harrison, in propria persona, and Messrs. David L. Withington, A. G. M. Robertson, and W. R. Castle for plaintiff in error. \n\n[205 U.S. 501, 502]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. J. Alfred Magoon, F. B. McStocker, and Mrs. Dorothea Emerson, in propriis personis, and Messrs. E. B. McClanahan and S. H. Derby for defendant in error Ables.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a writ of error to review a judgment for the defendants in a suit upon a contract. 16 Haw. 332, 485. At the trial a nonsuit was ordered, subject to exceptions taken by the plaintiff. A motion for a new trial was made but was dismissed, and this dismissal also was excepted to. The supreme court held that the former exceptions were presented too late, but that the latter was open and raised the question whether the judgment of nonsuit was right as matter of law. It discussed this question and sustained the judgment. This was on December 14, 1904. In January, 1905, a petition for rehearing was filed; it was entertained by the court, and, after argument, was denied on March 6, 1905. The defendants in error now move to dismiss, the main ground being that the act of March 3, 1905, chap. 1465,  3 (33 Stat. at L. 1035), amending the act of April 30, 1900, chap. 339,  86 (31 Stat. at L. 141, 158), granting writs of error, etc., does not apply. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n It is answered for the plaintiff in error that, as the petition for rehearing was entertained and acted upon by the supreme court of the territory, the time to be considered is the date when the petition was denied, and that that was after the statute went into effect. Voorhees v. John T. Noye Mfg. Co. \n151 U.S. 135\n, 38 L. ed. 101, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 295; Northern P. R. Co. v \n\n[205 U.S. 501, 503]\n\u00a0\n Holmes, \n155 U.S. 137\n, 39 L. ed. 99, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 28. No doubt the decisions cited and others show that where a right to take the case up exists at the time of the original judgment, the time limited for the writ of error on appeal does not begin to run until the petition for rehearing is disposed of. But there are limits to even that rule. When an appeal in bankruptcy, required by general orders in bankruptcy, 36, 2, to be brought within thirty days after the judgment or decree, was not brought within that time, the fact that a petition for rehearing was filed within the time required by the court below, but after the thirty days, was held not to prolong the time for appeal. 'The appellant could not reinvest himself with that right by filing a petition for rehearing.' Conboy v. First Nat. Bank, \n203 \nU.S. 141, 145\n, 51 S. L. ed. 128, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 50. If, at the time of final judgment, there is no right of appeal whatever, it is perhaps even plainer that a party cannot evoke a new one by filing a petition for rehearing, even if, by accident, it is kept along until an act giving an appeal is passed. Whether, in any event, a writ of error would lie in this case, it is unnecessary to decide.\n Writ of error dismissed.\n\nFootnotes\n Act of April 30, 1900, chap. 339,  86: '. . .

WORST(1907)\nNo. 41\nArgued: Decided: December 9, 1907\n\n\n\n This is a direct appeal from the circuit court for the district of North Dakota, sustaining the constitutionality of a statute of that state, requiring the manufacturers of mixed paints to label the ingredients composing them.\n The statute is as follows:\n An Act to Prevent the Adulteration of and Deception in the Sale of White Lead and Mixed Paints.\n Be it enacted by the legislative assembly of the state of North Dakota: 1. Every person, firm, or corporation who manufactures for sale or exposes for sale, or sells, within this state, any white lead paint or compound intended for use as such, shall label \n\n[207 U.S. 338, 339]\n\u00a0\n the same in clear and distinct open gothic letters upon a white background, and show the true per cent of each mineral constituent contained in said paint, or, if other than linseed oil is used in its preparation, the names of such oils or substitutes shall be shown, together with the percentage thereof, and every person, firm, or corporation who manufactures for sale, or exposes for sale, or sells within this state, any mixed paint or compound intended for use as such which contains any ingredient other than pure linseed oil, pure carbonate of lead, oxid of zinc, turpentine, Japan dryer, and pure colors, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall, for each offense, be punished by a fine of not less than twenty-five and not more than one hundred dollars and costs, or by imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding sixty days; provided, that any such person, firm, or corporation, who shall manufacture for sale, or expose for sale, or sell within this state any white lead paint or mixed paint, containing ingredients other than those as above enumeroated, shall not be deemed guilty of a violation of this act in case the same be properly labeled showing the quantity or amount of each and every ingredient used therein and not specified above, and the name and residence of the manufacturer or person for whom it is manufactured.\n It is made the duty of the appellee, in his official capacity, to enforce the statute. A few days before the statute took effect (January 1, 1906), the appellants filed a bill to restrain its enforcement, and prayed a preliminary as well as a permanent injunction. A preliminary injunction was granted. It was dissolved on final hearing, and a decree was entered, dismissing the bill for want of equity.\n The grounds of attack upon the statute are that it offends against the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, in that it deprives appellants of their property and liberty without due process of law, and denies them the equal protection of the laws. How it is contended the statute produces these effects will be pointed out hereafter. \n\n[207 U.S. 338, 340]\n\u00a0\n The stress of the case is upon paragraph 17 of the bill and the special paragraphs 'A' and 'B.' To these paragraphs an answer was filed. The legal effect of the others was submitted upon demurrer. Upon the issue of fact formed by the answer to paragraph 17 and the special paragraphs, testimony was taken, and upon it and the demurrer to the other allegations, and the affidavit of one Professor Ladd, the case was submitted.\n The bill is voluminous. It alleges that the plaintiffs are manufacturers of mixed paints, and sell their respective products in North Dakota, and that each 'had established an enviable reputation for its goods;' that each sold in North Dakota mixed paints containing ingredients other than those specified in the statute, which is set out. It is alleged that mixed paint has an absolutely defined meaning in the trade, and means a paint so thinned, 'by admixture of the proper liquid vehicles, as to reduce it to a consistency which makes it ready for use.' The term mixed paint, it is alleged, is used in contradistinction to 'a paste paint,' which paint has also a well defined meaning, meaning a paint ready for use, except that it requires thinning material to give it the necessary consistency. White lead, it is alleged, is a commercial, not a scientific, term, and is commonly understood to be a dry powder consisting of commercial carbonate of lead. When ground in oil to a paste consistency it is commonly called in the trade white lead in oil, colloquially referred to frequently as 'white lead.' In the statute these terms are used interchangeably, and are intended to denote white lead in oil, as above defined. That various compounds containing no carbonate of lead or other ingredients in addition to carbonate of lead are frequently sold in the market labeled as 'white lead.' And that the words 'any white lead paint, or compound intended for use as such,' in the act, 'are intended to denote a paste paint, intended as a substitute for white lead, and labeled or sold as 'white lead' or 'white lead in oil,' but which does not contain any carbonate of lead, or contains other ingredients in addition thereto.' \n\n[207 U.S. 338, 341]\n\u00a0\n Paragraph 17 is as follows:\n'Your orators further show unto your honors that the manufacture of paint, and more particularly of mixed paint, involves many practical problems, the proper solution of which demands the application of a variety of scientific principles, and is the result of a great variety of practical tests and experiments; that the means, methods, and processes employed in said manufacture have changed materially in the course of years to conform to the discovery of new scientific facts and the results of practical experiments; that the technology of paint manufacturing has made gradual and constant progress during the last fifty years, during which time it has undergone an evolutionary process which is still far from completed; that until about twenty-five years ago carbonate of lead was the only material which was universally conceded by manufacturers and users of paint to be a proper pigment to be used in paints requiring or admitting of the use of a white pigment; that since said time, and within the last twenty-five years, oxid of zine gradually gained recognition among manufacturers and users of paint as being equally appropriate for the purposes for which theretofore carbonate of lead had alone been recognized as appropriate, and has come to be universally conceded as possessing important useful qualities as a white pigment not possessed by carbonate of lead; that within the last fifteen years practical experiments and tests, made with a view to widening the range of white pigments properly usable in the manufacture of paint, have demonstrated the following facts, which are now conceded by the most advanced and most successful paint manufacturers of the world, viz.:\n\n'a. That there are materials other than carbonate of lead and oxid of zinc which, in some cases, may be used in connection therewith and in other cases may be used instead thereof, and which, either without carbonate of lead or oxid of zinc, or in connection with one or both of these, according to circumstances, are as efficient as, and in some respects more efficient than, carbonate of lead or oxid of zinc, or a combination of \n\n[207 U.S. 338, 342]\n\u00a0\n the two, for the purposes for which the latter are used in paint; that among said materials are (a) sublimed lead (which is an artificial product consisting of sulphate of lead and oxy-sulphate of lead), (b) standard zinc lead white (which is commonly called zinc lead, and is an artificial product, made by the United States Smelting Company, and sold in large quantities, and consists of a combination of sulphate of lead and oxid of zinc united by a furnace process), (c) zinc made from Western ores, which carries in its natural composition varying proportions of sulphate of lead and oxid of zinc, and (d) an artificial opaque white pigment, consisting essentially of zinc sulphid, zinc oxid, and barium sulphate, which is known to the paint manufacturing trade under various trade names, such as lithopone, ponolith, lithophone, charlton white, becton white, and Orr's white.\n\n'b. That there are certain white pigments other than carbonate of lead and oxid of zinc which constitute proper and useful ingredients of paints, and which, if so used in connection with carbonate of lead or oxid of zinc, or a combination of the same, or in connection with one or more of said other materials described in the last preceding paragraph as proper substitutes for carbonate of lead and oxid of zinc, furnish to the paint wherein used important useful qualities not possessed by either carbonate of lead or oxid of zinc, or any of said substitutes therefor; that among said other pigments are sulphate of barium, silica, silicate of magnesia, calcium carbonate, hydrated sulphate of lime, and others; that the proportionate amount of the pigments last named which may properly and usefully be made an ingredient of paint, and whether any of them may be properly used as such ingredients, depends upon a great variety of conditions and circumstances, but all of said pigments may, under proper conditions, serve a highly useful purpose, and where properly used do essentially increase the durability and density of the paint.'\n\n It is further alleged that the statute, in condemning inferentially the use of the materials mentioned in paragraph 17 and \n\n[207 U.S. 338, 343]\n\u00a0\n its subparagraph, 'as ingredients of mixed paint, and branding them as adulterants, ignores the fact that all said substances constitute proper, useful, and necessary ingredients of paint, is based upon antiquated, obsolete, and quite generally discarded prejudices regarding the ingredients proper, useful, and necessary to be used in paint, and is therefore unreasonable and void.'\n That complainants and most of the successful paint manufacturers of the United States have for many years maintained, and continue to maintain, in connection with their factories, chemical laboratories, wherein in are able, accomplished chemical experts, who are constantly conducting experiments in the qualities and properties of new ingredients to produce the best results regarding the purposes of paint, the materials upon which it is used, and the various conditions to which it may be exposed. And that the business success of such manufacturers largely depends upon the efficiency of said laboratories and experiments, 'and their readiness and ability to conform their methods of manufacturing to the truths discovered by said investigations and tests.' That such experiments have led to the adoption of improved methods of manufacture and the use of a widening range of ingredients and a constantly increasing degree of efficiency in the paint produced, and, if continued, 'is sure to bring about a still higher and gradually increasing degree of merit and efficiency in the paint of the future.'\n Other allegations of the bill set forth the virtues and usefulness of varnish as a vehicle or thinning material of mixed paint in connection with or in place of one or other of the ingredients of the statute for some purposes and situations, and that the statute, by excluding it, brands it as an adulterant, and is hence void. The bill also charges the statute with inaccuracy in its designation of pure carbonate of lead as one of the ingredients of mixed paint specified, and alleges that it cannot be used for the purpose of manufacturing paint, and that the carbonate of lead which is commonly used and has been used from time immemorial, even in paints of the higher grade, contains \n\n[207 U.S. 338, 344]\n\u00a0\n approximately 20 to 30 per cent of other ingredients. It is hence charged that the statute, by specifying 'pure' carbonate of lead, and prohibiting as a crime the use of commercial carbonate of lead, 'without specifying on a label quantity or amount of each of its ingredients, is unreasonable and void.' The bill also attacks with much detail the term 'pure colors' in the enumeration of the ingredients by the statute, alleges that such term neither has a definite meaning among the manufacturers of such coloring material nor among manufacturers of paint, nor is it capable of an exact, or even an approximately exact, definition; that there is no line of demarcation between pure and impure colors; that while some dry colors are regarded as 'pure' and others 'impure' by some manufacturers, there is nothing approaching a consensus of opinion upon the subject, and no rational classification has been attempted; that the standard universally applied to dry colors is not purity, but efficiency; that, with the exception of a very few dry colors of limited use in mixed paints, even the very highest and most expensive grades made or imported contain large and widely varying percentages of elements which have no coloring properties. Illustrations are given, and the bill charges 'that said act, in specifying 'pure colors' among the ingredients of mixed paint, and making the use of any but 'pure colors' as such ingredient a crime, unless the manufacturer or dealer stigmatizes the paint by a label, as required in said act, is so uncertain and unreasonable as to be void.'\n It is also alleged that the only purposes for which paint is used is to preserve and beautify, and that that paint is most efficient which accomplishes those purposes for the longest time, and that any ingredient which tends to such ends is a proper ingredient; that there is no natural standard of the purity of paint, nor a widely-accepted standard; that any enumeration of allowable ingredients, short of an exhaustive enumeration of ingredients which may, under particular circumstances and conditions, give to paint a useful quality, is necessarily unjust and unreasonable, and even such enumera- \n\n[207 U.S. 338, 345]\n\u00a0\n tion, though just to-day, by discoveries may be unjust to-morrow; that, to produce an efficient paint, not the ingredients alone must be considered, but the manner and the proportion of every combination, and the purpose and conditions of the use of the paint; that it is, therefore, impossible to speak of a standard of purity as applied to paint, 'nor is it reasonable for any statute to attempt to set up a standard of efficiency of paint by an enumeration of allowable ingredients; the only test of the efficiency of paint being its ability to serve the purposes for which it is intended.'\n It is further alleged that the requirement of the statute 'is intended and calculated to create in the minds of the mixed paint dealers and consumers in the state of North Dakota the erroneous belief that all ingredients of mixed paint other than those specified in said act are adulterants, used for the purpose of cheapening the product, and add no quality of usefulness or efficiency to the mixed paint wherein they are used; that said act, in requiring mixed paint containing any ingredients other than those specified in said act as aforesaid, to be labeled as aforesaid, is a requirement that the manufacturer of and dealer in such paint shall brand the same in such a way as to hold it up to the suspicion and prejudice of the users of mixed paint, and thereby make the sale thereof in said state, if not impossible, at least more difficult and expensive.'\n That the excluded ingredients (they are enumerated in the bill) will have no tendency by their use to render 'mixed paint by those applying the same harmful to health in any sense or degree.' That while such act was intended as a police regulation for the prevention of fraud, its provisions are such that it has no tendency to accomplish such end; that the act, by failing to specify the maximum and minimum of the proportionate amount of the ingredients specified, permits the manufacture and sale of mixed paint containing those ingredients in such proportions as to make it absolutely inefficient and useless and a fraud upon the purchaser; that by holding up to the prejudice of dealers in and users of other mixed paint has the ten- \n\n[207 U.S. 338, 346]\n\u00a0\n dency, in many instances, to give inferior brands a preference over superior brands of mixed paint. And that such act has no tendency to accomplish the prevention of fraud, because it does not prevent the manufacture and sale 'of any imaginable paint concoction in paste form,' or impure linseed oil, or any spurious article, as 'white lead,' or 'white lead in oil,' or as 'white lead paint,' because a paint ready for use may be lawfully made of such concoctions and substitutes; 'that the manufacture and sale of paste paint is a substantial part of the paint manufacturing and selling business of the United States; that millions of dollars worth of white lead in oil and compounds intended as substitutes therefor are annually manufactured and sold in the United States; that tinting colors for use as an ingredient of paint are manufactured in large quantities and sold in cans, in paste form, throughout the United States; that linseed oil, as such, is an article of commerce throughout the United States;' and that the statute, by failing to place restriction on the manufacture or sale of such paint and material, but imposing penalties and restrictions on the manufacturers of mixed paint, unjustly discriminates against the latter, and, for the same reason and 'the other facts and circumstances' stated in the bill, they will be deprived of their property without due process of law.\n It was also alleged that each of the complainants manufactures 'scores of different kinds and shades of mixed paints, differing from each other in chemical composition; that even the same kind and shade of mixed paint manufactured by any one of your orators has no fixed chemical composition, but varies in such composition from time to time and practically with each lot manufactured, by reason of the wide variations in the chemical composition of the constituent ingredients, more especially the chemical composition of the dry colors used; that in order to properly label the cans of mixed paint manufactured by your orators, and sold in North Dakota, showing 'the quantity or amount of each and every ingredient used therein, and not specified' in said act, each of your orators \n\n[207 U.S. 338, 347]\n\u00a0\n would have to have a chemical analysis made of each lot of mixed paint before putting the same up in cans or other containers.' It is alleged that this would add materially to the cost of manufacture of mixed paints, cast a burden upon them from which the manufacturers of other paints are free, and would deprive them of their property without due process of law.\n It is further alleged that there are dealers in North Dakota who have on hand a stock of mixed paint subject to the act, and who will be subject to criminal prosecution unless the cans containing the same be opened and analyzed and labeled, which opening would make the paint unsalable; that dealers, who, in the future, shall purchase from any of the complainants, and the distributing agents and salesmen of complainants, will be subject to criminal prosecution; and thereby a multiplicity of criminal prosecutions will ensue, and suits to enforce payments for paints sold or to be sold. And if the complainants should label the mixed paints manufactured by them as required by the act they would not only be subject to the expense thereof, but that their products will be held up to suspicion and prejudice of the dealers in and users of the same, which will make it either impossible or more difficult and expensive to sell their products in said state, all of which will produce incalculable and irreparable injury to complainants; that the dealers in paints who are now subject or may be subject to prosecution under such act will not have sufficient interest to or cannot successfully raise the defense of the invalidity of the act, 'inasmuch as such defense involves the consideration of the complex state of facts hereinbefore set forth.'\n Fear is expressed that most of such prosecutions will result in conviction, and that by such the brands of mixed paints involved therein will be branded as adulterated and illegal products, and will thereby be rendered unsalable, all of which will produce incalculable and irreparable injury to complainants, and will constitute the taking of their property without due process of law and the denial to them of the equal protection of the laws. \n\n[207 U.S. 338, 348]\n\u00a0\n It is difficult to separate the admissions and denials of the answer to paragraph 17. It admits that practical problems are involved in the manufacture of paints, particularly of mixed paints, the solution of which is the result of a variety of practical tests and experiments; 'that the technology of paint manufacture has made gradual and constant progress during the past fifty years, during which time it has undergone an evolutionary process. 'It admits that formerly carbonate of lead was the only material which was universally used as the proper pigment in paints requiring or admitting of the use of a white pigment, and that oxid of zinc has gained recognition as in many cases appropriate as a white pigment, but denies that such recognition has come within the last twentyfive years; on the contrary, asserts it has been recognized and used for a period of thirty years. Admits that there are materials other than carbonate of lead and odix of zinc used in connection with the latter or instead of them, but denies their equal efficiency; on the contrary, alleges that tests and experiments have not determined or demonstrated the value and usefulness of such materials, and further alleges that their use and value have not progressed beyond the experimental stage. That about one half of the leading manufacturers entirely reject them, or reject them because, upon test, they have proved to be unsatisfactory and inefficient, and others, that time has not yet demonstrated their value. Admits that zinc made from Western ores is valuable and efficient as a pigment, provided sulphate of lead, incidental to its production, does not exceed in quality 5 per cent of its constituent elements, and alleges that the percentages of the sulphate of lead are widely different.\n The answer to subparagraph 'b' of paragraph 17 admits that in making the colored paints there mentioned it is necessary to employ some of the articles mentioned in connection with some pigment other than carbonate of lead, and that the latter would change or modify the exact shades sought to be produced. But it is alleged on information and belief that the aggregate of all mixed paints produced, sold, and consumed in \n\n[207 U.S. 338, 349]\n\u00a0\n North Dakota, in the preparation of which it is necessary to exclude carbonate of lead, and to include one or more of the substituted materials mentioned in the bill, does not exceed 25 per cent of the aggregate of all mixed paints which may be prepared and produced by the use alone of carbonate of lead and oxid of zinc as pigments. Save as to those admitted, the answer denies the efficiency of the materials mentioned, and avers that the general use of them is 'to cheapen and adulterate the paints wherein they are employed,' and, of all substances known, they are best adapted and lend themselves most readily and are commonly used as adulterants to cheapen mixed paints. It is further averred that 70 to 75 per cent of the paint used in the state are mixed paints, and that their adulteration has become and is a great evil. 'That no other substances have been discovered or known, which, by their inherent qualities, lend themselves so readily to, or are so commonly employed for, such purpose of fraud and deception, as those described in said subparagraph 'b.\"\n Messrs. Sigmund Zeisler and Henry L. Stern for appellants.\n\n\n[207 U.S. 338, 352]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John S. Watson, T. S. McCue, and Ball, Watson, Young & Hardy for appellee. \n\n[207 U.S. 338, 353]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n It appears from the evidence that the statute which is assailed by appellants was one, among others, passed to prevent the adulteration of articles or to provide for the publication of their composition. That both purposes are within the competency of the state can hardly be denied. A discrimination is, however, asserted to have been made in the exercise of the power, with the following results: (1) The imposition of the burden of analyzing and labeling the ingredients of mixed paints, from which burden the manufacturers of paste paint and manufacturers of mixed paints containing only the ingredients specified in the act are to be free. (2) Holding up to the prejudice of dealers in and users of mixed paints containing ingredients other than those specified, branding them as suspicious or adulterated, and rendering them unsalable or less salable than mixed paints containing the statutory ingredients, though more efficient than the latter for certain purposes. We can see that expense will be cast on the manufacturers of mixed paint not containing ingredients enumerated in the statute, but that such paint will be branded as adulterated is not easy to accept, and seems to be opposed by other allegations in the \n\n[207 U.S. 338, 354]\n\u00a0\n bill. It is averred that the complainants have a yearly increasing trade in the state of North Dakota, which has at tained to many thousands of dollars per annum, and that, by the high quality of their goods and by advertising, they have attained an enviable reputation for them. How the firmness and profit of that trade, how the excellence and degree of that reputation, can be affected by revealing the composition of the goods, is not by us discernible. Manufacturers who use inferior materials because they are so, or from a mistaken opinion of their quality, though they have statutory sanction, would be more affected than complainants. Consumers of paint, we may assume, like the consumers of other kinds of goods, seek excellence in them, and, where excellence is demonstrated by use, will care little of what pigments it is composed. This, however, is anticipating somewhat, and we will pass to the statute, consider its purpose, and see whether its classification is justified by that purpose.\n We will omit from citation the cases in which this court has passed upon the power of the states to classify objects for the purpose of government. A review of them is not necessary in this case. Counsel have collected and analyzed them, applied or rejected them as they have thought they supported or opposed their respective contentions. We have declared many times, and illustrated the declaration, that classification must have relation to the purpose of the legislature. But logical appropriateness of the inclusion or exclusion of objects or persons is not required. A classification may not be merely arbitrary, but necessarily there must be great freedom of discretion, even though it result in 'ill-advised, unequal, and oppressive legislation.' Mobile County v. Kimball, \n102 U.S. 691\n, 26 L. ed. 238. And this necessarily on account of the complex problems which are presented to the government. Evils must be met as they arise and according to the manner in which they arise. The right remedy may not always be apparent. Any interference, indeed, may be asserted to be evil, may result in evil. At any rate, exact wisdom and nice adaptation of remedies are not required by \n\n[207 U.S. 338, 355]\n\u00a0\n the 14th Amendment, nor the crudeness nor the impolicy nor even the injustice of state laws redressed by it.\n Keeping these principles in mind, let us examine the North Dakota statute. Its purpose, as expressed in the title, is 'to prevent the adulteration of, and deception in the sale of, white lead and mixed paints.' It attempts to accomplish this purpose by the following requirements: (1) All white lead and compounds intended for use as a substitute therefor must be labeled to clearly show the per cent of each mineral therein. (2) All mixed paints must show their true composition, unless made of pure linseed oil, carbonate of lead, or oxid of zinc, turpentine, Japan dryer, and pure colors. (3) All substitutes for linseed oil in the preparation of paints must be clearly shown on the label.\n The second and third divisions we are concerned with in this case, and it is insisted their requirements work a discrimination between mixed paints which contain and those which do not contain any ingredients other than those specified. It will be observed that the manufacture for sale and the selling of the first kind is made a misdemeanor unless the paint be labeled as required by the statute. The manufacture or sale of the other kind is free from such consequence or condition. It is also charged that the statute discriminates between mixed paints and paste paints, it being asserted that the latter, no matter what their ingredients, need not be labeled. To this charge we may immediately answer that it is open to contest whether the act exempts paste paint from its requirements, and the executive officers of the state have construed it as not exempting them. But be this as it may, there is a distinction between the paints, and the evils to which the statute was addressed may not exist or be as flagrant in one as in the other. There indeed may be a degree of competition between them, but other circumstances and conditions may have directed the legislative discretion. This record certainly does not present any data to make it certain that the discretion was arbitrarily exercised. Legislation which regulates business \n\n[207 U.S. 338, 356]\n\u00a0\n may well make distinctions depend upon the degrees of evil without being arbitrary or unreasonable. Ozan Lumber Co. v. Union County Nat. Bank, \n207 U.S. 251\n, 52 L. ed.--, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 89.\n\n 2. \nThe argument which attacks the discrimination between mixed paints is an elaboration of paragraph 17 of the bill. It is able, circumstantial, and variously illustrated. It has been given careful consideration, but it would extend this opinion too much to answer it in detail or review its specifications. It is ultimately grounded on the contention that the pigments enumerated in the statute, and hence denominated statutory pigments, are not more efficient,-may be not as efficient to the manufacture of paint, either in themselves or as depending upon the particular use to which paint may be put, the proportion of ingredients varying with such use, or even with the fancy or taste of the user, or the atmospheric conditions to which paint may be exposed, as the pigments mentioned in subparagraphs 'A' and 'B' of paragraph 17, and hence called class 'A' and class 'B' pigments. And it is contended that there is 'neither a standard of purity nor general or widely-accepted standard of purity;' and that the statute, by making a standard of some ingredients and excluding others 'useful, efficient, harmless, and in some cases most essential,' is an arbitrary discrimination and an improper exercise of the police power of the state, not justified by the comparative newness of the excluded ingredients, or because they are not used by unprogressive manufacturers, or used by unscrupulous ones in excessive proportions to cheapen their products. And this, it is urged, is all that is established against such ingredients. Besides, it is further urged, the charge that they are used to cheapen paint is true of one of the statutory ingredients.\n The claims for class 'A' and 'B' pigments are controverted, and if they are sustained at all are sustained upon the balancing of, and the judgment between, the testimony of experts, certain publications and exhibits. But a problem of a different kind was presented to the legislature of North Dakota. It was not what scientific men might find out by chemical and laboratory \n\n[207 U.S. 338, 357]\n\u00a0\n tests, or progressive men might discover by practical experiments, but what the people of the state could find out or be justified in accepting as established. It was the experience of the people, not the acts of some progressive manufacturers, which directed the legislation, and it was to protect the people, when following the opinions formed from that experience, from deception, that the statute was enacted. It may be that the purpose could have been accomplished better in some other way. It may be that it would have been more entirely adequate, let us say, even more entirely just, to have required that all paint should be labeled; the statute nevertheless cannot be brought under the condemnation of the 14th Amendment. Legislatures, as we have seen, have the constitutional power to make unwise classifications. But we may be going too far in concession to the argument of appellants. The legislatute of North Dakota may have met the evils which exist as best it could, and there is a strong presumption that it did. At any rate, a fair question was presented, whether to take as a standard the ingredients that years of use had demonstrated as excellent or make regulation universal. We think it would be limiting the power of the state too much to say that a judgment exercised under such circumstances must be condemned as denying the equal protection of the laws, or that the liberty assured by the Constitution of the United States in the 14th Amendment gives a right to either progressive or conservative tendencies in legislation.\n Appellants not only attack the standard adopted by the statute, but attack the use made of it. They assert that the standard is of 'purely negative character,' in that it fails to 'require all allowable ingredients essential for efficiency to be used, and its failure to prescribe maximum and minimum percentages,' and, therefore, it is insisted, 'permits of the manufacture and sale under the special sanction of the law of that which is inefficient, useless, and a fraud upon the purchaser.' It is besides asserted that the statute enumerates among the allowable ingredients a material which cannot be used, to wit, \n\n[207 U.S. 338, 358]\n\u00a0\n pure carbonate of lead, and it is asked whether a statute having these effects can be a valid exercise of the police power of the state. The answer is ready enough. The enumeration of 'pure carbonate of lead' may be corrected into commercial carbonate by a perfectly allowable exercise of construction; and as to the other charge, the inefficiency of the statutory ingredients on account of the failure to define the proportions in which they must be used goes to the defect or incompleteness of the legislation, not to its legality. Were the proportions ever so exactly defined, the relation of mixed paints to the resultant product or its liberty of sale or power of competition would not be lessened.\n There is a special and earnest criticism of the provision of the statute requiring varnish when used as a thinning material to be specified, and a like criticism of the term 'pure colors' to designate one of the statutory ingredients. 'The exclusion of varnish,' it is said, 'from the list of allowable ingredients is indefensible and undefended.' The bill alleges, and it is not denied, that there is a very large demand for certain mixed paints, which are enumerated, that are capable of producing a high gloss for decorative purposes and have high resisting power to moisture, and that varnish is the 'only thinning material now known which may appropriately be used as an ingredient of mixed paint to produce said effects.' 'Notwithstanding these admitted facts,' counsel's comment is, 'varnish is branded as an adulterant by the statute.'\n The term 'pure colors,' it is alleged, is intended to refer to coloring material used by paint manufacturers in powdered form, and is known in trade as 'dry colors;' that the term 'pure colors' neither has a definite meaning nor is 'it capable of an exact or even approximately exact definition;' that some dry colors are regarded as 'pure' and others 'impure' by individual manufacturers, but there is 'nothing approaching a consensus of opinion,' and 'no rational classification on the subject has ever been attempted.' The standard 'applied to dry colors is not purity, but efficiency.' \n\n[207 U.S. 338, 359]\n\u00a0\n We regard these criticisms answered by our general discussion, and we have specially noticed them that it may not be thought we have overlooked them. They may emphasize what we have already said as to the possible imperfection of the classification of the statute. It must not be forgotten, however, that inaccuracies of definition may be removed in the administration of the law. And it must be borne in mind that the use of the nonenumerated ingredients is not forbidden nor the advantages of the practical tests and scientific research made by appellants taken away from them. The sole prohibition of the statute is that those ingredients shall not be used without a specific declaration that they are used,-a burden, maybe, but irremediable by the courts,-may be inevitable, in legislation directed against the adulteration of articles, or to secure a true representation of their character or composition.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","71":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHENRY E FRANKENBERG CO. v. U S(1907)\nNo. 257\nArgued: April 12, 1907Decided: May 13, 1907\n\n\n\n Mr. Frederick W. Brooks for petitioner.\n Assistant Attorney General Sanford for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n The question involved in this case is whether certain importations of metal beads are dutiable under paragraph 408 of the \n\n[206 U.S. 224, 225]\n\u00a0\n tariff act of July 24, 1897 [30 Stat. at L. 167, 189, chap. 11, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 1645, 1673], at 35 per cent ad valorem, or at 45 per cent ad valorem under paragraph 193.\n The collector assessed them at the latter rate. The petitioner protested. Upon submission of the protest to the board of general appraisers, that board sustained the collector. Its decision was successively affirmed by the circuit court and the circuit court of appeals. 76 C. C. A. 514, 146 Fed. 63.\n The applicable paragraphs are respectively as follows: 408, 'Beads of all kinds not threaded or strung, thirty-five per centum ad valorem;' 193, 'Articles or wares not specially provided for in this act, composed wholly or in part of . . . metal, and whether partly or wholly manufactured, forty-five per centum ad valorem.' There is no dispute about the character of the articles. They are metal beads, strung on cotton cords or strings. They cannot, therefore, be said to be beads 'not threaded or strung,' which paragraph 408 makes dutiable at 35 per cent, if the words of that paragraph be taken literally. But it is contended that the construction of that paragraph is dependent upon the use to which the beads are put and the purpose on account of which they are strung. It is contended, and the contention is supported by the testimony, that the beads are used in the manufacture of purses, for the embroidery of cushions and dresses; never for personal adornment; and that they are strung or threaded in bunches for the purpose of facilitating transportation, and hence, in contemplation of the statute, loose beads. To this argument the circuit court of appeals of the seventh circuit yielded. United States v. Buettner, 66 C. C. A. 289, 133 Fed. 163. It did not prevail, however, with the circuit court of appeals of the second circuit in the case at bar nor in a prior case. Steiner v. United States, 24 C. C. A. 690, 26 U. S. App. 778, 79 Fed. 1003. Notwithstanding this conflict in the circuit court of appeal, the case is in such narrow compass that an extended discussion is not necessary. It may be that the stringing of the beads has but a temporary purpose. We, however, are not at liberty to disregard the condition upon which the law makes the duty depend. Indeed, the considerations expressed by the board of appraisers \n\n[206 U.S. 224, 226]\n\u00a0\n make it certain that the language of paragraph 408 was deliberately used to apply only to beads actually loose. This view is supported by the testimony as well. It was testified that prior to 1897 that the terms threaded and strung beads were familiar in the importing trade, and that beads strung on 'threads for temporary use were commercially known at that time as strung beads.' And it was further testified that there was an increase in value over unstrung beads from 15 to 20 per cent on account of the labor attached to stringing.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice Moody took no part in the decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","72":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHISCOCK v. MERTENS(1907)\nNo. 209\nArgued: February 27, 1907Decided: March 25, 1907\n\n\n\n Mr. Will B. Crowley for petitioner.\n\n\n[205 U.S. 202, 204]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Dorr Raymond Cobb for respondent. \n\n[205 U.S. 202, 205]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n The question in this case is whether the cash surrender value of a policy of insurance under  70-2-5 of the bankruptcy act must be provided for in the policy, or whether it be sufficient if the policy have such value by the concession or practice of the company. Section 70 provides that 'the trustee of the estate of a bankrupt, upon his appointment and qualification, . . . shall in turn be vested by operation of law with the title of the bankrupt as of the date he was adjudged a bankrupt, except in so far as it is to property which is exempt, to all (1) documents relating to his property . . . (3) powers which he might have exercised for his own benefit, but not those which he might have exercised for some other person . . . (5) property which, prior to the filing of the petition, he could, by any means, have transferred, or which might have been levied upon and sold under judicial process against him: Provided, That when any bankrupt shall have any insurance policy which has a cash surrender value payable to himself, his estate or personal representatives, he may, within thirty days after the cash surrender value has been ascertained and stated to the trustee by the company issuing the same, pay or secure to the trustee the sum so ascertained and stated, and continue to hold, own, and carry such policy free from the claims of the creditors participating in the distribution of his estate under the bankruptcy proceedings; otherwise the policy shall pass to the trustee as assets.' [30 Stat. at L. 565, chap. 541, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3451.]\n The respondent and his sons, individually and as composing the copartnership of J. M. Mertens & Company, were declared bankrupts, and petitioner was elected the trustee of their estate October 14, 1903\n\n\n At the time the petition in bankruptcy was filed Mertens held four life insurance policies issued by the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States. One of the policies, payable to his wife if she should survive him, has been dropped from this controversy. The other three policies were payable \n\n[205 U.S. 202, 206]\n\u00a0\n to Mertens at his death, his executors, administrators, or assignees. They were subject to certain claims arising from their having been assigned as security for certain loans. With these we are not concerned.\n A dispute arose as to the ownership of the policies, and the trustee filed a petition in the district court for the determination of the ownership of them, and that Mertens be required to make an assignment of them to the trustee. Mertens answered, alleging that the policies had, by law and the regular practice of the Equitable Life Assurance Society, a cash surrender value which he had sought to pay to the trustee, and was ready and willing to pay; that it was the uniform practice of the society to pay, upon the surrender of such policies and on policies issued on any of the blank forms shown by the policies, the cash value thereof 'determined in accordance with a fixed and definite method of computation, and stated on demand by any policy holder or person in interest;' that the society, pursuant to law and in accordance with its practice, had stated to him and declared the cash surrender value of each of the policies and its readiness and willingness to pay such value upon the surrender of the policies. The values were stated.\n The matter was referred to a special master to take the proofs and report the same, with findings of fact and conclusions of law. Proofs were taken and a report made in accordance with the order of the court. The master, in his report, describing the policies, said:\n'None of these express any agreement or provision whereby, upon default, the company shall pay a 'cash surrender value' to any person. By their terms the assured is excluded from any participation in dividends until the completion of the tontine period, at which time all surplus and profits derived from such policies are to be divided among the persistent policies of that class then in force. At the expiration of the tontine period the persistent policy holder is given certain options, among them to withdraw in cash the policy's entire share of the assets, that is, that accumulated reserve, the amount of which is stated in each policy, and, in addition, the \n\n[205 U.S. 202, 207]\n\u00a0\n share of the assets, that is, the accumulated Each of these policies also provides that, upon default in payment of a premium and the surrender of the policy within six months thereafter, the assured shall be entitled to a new paid-up policy, based upon the reserve accumulated under the old policy, but 'without participation in profits.' Both funds secured by the agreement, namely, the insurance proper and the endowment fund representing the accumulated profits, are payable to the assured or to his executors, administrators, or assigns. No other person is mentioned in either of the policies as having any beneficial interest therein.'\n\n It appeared from the testimony that, as a matter of fact, policies of the character of those in controversy had, under the practice of the company, cash surrender values, if offered for surrender within six months from the date of the nonpayment of any premium. Explaining this, a witness said: 'To make clear the replies of previous questions I will state that the Equitable Life Assurance Society would decline to purchase for cash a policy during the period for which premiums had been paid, entitling the policy holder to protection for the face value, for the reason that, in the event of the death of the holder of that policy before the expiration of the period for which premiums had been paid, the question would be raised as to the liability of the company, so that the payment of an amount of cash for the surrender of a policy is only made by the company after that policy has lapsed by reason of the nonpayment upon its due date.' And it was testified that the cash surrender values of policies was determined by a fixed and definite method of computation, uniform in all cases, and had, without exception, been paid to persons insured by the company. It further appeared that the surrender values of the policies in controversy were as follows: Policy No. 274,445, $5,905.65; policy No. 417, 678, $2,272.56; policy No. 417,171, $6,574.00. \n\n[205 U.S. 202, 208]\n\u00a0\n It was further testified that the surrender value of each policy was equivalent to the amount of a paid-up policy, which the company was willing to give. Or, as expressed by a witness, 'it is equivalent to the percentage reserved under that policy (referring to policy No. 274,445), which the company is willing to pay in consideration of the surrender.'\n The district court held that the policies had no cash surrender value within the meaning of  70 of the bankrupt act. The court said:\n'In the policies in question not only is there a failure to provide for a cash surrender value, but the provisions are inconsistent with the existence of such a value. This, however, is not at war with the fact that the assurance association may be willing to pay money for the surrender of such policies. There is no pretense that this custom of the insurer formed a part of the contract between the parties, or that the insured could enforce the payment of a surrender value, or the payment of anything, on surrendering the policy. In short, the insurer might be willing to pay a surrender value and might not. Such payment would be optional with it.'\n\n And again:\n'The association might be willing to pay one day, entirely unwilling the next. . . . Is this the 'cash surrender value' spoken of in the bankruptcy law? This court thinks not. It would seem that had Congress intended that every bankrupt holding a policy of insurance of the nature of these should retain the same as his own on paying to the trustee in bankruptcy the value thereof that the insurer might fix by its custom or otherwise, it would have used language appropriate to that end, and not an expression implying a value the insured has a legal right to demand, and the insurer may be compelled to pay,-a value generally understood to be provided for in the policy itself.' [131 Fed. 974, 975.]\n\n The court cited, to sustain its siews, Re Welling, 51 C. C. A. 151, 113 Fed. 189, and Re Slingluff, 106 Fed. 154.\n An order was entered requiring Mertens to assign the policies \n\n[205 U.S. 202, 209]\n\u00a0\n to the trustees. It was reversed by the circuit court of appeals. The latter court, however, said that it 'should be inclined to concur with these views [expressed in Re Welling] and to sustain the conclusion of the district judge in the cause at bar, that 'no policy is understood to have a cash surrender value unless provided for in the policy so as to be enforceable by the insured,' were it not for a subsequent expression of opinion by the Supreme Court. This is found in Holden v. Stratton, \n198 U.S. 214\n, 49 L. ed. 1022, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 660, as follows:\n\"There has been some contrariety of opinion expressed by the lower Federal courts as to the exact meaning of the words 'cash surrender value' as employed in the proviso, some courts holding that it means a surrender value expressly stipulated by the contract of insurance to be paid, and other courts holding that the words embrace policies, even though a stipulation in respect to surrender value is not contained therein, where the policy possesses a cash value which would be recognized and paid by the insurer on the surrender of the policy. It is to be observed that this latter construction harmonizes with the practice under the bankrupt act of 1867 (Re Newland, 6 Ben. 342, Fed. Cas. No. 10,170; Re McKinney, 15 Fed. 535) and tends to elucidate and carry out the purpose contemplated by the proviso as we have construed it. However, whatever influence that construction may have, as the question is not necessarily here involved we do not expressly decide it.\" [142 Fed. 447.]\n\n The court observed that the extract from Holden v. Stratton was obiter to the questions decided in the case, but considered it such an explicit declaration of views that the court expressed hesitation to disregard it.\n We are hence confronted with the problem whether the obiter of Holden v. Stratton shall be pronounced to be the proper construction of  70 of the bankrupt act. We may remark at the commencement that that obiter was not inconsiderately uttered, nor can it be said that it was inconsequent to the considerations there involved. It was there necessary to determine between conflicting decisions of two \n\n[205 U.S. 202, 210]\n\u00a0\n circuit courts of appeals upon the effect of state statutes of exemption from liability for debts, and a careful consideration of  6 of the bankrupt act, which provided for exemptions, and  70, which defined the property which passed to the trustee, was necessary to be made and their proper effect and relation determined. As elements in that consideration the meaning and scope of  70 were involved and the purpose of Congress in its enactment. Section 6 provides for exemptions 'prescribed by the state laws.' Section 70 vests the title of all the property of the bankrupt in the trustee, 'except in so far as it is to property which is exempt.' Then, after a designation of the property the title to which is transferred, follows the proviso in regard to insurance policies. It was argued that the proviso would be meaningless unless considered as wholly disconnected from the clause as to exempt property, and this court replied:\n'As  70a deals only with property which, not being exempt, passes to the trustee, the mission of the proviso was in the interest of the perpetuation of policies of life insurance, to provide a rule by which, where such policies passed to the trustee because they were not exempt, if they had a surrender value their future operations could be preserved by vesting the bankrupt with the privilege of paying such surrender value, whereby the policy would be withdrawn out of the category of an asset of the estate. That is to say, the purpose of the proviso was to confer a benefit upon the insured bankrupt by limiting the character of the interest in a nonexempt life insurance policy which should pass to the trustee, and not to cause such a policy when exempt to become an asset of the estate. When the purpose of the proviso is thus ascertained it becomes apparent that to maintain the construction which the argument seeks to affix to the proviso would cause it to produce a result diametrically opposed to its spirit and to the purpose it was intended to subserve.' \n198 U.S. 213\n, 49 L. ed. 1022, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 659.\n\n And, contemplating the proviso as having such purpose, \n\n[205 U.S. 202, 211]\n\u00a0\n the court used the language quoted by the circuit court of appeals, and expressed the view that, as between the two constructions that had been made of the terms, 'cash surrender value,' whether they meant a stipulation in the contract or the recognition by the company, the latter harmonized with the practice under the bankrupt act of 1867 [14 Stat. at L. 517, chap. 176], and tended to elucidate and carry out the purpose contemplated by the proviso as the decision construed it. And the precedent practice is necessarily a strong factor and would be so even if it had a less solid foundation in reason. It is nowhere better expressed than in Re McKinney, supra. It is there pointed out that the foundation of the surrender value of a policy is the excess of the fixed annual premiums in the earlier years of the policy over the annual risk during the later years of the policy. 'This excess,' it was said, 'in the premium paid over the annual cost of insurance, with accumulations of interest constitutes the surrender value.'\n And further:\n Though this excess of premiums paid is legally the sole property of the company, still in practical effect, though not in law, it is moneys of the assured, deposited with the company in advance, to make up the deficiency in later premiums to cover the annual cost of insurance instead of being retained by the assured, and paid by him to the company in the shape of greatly increased premiums when the risk is greatest. It is the 'net reserve' required by law to be kept by the company for the benefit of the assured and to be maintained to the credit of the policy. So long as the policy remains in force the company has not practically any beneficial interest in it, except as its custodian, with the obligation to maintain it unimpaired and suitably invested for the benefit of the assured. This is the practical, though not the legal, relation of the company to this fund.\n'Upon the surrender of the policy before the death of the assured, the company, to be relieved from all responsibility for the increased risk, which is represented by this accumulating \n\n[205 U.S. 202, 212]\n\u00a0\n reserve, could well afford to surrender a considerable part of it to the assured, or his representative. A return of a part in some form or other is now usually made.'\n\n In Re Newland, supra, it was said that the present value of a policy is its cash surrender value, and but for that 'it could not be said to have any appreciable value. Parker v. Anglesey, 20 Week. Rep. 162, 25 L. T. N. S. 482.'\n There is no expression in either of the cases that the cash surrender value depended upon contract as distinct from the usage of companies. And  70 expresses no distinction. At the time of its enactment there were policies which stated a surrender value and a practice which conceded such value if not stated. If a distinction had been intended to be made it would have been expressed. Able courts, it is true, have decided otherwise, but we are unable to adopt their view. It was an actual benefit for which the statute provided, and not the manner in which it should be evidenced. And we do not think it rested upon chance concession. It rested upon the interest of the companies and a practice to which no exception has been shown. And that a provision enacted for the benefit of debtors should recognize an interest so substantial and which had such assurance was perfectly natural. What possible difference could it make whether the surrender value was stipulated in a policy or universally recognized by the companies? In either case the purpose of the state would be subserved, which was to secure to the trustee the sum of such value and to enable the bankrupt to 'continue to hold, own, and carry such policy free from the claims of the creditors participating in the distribution of the estate under the bankruptcy proceedings.'\n Counsel for petitioner argues that the policies are mere investments, and intimates the injustice of keeping them from the trustee, and illustrates the comment by contrasting what the company would have paid as the surrender value of policy No. 274,445, if default had been made in payment \n\n[205 U.S. 202, 213]\n\u00a0\n of premiums, and what the company would pay six months thereafter. The contrast is between $5,905.65 and $11,318.40. But this is the result of the age of the policy, and cannot be a test of other policies or of the construction of the law. And a precisely like effect would result if the policy expressed a surrender value, in which case it is conceded, it would come under the law. The same comment is applicable to other arguments of petitioner which tend to confound the distinction between surrender value and other value. Section 70 deals with the former, and makes it the conditions of the relative rights of the bankrupt and the trustee of his estate. Pursuing the argument farther, it is said that 'the right to participate in the profits was a part and parcel of the policy and of the privileges enjoyed thereunder;' and it is further observed that the difference between the value of the policy which was used for illustration, 'if lapsed on September 8, 1903, given as $5,905.65, and its value on March 8, 1904, $11,318.40, is chiefly made up of the value of this right to participate in profits.' And counsel for petitioner is disposed to think the contention absurd that the bankruptcy law contemplated that such a valuable right 'could be absolutely wiped out and taken from the trustee in such a case as this by allowing the bankrupt to take up the policy by paying what the bankrupt here claims to be the surrender value.' Such result would not appear to be absured if the policy were only two years old instead of nineteen years. Manifestly a policy cannot be declared in or out of the law according to its age, nor can anything be deduced from the investment features of tontine policies. Such policies were decided to be covered by the law in Holden v. Stratton. Whether the law should have included them is not our concern. Whatever may be said against it, it has seemed best to the legislature to encourage the extra endeavor and sacrifice which such policies may represent.\n It is further contended that respondent has not made out that the policies have a cash surrender value, because it appears \n\n[205 U.S. 202, 214]\n\u00a0\n from the evidence that the company would not accept their surrender until they had lapsed, and that they had not lapsed either when the petition was filed or the bankruptcy adjudged. But this is tantamount to saying that no policy can ever have a surrender value. According to the testimony, policies which have a stipulation for such value are subject to the same condition. And there is nothing in the record to show that the practice and policies of other companies are not the same as those of the Equitable Life Assurance Society. Section 70 is broad enough to accommodate such condition. It permits the redemption of a policy by the bankrupt from the claims of creditors by paying or securing to the trustee the cash surrender value of the policy 'within thirty days' after such value 'has been ascertained and stated to the trustee by the company issuing the same.'\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","73":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHISCOCK v. VARICK(1907)\nNo. 244\nArgued: March 15, 1907Decided: May 13, 1907\n\n\n\n General order in bankruptcy, No. 36, relates to 'Appeals,' and subdivision 3 thereof provides: 'In every case in which either party is entitled by the act to take an appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, the court from which the appeal lies shall, at or before the time of entering its judgment or decree, make and file a finding of the facts, and its conclusions of law thereon, stated separately; and the record transmitted to the Supreme Court of the United States on such an appeal shall consist only of the pleadings, the judgment or decree, the finding of facts, and the conclusions of law.'\n The circuit court of appeals, in pursuance thereof, made and filed its finding of the facts and its conclusions of law thereon.\n August 18, 1903, a petition in bankruptcy was filed against the firm of Jacob M. Mertens & Company and the individual members thereof. They were adjudicated bankrupts Septem- \n\n[206 U.S. 28, 29]\n\u00a0\n ber 15, and on the following 14th of October plaintiff in error was elected trustee in bankruptcy of both the copartnership and the individual estates. At the time the petition was filed the firm was indebted to the Varick Bank to the amount of $27,893.85, evidenced by notes made or indorsed or guaranteed by Mertens & Company, five of which, aggregating $ 22,500,-four for $5,000 each, and one for $2,500,-were collateral notes. These notes were alike in form and contained the following provision:\n'On the nonperformance of this promise or upon the nonpayment of any of the liabilities above mentioned, or upon the failure of the undersigned forthwith, with or without notice, to furnish satisfactory additional securities in case of decline as aforesaid,-then, and in either such case, this note shall forthwith become due and payable, without demand or notice, and full power and authority are hereby given to said holder to sell, assign, and deliver the whole of the said securities, or any part thereof, or any substitutes therefor, or any additions thereto, or any other securities or property given unto or left in the possession of the holder by the undersigned, for safekeeping or otherwise, at any broker's board or at public or private sale, at the option of the said holder, without either demand, advertisement, or notice of any kind, which are hereby expressly waived. At any such sale the said holder may purchase the whole or any part of the property sold, free from any right of redemption on the part of the undersigned, which is hereby waived and released. In case of sale for any cause, after deducting all costs or expenses of every kind for collection, sale, or delivery, the said holder may apply the residue of the proceeds of the sale or sales so made, to pay one or more or all of the said liabilities to it or him as to it or him shall seem proper, whether then due or not due, making proper rebate for interest on liabilities not the d ue, and returning the overplus, if any, to the undersigned, who agree to be and remain liable to the said holder for any deficiency arising upon such sale or sales. The undersigned do hereby \n\n[206 U.S. 28, 30]\n\u00a0\n authorize and empower the said bank (but no other holder) at its option, at any time, to appropriate and apply to the payment and extinguishment of any obligations or liabilities of the undersigned to it, whether now existing or hereafter contracted, any and all moneys now or hereafter in the hands of the said bank, on deposit or otherwise, to the credit of or belonging to the undersigned, whether the said obligations or liabilities are then due or not due.'\n\n Indorsed upon the back of each of these notes and signed by J. M. Mertens & Company and J. M. Mertens appeared the following:\n'In consideration of $1 paid to the undersigned, and of the making, at the request of the undersigned, of the loan evidenced by the within note, the undersigned hereby jointly and severally guarantee to the Varick Bank of New York, N. Y., its successors, indorsers, or assigns the punctual payment, at maturity, of the said loan, and hereby assent to all the terms and conditions of the said note, and consent that the securities for the said loan may be exchanged or surrendered from time to time, or the time of payment of the said loan extended without notice to or further assent from the undersigned, who will remain bound upon this guaranty, notwithstanding such changes, surrender, or extension.'\n\n On the day the petition was filed, Mertens individually was indebted to the bank in the sum of $25,489.62. This indebtedness was upon his guaranty of the five collateral notes, of one of which he was also the maker, the balance being based upon his indorsement of sundry notes of third parties amounting to about $3,000. Mertens individually, to secure the payment of the indebtedness to the bank, pledged to it two policies of insurance upon his life, one for $50,000, No. 417,171, and the other for $ 10,000, No. 252,314. The $50,000 policy was a free tontine policy, issued February 15, 1889, payable to Mertens or his estate, the yearly premium was $1,750, and the tontine dividend period expired Feb- \n\n[206 U.S. 28, 31]\n\u00a0\n ruary 15, 1909. The $10,000 policy was issued December 21, 1882, payable to Jennie Mertens, wife of the insured, but, in the event of her prior death, to the children of the insured, and the annual premium was $272.50. It was a tontine savings policy, and the tontine period was completed December 21, 1902, at which time Mertens, as the insured, withdrew in cash the share of the surplus apportioned to the policy, and continued it in force on the ordinary plan. On March 16, 1901, Jennie Mertens and the children of Jacob and Jennie executed an assignment of the $10,000 policy to the bank. On March 25, 1901, J. M. Mertens joined with his wife in executing a further assignment of the same policy to the bank. March 21, 1901, Mertens individually executed an assignment of the $50,000 policy to the bank. These assignments contained no power of sale. In addition the policies were pledged to the bank under the terms of the collateral notes and agreements of pledge. It appeared from the proofs that the claim against Mertens individually was secured by an individual deposit of Mertens of the sum of $6,000 as collateral, in addition to the policies.\n Obligations aggregating $1,691.93, indorsed by Mertens, had matured and remained unpaid on August 18, and on September 15 obligations aggregating $13,570.47 had matured and remained unpaid, and in the latter amount were included two of the collateral notes for $5,000 each and some $ 3,000 of the notes of third persons, indorsed by Mertens individually.\n On or before September 14, 1903, the two policies were delivered to a duly licensed auctioneer by the attorneys of the bank with instructions to sell the same at public auction at the New York Real Estate Office sales rooms, to the highest bidder, and they were offered for sale and sold to the highest bidder, an agent of the bank, on September 14, the $50,000 policy for the sum of $7,000 and the $10,000 policy for the sum of $3,250. No notice of the sale was given to anyone except the bank. In due time the bank filed with the referee \n\n[206 U.S. 28, 32]\n\u00a0\n in bankruptcy two proofs of claim, one against the copartnership estate aggregating $27,893.85, and another against Mertens for the sum of $9,118. 37. Thereafter the claims were amended. Objections to both were filed by the trustee, alleging in substance that the sales of the policies were illegal; that the value of the securities held by the bank had not been ascertained according to the provisions of the bankruptcy act, and that the trustee still owned the equity.\n No other evidence than appearing above was offered by the trustee on the hearing before the referee under the objections. The referee held, in substance, that the sale of the policies was null and void, and that the value of the securities had not been ascertained according to the provisions of  57h of the bankruptcy act, and refused to allow either claim against the estate or estates. Counsel for the trustee moved for the referee to direct a method by which the security held by the bank should be liquidated, and that in so doing he direct the bank to resell the policies on notice to the trustee. The motion was objected to, but was granted by the referee. The bank petitioned for a review, and the district court of the United States for the northern district of New York on such review approved the referee's rulings. 134 Fed. 101. From the order of the district court the bank appealed to the United States circuit court of appeals for the second circuit. That court, as previously stated, filed its finding of the facts and its conclusions of law, which conclusions of law were as follows:\n'1. That the order made by the referee and by the district court was a rejection of the claims of the Varick Bank.\n\n'2. That the policies in question did not belong to the partnership estate, and that the claim against the partnership should have been allowed in full.\n\n'3. That the sale of the policies, under the facts as stipulated, was a good and valid sale, and passed a good and valid title to said policies to the Varick Bank.\n\n'4. That the value of said policies was properly liquidated \n\n[206 U.S. 28, 33]\n\u00a0\n by said sale under the terms of  57h of the bankruptcy act, and that, under said section, the referee had no power to make the order directing a resale thereof.\n\n'5. That said bankruptcy act did not suspend or enjoin the exercise of said power of sale during the time between the filing of the petition and the adjudication in bankruptcy.\n\n'6. That the claim against the individual estate of Jacob M. Mertens should be allowed in full.\n\n'7. That the burden of proving that said sale was unfair was upon the trustee.'\n\n The order of the district court was reversed and the case remanded with instructions to proceed conformably with the opinion of the circuit court of appeals. 75 C. C. A. 548, 144 Fed. 818. The case was then brought to this court on appeal.\n Messrs. Will B. Crowley and Ceylon H. Lewis for appellant.\n\n\n[206 U.S. 28, 35]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Frederick M. Czaki for appellee. \n\n[206 U.S. 28, 36]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n The errors assigned question the conclusions of law.\n We need spend no time on the objection that the referee's order did not amount to the rejection of the claims. What the referee said was: 'As the proof now stands, I shall, therefore, decline to allow either claim as established against the estate or estates.'\n The district judge recited the action of the referee as disallowing both claims, and entering 'an order prescribing the method for ascertaining the value of such policies,' and concluded: 'The orders of the referee disallowing the claims are approved and affirmed.' 134 Fed. 102, 104. And entered an order accordingly.\n The circuit court of appeals held 'that the order appealed from was, in substance and effect, a rejection of the claims,' and said: 'The bank insisted that its claims were for a definite \n\n[206 U.S. 28, 37]\n\u00a0\n amount, the amount stated in its proofs of debt, less the sumwh ich it had already derived from the sale of the securities. The decision not only disallowed these claims, but left the bank remediless, unless it should consent to allow a different reduction.'\n We think it perfectly clear that the policies did not belong to the partnership estate. They insured the life of J. M. Mertens, and were payable, one to him or his legal representatives, and the other to his wife or children, or to him in the event of their death before his. And they had been assigned to the bank by him individually and the members of his family, as early as March, 1901, as collateral security, as well as by the collateral notes before mentioned. The fact that Mertens individually was the owner was in effect conceded, and the objections to the claims raised no issue in regard to it. That the partnership on some occasion may have pledged the policies in conjunction with Merten's separate individual pledge had no special significance.\n The notes provided that the holder might apply the proceeds of a sale to 'pay one or more or all of the liabilities due it, as it shall deem proper, whether due or not.' And it had the right, according to the settled rule in equity and in courts of bankruptcy, to apply the proceeds of the collateral in extinction of the individual debts. If the sale was a good and valid sale and the value of the policies was properly liquidated thereby, and applied on the individual indebtedness, it follows that the claim against the partnership should have been allowed in full.\n And also the claim against the individual estate of Mertens, for the balance, after deducting the $10,250 and the $6,000.\n The contracts of pledge were made, executed, and to be performed in the state of New York, and the rights of the parties were governed by the law of that state. No preference under the bankruptcy act was alleged or proved, nor was there any allegation or proof that the pledge of the securities was in fraud of the rights of the creditors or trustee. The \n\n[206 U.S. 28, 38]\n\u00a0\n questions of the extent and validity of the pledge were local questions, and the decisions of the courts of New York are to be followed by this court. York Mfg. Co. v. Cassell, \n201 U.S. 344\n, 50 L. ed. 782, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 481; Thompson v. Fairbanks, \n196 \nU.S. 516, 522\n, 49 S. L. ed. 577, 584, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 306; Humphrey v. Tatman, \n198 U.S. 91\n, 49 L. ed. 956, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 567. Here there was an absolute power of sale coupled with an interest. The bank had had both title and possession of the policies for a period of more than two years before the filing of the petition. It had a valid debt against both the copartnership and individual estates, which is not questioned. It could, therefore, make a sale under the power granted, and transfer title in its own name. Numerous decisions of the court of appeals of the state of New York sustain contracts of pledge waiving the right of the pledgeor to exact strict performance of the commonlaw duties of a pledgee. In the absence of fraud, the pledgee may buy at his own sale held without notice or demand or advertisement, when power so to do is expressly granted by the pledgeor. Baker v. Drake, 66 N. Y. 518, 23 Am. Rep. 80; Williams v. United States Trust Co. 133 N. Y. 660, 31 N. E. 29; Toplitz v. Bauer, 161 N. Y. 325, 55 N. E. 1059. And see National Bank v. Baker, 128 Ill. 533, 4 L.R.A. 568, 21 N. E. 510; McDowell v. Chicago Steel Works, 124 Ill. 491, 7 Am. St. Rep. 381, 16 N. E. 854; Farmers' Nat. Bank v. Venner, 192 Mass. 531, 78 N. E. 540.\n It must be remembered that the circuit court of appeals found that there was no fraud in fact in the sale. In respect of that Judge Wallace, delivering the opinion, said:\n'The court below regarded the sale made by the bank as a fraudulent sale. There was no evidence of fraud, unless the facts which have been referred to justify the inference of fraud. We are at a loss to understand how fraudulent conduct can justly be imputed to a pledgee when it appears that whatever was done in executing the power of sale was on e in full compliance with the terms of the pledge, and when there is no evidence that any unconscionable advantage was taken of the pledgeor or his creditors. Doubtless the pledgee cannot avail himself of his authority, however unlimited, to sacrifice the property wantonly, or to purchase \n\n[206 U.S. 28, 39]\n\u00a0\n it himself at a valuation so inadequate as to suggest a fraudulent purpose. If the valuation in this case was unfair, the burden was on the trustee to prove the fact.'\n\n The trustee did not offer to prove that others were prepared to purchase and might have done so but for want of information, or that the policies had a greater value than was realized at the sale, or that he was prepared to redeeom the pledge for the benefit of the estate, nor did he offer to do so. There was nothing in the evidence tending to show a wanton sacrifice or an intention to buy in at so inadequate a price as to justify the inference of a fraudulent purpose.\n Counsel for the trustee contends that the policies were worth more than was obtained at the sale, because the bank's agent, after having borrowed on the strength of the policies the exact amount of his bid immediately after the sale, subsequently borrowed thereon $2,622.75; and also that from the terms of the $50,000 policy it appeared that on the completion of the tontine dividend period, February 15, 1909, the assured had the privilege to withdraw in cash $18,823, and in addition the surplus which might then be apportioned. And counsel called attention in his brief filed herein, February 26, 1907, to the case of Hiscock v. Mertens [\n205 U.S. 202\n, ante, 488, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 488], then pending in this court, as demonstrating that the $50,000 policy was worth more than was realized at the sale. But the $2,622.75 loan covered the next ensuing premiums on the policies with interest; and the $7,000 paid for the $50,000 policy with interest and the premiums of February, 1904, 1905, 1906, 1907, and 1908, with interest, and the last premium, would appear to have aggregated a total cost of $21,346.50; while, if resort could be properly had to the record in another case to piece out the evidence in this, the opinion in Hiscock v. Mertens, decided March 25, \n205 U.S. 202\n, 51 L. ed. 771, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 488, states that the evidence showed that this particular policy had a surrender value of $6,574. And as to the $10,000 policy no suggestion was made that the $3,250 was not a full price or even more, nor could there be in reason, for as Ray, J., said, Re Mertens, 131 Fed. \n\n[206 U.S. 28, 40]\n\u00a0\n 972, it 'had become a simple life policy, payable to the wife of the assured, if living at his death; if not living, to his children, if any; and, in default of child or children, to the personal representatives of the assured. This policy concededly is so conditioned and encumbered, and the interest of the trustee therein, if any, is so remote and uncertain, that it is of no practical value to the estate.' Clearly, there is nothing on the face of the record to justify a charge of fraud on account of inadequacy.\n Section 57h provides: 'The value of securities held by secured creditors shall be determined by converting the same into money according to the terms of the agreement pursuant to which such securities were delivered to such creditors or by such creditors and the trustee, by agreement, arbitration, compromise, or litigation, as the court may direct, and the amount of such value shall be credited upon such claims, and a dividend shall be paid only on the unpaid balance. [30 Stat. at L. 560, chap. 541, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3443.]\n The court was by this subdivision empowered to direct a disposition of the pledge, or the ascertainment of its value, where the parties had failed to do so by their own agreement. It is only when the securities have not been disposed of by the creditor in accordance with his contract that the court may direct what shall be done in the premises. Of course, where there is fraud or a proceeding contrary to the contract, the interposiio n of the court might properly be invoked.\n According to the terms of the bankrupt act, the title of the bankrupt is vested in the trustee by operation of law as of the date of the adjudication. Act of 1898,  70a, e. By the act of 1867 [14 Stat. at L. 522, chap. 176] it was provided that as soon as an assignee was appointed and qualified the judge or register should, by instrument, assign or convey to him all of the property of the bankrupt, and such assignment shall relate back to the commencement of the proceedings in bankruptcy, and, by operation of law, shall vest the title to such estate, both real and personal, in the assignee. But  70a of the act of 1898 omits the provision that the trustee's title 'shall relate back to the com- \n\n[206 U.S. 28, 41]\n\u00a0\n mencement of the proceedings in bankruptcy,' and explicitly states that it shall vest 'as of the date he was adjudged a bankrupt.' When the petition in the present case was filed the bank had a valid lien upon these policies for the payment of its debt. The contracts under which they were pledged were valid and enforceable under the laws of New York, where the debt was incurred and the lien created. The bankruptcy act did not attempt, by any of its provisions, to deprive a lienor of any remedy which the law of the state vested him with; on the other hand, it provided,  67 d: 'Liens given or accepted in good faith, and not in contemplation of, or in fraud upon, this act, and for a present consideration, which have been recorded according to law, if record thereof was necessary in order to impart notice, shall not be affected by this act.'\n Mueller v. Nugent, \n184 U.S. 1\n, 46 L. ed. 405, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 269, is not to the contrary, as explained in York Mfg. Co. v. Cassell, \n201 U.S. 344\n, 50 L. ed. 782, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 481.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","74":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHOME SAV BANK v. CITY OF DES MOINES(1907)\nNo. 82\nArgued: March 5, 1907Decided: April 22, 1907\n\n\n\n\n[205 U.S. 503, 504]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William G. Harvison and Horatio F. Dale for plaintiff in error in No. 82.\n Messrs. Nathaniel T. Guernsey and George F. Henry for plaintiffs in error in Nos. 83 and 92.\n\n\n\n[205 U.S. 503, 506]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William H. Bremner and M. H. Cohen for defendants in error.\n\n\n[205 U.S. 503, 508]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Moody delivered the opinion of the court:\n These cases raise the same Federal question. The plaintiffs in error were banking institutions incorporated under the laws of the state of Iowa. Upon each of them a tax was levied under a law of that state, which provided that 'shares of stock of state and savings banks and loan and trust companies shall be assessed to such banks and loan and trust companies, and not to the individual stockholders.' The material sections of the Code are printed in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[205 U.S. 503, 509]\n\u00a0\n Each bank owned at the time to which the assessment related United States bonds, the value of which they insisted should be deducted from the valuation of the property assessed to them. The taxing authorities refused to make that deduction, and their action was sustained by the supreme court of the state, whose judgment has been brought here by writs of error for review.\n These banks were corporations created by the state of Iowa. In imposing burdens upon them, their property, or their shares, the state does not, as in the case of national banks, require any authority from the United States. Its own governmental power is sufficient for the imposition of such taxes, assessed by such methods, and under such standards of valuation, as it may choose, unless something is done which violates some provision of the Federal Constitution, or of a Federal law which, by that Constitution, is made supreme. The only claim of violation of Federal right which need be considered here is that bonds of the United States have been taxed. It is conceded, and cannot be disputed, that these securities are beyond the taxing power of the state, and the only question, therefore, is whether, in point of fact, the state \n\n[205 U.S. 503, 510]\n\u00a0\n has taxed them. The first step useful in the solution of this question is to ascertain with precision the nature of the tax in controversy, and upon what property it was levied, and that step must be taken by an examination of the taxing law as interpreted by the supreme court of the state. A superficial reading of the law would lead to the conclusion that the tax authorized by it is a tax upon the shares of stock. The assessment is expressed to be upon 'shares of stock of state and savings banks and loan and trust companies.' But the true interpretation of the law cannot rest upon a single phrase in it. All its parts must be considered in the manner pursued by this court in New Orleans v. Houston, \n119 \nU.S. 265, 278\n, 30 S. L. ed. 411, 415, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 198, and Home Ins. Co. v. New York, \n134 U.S. 594\n, 33 L. ed. 1025, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 593, with the view of determining the end accomplished by the taxation, and its actual and substantial purpose and effect. We must inquire whether the law really imposes a tax upon the shares of stock as the property of their owners, or merely adopts the value of those shares as the measure of valuation of the property of the corporation, and by that standard taxes that property itself. The result of this inquiry is of vital importance, because there may be a tax upon the shares of a corporation, which are property distinct from that owned by the corporation, and with a different owner, without an allowance of the exemption due to the property of the corporation itself, while, if the tax is upon the corporation's property, all exemptions due it must be allowed. Looking, then, further into the law, it appears that the shares are to be 'assessed to such banks . . . and not to the individual stockholders.' When this is read the doubt instantly arises whether the law intended to tax the corporation for property which it does not own, but which, on the contrary, is owned by the stockholders. Certainly such a purpose, against common justice and of doubtful constitutionality, ought not to be attributed to the law if any other fair construction is possible. With respect to taxation, usually, if not necessarily, property and its owners are inseparable. Taxes are assessed against persons upon \n\n[205 U.S. 503, 511]\n\u00a0\n the property which they own, not upon property which others own. We should be reluctant to suppose that there has been any departure from this principle in this law. It, however, is not an uncommon, and is an entirely legitimate, method of collecting taxes, to require a corporation, as the agent of its shareholders, to pay in the first instance the taxes upon shares, as the property of their owners, and look to the shareholders for reimbursement. In this very law we have an example of this method. By  1322, national bank shares are assessed to the stockholders, and by  1325 the corporations are made liable to pay the tax and are secured by a lien on the stock and dividends, which may be enforced by sale. The state banking corporations are excluded ex industria from this statutory right of reimbursement by confining it to the cases of 'taxes assessed to the stockholders of such corporation.' This cannot include the case of state bank shares, which are not so assessed. Nor can the corporations in the case at bar have, by any possibility, a common-law right to recover the tax paid from the shareholders. The law imposes no obligation on the shareholder. In paying the tax the corporation has paid its own debt, and not that of others, and there is nothing in such a payment from which the law can imply a promise of reimbursement. These taxes, therefore, are not to be paid by the banks as agents of their stockholders, but as their own debt, and, unless it is supposed that the law requires them to pay taxes upon property which they do not own, the taxes must be regarded as taxes upon the property of the banks. The fair interpretation of the law is that the taxes are upon the property of the banks. In the valuation for taxation the assessor is required to 'take into account the capital, surplus, and undivided earnings,' must be furnished with 'a verified statement of all matters provided by the preceding section,' which, by reference, is seen to be a detailed statement showing the assets of the bank ( 1321).2 It is true that the assessor \n\n[205 U.S. 503, 512]\n\u00a0\n may resort to 'other information he can obtain,' but, although capital, surplus, and undivided earnings are expressly named, nothing is said of the franchise and good will, essential factors of the value of the shares, though not of the value of the assets of the bank. See People ex rel. Union Trust Co. v. Coleman, 126 N. Y. 433, 12 L.R.A. 762, 27 N. E. 818. Moreover, the section closes with the words, 'and the property of such corporation shall not be otherwise assessed,' which plainly implies that the assessment already provided for is, in substance, an assessment upon the property of the corporation. That the law was administered upon the theory that the tax was upon the property of the corporation is signally illustrated by the proceedings in these cases. The valuation was first made on the exact figures of the capital, surplus, and undivided earnings, deducting the holdings of United States securities. Then, upon being advised that the deductions was erroneous, the assessor corrected the val-\n___ 4. The actual value of bonds and stocks of every kind and shares of capital stock or joint stock of other corporations or companies, held as an investment, or in any way representing assets, and the specific kinds and descriptions thereof exempt from taxation;\n\n 5. \nAll other property pertaining to said business, including real estate, which shall be specially listed and valued by the usual description thereof;\n The aggregate actual value of moneys and credits, after deducting therefrom the amount of deposits and of debts owing by such bank, as provided in this chapter, and the aggregate actual value of bonds and stocks after deducting the portion thereof, exempt or otherwise, taxed in this state, and also the other property pertaining to the business, shall be assessed at 25 per cent of the actual value of the same, not including real estate, which shall be listed and assessed as other real estate. \n\n[205 U.S. 503, 513]\n\u00a0\n uation by adding the value of the securities deducted. We therefore conclude that the substantial effect of the law is to require taxation upon the property, not including the franchise, of the banks, and that the value of the shares, ascertained in a manner appropriate to determine the value of the assets, is only the standard or measure by which the taxable valuation of that property is determined. This we think is consistent with the interpretation of the law by the supreme court of Iowa, which sustained the taxation upon grounds which will be presently considered.\n The next question is whether such taxation violates any provision of the Federal Constitution or of any paramount Federal law. The state cannot, by any form of taxation, impose any burden upon any part of the national public debt. The Constitution has conferred upon the government power to borrow money on the credit of the United States, and that power cannot be burdened or impeded or in any way affected by the action of any state. This principle was announced in Weston v. Charleston, 2 Pet. 449, 7 L. ed. 481, where it was held that taxes upon the stock of the United States, levied by one of the municipal corporations of South Carolina, were invalid. From that time no one has questioned the immunity of national securities from state taxation. It may well be doubted whether Congress has the power to confer upon the state the right to tax obligations of the United States. However this may be, Congress has never yet attempted to confer such a right. Until the time of the Civil War it was not thought to be necessary to express the constitutional prohibition in an act of Congress. But, on the occasion of authorizing the issue of Treasury notes, it was enacted that 'all stocks, bonds, and other securities of the United States held by individuals, corporations, or associations within the United States shall be exempt from taxation by or under state authority.' Act of February 25, 1862 (12 Stat. at L. 346, chap. 33, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2480). The substance of this enactment is embodied in  3701 of the Revised Statutes, and has usually, if not \n\n[205 U.S. 503, 514]\n\u00a0\n invariably, since 1862, been inserted in acts authorizing the issue of bonds. That the tax upon the property of a bank in which United States securities are included is beyond the power of the state, and, what perhaps is of lesser moment, within the prohibition of the statutory law, hardly needs to be proved by authority. But the authority is clear and conclusive. With the beginning of the Civil War large amounts of the national securities began to be issued. So important it was to sustain the national credit that, as we have seen, Congress for the first time began the practice of accompanying the authority for their sale with an express prohibition of their taxation by the states. The state banks often invested a large part or the whole of their resources in these securities, and the question of their liability to state taxation on their capital and surplus thus invested at once arose. The Bank of Commerce, incorporated under the laws of New York, invested all its capital, except its investment in real estate, in United States bonds. Under the authority of a law requiring that the capital stock should be assessed at its actual value a tax was levied. The court of appeals of New York sustained the tax so far as it applied to securities issued before the act of 1862, expressly declaring their exemption, and annulled it so far as it applied to securities thereafter issued. The case came here on a writ of error. New York ex rel. Bank of Commerce v. Tax Comrs. 2 Black, 620, 17 L. ed. 451. This court held the tax invalid on all securities, without even alluding to the act of 1862, but basing the decision entirely upon the constitutional inability of a state to affect, by taxation, the exercise of the sovereign power of the nation in borrowing money on its credit. This was the rule specifically declared in Weston v. Charleston, as an application of the general rule of the immunity from state control of the operations of the Federal government in the region of its supremacy. To the argument, which was strenuously urged, that the tax was not upon the securities, but upon the capital of the bank, and that thereby the case was \n\n[205 U.S. 503, 515]\n\u00a0\n distinguished from Weston v. Charleston, the court, by Mr. Justice Nelson, replied: 'We cannot yield our assent to the soundness of the distinction.'\n The state of New York then amended its law, and enacted that banks should be 'liable to taxation on a valuation equal to the amount of capital stock paid in, or secured to be paid in, and their surplus earnings.' The validity of taxation under the amended law was considered in the Bank Tax Case (New York ex rel. Bank of Commonwealth v. Tax & A. Comrs.) 2 Wall. 200, 17 L. ed. 793. There it was insisted that the tax was imposed upon the corporation, and not its property, and that the statute only prescribed a measure of the amount annually to be paid for the franchises. But the court held that the amendment simply changed the method of fixing the amount of capital, and that the tax was upon the capital, which, so far as invested in national securities, was beyond the power of the state.\n The case at bar cannot be distinguished in principle from these cases. In the first case the tax was on the capital stock at its actual value; in the second case on the amount of the capital stock and the surplus earnings; and, in the case at bar, on the shares of the stock, taking into account the capital, surplus, and undivided earnings. It would be difficult for the most ingenious mind and the most accomplished pen to state any distinction between these three laws, except in the manner by which they all sought the same end,-the taxation of the property of the bank. The slight concealment afforded by the omission of the property eo nomine is not sufficient to disguise the fact that, in effect, it is the property which is taxed. If, included in that property, it is discovered that there is some which is entitled by Federal right to an immunity, it is the duty of this court to see that the immunity is respected.\n It is, however, contended that although these cases have not been overruled, distinctions have been drawn in later cases which are applicable here, and withdraw the cases before the court from their authority. These later cases must therefore be considered and their exact affect determined. We \n\n[205 U.S. 503, 516]\n\u00a0\n may quickly put out of view those not relied upon here, in which it has been held that the state may levy a tax upon the value of the franchise of corporations created by it, or upon the right of succession to property on the death of its owner, without first deducting the amount of United States securities owned by the corporation whose franchise is taxed, or by the estate transmitted under the inheritance laws of the state. Society for Savings v. Coite, 6 Wall. 594, 18 L. ed. 897; Provident Inst. v. Massachusetts, 6 Wall. 611, 18 L. ed. 907; Hamilton Mfg. Co. v. Massachusetts, 6 Wall. 632, 18 L. ed. 904; Home Ins. Co. v. New York, \n134 U.S. 594\n, 33 L. ed. 1025, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 593; Plummer v. Coler, \n178 U.S. 115\n, 44 L. ed. 998, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 829. The theory of all these cases is that the taxes are not imposed upon the assets of the corporation or the property of the decedent, but, in the one case, upon the franchise granted by the state, and, in the other case, upon the right of succession to property on the death of the owner which is conferred by the state.\n But another line of cases cannot so easily be dismissed. They were relied upon by the supreme court of Iowa, and the respect due to the opinion of that court demands that the reasons why we think those cases do not apply to the case at bar should be fully stated. These cases relate to the right of the state to tax at their full value shares of stock as the property of the shareholders. Although the states may not, in any form, levy a tax upon United States securities, they may tax, as the property of their owners, the shares of banks and other corporations whose assets consist in whole or in part of such securities, and, in valuing the shares for the purposes of taxation, is not necessary to deduct the value of the national securities held by the corporation whose shares are taxed. The right to tax the shares of national banks arises by congressional authority, but the right to tax shares of state banks exists independently of any such authority, for the state requires no leave to tax the holdings in its own corporations. The right of such taxation rests upon the theory that shares in corporations are property entirely distinct and independent from the property of the corporation. \n\n[205 U.S. 503, 517]\n\u00a0\n The tax on an individual in respect to his shares in a corporation is not regarded as a tax upon the corporation itself. This distinction, now settled beyond dispute, was mentioned in M'Culloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 4 L. ed. 579, where, in the opinion of Chief Justice Marshall declaring a tax upon the circulation of a branch bank of the United States beyond the power of the state of Maryland, it was said that the opinion did not extend 'to a tax imposed on the interest which the citizens of Maryland may hold in this institution, in common with other property of the same description throughout the state.' The distinction appears, however, to have been first made the basis of a decision in Van Allen v. Assessors (Churchill v. Utica), 3 Wall. 573, 18 L. ed. 229. The national bank act, as amended in 1864 [13 Stat. at L. 112, chap. 106] (Rev. Stat.  5219, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3502), permitted the states to include in the valuation of personal property for taxation the shares of national banks 'held by any person or body corporate' under certain conditions not necessary here to be stated. Acting under the authority of this law, the state of New York assessed the shares of Van Allen in the First National Bank of Albany. At that time all the capital of the bank was invested in United States securities, and it was asserted that a tax upon the individual in respect of the shares he held in the bank was, unless the holdings in United States securities were deducted, a tax upon the securities themselves. But a majority of the court held otherwise, saying by Mr. Justice Nelson: 'The tax on the shares is not a tax on the capital of the bank. The corporation is the legal owner of all the property of the bank, real and personal; and, within the powers conferred upon it by the charter, and for the purposes for which it was created, can deal with the corporate property as absolutely as a private individual can deal with his own . . . The interest of the shareholder entitles him to participate in the net profits earned by the bank in the employment of its capital, during the existence of its charter, in proportion to the number of his shares; and, upon its dissolution or termination, to his proportion of the property that may remain of the corporation \n\n[205 U.S. 503, 518]\n\u00a0\n after the payment of its debts. This is a distinct, independent interest or property, held by the shareholder like any other property that may belong to him. Now, it is this interest which the act of Congress has left subject to taxation by the states, under the limitations prescribed.'\n In an opinion in which Justices Wayne and Swayne joined, Chief Justice Chase dissented from the judgment upon the ground that taxation of the shareholders of a corporation in respect of their shares was an actual though an indirect tax on the property of the corporation itself. But the distinction between a tax upon shareholders and one on the corporate property, although established over dissent, has come to be inextricably mingled with all taxing systems, and cannot be disregarded without bringing them into confusion which would be little short of chaos.\n The Van Allen Case has settled the law that a tax upon the owners of shares of stock in corporations, in respect of that stock, is not a tax upon United States securities which the corporations own. Accordingly, such taxes have been sustained by this court, whether levied upon the shares of national banks by virtue of the congressional permission, or upon shares of state corporations by virtue of the power inherent in the state to tax the shares of such corporation. The tax assessed to shareholders may be required by law to be paid in the first instance by the corporations themselves, as the debt and in behalf of the shareholder, leaving to the corporation the right to reimbursement for the tax paid from their shareholders, either under some express statutory authority for their recovery or under the general principle of law that one who pays the debt of another, at his request, can recover the amount from him. First Nat. Bank v. Kentucky, 9 Wall. 353, 19 L. ed. 701; Lionberger v. Rouse, 9 Wall. 468, 19 L. ed. 721; First Nat. Bank v. Chehalis County, \n166 U.S. 440\n, 41 L. ed. 1069, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 629; Merchants' & M. Nat. Bank v. Pennsylvania, \n167 U.S. 461\n, 42 L. ed. 236, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 829; Cleveland Trust Co. v. Lander, \n184 U.S. 111\n, 46 L. ed. 456, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 394. The theory sustaining these cases is that the tax was not upon the corporations' holdings of bonds, but on \n\n[205 U.S. 503, 519]\n\u00a0\n the shareholders' holdings of stock; and an examination of them shows that in every case the tax was assessed upon the property of the shareholders, and not upon the property of the corporation. \n3\n There is nothing in them which justifies the tax under consideration here, levied, as has been shown, on the corporate property. Without further review of the authorities it is safe to say that the distinction established in the Van Allen Case has always been observed by this court, and that, although taxes by states have been permitted which might indirectly affect United States securities, they have never been permitted in any case except where the taxation has been levied upon property which is entirely distinct and independent from these securities. On the other hand, whenever, as in these cases, the tax has been upon the property of the corporation, so far as that property has consisted of such securities, it has been held void.\n One other consideration only needs to be noticed. It is said that where a tax is levied upon a corporation, measured by the value of the shares in it, it is equivalent in its effect to a tax (clearly valid) upon the shareholders in respect of their shares, because, being paid by the bank, the burden falls eventually upon the shareholders in proportion to their holdings. It was upon this view that the lower court rested its opinion. But the two kinds of taxes are not equivalent in law, because the state has the power to levy one, and has not the power to levy the other. The question here is one of power, and not of economics. If the state has not the power to levy this tax, we will not inquire whether another tax, which it might lawfully impose, would have the same ultimate incidence. Precisely the same argument was made and rejected in Owensboro Nat. Bank v. Owensboro, \n173 U.S. 664\n, 43 L. ed. 850, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 537. There it appeared that a tax upon the intangible property of a national bank had been levied under the name of a franchise tax. Such a tax upon one of the agencies of the \n\n[205 U.S. 503, 520]\n\u00a0\n national government is beyond the power of the state. But it was contended that, although the tax was not in form upon shares in the hands of shareholders (a tax lawful by the permission Congress has given), it was the equivalent of such a tax. To this contention the court, by Mr. Justice White, replied: 'To be equivalent in law involves the proposition that a tax on the franchise and property of a bank or corporation is the equivalent of a tax on the shares of stock in the names of the shareholders. But this proposition has been frequently denied by this court, as to national banks, and has been overruled to such an extent in many other cases relating to exemptions from taxation, or to the power of the states to tax, that to maintain it now would have the effect to annihilate the authority to tax in a multitude of cases, and as to vast sums of property upon which the taxing power is exerted in virtue of the decisions of this court holding that a tax on a corporation or its property is not the legal equivalent of a tax on the stock, in the names of the stockholders. . . . If the mere coincidence of the sum of the taxation is to be allowed to frustrate the provisions of the act of Congress, then that act becomes meaningless and the power to enforce it in any given case will not exist. . . . The argument that public policy exacts that where there is an equality in amount between an unlawful tax and a lawful one, the unlawful tax should be held valid, does not strike us as worthy of serious consideration.' These words apply with equal force to the case at bar. Moreover, it may be said that, if given the effect claimed, the consideration that the ultimate burden of the tax is distributed upon the shareholders in proportion to their holdings would have saved the taxes condemned in the Bank of Commerce Case and the Bank Tax Case, and, indeed, all taxes assessed upon the property of corporations, and the immunity from state tax of United States bonds owned by corporations would indirectly be absolutely destroyed.\n We regret that we are constrained to differ with the su- \n\n[205 U.S. 503, 521]\n\u00a0\n preme court of the state on a question relating to its law. But, holding the opinion that the law directly taxes national securities, our duty is clear. If, by the simple device of adopting the with this opinion. of the taxation of the property of the corporation, that property loses the immunities which the supreme law gives to it, then national securities may easily be taxed whenever they are owned by a corporation, and the national credit has no defense against a serious wound.\n Judgments reversed, and cases remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice Harlan, and Mr. Justice Peckham dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 1322. Shares of stock of national banks shall be assessed to the individual stockholders at the place where the bank is located. Shares of stock of state and savings banks and loan and trust companies, shall be assessed to such banks and loan and trust companies, and not to the individual stockholders. At the time the assessment is made, the officers of national banks shall furnish the assessor with a list of all the stockholders and the number of shares owned by each, and he shall list to each stockholder, under the head of corporation stock, the total value of such shares. To aid the assessor in fixing the value of such shares, the corporations shall furnish him a verified statement of all the matters provided in the preceding section, which shall also show, separately, the amount of capital stock, and the surplus and undivided earnings, and the assessor, from such statement and other information he can obtain, including any statement furnished to and information obtained by the auditor of state, which shall be furnished him on request, shall fix the value of such stock, taking into account the capital, surplus, and undivided earnings. In arriving at the total value of the shares of stock of such corporations, the amount of their capital actually invested in real estate, owned by them, shall be deducted from the real value of such shares, and such real estate shall be assessed as other real estate, and the property of such corporations shall not be otherwise assessed.\n Sec. 1325.

Such corporations may recover from each stockholder his proportion of the taxes so paid, and shall have a lien on his stock and unpaid dividends therefor. If the unpaid dividends are not sufficient to pay such tax, the corporation may enforce such lien on the stock by public sale of the same, to be made by the sheriff at the principal office of such corporation in this state, after giving the stockholders thirty days' notice of the amount of such tax and the time and place of sale, such notices to be by registered letter, addressed to the stockholder at his postoffice address, as the same appears upon the books of the company, or is known by its secretary. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Sec. 1321.

NEW YORK COTTON EXCH.(1907)\nNo. 314\nArgued: Decided: April 8, 1907\n\n\n\n\n[205 U.S. 322, 323]\n\u00a0\n This is a bill in equity brought by the New York Cotton Exchange, a New York corporation, against appellant, a citizen of Tennessee, in the circuit court of the United States for the western district of Tennessee, to enjoin him from receiving and using the quotations of sales made upon the exchange. The case is here on questions of jurisdiction, and only a synopsis of the principal facts alleged is necessary.\n The exchange is a private corporation under the laws of New York, with 450 members, and owns in the city of New York a building for the use of its members, and conducts therein, on every business day, cotton sales for present and future delivery, the transfers aggregating many million bales of cotton annually. The purchases and sales for future delivery are permitted to be made and are made only during market hours and by open viva voce bidding, and the knowledge of the prices thus made has become a species of property of such value that telegraph companies pay large sums of money to the exchange for the privilege of receiving instantaneously the quotations, and distributing the same to customers and many persons in the United States who are engaged in the cotton commission business. Such persons are willing to pay and do pay the telegraph companies therefor, and the exchange realizes from the distribution of the quotations through the telegraph companies large sums of money annually. The quotations are such peculiar kind of property that their value depends upon the power of the exchange to confine the transmission and distribution thereof to such telegraph companies and their distributing agencies as will contract therefor with the exchange, and that, if any person or corporation is permitted to promptly acquire the quotations surreptitiously or \n\n[205 U.S. 322, 324]\n\u00a0\n by theft, or without paying the exchange therefor, such person or corporation can promptly give the same to numerous other persons, and the telegraph companies contracting with the exchange would thus be put at a disadvantage in competition with such persons so obtaining the quotations without pay for them, and would thereby be deterred from continuing to pay the exchange the prices provided in the contracts with the telegraph companies. The manner of collecting and distributing the quotations is detailed, and yearly the cost to the exchange, it is alleged, is $4,500. Prior to 1893 the exchange permitted the telegraph companies to gather the quotations through their own employees upon the floor of the exchange building, and to distribute them without any effective restrictions upon the persons entitled thereto, with the result that many persons used the same in conducting so-called 'bucket shops,' by reason thereof the bucket- shop evil assumed such large proportions and became so serious as to materially affect the legitimate transactions upon the floor of the exchange, and its members were deprived of many customers. The exchange therefore found it necessary to terminate such right or license of the telegraph companies, and to that end made contracts with them. The contracts are attached to the bill. It is enough to say of them that under them the companies receive the quotations under the condition not to furnish them to any persons, firms, or corporations who, or which, may be directly or indirectly engaged in the promotion or maintenance of bucket shops or other places where such continuous quotations are used as a basis for bets or other illegal contracts based upon fluctuations of the prices of cotton dealt in on the exchange. Nor shall the companies directly or indirectly furnish the quotations to any person, firm, or corporation, whether members of the exchange or not, until such person, firm, or corporation shall have submitted an application in writing to the exchange in such form as it shall provide, and until it has approved of the application. The exchange has power to revoke its approval. In such event the companies shall cease \n\n[205 U.S. 322, 325]\n\u00a0\n to furnish the quotations, and, if they have installed tickers or wires in the office or place of business of such person, firm, or corporation, they shall immediately remove the same. This, however, they are not required to do, 'or to discontinue service furnished by any other means, which are under restraint by injunctions of the courts during the pendency of the injunction.' In case of an application once approved and afterwards disapproved by the exchange and a suit be commenced against the companies on account of the discontinuance of the quotations, the exchange shall defend such suits at its expense and pay all fines, penalties, etc., to which the companies may be subject. In cases where an application has not been approved by the exchange, suits against the companies for refusal to furnish the quotations shall be defended at the expense of the companies, which shall use diligent efforts to secure the removal of injunctions. If the suit shall be brought against the exchange it shall defend at its own cost. For the purpose of protecting the companies against the use of quotations originating on the exchange by parties not entitled to them the companies may prosecute suits in their own name or that of the exchange to prevent or stop such competitive use.\n The Western Union Telegraph Company has to pay the exchange for the quotations $13,584 per annum in equal instalments of $1,132 at the close of each month. The form of the application is attached to the contract.\n It is alleged that all persons receiving the quotations have made applications in the form set out, except in a few instances, where persons who were receiving quotations from the companies prior to the execution of the contracts have, since the execution thereof, secured temporary injunctions (the exchange not being a party to the suits) to enjoin the companies from withholding or withdrawing the quotations, on the ground that such persons were not required to sign such applications or secure the approval of the exchange.\n The defendant, Clarence P. Hunt (appelant), has not made application to either of the companies or the exchange, nor \n\n[205 U.S. 322, 326]\n\u00a0\n has the exchange consented to his receipt of the quotations. On July 14, 1903, he was receiving from the Western Union Telegraph Company the quotations, and the company on said day notified him of the contract between it and the exchange, and that under said contract the company would be required to and would cease furnishing the quotations. Hunt declined to make an application, but in lieu thereof, on July 31, 1903, filed in the chancery court of Shelby county, Tennessee, a petition against the company to enjoin it from ceasing to furnish him said quotations. An ex parte injunction was issued. The company then filed its answer, and, the cause coming on for final hearing on bill and answer, decree was entered for it. The supreme court of the state reversed the decree without deciding the merits, for the reason that the chancery court should not have decided the cause on bill and answer, but should have awaited the taking of evidence. The cause is now pending and the injunction is still in force, and that by reason thereof only the company is furnishing Hunt the quotations. And it is alleged 'that such authorized receipt and use of said quotations by said defendant is calculated to and in time will, if not entirely stopped, seriously impair the value to your orator of its quotations, and that if even one person within the jurisdiction of this court be allowed to secure such quotations without restrictions as to the use thereof which your orator imposes as aforesaid, such person can furnish them to all the bucket shops and other persons within the United States desiring them, and thus entirely defeat the efforts of your orator to prevent their use in bucket shops as a basis of their illegal bets, and materially impair the right of your orator to derive a revenue from the distribution of said quotations.'\n It is further alleged that there is no adequate remedy at law, and that 'the amount involved and matters in dispute, exclusive of interest and costs, is much more than the sum of $2,000.' An injunction was prayed. A preliminary injunction was issued. 144 Fed. 511. \n\n[205 U.S. 322, 327]\n\u00a0\n The appellant filed a plea to the jurisdiction, traversing the allegations of the bill which averred the jurisdictional amount. A replication to the plea was filed. The court sustained the jurisdiction. The appellant then filed an answer, in which he alleged that the contracts with the telegraph companies were illegal and void, and that the exchange had no right to require the making of applications to it, and no right to require the companies to refuse the quotations to persons applying therefor, because such persons refused to make application to the exchange. He admitted that he had not made an application to the exchange, but had been desirous and even anxious to pay for the use of the quotations and conform to any reasonable rules or regulations, by whomsoever prescribed. He alleged that those stated in the bill were not reasonable, but unjust, oppressive, and illegal. And further, that he commenced business in Memphis as a broker, dealing in cotton, stocks, grain, and provisions, about the month of March, 1898, and made application to the Western Union Telegraph Company, under its designation of the Gold & Stock Telegraph Company, for its quotations by 'ticker.' The application was accepted, he agreeing to pay therefor the sum of $25 per month. He has continued to receive the quotations until the present time, and has built up and has now a considerable business, at great expense and labor, and the value and profits of the business depend largely upon the receipt and use of the quotations 'by and through the 'ticker,' under and in accordance with the contract.' The quotations are received through the 'ticker' automatically,- a specimen of which is attached to the answer,-and the letters and figures are at once put upon a blackboard in his office for reference and use, and are used immediately for the transaction of business. They indicate New York as the place from which the quotations are sent, the time of sending, the month the cotton has been sold for. He has transacted no business except as a broker, as stated, and is duly licensed under the laws of Tennessee. Every transaction made by him as evidenced by a report made to his customers \n\n[205 U.S. 322, 328]\n\u00a0\n upon a form, a copy of which is attached to the answer. The report evidences the consummation of the contract, and has upon it the following:\n'All orders for the purchase or sale of any article are received and executed with the distinct understanding that actual delivery is contemplated where order is executed, and that the party giving the order so understands and agrees.'\n\n Shortly after July 14, 1903, he was informed that the exchange had required the telegraph company to cancel its contract with him, and to take the ticker out of his office, and to cease to furnish to him the quotations; thereupon he and other persons similarly engaged in business of broker commenced in the chancery court of Shelby county the suit mentioned in the bill. The record and proceedings in the suit are referred to as part of the answer. The bill in that suit prayed an injunction against the telegraph company from removing the ticker or refusing to furnish the quotations as long as the company furnished them to any other person. A preliminary injunction was granted. The Western Union Telegraph Company, the defendant in the suit, answered, and based its defense substantially upon its contract with the exchange. Hunt, upon the authority of such contract, and upon information and belief, averred that the answer was so filed by the company at the request, and by the direction, and for the benefit, of the exchange, 'and with the view and for the purpose of asserting and setting up for him, and in his belief, the very same matters and grounds and causes of action as are set up and relied upon in this suit.' Upon the hearing the injunction was discharged and the court dismissed. The decree was reversed by the supreme court of the state and the injunction continued in force. The opinion of the supreme court is made part of the answer. It appears therefrom that the court considered that a serious question was presented by the defense of the contracts between the telegraph companies and the exchange. It was said upon the defense two questions arose,-one of fact, whether the contracts were made; \n\n[205 U.S. 322, 329]\n\u00a0\n the other of law, whether, conceding the existence of the contracts, did 'they furnish a sufficient answer to the demands of the complainants.' The court declined to pass upon either question, regarding the record imperfect. The court continued the injunction.\n The suit is still pending in the chancery court, and, by reason of his contract with the company of May 1, 1899, and the injunction, Hunt has remained in the use and enjoyment of the ticker, 'and is receiving, and the Western Union Telegraph Company has been and is furnishing him, the continuous quotations described in the bill and in this answer.' And it is averred that that suit embraces the same questions of fact and law as this present suit and is between the same parties plaintiff and defendant, and the decree to be pronounced will adjudicate and dispose of the same matters of controversy. That suit is relied on as a bar to the present one, and it is insisted that the circuit court had no jurisdiction to grant or issue the injunction prayed for, as 'it would require and compel the violation and breach of the injunction granted and in force in the chancery court of Shelby county, and the undoing of what has been done and is to be done in the course of the said suit.' The other allegations of the answer are not material to the question now involved. A replication to the answer was filed. The case was submitted on the pleadings and exhibits, agreement of counsel as to certain paragraphs of the bill, evidence taken before the court, which consisted of the record of the suit in Shelby county, and testimony of witnesses. It was decreed that a permanent injunction issue restraining Hunt in accordance with the prayer of the bill. Extracts from the testimony will appear in the opinion of the court.\n Messrs. Thomas B. Turley and William H. Carroll for appellant.\n\n\n[205 U.S. 322, 331]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Henry S. Robbins, Henry W. Taft, and Henry Craft for appellee.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice McKenna:\n\n\n[205 U.S. 322, 333]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna, after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the court:\n It will be observed that this case is like the Board of Trade v. Christie Grain & Stock Co. \n198 U.S. 236\n, 46 L. ed. 1031, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 637, and we therefore start with some propositions established. It is established that the quotations are property and are entitled to the protection of the law, and that the exchange 'has the right to keep the work which it has done, or paid for doing, to itself.' It is, however, contended by appellant that the controversy about them that this suit presents does not involve the value of $2,000, exclusive of interest and costs. This is the issue presented by the plea to the jurisdiction. Appellant contends that the value involved is measured by his contract with the telegraph company. The exchange contends that the matter in dispute is the value of the object sought to be accomplished by the bill. The circuit court expressed it to be 'the value of the contract between the New York Cotton Exchange and the Western Union Telegraph Company.'\n On the issue presented by the plea the burden of proof was upon the appellant, and he was required to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the amount involved was less than the jurisdictional amount. Sheppard v. Graves, 14 How, 505, 14 L. ed. 518; Wetmore v. Rymer, \n169 U.S. 115\n, 42 L. ed. 682, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 293; Gage v. Pumpelly, \n108 U.S. 164\n, 27 L. ed. 668, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 390; Adams v. Shirk, 55 C. C. A. 25, 117 Fed. 801. The only evidence offered by him was his contract with the telegraph company in connection with evidence of the manner of his receipt and use of the quotations. This testimony was to the effect that the quotations are communicated through a ticker, which is a machine with a tape attached to it, that registers the price of cotton, giving the hour. They come sometimes \n\n[205 U.S. 322, 334]\n\u00a0\n not more than a quarter of a minute or a half of a minute apart, and are copied from the tape and placed upon a blackboard, where all can see them. When new quotations are received the old ones are generally wiped out. The 'ticker service is very slow, and the value of it depends on the time it is received. After it is put upon the blackboard it becomes public property, so far as concerns the value of it.' And it was testified that a firm by the name of Ganong & Fitzgerald received their quotations about five minutes before appellant, they having better wire service. And also that there was a wire running into the Memphis Cotton Exchange, and that not quite a minute elapsed from the time the ticker registers the market quotations to the time they are registered on the blackboard in the city of Memphis and open to the public. Appellant testified that the amount of his business in cotton for future delivery amounted to one half million dollars per year, and when he took a trade himself he was prepared to deliver the cotton or commodity in conformity with the agreement between himself and his customer, and goes so far as to write across all orders that actual delivery is contemplated and understood.\n A witness on the part of the exchange testified that he was employed by the board of trade as expert to investigate persons who pretended to be brokers, 'but who were in fact bucket shops,' and was in that position for several years, gathered statistics, made estimates of the volume of business during 1901 and 1902, and has kept pretty well informed ever since as to the number of bucket shops in the United States. And he further testified that trades are carried on in such shops in all commodities that are traded in on the New York Cotton Exchange, New York Stock Exchange, and the Chicago Board of Trade. Of the value of the right of the New York Cotton Exchange to control the distribution of its quotation he said: 'One can only estimate or approximate the value of the right, for the reason that the volume of speculative business in the country changes, and that changes the value of the right. If there is a large volume of speculative business \n\n[205 U.S. 322, 335]\n\u00a0\n in cotton the value to the New York Cotton Exchange would probably amount to a million dollars, while with a depressed market it would not amount to more than $200,000 or $300,000.' And this is the amount per year.\n A superintendent of the exchange testified to his familiarity in a general way with what is called the independent trader, or independent trade, as distinguished from the trade or traders who carry their transactions to the cotton exchanges of the country, and in a measure with the volume of business done by such persons in an approximate way.\n He further testified that the amount of business thus diverted from the exchange made a difference to the exchange of fully $1,000,000 a year, and that the value of the right to control the distribution of the quotations in the manner set out in the bill would very much exceed $2,000.\n The witness was unable to state the relative amount of business done on the exchange in the years 1903, 1904, and 1905, because there was no record of the transactions kept, but he reached the conclusion in regard to the value of the business diverted from the exchange partly from the evidence given by appellee and partly as to the business done by the bucket shops. And he put the value 'in dollars and cents,' of the contract between the exchange and the telegraph company, independent of the amount of business diverted, at the amount the exchange received from the telegraph company. The following colloquy took place between the witness and counsel for appellant:\n Q. Now, Mr. King, what time, up to this good moment and hour, has that exchange failed to receive the amount of that contract, that is, for giving the Western Union Telegraph Company the right to furnish this information gathered on the floor of the New York Cotton Exchange?\n A. It has not.\n Q. Then, in short, this here is nothing except fear and apprehension that unless these defendants are restrained that is likely to happen, and affect the value of the contract? \n\n[205 U.S. 322, 336]\n\u00a0\n A. And the business upon the exchange.\n It is manifest that the injury to the exchange is not the rate paid by the appellant to the telegraph company. The purpose of the suit is to enjoin the appellant from receiving, using, or selling, directly or indirectly, the exchange's quotations, or permitting or maintaining any wire to his office over which the quotations are passing, or distributing the quotations, until he shall have acquired the right to receive them, either by contract of purchase from the exchange, or, with its consent and approval, from one of the telegraph companies authorized to distribute them. In other words, the object of the suit is to keep the control of the quotations by the exchange and its protection from the competition of bucket shops or the identity of its business with that of bucket shops. And the right to the quotations was declared, as we said in Board of Trade v. Christie Grain & Stock Co., to be property, and the exchange may keep them to itself or communicate them to others. The object of this suit is to protect that right. The right, therefore, is the matter in dispute, and its value to the exchange determines the jurisdiction, not the rate paid by appellant to the telegraph company. The value of the right was testified to be much greater than $2,000. In Mississippi & M. R. Co. v. Ward, 2 Black, 485, 17 L. ed. 311, it was decided that jurisdiction is tested by the value of the object to be gained by the bill. To the same effect is Board of Trade v. Cella Commission Co. 145 Fed. 28. In the latter suit the Chicago Board of Trade obtained a decree restraining the use of its continuous quotations by the Cella Commission Company. It was said that the amount or value of such right is not the sum a complainant might recover in an action at law for the damage already sustained, nor is he required to wait until it reaches the jurisdictional amount. The latter declaration is supported by Scott v. Donald, \n165 U.S. 107\n, 41 L. ed. 648, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 262.\n Counsel for appellant do not deny that jurisdiction is determinable by the object sought to be accomplished by the bill, \n\n[205 U.S. 322, 337]\n\u00a0\n but they assert that the value of that was speculative, and changed with the volume of business. Counsel lay great stress on the testimony of the superintendent of the exchange, to the effect that the value of the contract between the exchange and the telegraph company, independent of the business diverted from the exchange, is, in dollars and cents, the amount it receives from the telegraph company. Upon this testimony counsel assert the right claimed by the exchange to be the narrow one of preventing the appellant from receiving the continuous quotations from the telegraph company, which he pays for, pending a litigation in the state courts, and this distinguishes the case from the Board of Trade v. Christie Grain & Stock Co. and contend that the jurisdictional amount has not been established, as the telegraph company is fulfilling its contract with the exchange. Of the latter contention we have sufficiently indicated our view, and it is only necessary to add that because the value of the quotations to the exchange varies with the volume of business does not impair the effect of the testimony that the value of its right to control them is 'much greater than $2,000.' We cannot concur in the conclusion urged by appellant, that this case is distinguishable in principle from Board of Trade v. Christie Grain & Stock Co., either in the right asserted or in the defense against it. Even if the cases were distinguishable, it might still be contended, that would be of no consequence in determining the jurisdictional amount of the matter in dispute. But we will consider the difference claimed to exist between the cases. In the Christie Case, it is contended, the right asserted was 'to prevent getting at the knowledge of a trade secret or the quotations of the market surreptitiously, and using the knowledge so obtained,' and that, it is insisted, was the matter in controversy. 'Here,' it is said, 'there is no violation of a duty or trust. The market quotations are not received surreptitiously. The appellant is not depriving the appellee of the protection of the law.' In the Christie Case the quotations were gotten and published, 'in some way not \n\n[205 U.S. 322, 338]\n\u00a0\n disclosed,' but, it was said, as the defendants did not get them from the telegraph companies authorized to distribute them, had declined to sign contracts satisfactory to the plaintiff (board of trade), and denied the plaintiff's rights altogether, it was a reasonable conclusion that they got, and intended to get, their knowledge in a way which was wrongful. This, however, was not said to limit plaintiff's right, but to express a violation of it. The right was clearly defined to be, the right of the board of trade to keep the quotations to itself or communicate them to others. And this is also the right of the exchange in the case at bar. It can be violated not only by getting the quotations surreptitiously or 'in some way not disclosed,' or by getting them from a person forbidden to communicate them.\n The next contention of appellant is that the court had no jurisdiction to grant the injunction and pronounce the decree appealed from. The only question involved in this branch of the case, appellant says, is 'whether it comes within the provision of the Revised Statutes,  720, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 581, which is to the effect that no writ of injunction shall be granted by a court of the United States to stay proceedings of any court except in matters of bankruptcy.'\n And appellant insists that this suit necessarily offends that section, because under its decree he 'cannot have the benefit of the judgment of the state court without being in contempt of the Federal court,' and that he is restrained by the circuit court from receiving from the telegraph company what the company is forbidden to refuse him by the state court. To sustain his contention appellant cites United States v. Parkhurst Davis Mercantile Co. \n176 U.S. 317\n, 44 L. ed. 485, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 423, and cases there referred to. Also Diggs v. Wolcott, 4 Cranch, 179, 2 L. ed. 587; Watson v. Jones, 13 Wall. 679, 20 L. ed. 666; Dial v. Reynolds, \n96 U.S. 340\n, 24 L. ed. 644; Central Nat. Bank v. Stevens, \n169 U.S. 433\n, 42 L. ed. 807, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 403. These cases do not sustain his contention. In Central Nat. Bank v. Stevens it was decided that a state court had no power to enjoin a party whose rights had been adjudged by a circuit court of \n\n[205 U.S. 322, 339]\n\u00a0\n the United States from proceeding with a sale of property under a decree of that court. In the other cases cited, except Watson v. Jones, the purpose was to directly enjoin parties from proceeding in the state courts. In Watson v. Jones was considered what identity of parties, rights, and relief prayed for was necessary to enable the pendency of an action in one court to be pleaded in bar in another court, and it was said: 'The identity in these particulars should be such that, if the pending case had already been disposed of, it could be pleaded in bar as a former adjudication of the same matter between the same parties.' The principle was also expressed in that case, and sustained by authorities, that the possession of property by one court cannot be interfered with by another, and, that the act of Congress of March 2, 1793 (1 Stat. at L. 334, chap. 22,  5), (now  720 of the Revised Statutes of the United States [U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 581]), as construed in Diggs v. Wolcott, supra, and Peck v. Jenness, 7 How. 625, 12 L. ed. 846, is equally conclusive against any injunctions from the circuit court, forbidding the defendants in the case to take possession of property which an unexecuted decree of a state court required the marshal to deliver to them. The case at bar has not that feature, nor has it identity with the case in the chancery court of Shelby county. Its parties and purposes are different. The pendency of a suit in a state court does not deprive a Federal court of jurisdiction. Gordon v. Gilfoil, \n99 U.S. 168\n, 25 L. ed. 383; Mutual L. Ins. Co. v. Brune, \n96 U.S. 588\n, 24 L. ed. 737; Stanton v. Embrey, \n93 U.S. 548\n, 23 L. ed. 983; Merritt v. American Steel-Barge Co. 24 C. C. A. 530, 49 U. S. App. 85, 79 Fed. 228; Bank of Kentucky v. Stone, 88 Fed. 383.\n The Circuit Court had jurisdiction, and its decree is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","76":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHUNTER v. CITY OF PITTSBURGH(1907)\nNo. 264\nArgued: Decided: November 18, 1907\n\n\n\n A law of the state of Pennsylvania provides for the union of cities which are contiguous or in close proximity, by the annexation of the lesser to the larger. The parts of that law material to this decision follow:\n'Sec. 1. Be it enacted, etc., that wherever in this common- \n\n[207 U.S. 161, 162]\n\u00a0\n wealth, now or hereafter, two cities shall be contiguous or in close proximity to each other, the two, with any intervening land other than boroughs, may be united and become one by annexing and consolidating the lesser city and the intervening land other than boroughs, if any, with the greater city, and thus making one consolidated city, if, at an election, to be held as hereinafter provided, there shall be a majority of all the votes cast in favor of such union.\n\n'Sec. 2. The councils of either of said cities may, by ordinance, direct that a petition be filed in the court of quarter sessions of the county in which such cities are situate, or 2 per centum of the registered voters of either of said cities may present their petition to said court, praying that the two cities and any intervening land other than boroughs shall be united and become one city. Thereupon the said petition shall be filed; and the court shall fix a time for the hearing thereof, not more than twenty days thereafter, and direct that notice be given to the mayor or chief executive officer of each of the said cities, and the clerk of the councils of each of said cities, and by publication in one or more newspapers published in either of said cities, and such other notice as the court may deem proper, including notice to one or more of the officers of whatever may be the municipal subdivision of the state in which any intervening land other than boroughs may lie.\n\n ... * *\n'Sec. 4. Any person interested may file exceptions to said petition prior to the day fixed for hearing. At such hearing any person in interest shall be heard; but if the court shall find that the petition and proceedings are regular and in conformity with this act, it shall order an election to be held in the said cities, to vote for or against the proposed consolidation, at which all the legal voters of either of said cities, and of the said intervening land, if any, shall be qualified to vote.\n\n ... * *\n'Sec. 7. If it shall appear by the vote, when computed and certified as aforesaid, that a majority of all the lawful voters of the two cities and the intervening land, voting \n\n[207 U.S. 161, 163]\n\u00a0\n upon such question, have voted in favor of the annexation or consolidation, the said court of quarter sessions shall enter a decree annexing and consolidating the lesser city, and any intervening land other than boroughs, with the greater city, so that they form but one city, and in the name of the greater or larger city.\n\n'Sec. 8. Each of the constituent cities, and the intervening land, if any, so consolidated, shall pay its own floating and bonded indebtedness and liabilities of every kind, and the interest thereon, as the same existed at the time of annexation; and the councils of the consolidated city shall levy, respectively, on the properties in each of the said cities and intervening land so consolidated, and as they existed at the time of annexation, a tax sufficient to provide funds for each to pay its own floating and bonded indebtedness and liabilities and interest, as the same may accrue. The court of quarter sessions is given jurisdiction to ascertain what the bonded and floating indebtedness, and liabilities, and properties, and assets of each of the said cities and the said intervening land may be; due notice being given and an opportunity to be heard being allowed to all parties in interest.\n\n'Sec. 9. All the citizens of each of the united cities and of the intervening land shall be entitled to, and shall enjoy and exercise, full rights of citizenship in the said enlarged and consolidated city. All the rights of creditors and all liens and all the rights of the constituent cities and the government of the intervening land, to enforce the payment of moneys due either, or of contract liabilities, or of other claims or rights of property, existing in either city or in the government of the intervening land at the time of the annexation, shall be preserved unimpaired to each; and each of the said cities and the government of the intervening land, for the purpose of enforcing its rights and claims in the premises, and also of having prior rights and claims enforced against it, shall be deemed in law to continue in existence. \n\n[207 U.S. 161, 164]\n\u00a0\n 'Except as herein otherwise provided, all the property, real, personal, and mixed, and rights and privileges of every kind, vested in or belonging to either of said cities or to the intervening land prior to and at the time of the annexation, shall be vested in and owned by the consolidated or united city.\n\n ... * *\n'All moneys accruing from time to time from delinquent taxes prior to the annexation, and all assessments against private property for public improvements for which the contractors shall have been paid, shall be applied to the indebtedness of the city to which the same shall belong. In case of annexation, the court may appoint commissioners to ascertain the floating and bonded indebtedess of each of the said municipal subdivisions, at the time of annexation, including the share of the municipal indebtedness for which any intervening land may be liable, and also an account of all property, of every kind, owned or claimed by the cities, or the share of the intervening land to any property owned by the municipal subdivision of the state of which it is a part, prior to and at the time of annexation. The court may also order an account to be taken by the said commissioners of all moneys on hand or receivable, applicable to the payment of the floating or bonded indebtedness of the respective municipalities or of the intervening land, at the date of annexation. Such money shall be, respectively, applied in payment of the floating or bonded indebtedness of the respective municipalities or of the intervening land.\n\n ... * *\n'After the commissioners have made report, the court shall, by its decree, fix the said indebtendness and liabilities, and also the properties and assets, of all kinds, at the time of the annexation, belonging to each territory, united in the consolidation.'\n\n The city of Pittsburgh, under the provision of this act, filed in the court of quarter sessions of Allegheny county a petition asking for the union of the city of Allegheny with the city of \n\n[207 U.S. 161, 165]\n\u00a0\n Pittsburgh. The plaintiffs in error (except the city of Allegheny) seasonably filed exceptions to the petition under  4 of the act. The parts of the exceptions material here are as follows:\n'1st. That they are residents and citizens, voters, taxpayers, and owners of real estate and personal property within the city of Allegheny, county of Allegheny, and state of Pennsylvania.\n\n'4th. That the population of the city of Pittsburgh by the census of 1900 was 321,616 and that it has now a population of at least 350,000. That there were polled at the last mayoralty election in the said city, on February 20th, 1906, about 62,000 votes in round numbers.\n\n'That the population of the city of Allegheny, by the census of 1900, was 129,896, and that it is probably about 150,000 at the present time; that there were polled at the last mayoralty election in the said city, on February 20th, 1906, about 24,000 votes in round numbers.\n\n'6th. The city of Allegheny has improved its streets, established its own system of electric lighting; and has established a satisfactory water supply. The city of Pittsburgh is largely in debt; has established large and extensive parks in the eastern part of the city; built expensive and costly boulevards; extensive and costly reservoirs for the supply of wateer; and is contemplating still greater expenditures of money in the cutting down and grading of the elevation of Fifth avenue, known as the hump; and the construction of an extensive filtration plant; and a large expenditure of money in the purchase of the Monongahela Water Company platn,-a plant owned by a private corporation; and the further expensive construction of an electric light plant to be owned by the city of Pittsburgh, the said city owning at the present time no light plant, it being supplied with light from a private corporation; and the further expenditure of various sums of money for the acquirement of advantages and property which the citizens of Allegheny now practically own and enjoy but which the \n\n[207 U.S. 161, 166]\n\u00a0\n citizens of Pittsburgh do not, and to acquire which would largely increase the indebtedness of the city of Pittsburgh, and if the city of Allegheny should be annexed to the city of Pittsburgh, the taxpayers of Allegheny, including your respondents, will, in addition to the payment of the taxes necessary to pay and liquidate their own indebtedness, have to bear and pay their proportion of the new indebtedness that must necessarily be created to acquire the facilities, properties, and improvements, herein stated, in Pittsburgh; all of which would be of no benefit to the citizens and taxpayers of Allegheny, including your respondents, who now own and possess these advantages and privileges; and which will largely and unnecessarily increase the taxes of your respondents, as well as the taxes of the other citizens of Allegheny, without any material benefit to them whatever.\n\n'12th. The act of assembly under which this petition is filed for the annexation of the city of Allegheny to the city of Pittsburgh is in conflict with article 1,  9, 10, of the Constitution of the United States, in that it impairs the obligations of the contract existing between the city of Allegheny and your respondents, by which they are to be taxed only for the government of the city of Allegheny, and for improvements, repairs, and expenditures incidental to the government of the said city of Allegheny, and the attempt to subject them to the increased taxes and burdens of an additional or enlarged city government, by legislation, is in violation of said article 1,  9, 10, of the Constitution of the United States, and therefore is unconstitutional.\n\n'13th. The act of general assembly under which this petition is filed is in conflict with article 5 of the Amendments of the Constitution of the United States, because if the city of Allegheny shall be annexed in pursuance of the petition filed in this case, it will be depriving your respondents of their property without due process of law, and is therefore unconstitutional. Said annexation of the city of Allegheny to the city of Pittsburgh will add additional taxes to the property \n\n[207 U.S. 161, 167]\n\u00a0\n of your respondents, and create additional burdens without compensation, and will depreciate the value of the property of your respondents, and they, therefore, will be deprived of their property, in violation of said article 5 of the Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.\n\n'14th. The act of assembly under which this petition is filed is in conflict with article 14 of the Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, because the said annexation of the city of Allegheny to the city of Pittsburgh deprives your respondents of their property without due process of law. The additional taxes and burdens which he property of your respondents will have to bear in case the annexation takes place will cause a large depreciation in the value of the property of your respondents.\n\n'22d. The act of the general assembly under which these proceedings are had is in violation of the law of the land, it being unfair, unjust, and unequal; and is in conflict with the rights and privileges reserved by the people to themselves, in that it permits the qualified electors of the larger city to overpower or outnumber those of the lesser city, and to annex the lesser city without the vote or consent of a majority of the qualified electors of the lesser city.'\n\n The city of Pittsburgh filed an answer to the exceptions, admitting some of the allegations contained therein and denying others. As nothing turns here upon the answer, it need not be set forth. Thereupon there was a hearing in the case. No evidence on the issues of fact raised by the exceptions and the answer thereto was introduced, and no decision upon those issues was made. The court 'dismissed' the exceptions, and ordered an election to be held as prayed for in the petition. At the election a majority of all the voters of the two cities voted in favor of the consolidation. It is agreed that the majority of the voters of the city of Allegheny voted against the consolidation, but that majority was overcome by a larger majority of the voters of city of Pittsburgh in favor of the consolidation. The result of the election duly appearing to the \n\n[207 U.S. 161, 168]\n\u00a0\n court of quarter sessions, that court thereupon decreed that the two cities should be consolidated. The case was then taken by writ of error to the superior court of Pennsylvania, and the error assigned was the dismissal of the exceptions. In that court the city of Allegheny, on its petition, was permitted 'to intervene and become one of the appellants in said proceedings.' The superior court overruled the assignments of error and affirmed the decree. Thereupon the same assignments of error were made in the supreme court of Pennsylvania, where the case was taken by writ of error. That court dismissed the assignments of error, affirmed the decree, and refused a motion for rehearing. A writ of error was then allowed by a justice of this court. The assignments in this court are as follows:\n'First. The supreme court of the state of Pennsylvania erred in dismissing the fourth assignment of error of the plaintiffs in error, which is as follows:\n\n\"The act of the general assembly under which these proceedings are had is in violation of the law of the land, it being unfair, unjust, and unequal; and is in conflict with the rights and privileges reserved by the people to themselves, in that it permits the qualified electors of the larger city to overpower and outnumber those of the lesser city, and to annex the lesser city without the vote or consent of a majority of the qualified electors of the lesser city.'\n\n'Second. The supreme court of the state of Pennsylvania erred in dismissing the fifth assignment of error of the plaintiffs in error, which is as follows:\n\n\"The act of assembly under which this petition is filed for annexing of the city of Allegheny to the city of Pittsburgh is in conflict with article 1,  9, 10, of the Constitution of the United States, in that it impairs the obligations of the contract existing between the city of Allegheny and your respondents, by which they are to be taxed only for the government of the city of Allegheny and for improvements, repairs, and expenditures incidental to the government of said \n\n[207 U.S. 161, 169]\n\u00a0\n city of Allegheny, and the attempt to subject them to the increased taxes and burdens of an additional or enlarged city government, by legislation, is in violation of article 1,  9, 10, of the Constitution of the United States, and therefore is unconstitutional.'\n\n'Third. The supreme court of the state of Pennsylvania erred in dismissing the sixth assignment of error of the plaintiffs in error, which is as follows:\n\n\"The act of general assembly under which this petition is filed is in conflict with article 5 of the Amendments of te Constitution of the United States, because, if the city of Allegheny shall be annexed in pursuance of the petition filed in this case, it will be depriving your respondents of their property without due process of law, and is therefore unconstitutional. Said annexation of the city of Allegheny to the city of Pittsburgh will add additional taxes to the property of your respondents, and create additional burdens without compensation, and will depreciate the sale of the property, in violation of said article 5 of the Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and they, therefore, will be deprived of their property.'\n\n'Fourth. The supreme court of the state of Pennsylvania erred in dismissing the seventh assignment of error of the plaintiffs in error, which is as follows:\n\n\"The act of assembly under which this petition is filed is in conflict with article 14 of the Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, because the said annexation of the city of Allegheny to the city of Pittsburgh deprives your respondents of their property without due process of law. The additional taxes and burdens which the property of your respondents will have to bear in case the annexation takes place will cause a large depreciation in value of the property of your respondents.'\n\n'Fifth. The supreme court of the state of Pennsylvania erred in not holding that the act of the general assembly of Pennsylvania, approved February 7, A. D. 1906, entitled 'An \n\n[207 U.S. 161, 170]\n\u00a0\n Act to Enable Cities That Are Now, or May Hereafter Be, Contiguous or in Close Proximity, to be United, with Any Intervening Land Other Than Boroughs, in One Municipality; Providing for the Consequences of Such Consolidation, the Temporary Government of the Consolidated City, Payment of the Indebtedness of Each of the United Territories, and the Enforcement of Debts and Claims Due to or from Each,' was special or local legislation, and in conflict with article 3,  7, subd. 2, of the Constitution of the state of Pennsylvania, which constitutional provision provides that 'the general assembly shall not pass any local or special law . . . regulating the affairs of counties, cities, townships, wards, boroughs, or school districts,' and the said act of assembly, being in conflict with said provision of the Constitution of the state of Pennsylvania, is not due process of law, and therefore is in conflict with the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n\n'Sixth. The supreme court of the state of Pennsylvania erred in not holding that the said act of assembly, entitled as aforesaid, was passed at an extraordinary or special session of the legislature, convened by the governor of Pennsylvania under article 4,  12, of the Constitution of Pennsylvania, which provides that the governor may, on extraordinary occasions, convene the general assembly; and that the subject of the said legislation or act of assembly, aforesaid, was not designated in the proclamation of the governor calling such a session, or in the paper or proclamation issued by him dated January 9, 1906, and is therefore in conflict with article 3,  25, of the Constitution of Pennsylvania, which provides that 'when the general assembly shall be convened in special session, there shall be no legislation upon subjects other than those designated in the proclamation of the governor calling such session,' and that the said act of assembly is, by reason thereof, not due process of law, and is in conflict with the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.\n\n'Seventh. The supreme court of Pennsylvania erred in \n\n[207 U.S. 161, 171]\n\u00a0\n dismissing the exceptions filed by the plaintiffs in error, therby confirming the judgment of the court below.\n\n'Eighth. The supreme court of Pennsylvania erred in not entering judgment in favor of the plaintiffs in error, and not reversing the judgment of the court below.'\n\n\n\n Messrs. William A. Stone and John G. Johnson for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n[207 U.S. 161, 173]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. D. T. Watson, W. B. Rodgers, J. Rodgers McCreery, and John M. Freeman for defendant in error. \n\n[207 U.S. 161, 174]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Moody, after making the foregoing statement of the case, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The plaintiffs in error seek a reversal of the judgment of the supreme court of Pennsylvania, which affirmed a decree of a lower court, directing the consolidation of the cities of Pittsburgh and Allegheny. This decree was entered by authority of an act of the general assembly of that state, after proceedings taken in conformity with its requirements. The act authorized the consolidation of two cities, situated with reference to each other as Pittsburgh and Allegheny are, if, upon an election, the majority of the votes cast in the territory comprised within the limits of both cities favor the consolidation, even though, as happened in this instance, a majority \n\n[207 U.S. 161, 175]\n\u00a0\n of the votes cast in one of the cities oppose it. The procedure prescribed by the act is that after a petition filed by one of the cities in the court of quarter sessions, and a hearing upon that petition, that court, if the petition and proceedings are found to be regular and in conformity with the act, shall order an election. If the election shows a majority of the votes cast to be in favor of the consolidation, the court 'shall enter a decree annexing and consolidating the lesser city . . . with the greater city.' The act provides, in considerable detail, for the effect of the consolidation upon the debts, obligations, claims, and property of the constituent cities; grants rights of citizenship to the citizens of those cities in the consolidated city; enacts that 'except as herein otherwise provided, all the property . . . and rights and privileges . . . vested in or belonging to either of said cities . . . prior to and at the time of the annexation shall be vested in and owned by the consolidated or united city,' and establishes the form of government of the new city. This procedure was followed by the filing of a petition by the city of Pittsburgh; by an election, in which the majority of all the votes cast were in the affirmative, although the majority of all the votes cast by the voters of Allegheny were in the negative; and by a decree of the court, uniting the two cities.\n Prior to the hearing upon the petition the plaintiffs in error, who were citizens, voters, owners of property, and taxpayers in Allegheny, filed twenty-two exceptions to the petition. These exceptions were disposed of adversely to the exceptants by the court of quarter sessions, and the action of that court was successively affirmed by the superior and supreme courts of the state. The case is here upon writ of error, and the assignment of errors alleges that eight errors were committed by the supreme court of the state. This assignment of errors is founded upon the dispositions by the state courts of the questions duly raised by the filing of the exceptions under the provisions of the act of the assembly.\n The defendant in error moved to dismiss the case because \n\n[207 U.S. 161, 176]\n\u00a0\n no Federal question was raised in the court below or by the assignment of errors, or, if any Federal question was raised, because it was frivolous. This motion must be overruled. The plaintiffs in error claimed that the act of assembly was in violation of the Constitution of the United States, and specially set up and claimed in the court below rights under several sections of that Constitution, and all their claims were denied by that court. These rights were claimed in the clearest possible words, and the sections of the Constitution relied upon were specifically named. The questions raised by the denial of these claims are not so unsubstantial and devoid of all color of merit that we are warranted in dismissing the case without consideration of their merits.\n Some part of the assignments of error and of the arguments in support of them may be quickly disposed of by the application of well-settled principles. We have nothing to do with the policy, wisdom, justice, or fairness of the act under consideration; those questions are for the consideration of those to whom the state has intrusted its legislative power, and their determination of them is not subject to review or criticism by this court. We have nothing to do with the interpretation of the Constitution of the state and the conformity of the enactment of the assembly to that Constitution; those questions are for the consideration of the courts of the state, and their decision of them is final. The 5th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States is not restrictive of state, but only of national, action.\n After thus eliminating all questions with which we have no lawful concern, there remain two questions which are within our jurisdiction. There were two claims of rights under the Constitution of the United States which were clearly made in the court below and as clearly denied. They appear in the second and fourth assignments of error. Briefly stated, the assertion in the second assignment of error is that the act of assembly impairs the obligation of a contract existing between the city of Allegheny and the plaintiffs in error, that the latter \n\n[207 U.S. 161, 177]\n\u00a0\n are to be taxed only for the governmental purposes of that city, and that the legislative attempt to subject them to the taxes of the enlarged city violates article 1,  9, 10, of the Constitution of the United States. This assignment does not rest upon the theory that the charter of the city is a contract with the state, a proposition frequently denied by this and other courts. It rests upon the novel proposition that there is a contract between the citizens and taxpayers of a municipal corporation and the corporation itself, that the citizens and taxpayers shall be taxed only for the uses of that corporation, and shall not be taxed for the uses of any like corporation with which it may be consolidated. It is not said that the city of Allegheny expressly made any such extraordinary contract, but only that the contract arises out of the relation of the parties to each other. It is difficult to deal with a proposition of this kind except by saying that it is not true. No authority or reason in support of it has been offered to us, and it is utterly inconsistent with the nature of municipal corporations, the purposes for which they are created, and the relation they bear to those who dwell and own property within their limits. This assignment of error is overruled.\n Briefly stated, the assertion in the fourth assignment of error is that the act of assembly deprives the plaintiffs in error of their property without due process of law, by subjecting it to the burden of the additional taxation which would result from the consolidation. The manner in which the right of due process of law has been violated, as set forth in the first assignment of error and insisted upon in argument, is that the method of voting on the consolidation prescribed in the act has permitted the voters of the larger city to overpower the voters of the smaller city, and compel the union without their consent and against their protest. The precise question thus presented has not been determined by this court. It is important, and, as we have said, not so devoid of merit as to be denied consideration, although its solution by principles long settled and constantly acted upon is not difficult. This court \n\n[207 U.S. 161, 178]\n\u00a0\n has many times had occasion to consider and decide the nature of municipal corporations, their rights and duties, and the rights of their citizens and creditors.

We think the following principles have been established by them and have become settled doctrines of this court, to be acted upon wherever they are applicable. Municipal corporations are political subdivisions of the state, created as convenient agencies for exercising such of the governmental powers of the state as may be intrusted to them. For the purpose of executing these powers properly and efficiently they usually are given the power to acquire, hold, and manage personal and real property. The number, nature, and duration of the powers conferred upon these corporations and the territory over which they shall be exercised rests in the absolute discretion of the state. Neither their charters, nor any law conferring governmental powers, or vesting in them property to be used for governmental purposes, or authorizing them to hold or manage such property, or exempting them from taxation upon it, constitutes a contract with the state within the meaning of the Federal Constitution. The state, therefore, at its pleasure, may modify or withdraw all such powers, may take without compensation such property, hold it itself, or vest it in other agencies, expand or contract the territorial area, unite the whole or a part \n\n[207 U.S. 161, 179]\n\u00a0\n of it with another municipality, repeal the charter and destroy the corporation. All this may be done, conditionally or unconditionally, with or without the consent of the citizens, or even against their protest. In all these respects the state is supreme, and its legislative body, conforming its action to the state Constitution, may do as it will, unrestrained by any provision of the Constitution of the United States. Although the inhabitants and property owners may, by such changes, suffer inconvenience, and their property may be lessened in value by the burden of increased taxation, or for any other reason, they have no right, by contract or otherwise, in the unaltered or continued existence of the corporation or its powers, and there is nothing in the Federal Constitution which protects them from these injurious consequences. The power is in the state, and those who legislate for the state are alone responsible for any unjust or oppressive exercise of it.\n Applying these principles to the case at bar, it follows irresistibly that this assignment of error, so far as it relates to the citizens who are plaintiffs in error, must be overruled.\n It will be observed that, in describing the absolute power of the state over the property of municipal corporations, we have not extended it beyond the property held and used for governmental purposes. Such corporations are sometimes authorized to hold and do hold property for the same purposes that property is held by private corporations or individuals. The distinction between property owned by municipal corporations in their public and governmental capacity and that owned by them in their private capacity, though difficult to define, has been approved by many of the state courts (Dill. Mun. Corp. 4th ed.  66 to 66a inclusive, cases cited in note to State ex rel. Bulkeley v. Williams, 48 L.R.A. 465), and it has been held that, as to the latter class of property, the legislature is not omnipotent. If the distinction is recognized it suggests the question whether property of a municipal corporation owned in its private and proprietary capacity may be taken from it against its will and without compensation. Mr. Dillon \n\n[207 U.S. 161, 180]\n\u00a0\n SAYS TRULY THAT THE QUESTION HAS NEVER ARisen directly for adjudication in this court. But it and the distinction upon which it is based have several times been noticed. Tippecanoe County v. Lucas, \n93 \nU.S. 108, 115\n, 23 S. L. ed. 822, 824; Meriwether v. Garrett, \n102 \nU.S. 472, 518\n, 530 S., 26 L. ed. 197, 206, 210; Essex Public Road Board v. Skinkle, \n140 \nU.S. 334, 342\n, 35 S. L. ed. 446, 449, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 790; New Orleans v.

Counsel for plaintiffs in error assert that the city of Allegheny was the owner of property held in its private and proprietary capacity, and insist that the effect of the proceedings under this act was to take its property without compensation and vest it in another corporation, and that thereby the city was deprived of its property without due process of law, in violation of the 14th Amendment. But no such question is presented by the record, and there is but a vague suggestion of facts upon which it might have been founded. In the sixth exception there is a recital of facts with purpose of showing how the taxes of the citizens of Allegheny would be increased by annexation to Pittsburgh. In that connection it is alleged that while Pittsburgh intends to spend large sums of money in the purchase of the water plant of a private company and for the construction of an electric light plant, Allegheny 'has improved its streets, established its own system of electric lighting, and established a satisfactory water supply.' This is the only reference in the record to the property rights of Allegheny, and it falls far short of a statement that that city holds any property in its private and proprietary capacity. Nor was there any allegation that Allegheny had been deprived of its property without due process of law. The only allegation of this kind is that the taxpayers, plaintiffs in error, were deprived of their property without due process of law because of the increased taxation which would result from the annexation,-an entirely different proposition. Nor is the situation varied by the fact that, in the superior court, Allegheny was 'permitted to intervene and become one of the appellants.' \n\n[207 U.S. 161, 181]\n\u00a0\n The city made no new allegations and raised no new questions, but was content to rest upon the record as it was made up. Moreover, no question of the effect of the act upon private property rights of the city of Allegheny was considered in the opinions in the state courts or suggested by assignment of errors in this court. The question is entirely outside of the record and has no connection with any question which is raised in the record. For these reasons we are without jurisdiction to consider it ( Dewey v. Des Moines, \n173 U.S. 193\n, 43 L. ed. 665, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 379; Harding v. Illinois, \n196 U.S. 78\n, 49 L. ed. 394, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 176), and neither express nor intimate any opinion upon it.\n The judgment is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","77":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nIGLEHART v. IGLEHART(1907)\nNo. 158\nArgued: Decided: February 25, 1907\n\n\n\n This is an appeal from a decree of the court of appeals of the District of Columbia, affirming a decree of the supreme court of the District construing a will. 26 App. D. C. 209. The bill was filed by the executor of the will of Annie E. I. Andrews, who was a resident of the District at the time of her death, and whose will was there duly admitted to probate March 28, 1904. The supreme court held that all disputed provisions of the will were valid, and entered a decree to that effect, which was affirmed by the court of appeals, on an appeal taken by these appellants separately from the other parties defendant, by leave of the supreme court of the District. All necessary persons were made party to the suit. The deceased left an estate of about $10,000, of which $3,000 consisted of real estate in the city of Washington.\n The disputed portions of the will are clauses 1, 10, and 12, and they are set forth in the margin. \n\n[204 U.S. 478, 479]\n\u00a0\n J. Howard Iglehart, the executor, is the son of a deceased brother of the testatrix (mentioned in the first clause of the will), and the two appellants are, respectively, her brother and sister.\n The executor, in his bill, alleged his readiness to distribute the estate as directed by the will, but he said that some of the heirs at law disputed the validity of some of its provisions, and hence his appeal to the court for a construction of those clauses.\n The grounds of the dispute are stated to be that the trusts created in the 1st and 12th clauses of the will are void, as in violation of the statute of the District of Columbia prohibiting perpetuities and restraints upon alienation. D. C. Code,  1023 [31 Stat. at L. 1351, chap. 854]. The devise of the real estate is alleged to be void on that ground, as is also the residuary bequest to the cemetery company, while the direction to erect a monu- \n\n[204 U.S. 478, 480]\n\u00a0\n ment, as provided in  10 of the will, it is alleged, must fall with the destruction of the trust, as it is part of the general scheme of the will, and is inseparable from the trust provisions. The executor submitted the questions to the court and did not appeal from the original decree nor from the decree of affirmance by the court of appeals, and he now asks that this court should make proper provision for his protection and that of the estate, in regard to the costs involved by the contention between the defendant and the appellants.\n Messrs. Noel W. Barksdale and Andrew Wilson for appellants.\n\n\n[204 U.S. 478, 482]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Hugh B. Rowland, Walter V. R. Berry, Benjamin S. Minor, and Charles H. Stanley for appellee.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Peckham: \n\n[204 U.S. 478, 483]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The first inquiry is in regard to the law existing in the District of Columbia upon the subject of trusts of this nature. There are two sections of the Code of the District of Columbia ( 669 and 1023 [31 Stat. at L. 1295 and 1351, chap. 854]) which are involved in the question before us. Section 669 (subchapter 6, relating to 'Cemetery Associations,' of chapter 18, relating to 'Corporations') provides in substance that it shall be lawful for cemetery associations incorporated under the laws of the District to \n\n[204 U.S. 478, 484]\n\u00a0\n take and hold any grant, etc., upon trust, to apply the income thereof under the direction of the association for the embellishment, preservation, renewal, or repair of any cemetery lot or any tomb or monument or other structure thereon, according to the terms of such grant, and the supreme court of the District is given the power and jurisdiction to compel the due performance of such trusts, or any of them, upon a bill filed by the proprietor of any lot in such cemetery for that purpose. Section 1023 ( subchapter 1 of chapter 24, relating to 'Estates') provides that, except in the case of gifts or devises to charitable uses, every ruture estate, whether of freehold or leasehold, whether by way of remainder or without a precedent estate, and whether vested or contingent, shall be void in its creation, which suspends the absolute power of alienation of the property, so that there shall be no person or persons in being by whom an absolute fee in the same, in possession, can be conveyed, for a longer period than during the continuance of not more than one or more lives in being and twenty-one years thereafter. The provisions of the section are (at the end of the subchapter) made applicable to personal property generally, except where, from the nature of the property, they are inapplicable.\n The appellants assert that  669 is nullified by  1023. They urge that the last section, being the last expression of the legislative will, and being inconsistent with  669, the last section must prevail. This although  669 makes special provision in regard to trusts of this nature and permits their creation, yet, because the latter section does not in terms make exception of the trusts provided for in the earlier section, these trusts, it is urged, are thereby prohibited.\n This is not a case for the application of that doctrine, which is, in any event, very seldom applicable. The true rule is to harmonize the whole Code, if possible, and to that end the letter of any particular section may sometimes be disregarded in order to accomplish the plain intention of the legislature. \n\n[204 U.S. 478, 485]\n\u00a0\n Effect must be given to all the language employed, and inconsistent expressions are to be harmonized to reach the real intent of the legislature. Petri v. Commercial Nat. Bank, \n142 \nU.S. 644, 650\n, 35 S. L. ed. 1144, 1146, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 325; Bernier v. Bernier, \n147 \nU.S. 242, 246\n, 37 S. L. ed. 152, 154, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 244; Groff v. Miller, 20 App. D. C. 353, 357. These two sections can be easily harmonized, and the undoubted intention of the legislature be thus carried out, by considering the latter section as applying to cases other than those specially provided for in  669. That section must be regarded as in full force.\n Assuming, however, that the section is not affected by  1023,-it is then contended by the appellants that  669 does not apply to this case, and that the trusts are not valid as a gift or devise to a charitable use within the exception mentioned in  1023. It may be assumed for the purposes of this case that the gifts contained in the 1st and 12th clauses of the will do not constitute a valid trust for a charitable use (Jones v. Habersham, \n107 \nU.S. 174, 183\n, 27 S. L. ed. 401, 405, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 336), and that those clauses would be illegal if dependent upon the exception mentioned in that section. But the earlier section is referred to for the purpose of ascertaining the policy of Congress within the District upon the general subject of trusts for the perpetual maintenance of cemetery lots, and of monuments and other structures erected thereon.\n That policy, as indicated in the section, permits in the Distict exactly what is provided for in this will,-namely, a trust to a cemetery ( incorporated) association for the maintenance of a lot and a monument in perpetual good order and condition.\n The law in New York in regard to Greenwood cemetery permits the same kind of a trust. Section 6 of chapter 156 of the Laws of New York for 1839, passed April 11, 1839. The law of the District of Columbia, where the testatrix died and where the property was situated, and the law of the state of New York, where the moneys are to be applied by a corporation created by the laws of that state, concur in per- \n\n[204 U.S. 478, 486]\n\u00a0\n mitting such trusts as are created in this will, and, under those circumstances, such a trust will be permitted by the courts of the District to be carried out in the state of New York, although the testatrix was domiciled in the District at the time of her death, and the funds to be applied to such trust arise from property owned by her in the District at that time.\n This is in pursuance of the general comity existing between the states of the Union, and under that the cemetery association can take and hold the property for the purposes mentioned in the will, which are permitted both by the law of the District of Columbia and the law of the state of New York.\n But it is contended that the law of the District prohibits the creation of such trusts and refuses to permit them to be carried out within that District, and that there is no rule of comity which obtains in such case by which these trusts might be held valid when affecting property within the District owned by a testator residing therein at the time of his death, even though the party to carry out the terms is a foreign corporation and the trusts are to be carried out in another state. This claim is made upon the assertion that  669 of the Code, even if in force at all, refers only to domestic associations, and that foreign corporations, not being within the exception, receive no power from that section, and cannot take or hold property situated in the District upon these trusts.\n It may be that  669 referred only to domestic corporations when the power was therein granted them to take such gifts upon the trusts mentioned, and carry them out in the District. The section is cited, as has been already mentione, for the purpose of determining the general policy of Congress in relation to this class of trusts, and whether, under the law, trusts similar to those under discussion are permitted in the District. If so, then the result follows from the rule of comity already stated, that a trust of that nature, permitted in the District, will not be interfered with when it is to be operative in a foreign state whose laws also permit it. The \n\n[204 U.S. 478, 487]\n\u00a0\n statute is not relied upon as a direct grant to a foreign corporation of the right to carry out a trust in a foreign state regarding property situated in the District and owned at the time of his death by a resident therein. If the statute granted such a right, of course there would be no question of its validity, nor would there be any in regard to comity.\n Trusts of the same kind, although to be carried out in a foreign state by a foreign corporation in regard to property within the District, cannot be said to violate any policy or statute of the District, so long as the statute permits therein grants on similar trusts, although to its own corporations. The prohibition of  1023 would not extend to such a trust so provided for.\n Ever since the case of Bank of Augusta v. Earle, 13 Pet. 519, 10 L. ed. 274, this doctrine of comity between states in relation to corporations has been steadily maintained, and it has been recognized by this court in many instances. See, specially, Cowell v. Colorado Springs Co. \n100 U.S. 55\n, 25 L. ed. 547; American & F. Christian Union v. Yount, \n101 U.S. 352\n, 25 L. ed. 888. These cases cover, as we think, the principle involved herein.\n In the opinion delivered in the court of appeals it was well said that 'it cannot be successfully contended that something which the District of Columbia permits to its own corporations is so far against its public policy that it will not permit persons domiciled within its territory to devise their property to be used for the same purpose by a foreign corporation authorized by its own charter to receive and administer such bequests.' [26 App. D. C. 216.] In our opinion the 1st and 12th clauses of the will are valid.\n The objection to the 10th clause is based upon the assumption that the 1st and 12th clauses are invalid, and that the 10th clause is so interwoven with the 1st and 12th clauses that, if they are pronounced void, the whole scheme of the will falls, and the 10th clause goes down with it. Holding the 1st and 12th clauses valid, the contention in regard to the 10th clause also fails. \n\n[204 U.S. 478, 488]\n\u00a0\n The appellee also urges that, by reason of the direction contained in the will to sell the real estate, it thereby became constructively converted into personalty at the time of the testatrix's death, and that, regarding it as personalty, the trusts created are still less open to any objection set up by the appellants. Although the provisions of the subchapter containing  1023 apply to personal property generally, as well as to real estate, except where, from the nature of the property, they are inapplicable, yet, when it is seen that, even in regard to real estate granted to a domestic corporation for the purposes mentioned in this will, a perpetuity may be created, it seems to be still plainer, if possible, that it would not be against the policy of the District, as evidenced by the statute, to affirm the legality of a trust of this kind in relation to personal property which is to be sold and the proceeds taken to another state by a foreign corporation for the purpose of administration in that state. In any aspect in which we can view the case, we think the disputed provisions of the will are valid.\n In regard to costs, the courts below have charged the appellants with costs, and we think the same rule should obtain here. The executor may apply to the Supreme Court for such allowance out of the fund as it may think is, under all the circumstances, proper.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n First, I give, devise, and bequeath unto the Greenwood Cemetery Company, of Brooklyn, New York, as trustees, my real property, consisting of a house and lot, known and designated as house No. 88 M. street, northwest, in the city of Washington, District of Columbia, to be held by them in trust for and to the use of my brother, J.

CO. v. INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION(1907)\nNo. 588\nArgued: Decided: May 27, 1907\n\n\n\n This case involves the validity of an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission requiring the appellants 'to cease and desist on or before the 1st day of April, 1905, from further maintaining or enforcing the unlawful advance of 2 cents per 100 pounds, or the said unlawful rates resulting therefrom, for the transportation of lumber from shipping points \n\n[206 U.S. 441, 442]\n\u00a0\n on defendants' respective lines in the state of Louisiana east of the Mississippi river, and in the states of Mississippi and Alabama to Cincinnati, Louisville, Evansville, Cairo, and other points on the Ohio river commonly called and known as Ohio river points.'\n The order was made in the matter of the complaint filed with the Commission by the Central Yellow Pine Association, an incorporated association composed of persons, firms. and corporations engaged in the business of manufacturing yellow pine lumber in the states of Mississippi, Alabama, and that part of Louisiana east of the Mississippi river.\n The complaint charged that the appellants were common carriers by rail, engaged in interstate commerce, and as such were engaged in the transportation of yellow pine lube r from the mills and lumber plants of the members of the Yellow Pine Lumber Association to the territory known as the 'Central Freight Association territory,' which lies on the north of the Ohio river and on and between the Mississippi river on the west and a line running through Buffalo and Pittsburg on the east, and that the members of the association are dependent upon appellants for the transportation of their lumber to the markets of the country; that the appellants and the railways carrying yellow pine lumber to the same markets from the territory west of the Mississippi river, embracing the states of Texas, Arkansas, and that part of Louisiana west of the river, by agreement or concert of action advanced the rate on yellow pine lumber from the territories both east and west of the Mississippi river on and beyond the Ohio river in Central Freight Association territory 2 cents per 100 pounds. The advance was made applicable south of the Ohio river and effective on and from April 15, 1903, except as to the Louisville & Nashville road, as to which it became effective June 22, 1903. And it was alleged that such advance was 'unjust, unreasonable, as well as discriminative, in violation of the act to regulate commerce.' The answer of the railways admitted the advance, but denied that it had the \n\n[206 U.S. 441, 443]\n\u00a0\n character and effect charged, but alleged that, on the contrary, it was reasonable and just and not in violation of law. The answers also specifically justified the advance by the conditions of the market and the traffic, including competition, and the costs of operating the roads. Testimony was taken on the issues thus formed.\n The Commission sustained the complaint and made the order recited above. 10 Inters. Com. Rep. 505. The railways refused to obey. The Commission then instituted this proceeding in the circuit court of the United States for the eastern district of Louisiana, where further proof was taken and a decree rendered which affirmed the order of the Commission and made it the order of the court. The roads were also enjoined from further disobedience to the order. No opinion was filed. The testimony was voluminous, and the report and findings of the Commission are very long. They are reported in 10 Inters. Com. Rep. 505, supra. The conclusions of the Commission are mingled somewhat with legal arguments, but the following may be selected as important and pertinent to the questions which the controversy presents:\n The lumber-producing districts are divided in territory (1) west of the Mississippi river; (2) territory east of the river; and (3) southeastern territory, composed of the states of Georgia, Florida, and part of Alabama. The lumber of each of these districts competes in the sale of their products in 'Central Freight Association territory.'\n The roads of the appellants are located in and serve the second of these territories.\n The advance in rates was made as well in territory west of the Mississippi river, 'and was made, in fact, though not expressly, by agreement between the defendants (appellants) and the roads west of the river,' after several meetings, at a consultation between the representatives of the roads. The roads east of the river took the initiative.\n At Cairo traffic from a large portion of the lumber-producing districts meets or converges en route to destination. The \n\n[206 U.S. 441, 444]\n\u00a0\n rates on other Ohio river crossings are based on Cairo; that is, they bear a fixed relation to the Cairo rate, being advanced or reduced as that rate is advanced or reduced. The through rates to points beyond the Ohio river in Central Freight Association territory are made up of the full local rates of the roads north of the Ohio as the proportions of those roads. Whatever is left of the through rates are the proportions of the roads south of the Ohio. The rates to interior points north of the Ohio are made on the lowest combination rates to the Ohio plus the rates beyond, and are blanket rates, being the same from all shipping points or points of production to the samede stination. The rates to the Ohio are to the north bank and include the bridge tolls.\n There are divisions of rates south of the Ohio between what are termed the 'originating' between what are termed the 'originating' roads, on which the lumber is principally manufactured, and the roads intermediate between them and the river.\n There had been, from time to time, changes or fluctuations in the rate. Prior to 1894 the roads west of the Mississippi claimed and were allowed a differential of 2 cents. This placed at a disadvantage the shippers east of the Mississippi, and a readjustment of rates was made, and on May 1, 1894, the rate to Cairo from east of the Mississippi was reduced to 13 cents per 100 pounds, the rate in force from west of the Mississippi. This rate remained until September 9, 1899, about five years, when it was advanced to 14 cents, and so remained until April 15, 1903, nearly four years, when the advance of 2 cents complained of was made.\n The railroads west of the Mississippi make a certain allowance to the mills which have 'logging roads,' that is, roads by which logs are hauled from the timber to the mills. This is called 'tap line allowance or division.' It ranges 1 to 2 cents per 100 pounds, up to as high as 6 cents, and varies, to some extent, according to the destination of the traffic. The mills east of the river have logging roads also, but appellants make no allowance to them. The only exception \n\n[206 U.S. 441, 445]\n\u00a0\n is the Mobile & Ohio road, which grants allowances to about four mills on its line. The New Orleans & Northeastern road put in a tap line allowance of 2 cents, but other roads east of the river objected, and it was withdrawn. There does not appear to be any reason for such allowance west of the Mississippi which does not apply east of that river, and it amounts to a rebate or reduction from the regularly published rate, and gives an advantage to the mills west of the Mississippi over those east, although the published rates from both are the same.\n The lumber business had grown from its inception and was largely and possibly more prosperous than it had been before, but the proof does not show that for two of three years preceding the advance the prices of mill products had materially increased or that the profits realized were unusual or excessively large.\n As to the operating expense of the roads the Commission said:\n'The proof shows increases in wages and in prices of material and equipment, but not in a marked degree for the two years, 1901 and 1902, immediately preceding the advance rate. These increases have doubtless added materially to operating expenses, but the total annual increases in those expenses are, of course, due only in part to the advances in wages and prices of supplies and equipment. They are attributable in a great measure to the constant growth or enlargement of the business of the roads. Not only has the lumber business of the roads greatly increased, but their business in general. The greater the volume of business, the greater is the aggregate cost of conducting it; or, in other words, of operating the roads. The total operating expenses of the roads, as reported by them, have also been much enlarged by the inclusion therein of large expenditures for permanent improvements.\n\n ... * *\n'While the operating expenses of the defendants have constantly grown, the gross earnings from operation have also \n\n[206 U.S. 441, 446]\n\u00a0\n increased from year to year to such an extent as to have resulted in a constant increase in net earnings. This is shown in the tables set forth in our findings of fact (finding 14).'\n\n Sufficient cause was not shown, either in the alleged profit in the lumber business or in the increased cost of operating the roads, for the advance in the rates on lumber. And, answering the contention that the former rate was not adequately remunerative, the Commission expressed the view that 'reasonableness in this sense of a rate on a single article of traffic is one of almost insuperable difficulty.' And further, tha t he value of the entire property of a road 'can shed but little, if any, light upon the question.' The rate on one article might reasonably or unreasonably be high and the total of rates be remunerative or otherwise. But, it was concluded, even if that be a mistaken view, it was impossible, with any degree of accuracy, to determine from the voluminous and conflicting testimony on the subject introduced in behalf of both parties what was the value of the property employed by the roads. The Commission thought that the elements to be considered in determining the reasonableness of an entire system of rates were 'widely variant' from those to be considered in determining the reasonableness of a single rate, and expressed the elements upon which the latter depends to be 'the value, volume, and other characteristics affecting the transportation of the particular commodity to which it is applied.' The Commission referred to its findings of facts as having 'many things disclosed by the evidence' which bore directly upon the reasonableness of the particular rate in question, and which aided it in arriving at a correct judgment in respect thereto, saying that:\n'In the first place, the present advanced rate is the last (up to date) of a series of advances, and was made by joint or concerted action of the carriers. It is claimed by them that in advancing the rate they acted independently, each for itself, but the proof shows conclusively that the advance was the outcome of a concert of action and a previous under- \n\n[206 U.S. 441, 447]\n\u00a0\n standing between the companies. Through their authorized official representatives they conferred with each other repeatedly as to the making of an advance; recognized the fact that, because of competition in common markets between the lumber-producing districts served by them, the advance should be from all those districts or none, and finally they all promulgated the advance, to take effect at exactly the same time for exactly the same amount. This concurrence of action was not only between the railway companies, parties defendant in this case, and in relation to the rates charged by them, but was participated in by the lumber-hauling roads serving the territories west as well as east of the Mississippi river.'\n\n The 14-cent rate in force at the date of the advance had been maintained nearly four years, and a still lower rate, 13 cents, had been maintained for the preceding five years and four months. And the testimony of the officers of the roads was that there was a profit in both rates. The answer also admitted profit, but averred that lumber 'was not an exceedingly profitable commodity.' The Commission said:\n'No reason is given or shown why lumber should be singled out as a commodity upon which an 'exceedingly' large profit should be earned. A reasonable profit is all the defendants are entitled to, and the testimony is far from convincing us that the profit under the 14-cent rate was not reasonable or would not now be reasonable. As stated in our 'Findings of Facts,' the 14-cent rate appears to be reasonably high when compared with the rates on other commodities which are at all analogous to lumber in respect to value, volume, and the various conditions affecting the service of transportation. During the period from 1894 to 1899, while the 13-cent rate was operative, there were large annual increases in the net earnings of the defendants, and the same was the case from 1899 to 1903, while the 14-cent rate was operative (finding 15). During those periods there was also a large \n\n[206 U.S. 441, 448]\n\u00a0\n growth in the tonnage of lumber hauled by the defendants, and therefore their increases in net earnings were in part, at least, derived from the lumber traffic under those rates. Dividends have been declared during those periods, and in addition considerable surpluses have been reported ( finding 16), and large sums have been invested in permanent improvements or betterments (finding 14).'\n\n The seventh and eighth conclusions of the Commission we give entire, as follows:\n'The defendants, other than the originating roads, complain of the small amount of revenue or low rate per ton per mile realized by them out of their proportions of the through rates. This is due to the large allowances out of the rates made to the originating roads. (See findings 3 and 4.) Those allowances commenced under the lower rates in force prior to the advance, and raise the presumption that those lower rates, minus the allowances, were then considered reasonably remunerative for the remainder of the hauls to the Ohio river crossings. As the 2 cents advance goes entirely to the roads continuing the transportation on to the Ohio and none of it to the originating roads, the inference is that advance was made solely with a view of increasing the proportions of the former roads. If the allowances to the originating roads are unreasonably large, as they appear to be from a distant standpoint, and result in unreasonably low proportions to the other roads, this cannot be remedied by an advance in the total through rates charged the public. It is the total rate, and not its proportions, which is in issue.\n\n'Although both the net and gross earnings of the defendants have grown from year to year, the percentages of what are reported by the defendants as 'operating expenses' to earnings have also somewhat increased (table, finding 14), and this is urged as showing the necessity for an advance in the lumber and some other rates. It is to be noted that these operating expenses embrace large annual expenditures for real estate, right of way, tunnels, bridges, and other strictly \n\n[206 U.S. 441, 449]\n\u00a0\n permanent improvements, and also for equipment, such as locomotives and cars.'\n\n And the Commission said repairs, whether to improvement or equipment, were properly chargeable to operating expenses, but that expenditures for improvements and equipments should not 'be taxed as part of the current or operating expenses of a single year, but should be, so far as practicable, and so far as rates exacted from the public are concerned, 'projected proportionately over the future.\" It was said further, if such expenditures should be deducted from the annual operating expenses it would be found that the percentage of operating expenses to earnings had, in some instances, diminished, and in others increased, to no material extent.\n The tenth and eleventh conclusions are as follows:\n'10. The general rule is, the greater the tonnage of an article of traffic, the lower is the rate. No rule is more firmly grounded in reason or more universally recognized by carriers. It is because of the greater density of traffic north of the Ohio river in Central. Freight Association territory and in eastern territory that rates in general are materially lower in those territories than in southern territory. The defendants have made yellow pine lumber an exception to this rule; while the tonnage in general of the defendants and lumber tonnage in particular have grown greatly, the lumber rate has not been lowered, but has been materially advanced. Moreover, the testimony is that 'a decrease in the rates on traffic in general has been going on throughout the United States since the improvements in transportation have been put in operation;' here, again, lumber has been taken from under, and deprived of the benefits of, the general rule.\n\n'11. As said in Marten v. Louisville & N. R. Co. 9 Inters. Com. Rep. 589, and shown by the proof in this case, 'lumber is an inexpensive freight and only a few other commodities furnish to carriers so large a tonnage.' The lumber business is constant, yielding the carriers revenue all the year; no special equipment is constructed or furnished for its carriage; it is \n\n[206 U.S. 441, 450]\n\u00a0\n loaded by the shipper and unloaded by the consignee, and where open cars are furnished, the shipper is required at considerable expense to equip them so as to protect the load and the train; there is small risk incident to its transportation, and, in case of accident, the damage is insignificant. For thee reasons lumber should be given rates which are relatively low.\n\n'Our conclusion on the whole is that the advance, April 15, 1903, of 2 cents in the Cairo rate (with a corresponding increase in the rates to the other Ohio river crossings) was not warranted under all the facts in evidence, and that the resultant increased rate is unreasonable and unjust. An order will be issued in accordance with these views.'\n\n Mr. Ed. Baxter for appellants.\n\n\n[206 U.S. 441, 452]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. L. A. Shaver, T. M. Miller, Marcellus Green, and Garner Wynn Green for appellee.\n\n\n[206 U.S. 441, 454]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n Counsel for appellants in his oral argument made the declaration that it would not be necessary for this court to open the pages of testimony contained in the record, and says in his supplemental brief:\n'I do not insist that this court shall read the voluminous testimony contained in these records, but I do most respectfully ask it to lay down the rules or principles of transportation law which are fairly involved in the just determination of these cases, and to remand them to the Commission, to be reexamined upon the testimony in conformity with the principles of transportation law to be announced by this court.'\n\n To what, then, shall we resort? How shall we determine what 'principles of transportation law' were involved? How determine whether they were recognized and applied, or denied and rejected, by the Commission, and, necessarily, by the circuit court? An examination of the testimony, by concession of counsel, is out of the question. And the findings of the Commission are made by law prima facie true. This court has ascribed to them the strength due to the judgments of a tribunal appointed by law and informed by experience. Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Behlmer, \n175 U.S. 648\n, 44 L. ed. 309, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 209; East Tennessee, V. & G. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n181 \nU.S. 1, 27\n, 45 S. L. ed. 719, 729, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 516. And, in any special case of conflicting evidence, a probative force must be attributed to the findings of the Commission, which, in addition to 'knowledge of conditions, of environment, and of transportation relations,' has had the witnesses before it and has been able to judge of them and \n\n[206 U.S. 441, 455]\n\u00a0\n their manner of testifying. In the case at bar these considerations are reinforced by a concurrent judgment of the circuit court.\n The question is one of the reasonableness of a rate, and such a question was said to be one of fact in Texas & P. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n162 U.S. 197\n, 40 L. ed. 940, 5 Inters. Com. Rep. 405, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 666; Cincinnati, N. O. & T. P. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n162 U.S. 184\n, 40 L. ed. 935, 5 Inters. Com. Rep. 391, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 700. In these cases, however, it was declared that the conclusions of the Commission are subject to review if it excluded 'facts and circumstances that ought to have been considered.' Upon this declaration appellants rely, and justify their invocation that this court express and enforce the principles of transportation which, they contend, the Commission disregarded; and appellants venture the observation that unless this be done 'there will be no settled principles of law for the guidance of either the Commission or of the courts,' and that 'the interstate railroad companies will be the only persons in this country who will not be able to obtain the opinion of the courts upon questions of law which vitally affect their interest.' We think the apprehension is groundless and is demonstrated to be groundless by the cases cited. In all of them legal propositions were reviewed as elements in the inquiry of the reasonableness of a rate. Those cases, however, are in marked contrast to the pending case. It will be observed that in them the instances were very simple. There was a salient circumstance in each of them about which there was no uncertainty. In other words, it was unconfused by dispute and was not put to question by a conflict of testimony. A definite legal proposition unmixed with fact was presented, and the only act of judgment exercised by the Commission was to reject it. In Cincinnati, N. O. & T. P. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, passing on the effect of a shipment on a through bill of lading to give jurisdiction to the Commission (in which the Commission was sustained), the questions presented were the power in the Commission \n\n[206 U.S. 441, 456]\n\u00a0\n to fix a maximum rate, and whether competitive conditions could be considered by a railroad in fixing a greater charge for a shorter than a longer distance on its own line. It was decided that the power to pass on the reasonableness of an existing rate did not imply the power to prescribe a rate. On the conditions affecting competition it was not found necessary to pass, but the following passage is worth the quoting as bearing on the contention of appellants:\n'It has been forcibly argued that, in the present case, the Commission did not give due weight to the facts that tended to show that the circumstances and conditions were so dissimilar as to justify the rates charged. But the question was one of fact, peculiarly within the province of the Commission, whose conclusions have been accepted and approved by the circuit court of appeals, and we find nothing in the record to make it our duty to draw a different conclusion.'\n\n In Texas & P. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, ocean competition as constituting a dissimilar condition and as justifying a difference in rates between import and domestic traffic was the circumstance considered. The Interstate Commerce Commission had ruled against such competition as a factor, and condemned rates made in view of it to be undue and unjust. The court observed:\n'But we understand the view of the Commission to have been that it was not competent for the Commission to consider such facts-that it was shut up by the terms of the act of Congress, to consider only such 'circumstances and conditions' as pertained to the articles of traffic after they had reached and been delivered at a port of the United States or Canada.'\n\n And further:\n'We have, therefore, to deal only with a question of law, and that is, What is the true construction, in respect to the matters involved in the present controversy, of the act to regulate commerce? If the construction put upon the act by the Commission was right, then the order was lawful; otherwise it was not.' \n\n[206 U.S. 441, 457]\n\u00a0\n The ruling of the Commission was reversed.\n\n In Interstate Commerce Commission v. Alabama Midland R. Co. \n168 U.S. 144\n, 42 L. ed. 414, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 45, there was passed upon a decision of the Commission that the competition of river lines of transportation was not a factor to be considered when determining whether property transported over the same line is carried under 'substantially similar circumstances and conditions,' as that phrase is found in the 4th section of the interstate commerce act. The decision was declared to be an erroneous construction of the act.\n In Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Behlmer (passing by subordinate questions) the dominant element was the construction of the 4th section of the interstate commerce act. The Commission and the circuit court of appeals, it was said, 'mistakenly considered as a matter of law that competition, however material, arising from carriers who were subject to the act to regulate commerce, could not be taken into consideration, and likewise that all competition, however substantial, not originating at the initial point of the traffic, was equally, as a matter of law, excluded from view.'\n In all these cases, therefore, there was a single, distinct, and dominant proposition of law which the Commission had rejected, and the exact influence of which, in its decisions, could be estimated. Indeed, they were mere constructions of the statute, the delegation of the Commission's duties and power. Let us now see what the propositions are which appellants propose for our adoption. They are presented as presumptions of law, which dispense with evidence until rebutted, or countervail evidence by their probative force. (1) That the rate published bya carrier is reasonably low. (2) A rate upon a commodity, made by the competition of carriers, is reasonably low, and the burden is on him who assails it. (3) A rate upon a commodity as low, or lower, than the majority of rates charged by other carriers for the transportation of the same grade of commodities for similar distances in the same or other territory, is reasonably low, and the burden is upon him who \n\n[206 U.S. 441, 458]\n\u00a0\n insists that it is unreasonably high. (4) A rate charged by a carrier which has the 'strongest possible motive' to develop and increase a traffic in a particular commodity, and has maintained such rate for a 'long series of years,' so as to have induced a large and continuous increase of business in that commodity and of the capital invested, is reasonably low. (5) Rates being so adjusted upon a commodity as to enable it to move with profit to the shipper, whatever the conditions of the market, reducing the rates as the market declines, only increasing them as the market improves, a particular increase is reasonable if it be shown that the percentage of increase has been greater in the price of the commodity than in the rates on it. (6) Rates reduced to meet a market depression, and kept in effect during the depression, and increased when the depression ceases, which does not cause the increased rates to exceed the rates that were maintained by the carrier prior to the depression, are reasonable. (7) (8) Increase in rates upon all commodities impartially to meet largely increased expenditures on account of an abnormal increase in the volume of traffic is reasonable, 'provided the gross earnings of the carrier yield less than the normal proportion of net earnings.' Or provided the percentage of increase has been greater in the operating expenses of the carrier than in the rates upon the commodity. (9) (10) Upon the supposition that certain improvements have been made necessary by 'an abnormal increase of traffic,' they should be taken into account in determining the reasonableness of an increase of rates upon a commodity, whether, as a matter of bookkeeping, the expenditures should be charged to capital account or to the operating expenses; and without regard to the fact whether such expenditures have been paid out of the carrier's earnings or have been provided for by the issuance of bonds. (11) A rate on a commodity is profitable if it exceeds the cost of its movement; and yet the rate may be unreasonably low if it does not contribute its fair share to operating expenses, taxes, and fixed charges. \n\n[206 U.S. 441, 459]\n\u00a0\n If these propositions should be granted as axioms of transportation there is the difficulty, as we have already pointed out, of determining to what extent-that is, whether to prejudicial extent, if at all-they were disregarded by the Commission and by the circuit court. The circuit court affirmed the order of the Commission, and it is an instant assumption that the court considered all the elements in the testimony and inferences from it. And the propositions of appellants are inferences of mixed law and fact, hence disputable,-may be overcome or counterpoised; and, therefore, the court, in reaching its ultimate judgment, may have given them all the weight to which they were entitled.\n It is almost impossible to discuss the contentions of appellants without bringing forward the elemental. A presumption is the expression of a process of reasoning, and most, if not all, the rules of indirect evidence may be expressed as such. We cannot go far in the investigation of any controversy without finding ourselves compelled to infer one fact from another, but we would not therefore be justified in declaring such inferences legal axioms. It is to this that appellants invite us and seek to erect disputable inferences from conduct that may have many explanations into intendments of law.\n In this connection Texas & P. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, supra, is an instructive case. In that case, we have seen, it was decided that whether the rate wasre asonable or unreasonable was a question, whatever its theoretical nature, for the tribunal that decides upon matters of fact. Among other cases cited to sustain that position was Denaby Main Colliery Co. v. Manchester, etc. R. Co. 3 Railway & Canal Traffic Cases, 426. In that case it was declared that reasonableness of a rate was a question of fact, and not reviewable by an appellate court unless circumstances which ought to have been considered were not considered, and that a decision must be arrived at fairly looking at all the circumstances that are proper to be looked at. The appellant in the case contended against the consideration by the rail- \n\n[206 U.S. 441, 460]\n\u00a0\n way commissioners of competition between two places, and the court of appeals, replying, said:\n'If the appellants can make out that, in point of law, that is a consideration which cannot be permitted to have any influence at all, that those circumstances must be rigidly excluded from consideration, and that they are not circumstances legitimately to be considered, no doubt they establish that the court below has erred in point of law. But it is necessary for them to go as far as that in order to make any way with this appeal, because once admit that to any extent, for any purpose, the question of competition can be allowed to enter in, whether the court has given too much weight to it or too little becomes a question of fact, and not of law. The point is undoubtedly a very important one.'\n\n And it may be well to say here, as a suggestive principle throughout, that it was pointed out, such conclusions of fact were 'to be arrived at, looking at the matter broadly and applying common sense to the facts that are proved.' The remarks of Wills, J., in Phipps v. London & N. W. R. Co. [ 1892] 2 Q. B. pp. 229, 236, when the case was before the railway commissioners, were in effect approved. This court also quoted them. Willes, J., said, speaking of the questions of undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to or in favor of any particular person under  2 of the railway and canal traffic acts, that they were eminently practical, 'and if this court once attempts the hopeless task of dealing with questions of this kind with any approach to mathematical accuracy, and tries to introduce a precision which is unattainable in commercial and practical matters, it would do infinite mischief and no good.'\n It is conceded, as we have said, that the presumptions contended for by appellants are mixed of law and fact, except, may be, those which we shall presently consider. If either element is dominant in such presumptions, it must be that of fact. In other words, the fact must be ascertained before the law draws its inference. This is especially pertinent to \n\n[206 U.S. 441, 461]\n\u00a0\n the propositionsurged by appellants. Let us illustrate. Take, for example, the second proposition, that 'a rate upon a commodity made by competition of carriers is reasonably low, and the burden is on him who assails it.' But suppose competition is not established, or is disproved, what becomes of the inference and the onus of proof dependent upon it? The question marks the condition that appellants encounter in the findings of the Commission. The findings of the Commission in effect negative the facts upon which the propositions depend. In still greater degree there is illustration in the first proposition. That proposition is an inference from an inference, as we shall presently point out. The reasonableness of the rate is inferred from competition, and competition is inferred from the publication of the rate.\n This comment, it may be said, is not applicable to the ninth and tenth propositions of appellants, as they present propositions of law which were not only disregarded by the Commission, but the antithesis of them was asserted in the eighth finding. This contention must be specifically considered. The Commission finds that the net and gross earnings of the appellants have grown from year to year, and also that what they have reported as operating expns es have also grown. But in these operating expenses there were included 'expenditures for real estate, right of way, tunnels, bridges, and other strictly permanent improvements, and also for equipment, such as locomotives and cars.' The Commission expressed the opinion that such expenditures should not be charged to a single year, but 'should be, so far as practicable and so far as rates exacted from the public are concerned, 'projected proportionately over the future.\" And it was said: 'If these large amounts are deducted from the annual operating expenses reported by the defendants (appellants), it will be found that the percentage of operating expenses to earnings has in some instances diminished and in others increased to no material extent.' The exact effect of the difference of view between appellants and the Commission as to operating expenses there is no test; \n\n[206 U.S. 441, 462]\n\u00a0\n but it cannot be said, even if the commission was wrong as to such expenses, that error in its ultimate conclusion is demonstrated or that the correctness of the conclusion is made so doubtful as to justify a reversal. The findings show that the old rates were profitable and that dividends were declared even when permanent improvements and equipment were charged to operating expenses. But may thet be so charged? Appellants contend that the answer should be so obviously in the affirmative that it should be made an axiom in transportation. On principle it would seem as if the answer should be otherwise. It would seem as if expenditures for additions to construction and equipment, as expenditures for original construction and equipment, should be reimbursed by all of the traffic they accommodate during the period of their duration, and that improvements that will last many years should not be charged wholly against the revenue of a single year. But it is insisted that Union P. R. Co. v. United States, \n99 U.S. 402\n, 25 L. ed. 274, establishes the contrary. That case was not concerned with rates of thansportation or the rule which should determine them against shippers. It was concerned with the construction of the words 'net earnings' in an act of Congress, 5 per cent of which earnings were provided to be applied annually to a loan by the government to the railroad. Considering the provision of the act and its purpose, it was concluded 'that the true interest of the government' was 'the same as that of stockholders, and would be subserved by encouraging a liberal application of the earnings to the improvement of the works.' 'It is better,' it was said, 'for the ultimate security of the government in reference to the payment of its loan, as well as for the service which it may require in the transportation of its property and mails, that $100 should be spent in improving the works, than that it should receive $5 towards the payment of its subsidy. If the 5 per cent of net earnings, demandable from the company, amounted to a new indebtedness, not due before, like a rent accruing upon a lease, a more \n\n[206 U.S. 441, 463]\n\u00a0\n rigid rule might be insisted on. But it is not so; the amount of the indebtedness is fixed and unchangeable. The amount of the 5 per cent and its receipt at one time or another is simply a question of earlier or later payment of a debt already fixed in amount. If the employment of any earnings of the road in making improvements lessens the amount of net earnings, the government loses nothing thereby. The only result is, that a less amount is presently paid on its debt, whilst the general security for the whole debt is largely increased.' The interest of the government in the improvement of the road was even greater than that of a stockholder. This was manifest from its munificent gift of lands, in addition to its generous loan of credit. As benefactor of the road and as creditor of it, as a government concerned with the development of the country, as a money lender concerned with the extent of security, 'the true interest' of the United States might be that revenue should be applied to improvemets . Payment of the debt was only postponed, not denied, and this and the other considerations might well determine the construction of words in the statute which were capable of different meanings. But such is not the relation or concern of a shipper of lumber. His right is immediate. He may demand a service. He must pay a toll, but a toll measured by the reasonable value of the service. The elements of that value may be many and complex, not always determinable, as we have seen, with mathematical accuracy, but, we think it is clear that instrumentalities which are to be used for years should not be paid by the revenues of a day or year; and this is the principle of returns upon capital which exists in durable shape.\n The first proposition submitted by appellants may also be said to be so far absolute and independent of evidence as to be considered as a presumption of law simply. This is contended on the authority of Van Patten v. Chicago, M. & St. P. R. Co. 81 Fed. 545. It is difficult to analyze the case briefly. It was an action of damages against the railroad for charging unjust and unreasonable rates under \n\n[206 U.S. 441, 464]\n\u00a0\n the assumption that  8 and 9 of the interstate commerce act gave such an action, though the railroad had charged according to the schedule of rates filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission. The answer of the railroad set up the schedule and that rates had been charged shippers in accordance with it. The court overruled a demurrer to a demurrer to the answer and adjudged the defense good. The court discussed the question in an elaborate opinion, and, led by the difficulties of applying all of the provisions of the act, which were enacted, the court observed, to correct 'the mode in which carriers imposed their charges,' sought in the act itself a standard of reasonableness.\n The court, in its opinion, referred to the evils which had existed,- rebates from published schedules, preferences and discriminations against shippers,-and the purpose and hope of the act to correct them through the requirement of an imperative statutory standard, and by that and other requirements to establish free competition between railroads, and, as a result of competition, reasonable rates. But it was not said or intended to be said that competition followed as a presumption of law in any given case. The court did not intend to assert a rule deduced from the conduct of railroads,-conduct so far constant that the law would base a presumption upon it and forever fix it as one of its intendments. Indeed, the court meant to do no more than to deny a right of action for unreasonableness in the rates as filed. And this court, in Texas & P. R. Co. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co. \n204 U.S. 426\n, 51 L. ed. 553, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 350, has decided that the redress of a shipper for such unreasonableness must be through the Interstate Commerce Commission. It is certain that a presumption that was sufficient to defeat an action in the circuit court could not be urged to defeat an inquiry by the Commission. Of course, if a complaint should be filed before the Commission and no proof adduced to support it, we cannot doubt but that the complaint would be dismissed; but this because of the principle that the party who asserts the affirmative in any controversy ought \n\n[206 U.S. 441, 465]\n\u00a0\n to prove the assertion, and that he who denies may rest on his denial until, at least, the probable truth of the matter asserted has been established. 'The reason is obvious: to all propositions which are neither the subject of intuitive or sensitive knowledge, nor probabilized by experience, the mind suspends its assent until proof of them is adduced.' Best, Presumptions,  32.\n There are other contentions of appellants which we think are untenable. One only needs comment. It is said that it was error to hold the advance unreasonable and unjust because the charges made on lumber to Cairo and other points on the Ohio river 'are mere divisions of through rates, the justness of which neither the Interstate Commerce Commission nor the circuit cort has any jurisdiction to determine.' Indeed, it is said, to do so is an exercise of a legislative function. We think the contention is in effect answered by Cincinnati, N. O. & T. P. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n162 U.S. 184\n, 40 L. ed. 935, 5 Inters. Com. Rep. 391, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 700. If the contention is intended to be as extensive as its words seemingly make it, it would withdraw from the supervision of the Interstate Commerce Commission and from the courts every shipment over two or more railroads. There necessarily must be some apportionment of the rates between such roads, and whether the advance should be made in the rates over one road or the other, or in the rates over all, can make no difference. In other words, it is competent for the Commission or the courts to consider the throught rate, however composed. It must not be overlooked that the Commission and the circuit court found that the advance in the case at bar was made by agreement between the roads, and was not the individual action of each, induced by competition. It is true the contrary fact is asserted. It is asserted, that such action was the result of competition, and, that the 'legal value' to which competition was entitled was not given it. The argument to support the contention has not convinced us. The inquiry was essentially one of fact, and the attempt to make competition an inference of law and dominating against the \n\n[206 U.S. 441, 466]\n\u00a0\n findings of the Commission and their affirmance by the circuit court we have already rejected.\n But little more discussion is necessary. The concession of counsel with which we have commenced this opinion is a frank recognition of the effect which this court has given to the decisions of the Interstate Commerce Commission on questions of fact. And we have said very recently: 'The statute gives prima facie effect to the findings of the Commission, and, when those findings are concurred in by the circuit court, we think they should not be interfered with unless the record establishes that clear and unmistakable error has been committed.' Cincinnati, H. & D. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n206 U.S. 142\n, 51 L. ed. 995, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 648.\n It is true, appellants assert, that clear and unmistakable error has been committed, but upon ground untenable, as we have seen. And the present case, above all others, calls for the application of the rule. The question submitted to the Commission, as we have said, with tiresome repetition, perhaps, was one which turned on matters of fact. In that question, of course, there were elements of law, but we cannot see that any one of these or any circumstances probative of the conclusion was overlooked or disregarded. The testimony was voluminous. It is not denied that it was conflicting, and, by concession of counsel, it included a large amount of testimony taken on behalf of appellants in support of the propositions contended for by them. Whether the Commission gave too much weight to some parts of it and too little weight to other parts of it is a question of fact, and not of law. It seems from the findings, report, and conclusions of the Commission that it considered every circumstance pertinent to the problem before it.\n Further testimony was taken by the circuit court and its judgment confirmed that of the Commission and approved its order. Decree affirmed.\n Mr. Justice Moody took no part in the decision of this case.\n Mr. Justice Brewer dissented. \n\n\n\n","79":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nIN RE POLLITZ(1907)\nNo. 16\nArgued: April 8, 1907Decided: May 27, 1907\n\n\n\n James Pollitz, a citizen of the state of New York, brought suit in the supreme court of the state of New York for the county of New York against the Wabash Railroad Company, a consolidated railroad corporation existing under the laws of the states of Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, and Missouri, and a citizen of the state of Ohio; and sundry other defendants, chiefly citizens and residents of the state of New York, being individual directors of the railroad company; the trust company, registrar of the stock of the railroad company; a committee representing debenture holders; mortgage trustees, etc. The complaint alleged in substance that the railroad company, in 1906, entered into certain negotiations for the retirement of the debenture mortgage bonds of the company through the issue of other securities, both bonds and stocks, and that the plan to accomplish that end was subsequently authorized and approved by the stockholders of the company and debenture mortgage bondholders, at a meeting at Toledo, October 22, 1906, at which the issue of certain new bonds and preferred and common stock of the company and the exchange of certain new bonds, preferred and common stock, for the company's debenture mortgage bonds, was authorized and approved. The complaint alleged that the plan of exchange was unlawful, unauthorized, and contrary to the laws of the states in which \n\n[206 U.S. 323, 324]\n\u00a0\n the company was organized, and was unjust, inequitable, and injurious to complainant, who claimed to be the owner of one thousand shares of the common capital stock of the railroad company. It was also alleged that 90 per cent of the debenture holders voted in favor of the exchange, and that the plan had been carried out as to more than nine tenths of the debenture bonds, and new bonds and stocks to the requisite amount had been issued. And it was prayed that the plan 'be decreed and adjudged to be utr a vires, and that all said bonds and the preferred and common stock, used and issued and applied by the said Wabash Railroad Company for the purpose and plan of said scheme, be decreed and adjudged of no effect.' The complaint prayed in the alternative that if the court should decree that Pollitz was not entitled to the main relief he had asked, then that he might have an accounting by the defendant officers and directors of the railroad company, etc., in respect of the new bonds and common and preferred stock which had been issued under the plan of exchange.\n The railroad company filed its petition to remove the case into the circuit court of the United States for the southern district of New York, which set forth in substance the foregoing matters, and further averred:\n'That your petitioner disputes the claim against it as set forth by the plaintiff in his complaint, and denies that the plaintiff is entitled to the judgment and relief prayed for against this petitioner or to any judgment or relief against it; and this petitioner alleges that the fundamental and primary controversy, as set forth in said complaint, is whether or not the plan for the exchange of the debenture mortgage bonds by this petitioner, the authorization and creation by it of the new securities in the said complaint set forth, and the issue of the same by it for the purpose of carrying said plan into effect, is, as alleged in said complaint, illegal, unlawful, void, and prohibited by the charter of this petitioner and the laws under which it is incorporated; and whether said new se- \n\n[206 U.S. 323, 325]\n\u00a0\n curities are, as alleged in said complaint, invalid and void; and that such controversy is a separable and distinct controversy between the plaintiff and this petitioner.\n\n'That a complete determination of said controversy can be had without the presence of any of the defendants in this action other than this petitioner; and that all of said other defendants are neither indispensable nor necessary parties to the complete determination of said controversy.\n\n'That the foregoing controversy, which is solely between the plaintiff and the petitioner, must be determined before any other controversy alleged in the complaint can be considered and determined; and that said controversy between the plaintiff and this petitioner, as above set forth, is separate and distinct from any other or further controversy.\n\n'That said fundamental and primary controversy herein between the plaintiff and this petitioner is a controversy wholly between citizens of different states,-to wit: Between the plaintiff, a citizen of the state of New York, and this petitioner, a citizen of the state of Ohio.'\n\n The cause was removed, and Pollitz made a motion to remand, which was denied by the circuit court, Lacombe, J., presiding.\n Pollitz thereupon applied to this court on March 18 for leave to file a petition for a writ of mandamus directing the cause to be remanded to the state court. Leave to file was granted March 25, and a rule was entered thereon returnable April 8, to which return was duly made to the effect that the order denying the motion of Pollitz to remand the cause had been made and entered in the exercise of the jurisdiction and judicial discretion conferred upon the circuit judge by law, and for the reasons expressed in his opinion filed with the order. The case was heard on the return to the rule.\n Mr. Roger Foster for petitioner.\n\n\n[206 U.S. 323, 329]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Rush Taggart and Lawrence Greer for respondents. \n\n[206 U.S. 323, 330]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n The suit was commenced in the state court by a citizen \n\n[206 U.S. 323, 331]\n\u00a0\n and resident of the city, county, and state of New York, against a corporation, a citizen of the state of Ohio, and other defendants, many of whom were residents and citizens of the state of New York, the value of the matter in dispute, exclusive of interest and costs, exceeding the jurisdictional sum.\n The defendant the Wabash Railroad Company, a citizen of Ohio, filed its petition and bond in proper form for the removal of the suit into the United States circuit court for the souther d istrict of New York, on the ground of separable controversy so far as it was concerned, and it was removed accordingly. A motion to remand was made and denied by the circuit court, which held that the controversy was separable, and that the other defendants were not indispensable or necessary parties to the complete determination of that separable controversy.\n The issue on the motion to remand was whether such determination could be had without the presence of defendants other than the Wabash Railroad Company, and this was judicially determined by the circuit court, to which the decision was by law committed.\n The application to this court is for the issue of the writ of mandamus directing the circuit court to reverse its decision, although in its nature a judicial act, and within the scope of its jurisdiction and discretion.\n But mandamus cannot be issued to compel the court below to decide a matter before it in a particular way or to review its judicial action had in the exercise of legitimate jurisdiction, nor can the writ be used to perform the office of an appeal or writ of error.\n Where the court refuses to take jurisdiction of a case and proceed to judgment therein, when it is its duty to do so and there is no other remedy, mandamus will lie unless the authority to issue it has been taken away by statute.

Thereupon an application was made to this court for leave to file a petition for a writ of mandamus to the judge of the circuit court to take jurisdiction and to proceed against the company in the suit. Leave was granted and a rule to show cause entered thereon, upon the return to which the writ of mandamus was awarded.' Re Atlantic City R. Co. \n164 U.S. 633\n, 41 L. ed. 579, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 208.\n\n In Ex parte Wisner, Wisner, a citizen of the state of Michigan, commenced an action at law in the circuit court for the city of St. Louis, state of Missouri, against Beardsley, a citizen of the state of Louisiana. After service of summons on Beardsley, he filed his petition to remove the action from the state court into the circuit court of the United States for the eastern district of Missouri, on the ground of diversity of citizenship, with the proper bond, and an order of removal was made by the state court, and the transcript of record was filed in the circuit court. Wisner (who had had no choice but to sue in the state court) at once moved to remand the case, on the ground that the suit did not raise a controversy within the jurisdiction of the circuit court, and that, as it appeared on the face of the record that plaintiff was a citizen and resident of Michigan, and defendant a citizen and resident of Louisiana, the case was not one within the original jurisdiction of the circuit court, in accordance with the statute providing that where jurisdiction is founded only on the fact that the action is between citizens of different states, suit shall be brought \n\n[206 U.S. 323, 333]\n\u00a0\n only in the district of the residence of either the plaintiff or the defendant. The motion to remand was denied, and Wisner applied to this court for a writ of mandamus, which was suse quently awarded.\n In the present case the removal was granted and sustained on the ground that there was a controversy between the removing defendant and plaintiff, which could be fully determined as between them without the presence of the other defendants. That being so, the suit might have been brought originally in the circuit court against the railroad company as sole defendant.\n If the ruling of the circuit court was erroneous, as is contended, but which we do not intimate, it may be reviewed after final decree on appeal or error.

Knight for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[207 U.S. 79, 82]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Dona Malone and Fred T. Field for defendant in error.\n\n\n[207 U.S. 79, 83]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This was a complaint against the plaintiff in error for refusing to sell tickets for the transportation of pupils to and from the public schools at one half the regular fare charged by it, as required by Mass. Rev. Laws, chap. 112,  72. At the trial the railway company admitted the fact, but set up that the statute was unconstitutional, in that it denied to the company the equal protection of the laws and deprived it of its property without just compensation and without due process of law. In support of this defense it made an offer of proof which may be abridged into the propositions that the regular fare was 5 cents; that during the last fiscal year the actual and reasonable cost of transportation per passenger was 3 86\/100 cents, or, including taxes, 4 10\/100 cents; that pupils of the public schools formed a considerable part of the passengers carried by it, and that the one street railway expressly exempted by the law transported nearly one half the passengers transported on street railways and received nearly one half the revenue received for such transportation in the commonwealth. The offer was stated to be made for the purpose of showing that the plaintiff in error could not comply with the statute without carrying passengers for less than a reasonable compensation \n\n[207 U.S. 79, 84]\n\u00a0\n and for less than cost. The offer of proof was rejected, and a ruling that the statute was repugnant to the 14th Amendment was refused. The plaintiff in error excepted and, after a verdict of guilty and sentence, took the case to the supreme judicial court. 187 Mass. 436, 73 N. E. 530. That court overruled the exceptions, whereupon the plaintiff in error brought the case here.\n This court is of opinion that the decision below was right. A majority of the court considers that the case is disposed of by the fact that the statute in question was in force when the plaintiff in error took its charter, and confines itself to that ground. The section of the Revised Laws (chap. 112,  72) was a continuation of Stat. 1900, chap. 197. Rev. Laws, chap. 226,  2. com. v. Anselvich, 186 Mass. 376, 379, 380, 104 Am. St. Rep. 590, 71 N. E. 790. The act of incorporation went into effect March 15, 1901. Stat. 1901, chap. 159. By the latter act the plaintiff in error was 'subject to all the duties, liabilities, and restrictions set forth in all general laws now or hereafter in force relating to street railways companies, except,' etc.  1. See also  2. There is no doubt that, by the law as understood in Massachusetts, at least, the provisions of Rev. Laws, Chap. 112,  72, Stat. 1900, chap. 197, if they had been inserted in the charter in terms, would have bound the corporation, whether such requirements could be made constitutionally of an already existing corporation or not. The railroad company would have come into being and have consentedto come into being subject to the liability, and could not be heard to complain. Rockport Water Co. v. Rockport, 161 Mass. 279, 37 N. E. 168; Ashley v. Ryan, \n153 \nU.S. 436, 443\n, 38 S. L. ed. 773, 777, 4 Inters. Com. Rep. 664, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 865; Wight v. Davidson, \n181 \nU.S. 371, 377\n, 45 S. L. ed. 900, 903, 21 Sup. Ct.

Laws, 112,  72, referred specifically to another document expressing them, and purported to incorporate it, of course the charter would have the same effect as if it itself contained the words. If the document was identified, it would not matter what its own nature or effect might be, as the force given to it \n\n[207 U.S. 79, 85]\n\u00a0\n by reference and incorporation would be derived wholly from the charter. The document, therefore, might as well be an unconstitutional as a constitutional law. See Com. v. Melville, 160 Mass. 307, 308, 35 N. E. 863. But the contents of a document may be incorporated or adopted as well by generic as by specific reference, if only the purport of the adopting statute is clear. Corry v. Baltimore, \n196 \nU.S. 466, 477\n, 49 S. L. ed. 556, 562, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 297. See Purdy v. Erie R. Co. 162 N. Y. 42, 48 L.R.A. 669, 56 N. E. 508.\n Speaking for myself alone, I think that there are considerations on the other side from the foregoing argument that make it unsafe not to discuss the validity of the regulation apart from the supposition that the plaintiff in error has accepted it. See W. W. Cargill Co. v. Minnesota, \n180 \nU.S. 452, 468\n, 45 S. L. ed. 619, 626, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 423. Therefore I proceed to state my grounds for thinking the statute constitutional irrespective of any disabilities to object to its terms.\n The discrimination alleged is the express exception from the act of 1900 of the Boston Elevated Railway Company and the railways then owned, leased, or operated by it. But, in the first place, this was a legislative adjudication concerning a specific road, as in Wight v. Davidson, \n181 U.S. 371\n, 45 L. ed. 900, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 616, not a general prospective classification as in Martin v. District of Columbia, \n205 \nU.S. 135, 138\n, 51 S. L. ed. 743, 744, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 440. A general law must be judged by public facts, but a specific adjudication may depend upon many things not judicially known. Therefore the law must be sustained on this point unless the facts offered in evidence clearly show that the exception cannot be upheld. But the local facts are not before us, and it follows that we cannot say that the legislature could not have been justified in thus limiting its action. Covington & L. Turnp. Road Co. v. Sandford, \n164 \nU.S. 578, 597\n, 598 S., 41 L. ed. 560, 566, 567, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 198. In the next place, if the only ground were that the charter of the elevated railway contained a contract against the imposition of such a requirement, it would be attributing to the 14th Amendment an excessively nice operation to say that the immunity of a single corporation prevented the passage of an otherwise desirable and wholesome law. It is unnecessary to consider what would be the \n\n[207 U.S. 79, 86]\n\u00a0\n effect on the statute by construction in Massachusetts if the exception could not be upheld. For, if in order to avoid the Scylla of unjustifiable class legislation, the law were read as universal (see Dunbar v. Boston & P. R. Corp. 181 Mass. 383, 386, 63 N. E. 916), it might be thought by this court to fall into the Charybdis of impairing the obligation of a contract with the elevated road, although that objection might, perhaps, be held not to be open to the plaintiff in error here (New York ex rel. Hatch v. Reardon, \n204 \nU.S. 152, 160\n, 51 S. L. ed. 415, 422, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 188).\n The objection that seems to me, as it seemed to the court below, most serious, is that the statute unjustifiably appropriates the property of the plaintiff in error. It is hard to say that street railway companies are not subjected to a loss. The conventional fare of 5 cents presumably is not more than a reasonable fare, and it is at least questionable whether street railway companies would be permitted to increase it on the ground of this burden. It is assumed by the statute in question that the ordinary fare may be charged for these children or some of them when not going to or from school. Whatever the fare, the statute, fairly construed, means that children going to or from school must be carried for half the sum that would be reasonable compensation for their carriage if we looked only to the business aspect of the question. Moreover, while it may be true that in some cases rates or fares may be reduced to an unprofitable point in view of the business as a whole or upon special considerations ( Minneapolis & St. L. R. Co. v. Minnesota, \n186 \nU.S. 257, 267\n, 46 S. L. ed. 1151, 1157, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 900), it is not enough to justify a general law like this, that the companies concerned still may be able to make a profit from other sources, for all that appears (Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. North Carolina Corp. Commission, \n206 \nU.S. 1, 24\n, 25 S., 51 L. ed. 933, 944, 945, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 585).\n Notwithstanding the foregoing considerations I hesitatingly agree with the state court that the requirement may be justified under what commonly is called the police power. The obverse way of stating this power in the sense in which I am using the phrase would be that constitutional rights, like others, \n\n[207 U.S. 79, 87]\n\u00a0\n are matters of degree, and that the great constitutional provisions for the protection of property are not to be pushed to a logical extreme, but must be taken to permit the infliction of some fractional and relatively small losses without compensation, for some, at least, of the purposes of wholesome legislation. Martin v. District of Columbia, \n205 \nU.S. 135, 139\n, 51 S. L. ed. 743, 744, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 440; Camfield v. United States, \n167 \nU.S. 518, 524\n, 42 S. L. ed. 260, 262, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 864.\n It the 14th Amendment is not to be a greater hamper upon the established practices of the states im common with other governments than I think was intended, they must be allowed a certain latitude in the minor adjustments of life, even though by their action the burdens of a part of the community are somewhat increased. The traditions and habits of centuries were not intended to be overthrown when that Amendment was passed.\n Education is one of the purposes for which what is called the police power may be exercised. Barbier v. Connolly, \n113 \nU.S. 27, 31\n, 28 S. L. ed. 923, 924, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 357. Massachusetts always has recognized it as one of the first objects of public care. It does not follow that it would be equally in accord with the conceptions at the base of our constitutional law to confer equal favors upon doctors, or working men, or people who could afford to by 1000-mile tickets. Structural habits count for as much as logic in drawing the line. And, to return to taking of property, the aspect in which I am considering the case, general taxation to maintain public schools is an appropriation of property to a use in which the taxpayer may have no private interest, and, it may be, against his will. It has been condemned by some theorists on that ground. Yet no one denies its constitutionality. People are accustomed to it and accept it without doubt. The present requirement is not different in fundamental principle, although the tax is paid in kind and falls only on the class capable of paying that kind of tax,-a class of quasi public corporations specially subject to legislative control.\n Thus the question narrows itself to the magnitude of the burden imposed,-to whether the tax is so great as to exceed \n\n[207 U.S. 79, 88]\n\u00a0\n the limits of the police power. Looking at the law without regard to its special operation I should hesitate to assume that its total effect, direct and indirect, upon the roads outside of Boston, amounted to a more serious burden than a change in the law of nuisance, for example, might be. See further, Williams v. Parker, \n188 U.S. 491\n, 47 L. ed. 559, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 440. Turning to the specific effect, the offer of proof was cautious. It was simply that a 'considerable percentage' of the passengers carried by the company consisted of pupils of the public schools. This might be true without the burden becoming serious. I am not prepared to overrule the decision of the legislature and of the highest court of Massachusetts, that the requirement is reasonable under the conditions existing there, upon evidence that goes no higher than this. It is not enough that a statute goes to the verge of constitutional power. We must be able to see clearly that it goes beyond that power. In case of real doubt a law must be sustained.\n Mr. Justice Harlan is of opinion that the constitutionality of the act of 1900 is necessarily involved in the determination of this case.\n He thinks the act is not liable to the objection that it denies to the railway company the equal protection of the laws. Nor does he think that it can be held, upon any showing made by this record, to be unconstitutional as depriving the plaintiff in error of its property without due process of law. Upon these grounds alone, and independent of any other question discussed, he joins in a judgment of affirmance.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice Moody, having been of counsel, did not sit in this case. \n\n\n\n","81":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nIROQUOIS TRANSP. CO. v. DE LANEY FORGE & IRON CO.(1907)\nNo. 218\nArgued: February 28, 1907Decided: April 8, 1907\n\n\n\n\n[205 U.S. 354, 355]\n\u00a0\n These cases may be considered together. They are writs of error to the judgments of the supreme court of Michigan affirming the decrees of the circuit court of Wayne county, Michigan, enforcing liens for the De Laney Forge & Iron Company, defendant in error, in 218, and George W. Edwards and others, defendants in error in 219, and interveners in the original case.\n The Winnebago, a steel steamer of 1,091 tons burden, was built by the Columbia Iron Works, at St. Clair, Michigan. The contract price was $95, 000; date of contract, March 8, 1902; between the Columbia Iron Works and John J. Boland and Thomas J. Prindeville. It was understood that these persons should organize a corporation to be known as the Iroquois Transportation Company. The contract price was to be paid, $31,000 in cash, from time to time; for the balance the transportation company was to execute its notes to the amount of $16,000, to issue bonds for $48,000, to be secured by mortgage upon its property. On April 5, 1902, Boland and Prindeville assigned the contract to the Iroquois Transportation Company. Payments were made on the contract as follows: $7,500, at date of signing contract; 7,500, April 3, 1902; 4,000, April 14, 1902; 4,000, June 15, 1902; 4,000, July 15, 1902\n\n\n An additional $4,000 was paid on October 3, 1902, and two negotiable notes of $4,000 given, maturing respectively November 1, 1903, and November 1, 1904.\n The steamer was launched March 21, 1903. After she was in the water the work on the contract continued. On July 18, 1903, she was inspected, measured, enrolled, and licensed to \n\n[205 U.S. 354, 356]\n\u00a0\n be employed in domestic and foreign trade. This license was issued in the name of the Columbia Iron Works as owner.\n On July 19, 1903, the Iroquois Transportation Company received a bill of sale of the steamer and delivered to the Columbia Iron Works ninety-six negotiable bonds of $500 each, secured by mortgage on the steamer, and paid the balance of the purchase money, which was to be paid in cash, then amounting between $400 and $500.\n The agreement recited that possession was given to the Iroquois Transportation Company for the purpose of completing and finishing up those things still remaining undone on the steamer and required to be done by the iron works by the terms of the contract for the construction of the steamer, 'it being the sole intent and purpose of this agreement to enable the Iroquois Transportation Company to obtain immediate possession of the steamer, and without intending either to limit the extent of the obligation of said Columbia Iron Works under the original specifications.'\n The steamer left St. Clair for Lorain, Ohio, July 19, 1903. At that time she was not completed, and workmen remained on her and went with her to St. Clair, where additional work was done upon her. She was afterwards engaged in carrying cargoes between points on Lake Erie and Lake Superior.\n On July 30, 1903, the Columbia Iron Works made an assignment for the benefit of creditors. On August 25, 1903, the De Laney Forge & Iron Company served notice on the Iroquois Transportation Company that it made a claim of lien against the steamer for forging and material furnished; and on October 6, 1903, complaint was filed in the circuit court of Wayne county, Michigan, and shortly thereafter Edwards and others intervened in the case, claiming a lien. The Iroquois Company gave a bond under the statute for the release of the vessel. Decrees were rendered in favor of the claimants and interveners in the circuit court of Wayne county, and upon appeal they were affirmed in the supreme court of Michigan, 142 Mich. 84, 105 N. W. 527.\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n The Michigan statute under which the liens are claimed in this case is as follows:\n'Third Compiled Laws of Michigan, p. 3254:\n\n'(10789) Sec. 2. Every water craft of above 5 tons burden, used or intended to be used, in navigating the waters of this state, shall be subject to a lien thereon: \n\n[205 U.S. 354, 357]\n\u00a0\n 'First, for all debts contracted by the owner or part owner, master, clerk, agent, or steward of such craft, on account of supplies and provisions furnished for the use of said water craft, on account of work done or services rendered, on board of such craft by seamen or any employee other than the master thereof; on account of work done or service rendered by any person in or about the loading or unloading of said water craft; on account of work done or materials furnished by mechanics, tradesmen, or others, in or about the building, repairing, fitting, furnishing, or equipping such craft: Provided, That when labor shall be performed or materials furnished, as aforesaid, by a subcontractor or workman other than an original contractor, and the same is not paid for, said person or persons may give the owner or his agent, or the master or clerk of said craft, timely notice of his or their said claim, and from thenceforth said person or persons shall have a lien upon said craft pro rata for his or their said claims, to the amount that may be due by said owner to said original contractor for work or labor then done on said water craft.'\n\n Messrs. Charles E. Kremer and William T. Gray for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[205 U.S. 354, 358]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Herbert K. Oakes, John C. Shaw, Charles B. Warren, William B. Cady, Joseph C. Hamblen, Jr., and Hugh Shepherd for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Day:\n\n\n[205 U.S. 354, 360]\n\u00a0\n Several objections are urged by the plaintiff in error which, if sustained, will result in the reversal of the judgments of the supreme court of Michigan. Some of them are of a non-Federal character. It is insisted that the statute does not apply in this case, because the steamer Winnebago was not to be used in navigating the waters of Michigan, within the terms of the statute. But this only presents a question of state law, upon which the judgment of the state court is final and conclusive. The same may be said as to the objection because the transportation company was a bona fide purchaser without notice of complainant's lien, and because complainant did not within a year file its claim for a lien with the proper court in the county in which it resided. These are state questions, likewise concluded by the decision of the state court.\n It is further contended that to seize the vessel and subject her to sale and the proceeds thereof to distribution in the state court would be in direct conflict with the exclusive jurisdiction in admiralty in the courts of the United States in favor of liens of a maritime character, and therefore the Michigan act is unconstitutional. No maritime lien is asserted in this case, and it is merely a matter of speculation as to whether any such claim existed, or might be thereafter asserted. No holder of any such maritime lien is here contesting the constitutionality of the state law.\n In a case from a state court, this court does not listen to objections of those who do not come within the class whose constitutional rights are alleged to be invaded; or hold a law unconstitutional because, as against the class making no complaint, the law might be so held. This was distinctly ruled in a case decided at this term. New York ex rel. Hatch v. Reardon, \n204 U.S. 152\n, 51 L. ed. 415, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 188. See also Albany County v. Stanley, \n105 U.S. 305\n-311, 26 L. ed. 1044-1049; Lampasas v. Bell, \n180 \nU.S. 276, 283\n, 284 S., 45 L. ed. 527, 530, 531, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 368; Clark v. Kansas City, \n176 U.S. 114\n-118, 44 L. ed. 392-396, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 284; Cronin v. Adams, \n192 U.S. 108\n-114, 48 L. ed. 365- 368, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 219.\n There is no one in position in this case to make this objection, and, for aught that this record discloses, no such maritime \n\n[205 U.S. 354, 361]\n\u00a0\n lien existed. If this statute is broad enough to include strictly maritime liens, it can only be held unconstitutional, in a case coming from a state court, where the complaint on that ground is made by the holder of such a demand. We agree with Judge Severns, speaking for the circuit court of appeals for the sixth circuit, in a case directly involving this question, where other claimants upon the Winnebago had removed a case to the United States circuit court for the eastern district of Michigan, whence it was taken to the circuit court of appeals:\n'And the fact that she [the Winnebago] might become subject to maritime liens would not destroy liens already lawfully acquired. It is true she might become subject to maritime liens which would be superior to the existing lien, and that such liens would have to be enforced in the admiralty. But that possibility does not defeat the enforcement by a state court of the nonmaritime lien to which she is subject. How else is the owner of the latter to obtain his remedy? It may be the vessel will never become subject to maritime liens at all; and, if so, the holder of the existing lien may never have even the privilege of proving his claim in some cause instituted for another purpose. But no such supposed embarrassment has yet occurred. And they are as yet imaginary. But suppose such other liens should attach. That should not prevent the enforcement of the earlier lien in the proper court. If the holder of the earlier lien delays his action, he subjects himself to the danger of superior liens becoming fastened, and the enforcement of his own lien in the state court must leave the vessel subject to the superior liens of which the state court cannot take cognizance. If occasion requires, and the admiralty court enforces the superior liens, it is in no wise obstructed by the action of the state court, and a title under a decree of the former court would defeat the title gained under the decree of the state court. The case of Moran v. Sturges, \n154 U.S. 256\n, 38 L.ed. 981, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1019, is a good illustration of this subject. There is no difficulty other than such as may happen in case one court should take and have possession of the vessel at a time when the other \n\n[205 U.S. 354, 362]\n\u00a0\n should require it; but that is an incident common along all the lines of concurrent proceedings in the state and Federal courts, and gives no ground for the denial of jurisdiction to either.' The Winnebago, 73 C. C. A. 295, 141 Fed. 945.\n\n It is next insisted that the materials and supplies were not furnished on the credit of the vessel, but were contracted for, furnished, and delivered on the credit of the Columbia Iron Works.\n The findings upon this proposition are again questions within the exclusive jurisdiction of the state court. The findings will not be disturbed here.\n It is next objected that the court erred because certain items were allowed for material furnished the vessel after she was launched, and therefore the subject of exclusive jurisdiction for which a lien could only be enforced in the admiralty. But we agree with the state court that these items were really furnished for the completion of the vessel, and were fairly a part of her original construction. In such a case the remedy was within the jurisdiction of the state court. The Iosco, 1 Brown, Adm. 495, Fed. Cas. No. 7,060; The Victorian, 24 Or. 121, 41 Am. St. Rep. 838, 32 Pac. 1040; The Winnebago, 73 C. C. A. 295, 141 Fed. 945.\n It is urged that the attempt to enforce the lien on the vessel was while she was engaged in interstate commerce, and therefore proceedings against her were unlawful and void, in view of the exclusive control of this subject by Congress under the Constitution and laws of the United States. But it must be remembered that concerning contracts not maritime in their nature, the state has authority to make lawa and enforce liens, and it is no valid objection that the enforcement of such laws may prevent or obstruct the prosecution of a voyage of an interstate character. The laws of the states enforcing attachment and execution in cases cognizable in state courts have been sustained and upheld. Johnson v. Chicago & P. Elevator Co. \n119 U.S. 388\n-398, 30 L. ed. 447-480, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 254. The State may pass laws enforcing the rights of its citizens which affect interstate commerce, but fall short of regulating such commerce in the sense \n\n[205 U.S. 354, 363]\n\u00a0\n in which the Constitution gives exclusive jurisdiction to Congress. Sherlock v. Alling, \n93 U.S. 99\n-103, 23 L. ed. 819, 820; Kidd v. Pearson, \n128 \nU.S. 1, 23\n, 32 S. L. ed. 346, 351, 2 Inters. Com. Rep. 232, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 6; Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Hughes, \n191 U.S. 477\n, 48 L. ed. 268, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 132.\n Upon the subject, Mr. Justice Brown, speaking for the court in Knapp, S. & Co. Co. v. McCaffrey, \n177 U.S. 638\n-642, 44 L. ed. 921-923, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 824-827, said:\n'That wherever any lien is given by a state statute for a cause of action cognizable in admiralty, either in rem or in personam, proceedings in rem to enforce such lien are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the admiralty courts.\n\n'But the converse of this proposition is equally true, that if a lien upon a vessel be created for a claim over which a court of admiralty has no jurisdiction in any form, such lien may be enforced in the courts of the state. Thus, as the admiralty jurisdiction does not extend to a contract for building a vessel, or to work done or materials furnished in its construction (People's Ferry Co. v. Berrs, 20 How. 393, 15 L. ed. 961; Roach v. Chapman, 22 How. 129, 16 L. ed. 294), we held in Edwards v. Elliott, 21 Wall. 532, 22 L. ed. 487, that in respect to such contracts it was competent for the states to enact such laws as their legislatures might deem just and expedient, and to provide for their enforcement in rem.'\n\n The contract in this case being for the construction of a vessel, and its enforcement within the power and jurisdiction of the state courts, we do not think that execution of such a decree can be avoided because the vessel engaged in interstate commerce.\n Finally, an elaborate and able argument is made in support of the contention that a contract to build a ship is a maritime contract, and therefore can be enforced only in admiralty; but, as late as this term, in Graham & M. Transp. Co. v. Craig Shipguilding Co., this contention was overruled upon the authority of the previous decisions of this court. \n203 U.S. 577\n, 51 L. ed. --, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 777.\n The judgments of the Supreme Court of Michigan are affirmed. \n\n\n\n","82":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJ. B. ORCUTT CO. v. GREEN(1907)\nNo. 116\nArgued: December 6, 1906Decided: January 7, 1907\n\n\n\n This case comes here upon return to a writ of certiorari, issued by this court to the circuit court of appeals of the second circuit. It is a proceeding in bankruptcy, and the question involved is one in regard to the sufficiency of the filing of certain proofs of claims against the bankrupts' estate.\n The facts are these: Messrs. Ingalls Brothers were adjudicated bankrupts in proceedings in the district court of the United States for the northern district of New York on the 3d day of December, 1902. Soon thereafter one Charles Duncan was appointed trustee, and on the 19th day of December, 1902, he duly verified a proof of claim in his own behalf for $ 4,171, admitting an offset of $327. On the 1st of April, 1903, the J. B. Orcutt Company duly verified a proof of claim against the bankrupts' estate for $893.68, and in a short time delivered it to the trustee. At the first meeting of creditors Charles H. Dauchy Company presented to the referee a defective proof of claim against said bankrupts for $3,335.67, which was returned by the referee to said company \n\n[204 U.S. 96, 97]\n\u00a0\n for correction. Prior to January 23, 1903, the Dauchy Company duly verified another proof of claim in the same amount, prepared by Henry W. Smith, the attorney for the trustee, who had volunteered teered to prepare the same so as to comply with the rules, and on or about March 15, 1903, the Dauchy Company delivered this proof of claim to the trustee. Prior to June 1, 1903, the trustee delivered all three claims to said Henry W. Smith, with directions to file the same with the referee, which the attorney promised to do. In this he failed. When the attorney Smith received these claims from the trustee he handed them to a clerk in his office, directing him to put them with the papers in this proceeding, and shortly after told the clerk to file the proofs of the claim with the referee. The clerk neglected to do so, and some time afterwards, upon being asked in regard to it, said that he would do so immediately. This was before the expiration of the year after the adjudication. But he again failed to make the filing. The Dauchy proof, which had been left with the attorney, is lost and cannot be found, after diligent search made by the attorney for it in his office. The other two claims, the Orcutt Company and Duncan's own claim, were found in a package of papers relating to another bankruptcy proceeding. Another proof of claim, for the same amount, was made by the Dauchy Company April 2, 1904, and, with the Duncan and Orcutt proofs, was presented to the referee for filing, each proof being accompanied by a petition, dated April 2, 1904, for leave to file each of said claims nunc pro tunc as of a date prior to December 3, 1903, or for such other or further relief as might be just and proper. Smith was not the attorney for any of the claimants, and his failure to file with the referee was not by virtue of any instructions to withhold such claims from filing, nor was it known on the part of any of the claimants that he had failed to file them until more than a year after the adjudication.\n Upon the presentation of these claims with the petition, other creditors of the bankrupts objected to the granting of the relief asked in the petition, upon the ground that the claims \n\n[204 U.S. 96, 98]\n\u00a0\n had not been seasonably presented to the court, and were barred under the provisions of  57n of the bankruptcy act. [30 Stat. at L. 561, chap. 541, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3444.]\n Upon the hearing of the petition for leave to file these proofs of claim, the referee to whom the case had been referred denied the petition, under the objection of other creditors, on the ground that, one year having expired subsequent to the adjudication of bankruptcy and prior to the filing of the several petitions and the presentation therewith to the referee, the referee had no power to permit the filing of said proofs of claims, and that neither the referee nor the court had any discretionary power to permit either of said proofs of claims to be filed, either nunc pro tunc or otherwise. An order denying the relief asked was duly entered.\n The referee then certified for review by the district court the question whether his decision was correct in refusing the relief stated by the claimants.\n The district court directed that the claims of the petitioning creditors should be filed as of the date when delivered to the trustee.\n Charles H. Green, one of the creditors of the bankrupts, thereupon appealed from the order of the district court reversing the determination made by the referee, to the United States circuit court of appeals for the second circuit, and in his appeal, in view of the position of the trustee and his refusal himself to act in the matter, Green asked that he might be permitted to prosecute the appeal for himself and the other creditors. The district court thereupon allowed the appeal and cited the respondents to appear in the circuit court of appeals. That court, having heard the case argued, reversed the decision of the district court, and affirmed that of the referee. A brief memorandum was filed by the court, in which it was stated that the referee had given a very full examination of the question of law involved, and that the court concurred in his interpretation of the statute, and that his opinion might be printed as a supplement to the memorandum of the court. \n\n[204 U.S. 96, 99]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Reginald S. Huidekoper, Charles Cowles Tucker, and J. Miller Kenyon for petitioners.\n Messrs. Herbert D. Bailey and Frank H. Deal for respondents.\n\n\n[204 U.S. 96, 100]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The question in this case resolves itself into one of the sufficiency of the presentation of proofs of claims of the creditors named in the foregoing statement. They were, in reality, presented and delivered to the trustee in bankruptcy before the expiration of one year after adjudication, but there was no actual filing of the claims with the referee until after the expiration of that time, when the attempt to file them with the petition was made as above stated.\n The question turns upon the construction of some of the subdivisions of the 57th section of the bankruptcy act, together with the 21st general order in bankruptcy, the last part of which reads: 'Proofs of debt received by any trustee shall be delivered to the referee to whom the cause is referred.'\n Subsection a of  57 provides that 'proof of claims shall consist of a statement under oath, in writing, signed by a creditor, setting forth the claim, the consideration therefor, and whether any, and, if so, what, securities are held therefor; and whether any, and, if so, what, payments have been made thereon, and that the sum claimed is justly owing from the bankrupt to the creditor.'\n Subsection c provides that 'claims, after being proved, may \n\n[204 U.S. 96, 101]\n\u00a0\n for the purpose of allowance, be filed by the claimants in the court where the proceedings are pending, or before the referee if the case has been referred.'\n Subsection d provides that 'claims which have been duly proved shall be allowed, upon receipt by or upon presentation to the court, unless objection to their allowance shall be made by parties in interest, or their consideration be continued for cause by the court upon its own motion.'\n Subsection n provides that 'claims shall not be proved against a bankrupt estate subsequent to one year after the adjudication.'\n If the presentation and delivery of these proofs of claim in the case before us with the trustee was sufficient within the meaning of the bankruptcy act, then the referee should have proceeded to determine the question of their allowance, when presented to him, the same as if they had been filed with him personally within the year subsequent to adjudication.\n We have been referred to no case in this court deciding the exact question, nor is there cited any case in the lower courts wherein it has been decided, with the exception of that of Re Seff, district court of United States, southern district of New York (not reported), where the question before us seems to have been directly before that court, and the decision was in favor of the sufficiency of the filing with the trustee. The parties hereto have cited a great many cases in the lower courts deciding questions somewhat analogous to the one now before us, but none in which this question has been decided. We, therefore, think it unnecessary to refer to them.\n We are of opinion, taking into consideration the various provisions of the 57th section of the bankruptcy act, in connection with No. 21 of the general orders in bankruptcy, adopted by this court, that the presentation and delivery of proofs of claim to the trustee in bankruptcy within the year after the adjudication is a filing within the statute and the general order above mentioned.\n The general orders of this court are provided for by  \n\n[204 U.S. 96, 102]\n\u00a0\n 30 of the bankruptcy act, which enacts that 'all necessary rules, forms, and orders as to procedure and for carrying this cat into force and effect shall be prescribed, and may be amended from time to time, by the Supreme Court of the United States.' Under that section this court had the power to provide, as it has done in order 21, that 'proofs of debt received by any trustee shall be delivered to the referee to whom the cause is referred.' There is nothing in that provision inconsistent with, or opposed to, anything stated in the bankruptcy law upon the subject, and we must, therefore, take the statute and the order and read them together, the order being simply somewhat of an amplification of the law with respect to procedure, but nothing which can be construed as beyond the powers granted to the court by virtue of the law itself. The question is not whether anyone but the court or referee can pass upon a claim and allow it or disallow it. That must be done by the court or referee; but it is simply whether a delivery of a claim, properly proved, to the trustee, is a sufficient filing. The law provides (subsection c of  57) that the claims, after being proved, may, for the purpose of allowance, be filed by the claimants in the court where the proceedings are pending, or before the referee, if the case has been referred; but that does not prohibit their being filed somewhere else prior to their allowance, and the order in bankruptcy in substance provides that they may be filed, after being proved, with the trustee. Such order is equivalent to saying that proofs of debt (or claim) may be received by the trustee. When they are so received by him they are in legal effect received by the court, whose officer the trustee is. Having been received by the trustee, under authority of law, the proofs of debt are thereby sufficiently filed so far as the creditors are concerned, and it is the duty of the trustee to deliver them to the referee. If the trustee inadvertently neglects to perform that duty it is the neglect of an officer of the court, and the creditors are in no way responsible therefor. The presentation and filing have been made within the time provided for and with one of the proper \n\n[204 U.S. 96, 103]\n\u00a0\n officers, his failure to deliver to the referee cannot be held to be a failure on the part of the creditor to properly file his proofs.\n Not much benefit can be derived from an examination of the bankruptcy act of 1867 [14 Stat. at L. 517, chap. 176], in reference to the provisions therein contained, granting power to the justices of the Supreme Court to frame general orders for the purpose named. See  10, bankruptcy act of 1867. We think it plain that, so far as this matter is concerned, the Supreme Court had full power to make the general order it did.\n Different considerations, however, apply to the one claim made by the trustee himself. We do not think that in any event a trustee could file with himself his proof of his own claim against the estate of the bankrupt. General principles of law forbid that he should so act in his own case. And his delivery of his own claim to his attorney could not make such delivery stand in the place of a delivery to the referee.\n Thes views lead to a reversal of the order of the Circuit Court of Appeals, and the affirmance of the order made by the District Court, with the modification, refusing the filing of the proof of claim of the trustee himself.\n And it is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] U.

COGSWELL(1907)\nNo. 80\nArgued: November 2, 1906Decided: January 7, 1907\n\n\n\n The Second National Bank of Norwich, Connecticut, was a banking association, organized and existing under the laws of the United States, with a capital stock of $300,000.\n As stated, in substance, by the supreme court of errors of Connecticut, the directors, having voted to recommend a reduction of the capital stock from $300,000 to $200,000, were advised by the Comptroller of the Currency that it would be approved, 'provided so much of the amount as is necessary is used to charge off bad, doubtful, and unproductive assets, the difference only being paid to the shareholders in cash,' \n\n[204 U.S. 1, 2]\n\u00a0\n and that 'the shareholders of a national bank, upon a reduction in capital stock, are entitled to either receive the cash or the charged-off assets, and neither can be withheld without their consent.' The Comptroller also informed the president of the bank: 'The assets belong to the stockholders of record, and a trust fund must be created, so that those assets may be distributed among the stockholders of record when your capital is reduced.' The stockholders, in May, 1900, voted to make the reduction, and the president first, and then the directors, filed with the Comptroller a written statement that 'the whole amount of the reduction, viz., $100,000, will be used for the purpose of charging off bad, doubtful, and unproductive assets, no money to be paid to the shareholders unless realized from said assets, which are to be set aside and collected for the benefit of the shareholders of record at date of the issuance of the Comptroller's certificate approving the reduction.' The Comptroller gave his certificate, dated June 9, 1900, approving the reduction, without any qualifications.\n'On June 27th a schedule of certain assets of the bank, each item being given a valuation, and the total valuations of all amounting to $100, 307.86, was presented to the directors, who thereupon voted that the assets so scheduled, 'which assets are considered either bad or doubtful, and on account of which the capital stock of the bank has been reduced from $300,000 to $200,000, be set aside from the other assets of the bank, and be held by it in trust for the stockholders of record on the 9th day of June, 1900, and that whatever may be realized from said assets be distributed from time to time as may be reasonable among said stockholders in proportion to their respective holdings on said date.'\n\n'Thereupon the account with capital stock on the books of the bank was credited with a reduction of $100,000, and the items named in the schedule above described were charged to the account of profit and loss at the valuation of $100,307.86. Some of the items were of real estate; the rest were not well \n\n[204 U.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n secured; and all were those referred to in the directors' statement to the Comptroller, dated June 9th.\n\n'This left the bank with good assets worth over $240,000.\n\n'The bank thereafter, until its charter expired in 1903, kept a separate account relating to the assets included in the schedule, entitled 'Stockholders' Trust,' in which were credited all collections and charged all expenditures arising in connection with endeavors to realize upon them.\n\n'Two of the scheduled items represented claims for a larger amount; the valuation affixed to each representing the estimated loss upon it. The same claims were also entered in the books of the bank, as part of its remaining capital, at a valuation for each equal to the difference between its face and the valuation assigned to it in the schedule.\n\n'The receiver has received $20,240 on account of the scheduled assets. Some of them also remain uncollected, but have a value. To one of the items, entered as 'Demand loans, E. A. Packer, $15,647.50.' belonged certain railroad stock held as collateral security. A note for over $1,000, made by 'C. P. Cogswell, trustee,' and discounted by the bank to pay an assessment on this stock, was included in the reduced capital of $200,000, and in March, 1903, was paid off from the proceeds of sales of the stock; leaving a balance of such proceeds, which was included in the $20,240 above mentioned.\n\n'All the certificates representing the shares in the original capital were, on or about July 1st, 1900, exchanged by the holders for certificates in favor of each for two thirds of the number of his original shares.'\n\n The charter of the bank expired by lapse of time February 24, 1903, and its affairs were being settled in the manner provided by law, when a complaint in equity was filed by a stockholder in the superior court of Connecticut, asking for the appointment of a receiver to wind up its affairs, because of alleged misappropriation, and a receiver was appointed. The receiver filed a petition with the court, stating that in May, 1900, the capital stock of the bank was reduced from \n\n[204 U.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n $300,000 to $200,000, and that thereupon assets of the face value of $100, 000 were charged off and set aside, and that a question had arisen as to whether the proceeds of those assets be distributed to the stockholders of record at the time of the reduction or of the expiration of the charter.\n Claims to the charged-off assets by virtue of ownership of original stock when capital was reduced; of such stock, although it had been surrendered and new stock issued; and of stock after the reduction,-were filed.\n The superior court held that those assets belonged to the bank, and should be distributed to the stockholders of record at the expiration of its charter.\n The supreme court of errors adjudged that the stockholders of record at time of reduction were entitled to the charged-off assets, and reversed the judgment of the superior court, with directions to distribute accordingly. 78 Conn. 75, 60 Atl. 1059\n\n\n Whereupon this writ of error was brought.\n Messrs. Donald G. Perkins and William H. Shields for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[204 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Frank T. Brown and Hadlai A. Hull for defendants in error.\n\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is not a case involving the rights of creditors or of minority stockholders as such, but a case raising the bare question to whom assets remaining on a valid reduction of the capital stock of a national bank belong.\n The national banking act (title 62, Rev. Stat.) provides:\n'Sec. 5143 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3463). Any association formed under this title may, by the vote of shareholders owning two thirds of its capital stock, reduce its capital to any sum not below the amount \n\n[204 U.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n required by this title to authorize the formation of associations; but no such reduction shall be allowable which will reduce the capital of the association below the amount required for its outstanding circulation, nor shall any such reduction be made until the amount of the proposed reduction has been reported to the Comptroller of the Currency, and his approval thereof obtained.'\n\n The reduction in this case was accomplished at a time when the bank was not being wound up, by the required vote of the stockholders, and with the approval of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the new shares on the basis of the reduction were accepted by all the stockholders.\n The bank was left with good assets of more than $240,000, or, in other words, with an unimpaired capital stock of $200,000 and a surplus of 20 per cent,-that is, $40,000, exclusive of the assets, the distribution of which is the matter in controversy. These assets were set apart in compliance with the requirement of the Comptroller that certain bad, doubtful, and unproductive assets should be charged off or set aside for the benefit of those who were stockholders at the date of the approval. This requirement, though not stated in the certificate of approval, was evidently, on the facts, made a condition thereof, and presumably in accordance with the practice of the Comptroller's office, and was imposed to the end that justice might be done to the owners of the original shares.\n It is said that the original capital of the bank of $300,000 was impaired prior to the reduction, say to the extent of $30,000, as shown by adding to the $240,000 the value of the scheduled assets, estimated at $30, 000.\n As a general rule, it may be admitted that where capital stock is impaired and a reduction is made merely to meet that impairment, there can be no distribution. But that is not this case, in which the stockholders of record June 9, 1900, had a right to require a distribution among them of an excess upon reduction in proportion to their respective holdings. In the language of the Connecticut supreme court: 'The \n\n[204 U.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n right to receive what might ultimately be realized from the fund thus set apart became, therefore, irrevocably vested in those who were shareholders on June 9th, 1900, and they or their assigns are now entitled to whatever is to be distributed from it.' [78 Conn. 79, 60 Atl. 1060.]\n It follows, as held, that the transfer of shares after the reduction of June 9, 1900, did not carry any right to an interest in the special trust fund, the proportionate interest therein having vested in the then shareholders as individuals. The result is unaffected by the fact that distribution in cash may have been contemplated as the assets set aside were realized upon.\n The conclusion at which we have arrived dispenses with the necessity of discussing other questions suggested.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","84":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJOHNSON v. BROWNE(1907)\nNo. 481\nArgued: Decided: April 8, 1907\n\n\n\n\n[205 U.S. 309, 310]\n\u00a0\n The respondent sued out a writ of habeas corpus from the circuit court of the United States for the southern district of New York, directed to the agent and warden of the state prison at Sing Sing, in the state of New York, where he was confined, and pursuant to the terms of the writ the respondent was brought before that court in New York city, and after a hearing the court ordered his discharge. The agent and warden has appealed to this court from that order.\n The facts appearing on the hearing before the circuit court on the return to the writ were these:\n The respondent was an examiner of silks in the appraisers' department in the port of New York, and in the spring of 1903, in the circuit court of the United States for the southern district of New York, a grand jury found two indictments against him, one being found against him jointly with two others for conspiring to defraud the United States in violation \n\n[205 U.S. 309, 311]\n\u00a0\n of  5440 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3676), and the other was against him alone for knowingly attempting to enter certain Japanese silks upon payment of less than the amount of legal duty thereon, in violation of  5444, Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3677).\n In January, 1904, he, in company with one of the others named in the indictment (the other having fled the jurisdiction), was tried in the circuit court of the United States for the southern district of New York upon the indictment charging them with conspiracy. He was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment in the state prison at Sing Sing, New York, for two years.\n He appealed to the circuit court of appeals for the second circuit, where the conviction was affirmed, and thereafter an application was made in his behalf to this court for certiorari to review the judgment of conviction, which application was denied in January, 1906\n\n\n After his trial and conviction, and pending a review of the judgment, the respondent had been enlarged on bail, and after the judgment was affirmed in the circuit court of appeals and a certiorari from this court had been denied, he was, on the 19th of January, 1906, duly called in the circuit court to submit himself to sentence, but did not appear, and his default was entered.\n A few days subsequently he was found in the Dominion of Canada. This government then instituted extradition proceedings in Montreal to procure his rendition upon the judgment of conviction of conspiracy to defraud the United States, and claimed it was an extraditable crime under the fourth subdivision of article 1 of the treaty or 'extradition convention' of 1889, between the United States and Great Britain. [26 Stat. at L. 1508.] That subdivision reads as follows:\n'4. Fraud by bailee, banker, agent, factor, trustee, or director or member or officer of any company made criminal by the laws of both countries.'\n\n The respondent was held for extradition by the Canadian \n\n[205 U.S. 309, 312]\n\u00a0\n commissioner, but, on writ of habeas corpus, the court of King's bench held that the conspiracy to defraua the United States, as set forth in the indictment upon which respondent was convicted, was not such a fraud as was provided for in the subdivision of the article of the treaty above referred to. Extradition was therefore refused.\n Thereupon the United States secured the rearrest of the respondent on another complaint, charging him with the offenses for which he had been indicted under  5444 of the Revised Statutes, and for which he had not been tried in New York. The Canadian commissioner held the respondent upon that complaint, and ordered his extradition, and, upon a writ of habeas corpus, the court of King's bench affirmed that order; and the respondent was then surrendered to the proper agent of the United States, who at once took him to the state of New York, and, having arrived within the southern district of that state, the marshal of that district, proceeding under the warrant for imprisonment issued by the circuit court upon the conviction of the respondent on the conspiracy indictment, took possession of him and delivered him into the custody of the warden of Sing Sing prison, there to be imprisoned for two years according to the sentence imposed upon him under the conviction as stated.\n The respondent then obtained this writ upon a petition setting forth the above facts, and claimed that his imprisonment was in violation of the 3d and 7th articles of the extradition treaty between the United States and Great Britain. 26 Stat. at L. 1508. The warden of the prison made return August 7, 1906, that he held the respondent by virtue of the final judgment of the circircuit court of the United States for the southern district of New York, rendered on the 9th of March, 1904, as above set forth.\n Mr. W. Wickham Smith and Solicitor General Hoyt for appellant.\n\n\n[205 U.S. 309, 314]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Terence J. McManus, W. M. K. Olcott, and Black, Olcott, Gruber, & Bonynge for appellee.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Peckham:\n\n\n[205 U.S. 309, 316]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n It does not appear that any movement has been made or notice given by this government to try the respondent on the indictment for the crime for which he has been extradited, but his imprisonment in Sing Sing prison is upon a conviction of a crime for which the Canadian court had refused to extradite him, and is entirely different from the one for which he was extradited. In other words, he has been extradited for one offense and is now imprisoned for another, which the Canadian court held was not, within the treaty, an extraditable offense.\n Whether the crime came within the provision of the treaty was a matter for the decision of the Dominion authorities, and such decision was final by the express terms of the treaty itself. Article 2, Convention of July 12, 1889, 26 Stat. at L. 1508; United States Treaties in Force April 28, 1904, pages 350, 351.\n We can readily conceive that if the Dominion authorities, after the court of King's bench had decided that the crime of which respondent had been convicted, and for which extradition had been asked, was not extraditable, and the request for extradition had, therefore, been refused, had been informed on the subsequent proceeding for extradition on the other indictment that it was not the intention of this government to try respondent on that indictment, but that, having secured his extradition on that charge, it was the intention \n\n[205 U.S. 309, 317]\n\u00a0\n of this government to imprison him on the judgment of conviction, they would have said that such imprisonment would not be according to the terms of the treaty, and they would have refused to direct his extradition for the purpose stated.\n Although the surrender has been made, it is still our duty to determine the legality of the succeeding imprisonment, which depends upon the treaty between this government and Great Britain, known as the Ashburton treaty of 1842 (8 Stat. at L. 572-576, art. 10), and the subsequent one, called a convention, concluded in 1889, and above referred to.\n The treaty of 1842 had no express limitation of the right of the demanding country to try a person only for the crime for which he was extradited, and yet this court held that there was such a limitation, and that it was to be found in the 'manifest scope and object of the treaty itself;' that there is 'no reason to doubt that the fair purpose of the treaty is that the person shall be delivered up to be tried for that offense, and for no other.' United States v. Rauscher, \n119 \nU.S. 407, 422\n, 423 S., 30 L. ed. 425, 430, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 234.\n Again, at the time of the decision of the Rauscher Case there were in existence  5272 and 5275, Rev. Stat. (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 3595, 3596), both of which are cited and commented upon in that case, and in the course of the opinion of Mr. Justice Miller, at page 423, L. ed. page 430, Sup. Ct. Rep. page 243, he said:\n'The obvious meaning of these two statutes, which have reference to all treaties of extradition made by the United States, is that the party shall not be delivered up by this government to be tried for any other offense than that charged in the extradition proceedings; and that, when brought into this country upon similar proceedings, he shall not be arrested or tried for any other offense than that with which he was charged in those proceedings, until he shall have had a reasonable time to return unmolested to the country from which he was brought. This is undoubtedly a congressional construction of the purpose and meaning of extradition treaties, \n\n[205 U.S. 309, 318]\n\u00a0\n such as the one we have under consideration, and, whether it is or not, it is conclusive upon the judiciary of the right conferred upon persons brought from a foreign country into this under such proceedings.\n\n'That right, as we understand it, is that he shall be tried only for the offense with which he is charged in the extradition proceedings and for which he was delivered up, and that if not tried for that, or after trial and acquittal, he shall have a reasonable time to leave the country before he is arrested upon the charge of any other crime committed previous to his extradition.'\n\n Mr. Justice Gray, page 433, L. ed. page 433, Sup. Ct. Rep. page 248, in his concurring opinion, places that concurrence upon the single ground that these sections clearly manifest the will of the political department of the government in the form of an express law that the person should be tried only for the crime charged in the warrant of extradition, and he should be allowed a reasonable time to depart out of the United States before he could be arrested or detained for any other offense. Both grounds were concurred in by a majority of the whole court.\n If the question now before us had arisen under the treaty of 1842 and the sections of the Revised Statutes above mentioned, we think the proper construction of the treaty and the sections would have applied to the facts of this case and rendered the imprisonment of the respondent illegal. The manifest scope and object of the treaty itself, even without those sections of the Revised Statutes, would limit the imprisonment as well as the trial to the crime for which extradition had been demanded and granted.\n It is true that the 10th article of the treaty contained no specific provision for delivering up a convicted criminal, but, if otherwise delivered, he could not have been punished upon a former conviction for another and different offense.\n The claim is now made on the part of the government that 'the manifest scope and object of the treaty' of 1842 are altered and enlarged by the treaty or convention of July 12, \n\n[205 U.S. 309, 319]\n\u00a0\n 1889. The 2d, 3d, 6th, and 7th articles of that convention are set forth in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n It will be perceived that the second article provides that no person surrendered shall be triable or tried, or be punished, for any political crime or offense, while article three provides that no person surrendered shall be triable or be tried (leaving out the words 'or be punished') for any crime or offense committed prior to the extradition, other than the offense for \n\n[205 U.S. 309, 320]\n\u00a0\n which he was surrendered, until he shall have had an opportunity for returning to the country from which he was surrendered. Hence it is urged that, as punshment for another offense of which the person had been convicted is not in so many words expressly prohibited in and by article 3, a requisition may be obtained for one crime under that article, and, when possession of the person is thus obtained, he may be punished for another and totally different crime of which he had been convicted before extradition.\n We do not concur in this view. Although if the words 'or be punished' were contained in the 3d article the question in this case could not, of course, arise, yet we are satisfied that the whole treaty, taken in connection with that of 1842, fairly construed, does not permit of the imprisonment of an extradited person under the facts in this case.\n The mere failure to use these words in the 3d article does not so far change and alter 'the manifest scope and object' of the two treaties as to render this imprisonment legal. The general scope of the two treaties makes manifest an intention to prevent a state from obtaining jurisdiction of an individual whose extradition is sought on one ground and for one expressed purpose, and then, having obtained possession of his person, to use it for another and different purpose. Why the words were left out in the 3d article of the convention of 1889, when their insertion would have placed the subject entirely at rest, may perhaps be a matter of some possible surprise, yet their absence cannot so far alter the otherwise plain meaning of the two treaties as to give them a totally different construction.\n In addition to the provisions of the treaty of 1889 we find still in existence the already-mentioned sections of the Revised Statutes, which prohibit a person's arrest or trial for any other offense than that with which he was charged in the extradition proceedings, until he shall have had a reasonable time to return unmolested from the country to which he was brought.\n It is argued, however, that the sections in question have \n\n[205 U.S. 309, 321]\n\u00a0\n been repealed by implication by the treaty or convention of 1889, and that the respondent, therefore, cannot obtain any benefit from them. We see no fair or reasonable ground upon which to base the claim of repeal. Repeals by implication are never favored, and a later treaty will not be regarded as repealing an earlier statute by implication unless the two are absolutely incompatible and the statute cannot be enforced without antagonizing the treaty. United States v. Lee Yen Tai, \n185 U.S. 213\n, 46 L. ed. 878, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 629. If both can exist the repeal by implication will not be adjudged. These sections are not incompatible with the treaty or in any way inconsistent therewith. We find nothing in the treaty which provides that a person shall be surrendered for one offense and then that he may be punished for another, such as is the case here. The most that can be asserted is that an inference to that effect perhaps might be drawn from the absence in article 3 of positive language preventing such punishment. But that slight and doubtful inference, resting on such an insufficient foundation, is inadequate to overcome the positive provisions of the statute and the otherwise general scope of both treaties, which are inconsistent with the existence of such right.\n It is urged that the construction contended for by the respondent is exceedingly technical and tends to the escape of criminals on refined subtleties of statutory construction, and should not, therefore, be adopted. While the escape of criminals is, of course, to be very greatly deprecated, it is still most important that a treaty of this nature between sovereignties should be construed in accordance with the highest good faith, and that it should not be sought, by doubtful construction of some of its provisions, to obtain the extradition of a person for one offense and then punish him for another and different offense. Especially should this be the case where the government surrendering the person has refused to make the surrender for the other offense, on the ground that such offense was not one covered by the treaty.\n Our attention has been directed to various other treaties \n\n[205 U.S. 309, 322]\n\u00a0\n between this government and other nations, where provision is expressly made in regard to punishment. They frequently provide that no person shall be triable or tried 'or be punished' for any other offense than that for which he was delivered up until he has had an opportunity of returning to the country from which he was surrendered. But because in some of the treaties the words 'or be punished' are contained we are not required to hold that in the case before us the absence of those words permits such punishment, when that construction is, as we have said, contrary to the manifest meaning of the whole treaty, and also violates the statutes above cited.

Theall for appellants in No. 17.\n\n\n\n[204 U.S. 43, 46]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. J. J. Darlington and Leon Tobriner for appellee.\n\n\n[204 U.S. 43, 47]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justic e White delivered the opinion of the court:\n These appeals are from a decree of the court of appeals of the District of Columbia, which adjudged that a tax sale of certain real estate in the District was void, and which relieved the lessee of the premises from a threatened forfeiture of the lease, asserted to have resulted from the failure of the tenant to pay the taxes to enforce which the tax sale was made. The complainant in the original bill was Caroline King, the lessee \n\n[204 U.S. 43, 48]\n\u00a0\n of the premises, and the defendants were Marianne A. B. Kennedy (the lessor) and Louis Kann, Sigmund Kann, and Myer Cohen, whom it was alleged claimed to be either the equitable or legal owners of the tax title in question. The defendant Kennedy died the day the bill was filed, and Henry Randall Webb, as her executor, and Maria G. Dewey, as her heir at law, were substituted as defendants.\n The lessor prosecuted an appeal from an order granting an injunction pendente lite, restraining him, among other things, from prosecuting landlord and tenant proceedings, based upon a right of re-entry arising from the alleged forfeiture caused by the nonpayment of taxes and tax sale referred to in the bill. The court of appeals, on the face of the bill, sustained the order of injunction. 21 D. C. App. 141. The cause, having been put at issue by separate answers asserting the right of the lessor to forfeit and the right of the holders of the tax title, was tried on the merits and was decided in favor of the complainant. It was taken to the court of appeals on behalf of all the defendants except Mrs. Dewey, and the decree of the lower court, adjudging the tax sale to be void and relieving from the alleged forfeiture, was affirmed. 25 D. C. App. 182.\n The origin of the controversy and the facts, as to which there is no dispute, are as follows:\n The property in controversy, no. 715 Market space, in the city of Washington, was owned by and assessed for taxation in the name of Maria T. Gillis at the time of her death, intestate, in 1871. Marianne A. B. Kennedy, as the heir at law of Mrs. Gillis, took possession of the property as owner, without any administration upon the estate of Mrs. Gillis. After the death of Mrs. Gillis, continuously up to the making of the tax sale hereafter referred to, the property remained on the public records and continued to be assessed in the name of Mrs. Gillis, except that a small portion of the rear end of the premises was, at a time not shown, but prior to the tax sale before referred to, assessed for taxation in the name of Mrs. Kennedy and her husband. \n\n[204 U.S. 43, 49]\n\u00a0\n In 1890, Mrs. Kennedy leased in writing the premises to Henry King, Jr., the husband of complainant, for use as a fancy dry goods store, and by several extensions the period of expiration of this lease came to be October 1, 1908. By the lease the lessee, his executors and administrators or assigns, were bound, 'during the continuance and until the end and determination of the said term for which the said premises are demised, to pay or cause to be paid in each and every year thereof the taxes, general and special, of every character and description, assessed against and levied upon the said premises by the authorities of the general or local government.' The right to terminate the lease and to re-enter upon the breach of any of the conditions was stipulated. When the lease was made, King, the lessee, was engaged in the dry goods business in a store on Seventh street, not far from the Market space store. Under the lease he entered into possession of the Market space store and carried on, in addition, business there until his death on August 18, 1897. Sanctioned by an order of the probate court, an assignment of the lease covering the store on Market space was made to Caroline King, the widow. The business was thereafter conducted for a time solely in her name. She did not, however, actively supervise it. Her elder son, Harry King, who had been, during the latter years of his father's life, in general charge of the business for his father, remained in that capacity, after the death of the father, as the representative of his mother, assisted at the Market space store, in a subordinate capacity, by a brother, Joseph King, who, during the father's life, had also, in a subordinate capacity, been engaged in business at that place. From the making of the lease in 1890 to the death of King in 1897 it was the habit of Mrs. Kennedy, when the tax on the Market space store was about to become payable, to request the lessee to send her a check for the amount of the tax, and on the receipt thereof the tax was paid either by Mrs. Kennedy or her agent. This course was not, however, followed, after the death of King. The first instalment of taxes which fell due in November, 1897, soon after the \n\n[204 U.S. 43, 50]\n\u00a0\n death of King, was directly discharged by Mrs. King, who took and retained the receipt. This was done at the request of Mrs. Kennedy, who called at the Market space store about Christmas, 1897, and asked that the tax be paid. From that time no request was made by the lessor to the tenant, as the taxes fell due, to send her the money to enable her to pay them, nor is it shown that any express demands were made that the tenant pay the taxes directly. From the time of the payment, by the tenant, near the close of 1897, of the first instalment of taxes which fell due after the death of her husband, until the summer of 1900, a period of more than two and a-half years, no taxes whatever were paid upon the leased premises. In the interval the following taxes became overdue:\n Second instalment of tax for 1898, due in May, 1898;\n First instalment of tax for 1899, due in November, 1898;\n Second instalment of tax for 1899, due in May, 1899;\n First instalment of tax for 1900, due in November, 1899; and,\n Second instalment of tax for 1900, due in May, 1900\n\n\n On July 24, 1900, the two instalments of the tax for 1900, due in November, 1899, and May, 1900, with accrued penalties, were paid by the tenant under the following circumstances: As testified by Harry King, he being concerned over past-due taxes owing on a large number of tracts of real estate owned by the estate of his father, it 'occurred' to him to have the 'bookkeeper go down to the tax office and inquire for the tax bills of 715 Market space.' The bookkeeper went and subsequently reported that the two instalments for 1900 were due, and Harry King paid them. The nature of the inquiry made by the bookkeeper at the tax office, and what occurred, is the subject of controversy, and we pretermit its consideration. Nearly a year after, in May, 1901, the two instalments of taxes for 1899, due in November, 1898, and May, 1899, with interest and penalties, along with the taxes for 1901, were paid by the tenant. The payment of the 1899 taxes was by way of redemption of a sale of the property for such taxes made on April 12, \n\n[204 U.S. 43, 51]\n\u00a0\n 1900. There is no doubt that the payment of the arrears for 1899 was a result of the visit by the bookkeeper to the tax office. It will be observed that the payments which were made in 1900 and 1901, of taxes which were in arrears, did not embrace the second instalment of the tax of 1898, due in May, 1898. To enforce that instalment a sale had been made in April, 1899, and a certificate was issued to the purchaser a few days thereafter, which was subject to a right of redemption during a period of two years. In other words, when the instalments of taxes which were in arrears were paid on July 24, 1900, the property had been sold for the last half of the tax of 1898, and when the payment was made in 1901 of the arrears for 1899 the period for redemption had elapsed.\n On July 25, 1901, Mrs. King received a letter sent from Rochester, New York, by one Wiltsie, stating that he had bought the property in April, 1899, at a tax sale to enforce the tax for the second half of the year 1898, and that he was entitled to a deed of the property, but would surrender the tax certificate if immediate payment was made of the amount of his, Wiltsie's, advance, viz., $143.93, together with the statutory interest at the rate of 15 per cent, and a charge for releasing, to be agreed upon. Harry King replied to this letter on July 30, 1901, and asked to be informed of the charge for redemption. Wiltsie answered on August 1, 1901, calculating the statutory interest at $50.38, and naming $100 as his fee or charge for releasing. To this letter reply was made that Harry King was out of town, and that on his return the letter of Wiltsie would be laid before him. On September 17, 1901, Wiltsie wrote King, and called attention to the fact that he had not heard from him, and requested to be informed by return mail when the matter would have attention. To this King replied, objecting to the charge of $100 for releasing, and stated that in his opinion $50 would be an equitable charge. The letter concluded as follows:\n'Unfortunately we have paid you quite a considerable amount of money in the past for tax sales. We are not in- \n\n[204 U.S. 43, 52]\n\u00a0\n terested in this piece of property in any way except as tenant, as we are not the owners or the mortgagees. If it should meet with your approval send us a bill and we will send check.'\n\n It was replied on September 24, 1901, that if the matter was attended to promptly $75 would be accepted for the release certificate, and that the papers had been sent to the Central National Bank of Washington, where, on payment of $279.90, they would be delivered up.\n Neither Mrs. King nor her representatives, after learning in July of the sale of the property and of the outstanding tax title, gave any notice of that fact to the lessor, nor did they apparently concern themselves further about the matter until the purchase of the certificate from Wiltsie, as hereafter stated, by Cohen, one of the defendants.\n Both the Kann defendants carried on business on Market space, having stores on each side of the property leased to King, and the situation was therefore such that the possession of that property was particularly advantageous to the Kanns. Indeed, they had at some previous time stated to Webb, the attorney of the lessor, that if they could obtain a long lease of the premises they would be willing to pay a rent much in advance of that paid by Mrs. King. Some time in September, 1901, one Knight called upon the Kanns and informed them that the property at 715 Market space had been sold for taxes. They referred him to Webb, the attorney of the lessor. Knight called upon Webb, said to him that Wiltsie had bought the property at the tax sale, and solicited employment to set aside the sale. Webb on the next day made inquiry, and discovered the fact of the sale and the outstanding certificate and the lapse of the period of redemption. He informed the lessor of the fact and of her right to forfeit the lease. Mrs. Kennedy, who was advanced in age, being nearly eighty years old, was perturbed, and, in a letter to Webb, expressed solicitude as to obtaining a new tenant in case the lease of Mrs. King was forfeited. As a result of the conferences and the correspondence between Mrs. Kennedy and her counsel, the latter called on Cohen, \n\n[204 U.S. 43, 53]\n\u00a0\n another defendant, who was the attorney of the Kanns, and desired to know whether the Kanns were yet willing to lease at an increased rent, and was informed they were. Shortly after Cohen advised the Kanns to purchase the Wiltsie tax certificate, and upon their giving him authority to use his discretion in the matter he determined to go at once to Rochester to accomplish that purpose. He communicated his intentions to Webb, who endeavored to dissuade him. Cohen went to Rochester. The papers which had been sent to Washington in consequence of the correspondence between Wiltsie and King were returned to Rochester. Cohen bought the certificate, took an assignment of the same in October, 1901, and, returning to Washington, procured a tax deed for the property from the commissioners of the District, which was duly recorded. Thereafter Mrs. Kennedy notified Mrs. King of her intention to re-enter because of the forfeiture of the lease resulting from the sale of the property for the nonpayment of taxes. Harry King then called at the bank to take up the certificate, and found that it had been returned to Wiltsie. Negotiations ensued between Mrs. King and Mrs. Kennedy, looking to a compromise of the matter, and a letter was written by the counsel of Mrs. King to Mrs. Kennedy, asking to be permitted to use her name in rpoceedings to be brought to cancel the tax sale. This was declined. At all times Mrs. King insisted upon her right to continue in possession under the lease despite the default. The Kanns notified Mrs. Kennedy that they were the real holders of the tax title, and would attempt to enforce their rights under it unless a lease of the property was made to them at the previously suggested increased rental. The counsel of Mrs. Kennedy, Webb, advised making such a lease. Placed between the threatened assertion by the Kanns of the tax title, unless they obtained a lease, and the insistance of Mrs. King that she was entitled to retain the property under her lease, Mrs. Kennedy wavered. The result was a letter addressed by Webb, the counsel for Mrs. Kennedy, to the counsel for Mrs. King, submitting a proposition of compromise, which was in substance \n\n[204 U.S. 43, 54]\n\u00a0\n that Mrs. Kennedy would waive the forfeiture upon condition that Mrs. King promptly commenced and prosecuted proceedings to have the tax deed to Cohen declared a nullity or defend against any claim under the tax title, and upon the further condition that Mrs. King furnish a bond with sufficient surety to pay the sum of $70,000 in the event that the tax title was held to be valid. Counsel for Mrs. King in writing declined this offer. The letter doing this made no counter proposition, but referred to and did not expressly withdraw the previous offer of Mrs. King, if she were allowed the use of Mrs. Kennedy's name, to conduct proceedings to vacate the tax title. In addition the letter, which was quite lengthy, expressly stated the opinion of the counsel of Mrs. King to be that the tax title was void and could be set aside. It insisted that Mrs. King would be relieved by a court of equity from the forfeiture alleged to have resulted from her inadvertent omission to pay the tax, and besides stated various grounds which, it was deemed, placed Mrs. Kennedy in a position where she could not, as against Mrs. King, ask to be protected against the risk, if any, of the outstanding tax title held by the Kanns. These grounds were, in substance, that the tax certificate had been bought by the Kanns at the instance of the counsel of Mrs. Kennedy, for the purpose of making sure of a forfeiture of Mrs. King's rights, and with the knowledge that negotiations were pending between Mrs. King and Wiltsie, and for the purpose of forestalling the acquisition by Mrs. King of the tax certificate.\n The negotiations having failed, Mrs. Kennedy commenced landlord and tenant proceedings to recover possession. Before the time set for the trial of the proceedings Mrs. King commenced this suit, which, as we at the outset stated, sought to have the tax title declared void, to have complainant relieved from the forfeiture, and for an injunction restraining the prosecution of a landlord and tenant proceeding.\n That a court of equity, even in the absence of special circumstances of fraud, accident, or mistake, may relieve against a \n\n[204 U.S. 43, 55]\n\u00a0\n forfeiture incurred by the breach of a covenant to pay rent, on the payment or tender of all arrears of rent and interest by a defaulting lessee, is elementary. Sheets v. Selden, 7 Wall. 416, 19 L. ed. 166. But that principle cannot control this case, even if it be conceded, for the sake of argument, that it applies to collateral covenants in leases, such as the obligation to repair, to insure, and even to pay taxes, said in the Sheets case to be settled in England adversely to such right, but to be an open question in this country, and as to which there may be differences of opinion in state courts of last resort. Noyes v. Anderson, 124 N. Y. 175, 21 Am. St. Rep. 657, 26 N. E. 316; Giles v. Austin, 62 N. Y. 491; Gordon v. Richardson, 185 Mass. 492, 69 L. R. A. 867, 70 N. E. 1027; Lundin v. Schoeffel, 167 Mass. 465, 45 N. E. 933; Mactier v. Osborn, 146 Mass. 399, 4 Am. St. Rep. 323, 15 N. E. 641; Tibbetts v. Cate, 66 N. H. 550, 22 Atl. 559; Bacon v. Park, 19 Utah, 246, 57 Pac. 28. We say this, because the general principle, as declared in the Sheets Case, rests upon the ground that 'the rent is the object of the parties and the forfeiture only an incident intended to secure its payment; that the measure of damages is fixed and certain, and that when the principal and interest are paid the compensation is complete.' When the foundation upon which the doctrine is based is borne in mind it becomes apparent that it affords no ground for the contention that it is applicable to a case where the failure to perform a covenant to pay taxes has led to a tax sale, ripening into a prima facie irredeemable title held adversely to the lessor. In other words, the doctrine lends no support to the proposition that a court of equity can require an owner to risk the loss of his property by compelling him to engage in a contest involving the validity of an irredeemable tax sale, for the purpose of endowing the tenant with the right, if the tax title be held invalid, to pay the taxes and thus be relieved of a forfeiture. To extend the principle to such a degree would be destructive of rights of property, since it would subject everyone who made a lease of his property, containing a covenant by the lessee to pay taxes, to the hazard of the loss of his title, if only the tenant chose to violate the covenant, and thus give rise to the coming into existence of a tax title prima \n\n[204 U.S. 43, 56]\n\u00a0\n facie valid and irredeemable in character. And the force of these considerations is not avoided by the reasoning which led the court below to its conclusion, or by the arguments at bar advanced to support that conclusion.\n Thus, the court, in its opinion, considering the paramount issue to be the validity of the tax sale, first disposed of that question, and, concluding that the sale was void, proceeded to determine its power to grant relief from the forfeiture, upon the hypothesis that there never had been a tax sale, that the taxes were still due, and could be paid, and that the tenant was willing to pay them. But thus to contemplate the controversy was to assume the very question for decision; that is, the power of a court of equity, in order to relieve from a forfeiture, to endow a tenant with the right to create, at the risk of the owner, a primary controversy, viz., to compel the owner against his will to jeopardize his title by testing the validity of the irredeemable tax sale,- a hazard which the owner was desirous of avoiding. The paramount issue was not, as assumed, the invalidity of the tax sale as a mere abstract question, but, we repeat, was the right of the tenant to invoke at the hands of the court a determination of that question at the risk of the owner. And this view is not changed by saying that the decision at the instance of the tenant as to the validity of an irredeemable tax title, held by a third person, was an incident to the right of the tenant to be relieved from the forfeiture, for to so say is but to destroy the foundation upon which the right to relief from the forfeiture rested; that is, the ability of the tenant, when applying for relief, to make complete compensation. And the misconception of the general doctrine just pointed out pervades the argument at bar of the appellee. Thus, while no authority is referred to sustaining the right of a tenant to test the validity of an outstanding prima facie irredeemable tax deed, caused to exist by the default of the tenant, the ultimate result of the contentions is to assume that principle as established and to predicate rights upon that hypothesis. In other words, in substance, by a petitio principii, the propositions \n\n[204 U.S. 43, 57]\n\u00a0\n urged treat the outstanding tax title as void and proceeded to demonstrate the right to relief under that assumption.\n There being, then, no foundation for the contention that it was within the ordinary power of a court of equity to relieve from the forfeiture, we come to consider whether the case as made by the record is brought within the general authority of a court of equity to relieve in cases of fraud, accident, or mistake. We put out of view, for ulterior consideration, the question of fraud, and therefore presently examine only the contentions as to the existence of the elements of accident or mistake. In considering this subject two propositions are obvious: First, where the forfeiture from which relief is sought has been occasioned by the gross negligence of the person claiming to be relieved the default so occasioned is not one brought about by accident or mistake; and, second, that even where accident or mistake has been shown, especially in the absence of culpability or fraud on the part of the other party, a court of equity will not grant relief from the forfeiture, unless it can be done with justice to that party.\n Referring to its opinion on the appeal from the order granting an injunction pendente lite, and in effect reiterating the view therein expressed, that the averments of the bill justified the relief prayed, the court, in its opinion on the final hearing, said:\n'But the testimony makes it more plain than even the allegations of the bill of complaint did, that she is entitled to the relief which she asks. The testimony shows quite conclusively that, while the lease required the annual taxes on the property to be paid by the lessee, yet the invariable custom of the lessor down to the time of the default had been to demand and receive the amount of the taxes from the lessee, and to pay the taxes herself by her own agents. For the taxes of the second half of the year 1898, in connection with which the default occurred, the lessor failed for some reason to make the usual demand for the money wherewith to pay the taxes; and the lessee was in the midst of financial trouble and distress caused by the recent death of her husband, who had been the lessee down to the \n\n[204 U.S. 43, 58]\n\u00a0\n time of his death. The record shows to us quite plainly that the default of the lessee was excusable under the circumstances; and that no harm would be done to anyone by her relief from the nominal forfeiture which she has incurred.'\n\n By this reasoning it was assumed the case was brought within the grounds of relief for accident or mistake upon two inferences, both treated as alleged in the bill and established by the testimony; first, the prior practice of the lessor in calling upon the tenant to hand her the money to pay the taxes and then herself paying them; and second, the failure of the lessee, after this practice was discontinued, to call to mind that the tax was due and payable, owing to her disturbed state of mind at that particular time. In the argument at bar reliance is principally rested upon the first of these grounds, and indeed it is insisted that the testimony goes much further than implied by the court below, and demonstrates that the conduct of the lessor was such as to mislead the lessee, and thereby estop the former from asserting the forfeiture.\n Let us consider separately the two grounds: First, accident or mistake as engendered by the course of dealing of the lessor, and, second, accident or mistake arising from oversight, the alleged result of the particular circumstances surrounding the tenant at the time of the failure to pay the taxes. As to the first ground it would seem to be an afterthought, since it was not suggested in the correspondence between the parties immediately preceding the litigation that Mrs. Kennedy by her conduct had in anywise led to the default of the tenant. To the contrary, that view was excluded, for in the letter written to Mrs. Kennedy, dated October 8, 1901, asking authority to use her name in proceedings to be brought by the tenant to cancel the tax sale, the attorneys of Mrs. King said:\n'We assume that you are aware that your tenant has always paid the taxes upon the demised premises, and the failure to pay the one made the basis of the notice was an oversight, caused by the death of Mr. Henry King, Jr., which was being remedied at the time your notice was received.' \n\n[204 U.S. 43, 59]\n\u00a0\n And although it would seem that the court below assumed to the contrary, the fact is the bill contained no averment justifying the default in paying, upon the theory that it had been induced by the conduct of the lessor. To the reverse it was specifically stated in the fifth paragraph of the bill that the alleged single default in the payment of taxes arose 'wholly through oversight and inadvertence,' without in anywise charging that the conduct of Mrs. Kennedy was in whole or in part the cause of the oversight or inadvertence. Besides, in the eleventh paragraph of the bill, explicit reference was made to the letter to which we have just above referred, and it was alleged that by its terms Mrs. Kennedy was notified 'that the failure to pay the taxes was simply an oversight, which was being remedied at the time the notice of refusal to accept the rent was received.' True it is that the testimony shows that prior to the death of Henry King, Jr., in August, 1897, the lessor was in the habit of calling upon the tenant for the amount required to pay the tax then due or about to become due, in order that she might herself pay them. True also is it that Harry King, in testifying, made statements from which the inference can be deduced that in conducting the business for his mother, after the assignment of the lease subsequent to the death of his father, he relied upon a continuance of this practice. But it must be borne in mind these statements were made after the death of Mrs. Kennedy, who died on the day the bill was filed, and their inaccuracy is, we think, conclusively shown by the mode of dealing following the assignment of the lease and the conduct of the tenant in respect to the matter of taxes. The very first payment of taxes made after the death of Henry King was made by the tenant herself, paying the taxes at the request of Mrs. Kennedy, and retaining the receipt. Nearly three years of default followed, without any payment of taxes by the tenant whatever and without any inquiry being made by the tenant on the subject. When in July, 1900, the two defaulting instalments of the tax for 1900 were paid by the tenant they were not paid at the instance of Mrs. Kennedy, or because \n\n[204 U.S. 43, 60]\n\u00a0\n of any request upon her part, but because it 'occurred' to the tenant to do so. When they were paid the payment embraced interest and penalties, for which the tenant could not have deemed herself responsible if the course of dealing asserted had been relied upon. Despite this fact, no proof whatever was made of any notice to Mrs. Kennedy of the fact or of any claim being made against her in the premises. And the same thing is true as to the payments made in May, 1901, of the current taxes and some of the overdue instalments. Besides, when these payments were made the property had been sold for the overdue instalments, but was yet subject to redemption, and the statutory interest of 15 per cent was paid by the tenant without any intimation of a claim of any character against the lessor. Indeed, the conduct of the tenant in respect to the very tax for which a forfeiture was asserted is absolutely inconsistent with the theory that she deemed that her landlord was the cause of the default, for, when notice was received by the tenant from the purchaser at the tax sale of the outstanding irredeemable tax certificate, more than two months and a half elapsed before the purchase of the certificate by Cohen, and no complaint was made to the landlord that she had neglected to demand payment of the tax, and that in consequence the default and loss was occasioned, but a negotiation was opened to purchase the outstanding title for the account of the tenant alone. When this line of conduct is considered in connection with the fact, already stated, the conclusion is inevitable that the suggestion that the conduct of the landlord had induced the failure to pay, first made after the death of Mrs. Kennedy, is without foundation.\n\n And the facts which we have just stated also render it impossible to conclude that the nonpayment of the tax was due to a mere temporary oversight, and not to gross negligence. How can an inference of temporary oversight be possible when the long period of the failure by the tenant to pay any tax whatever is borne in mind, and when we also consider the delay of more than two months and a half which took place after \n\n[204 U.S. 43, 61]\n\u00a0\n knowledge was conveyed, by the letter of Wiltsie, of the outstanding irredeemable tax certificate?\n The fact that the tenant was a merchant, and of necessity kept mercantile books, is significant. The mind cannot conceive of adequate entries being made of the taxes which were belatedly paid, which would not have at once suggested those which were unpaid. The inference fairly deducible from the letter to Wiltsie-'Unfortunately we have paid you quite a considerable amount of money in the past for tax sales'-adds cogency to the irresistible inferences as to negligence.\n And even if the foregoing considerations which establish the absence of accident or mistake and demonstrate the presence of gross negligence are put out of mind, and accident or mistake be assumed, for the sake of the argument, nevertheless, under the circumstances of the case, a court of equity could not give relief. This follows since the relief sought could not be afforded without subjecting the lessor to the peril of contesting the validity of the outstanding prima facie irredeemable tax title.\n We come to the question which we hitherto put aside for final consideration; viz., the alleged fraud. It, in any event, only involves a consideration of what took place with regard to the purchase of the tax certificate by Cohen as the agent of the Kanns, and the circumstances surrounding and connected with that purchase, and the use made or the certificate. Concerning these matters the court below said:\n'We find no evidence whatever in the record of any fraud or wrongdoing perpetrated by anyone concerned. We only find the evidence of a situation created by a keen commercial rivalry and shrewd management, wholly untainted by wrongdoing, but still a situation from which injury is threatened to the complainant's rights of property, and against which she is entitled to be relieved. For that there was an arrangement between the defendants whereby the tax certificate was to be used to oust the complainant from the property, we think is too plain to be reasonably questioned. There was, undoubtedly, a concurrence of effort for that purpose; perhaps no formal combina- \n\n[204 U.S. 43, 62]\n\u00a0\n tion or preconcerted action. But it matters not what we call it. The undoubted fact is there was co-operation between the defendants to use the tax certificate to the detriment of the complainant's rights; and there being such cooperation, the defense of multifariousness cannot prevail. The one purpose of the bill is to relieve the complainant from the effect of this tax certificate and of the tax title based upon it.'\n\n For the reason that we agree with the finding that there is no evidence whatever of any fraud or wrongdoing by anyone concerned, we are constrained to disagree with the conclusion that the complainant was entitled to relief. We say this, because we are of opinion that the relief awarded could only have been justified upon the finding that there was fraud and wrongdoing. We so conclude, because if it be accepted that there was an agreement and combination as to the certificate, entirely free from every element of fraud or wrongdoing, we fail to perceive how an agreement of that character afforded ground for granting the relief which was given. But, disregarding mere forms of expression, and assuming that the general finding that there was no fraud or wrongdoing was intended to be limited to intentional as distinguished from constructive fraud or wrongdoing, let us briefly review the facts concerning the acquisition and use made of the certificate, in order to fix whether such a finding is at all sustained by the record. Although we think it immaterial, as there was no evidence whatever tending to show that the lessor or her attorney procured the purchase of the certificate by Cohen, that subject may be put out of view. The irredeemable tax certificate was in the hands of and belonged to Wiltsie. He notified the tenant that he held it more than two months and a half before the purchase by Cohen, and proffered his willingness to assign it to the tenant. As shown by the undisputed facts which we have stated, with indifference both to her own interest and the interest of the landlord, the tenant neither acted for herself by accepting the offer, nor gave any notification whatever to the landlord on the subject. Cohen, as the agent of the Kanns, learned of the existence of the \n\n[204 U.S. 43, 63]\n\u00a0\n irredeemable tax sale and of the person who held the certifice. He purchased it by the authority of and for the benefit of his principals, the Kanns. By the express terms of the statute under which the certificate was issued it was assignable. Granting that the purchase was made in order to aid the Kanns in obtaining a lease of the property, in the absence of any legal duty owing by them to the tenant, we fail to perceive how the motive of Cohen or his principals could operate to make the otherwise lawful action constructively wrongful. The tenant, by whose negligent default the sale of the property had been occasioned, certainly had no exclusive pre-emptive right to the purchase of the certificate, which would operate to render its purchase by anyone else in his own interest void. After the purchase of the certificate byCohen, what was the position of the landlord? On the one hand confronted by the assertion of the tenant that the outstanding tax title was void, that she had a right to be relieved from the forfeiture caused by the nonpayment of the tax, and was entitled to continue in possession under the lease, and, on the other, with an offer on the part of the holder of the tax title to quitclaim the same, and thus avoid testing its validity, if only a lease was made which would be advantageous. When it is again borne in mind that this situation was brought about by the neglect of the tenant to perform his covenant to pay the taxes, and by his procrastination in respect to acquiring the tax certificate which had been previously offered to him, we can conceive of no principle of equity preventing the landlord from taking a course not forbidden by law, which was not only most conducive to her own interest, but which besides obviated the danger of submitting her title to a contest concerning the validity of a tax sale. But, if an equitable principle could be conceived of which prevented the landlord from so acting under the circumstances stated, that principle would be inapplicable to the case before us, when one of the undisputed facts to which we have already called attention is considered. That fact is this: Before the landlord irrevocably determined to avail of the forfeiture and thus avoid \n\n[204 U.S. 43, 64]\n\u00a0\n the risk to herself concerning the outstanding tax title, she offered to condone the forfeiture, provided the tenant commenced proceedings to have the outstanding tax title declared invalid, and also secured the landlord from loss in the event that such tax title should be sustained, which offer was declined, on grounds substantially asserting that the risk resulting from the default of the tenant should be borne by the owner, and not by the tenant.\n The decree of the court below is reversed and the cause remanded with instructions to dismiss the bill for want of equity.\nREVERSED.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice Harlan dissent. \n\n\n\n","86":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKAWANANAKOA v. POLYBLANK(1907)\nNo. 273\nArgued: Decided: April 8, 1907\n\n\n\n Mr. Sidney M. Ballou for appellants.\n\n\n[205 U.S. 349, 351]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Aldis B. Browne, Alexander Britton, and E. A. Douthitt for appellees. \n\n[205 U.S. 349, 352]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an appeal from a decree affirming a decree of foreclosure and sale under a mortgage executed by the appellants to the appellee, Sister Albertina. 17 Haw. 82. The defendants (appellants) pleaded to the jurisdiction that after the execution of the mortgage a part of the mortgaged land had been conveyed by them to one Damon, and by Damon to the territory of Hawaii, and was now part of a public street. The bill originally made the territory a party, but the territory demurred and the plaintiffs dismissed their bill as to it before the above plea was argued. Then the plea was overruled, and after answer and hearing the decree of foreclosure was made, the appellants having saved their rights. The decree excepted from the sale the land conveyed to the territory, and directed a judgment for the sum remaining due in case the proceeds of the sale were insufficient to pay the debt. Eq. Rule 92.\n The appellants contend that the owners of the equity of redemption in all parts of the mortgage land must be joined, and that no deficiency judgment should be entered until all the mortgaged premises have been sold. In aid of their contention they argue that the territory of Hawaii is liable to suit like a municipal corporation, irrespective of the permission given by its statutes, which does not extend to this case. They liken the territory to the District of Columbia (Metr- \n\n[205 U.S. 349, 353]\n\u00a0\n opolitan R. Co. v. District of Columbia, \n132 U.S. 1\n, 33 L. ed. 231, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 19), and point out that it has been a party to suits that have been before this court (Damson v. Hawaii, \n194 U.S. 154\n, 48 L. ed. 916, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 617; Carter v. Hawaii, \n200 U.S. 255\n, 50 L. ed. 470, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 248).\n The territory, of course, could waive its exemption (Smith v. Reeves, \n178 U.S. 436\n, 44 L. ed. 1140, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 919), and it took no objection to the proceedings in the cases cited if it could have done so. See act of April 30, 1900, chap. 339,  96. 31 Stat. at L. 141, 160. But in the case at bar it did object, and the question raised is whether the plaintiffs were bound to yield. Some doubts have been expressed as to the source of the immunity of a sovereign power from suit without its own permission, but the answer has been public property since before the days of Hobbes. Leviathan, chap. 26, 2. A sovereign is exempt from suit, not because of any formal conception or obsolete theory, but on the logical and practical ground that there can be no legal right as against the authority that makes the law on which the right depends. 'Car on peut bien recevoir loy d'autruy, mais il est impossible par nature de se donner loy.' Bodin, Republique, 1, chap. 8, ed. 1629, p. 132; Sir John Eliot, De Jure Maiestatis, chap. 3. Nemo suo statuto ligatur necessitative. Baldus, De Leg. et Const. Digna Vox, 2. ed. 1496, fol. 51b, ed. 1539, fol. 61.\n As the ground is thus logical and practical, the doctrine is not confined to powers that are sovereign in the full sense of juridical theory, but naturally is extended to those that, in actual administration, originate and change at their will the law of contract and property, from which persons within the jurisdiction derive their rights. A suit presupposes that the defendants are subject to the law invoked. Of course it cannot be maintained unless they are so. But that is not the case with a territory of the United States, because the territory itself is the fountain from which rights ordinarily flow. It is true that Congress might intervene, just as, in the case of a state, the Constitution does, and the power that can alter the Constitution might. But the rights that exist are not created by \n\n[205 U.S. 349, 354]\n\u00a0\n Congress or the Constitution, except to the extent of certain limitations of power. The District of Columbia is different, because there the body of private rights is created and controlled by Congress, and not by a legislature of the District. But for the territory of Hawaii it is enough to refer to the organic act. Act of April 30, 1900, chap. 339,  6, 55. 31 Stat. at L. 141, 142, 150. Coffield v. Territory, 13 Haw. 478. See, further, Territory v. Doty, 1 Pinney (Wis.) 396, 405; Langford v. King, 1 Mont. 33; Fisk v. Cuthbert, 2 Mont. 593, 598.\n However it might be in a different case, when the inability to join all parties and to sell all the land is due to a conveyance by the mortgagor directly or indirectly to the territory, the court is not thereby deprived of ability to proceed.\n Decree affirmed.\n Mr. Justice Harlan concurs in the result. \n\n\n\n","87":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKENT v. PEOPLE OF PORTO RICO(1907)\nNo. 31\nArgued: Decided: November 18, 1907\n\n\n\n Messrs. N. B. K. Pettingill, Nemesio Perez Moris, and Harry B. Leake for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Frank Feuille for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n Whether the supreme court of Porto Rico erred in affirming the conviction and sentence of the plaintiff in error of a crime held to constitute embezzlement is the question presented by this record. Twenty- seven errors are assigned. At the thresh- \n\n[207 U.S. 113, 114]\n\u00a0\n old we are concerned with our right to consider them. Our jurisdiction arises from the 35th section of the act of April 12, 1900 (31 Stat. at L. 85, chap. 191). For the purposes of this case it suffices to say that by the section in question our power to review extends, first, to 'the same cases as from the supreme courts of the territories of the United States;' and, second, to 'all cases where the Constitution of the United States, or a treaty thereof, or an act of Congress is brought in question and the right claimed thereunder is denied.' As we have no authority to review the action of the supreme court of a territory of the United States in a criminal case like this (Amado v. United States, \n195 U.S. 175\n, 49 L. ed. 146, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 13), the first of the above clauses may be put out of view. A few only of the errors assigned are relied upon at bar as presenting Federal questions within the scope of the second clause, yet it is urged that all the assigned errors are open. This rests upon the proposition that, in a case coming from Porto Rico, where jurisdiction arises from the presence of a Federal question, the duty devolves of passing upon all the errors relied upon, irrespective of their Federal character. Passing for the moment a consideration of the deduction involved in the proposition, we come to consider the premise, that is, the alleged existence of Federal contentions embraced by the second clause of  35. We do this because, if it be that there are no such questions, it will become unnecessary further to notice the argument. In determining whether the assignments of error present Federal questions it is to be borne in mind that the mere fact that some of the assignments relied on assert Federal rights is not determinative, since, even although the assignments formally involve such rights, we are nevertheless without jurisdiction 'where it indubitably appears that the Federal right asserted is frivolous; that is, without color of merit.' American R. Co. v. Castro, \n204 U.S. 453\n, 51 L. ed. 564, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 466.\n The first error assigned alleged to embody a Federal right is that the trial below was absolutely void because the district court in which the information was filed and trial had was not \n\n[207 U.S. 113, 115]\n\u00a0\n a legal tribunal within the intendment of the act of Congress of April 12, 1900, the organic act of Porto Rico. To test the merit of the contention it is necessary to briefly state the organization of the judicial system of Porto Rico under the American domination and the legislation of Congress relating to the same. By an order promulgated during the control of Porto Rico by the military authorities the judicial system was made to consist, generally speaking, of district courts composed of three judges, and of a supreme court. By  33 of the act of Congress above referred to, it was, in part, provided:\n'That the judicial power shall be vested in the courts and tribunals of Porto Rico as already established and now in operation, including municipal courts, under and by virtue of general orders, numbered one hundred and eighteen, as promulgated by Brigadier General Davis, United States Volunteers, August sixteenth, eighteen hundred and ninety-nine, and including also the police courts, established by general orders numbered one hundred and ninety-five, promulgated November twenty-ninth, eighteen hundred and ninety-nine, by Brigadier General Davis, United States Volunteers, and the laws and ordinances of Porto Rico and the municipalities thereof in force, so far as the same are not in conflict herewith, all which courts and tribunals are hereby continued.'\n\n In March, 1904, a law was enacted by the legislature of Porto Rico, modifying the judicial system as established by the military orders referred to in the act of Congress. For the purposes of the contention now under consideration it suffices to say that by this local law the boundaries of the judicial districts were changed, caused by the creation of additional districts, and it was provided that such courts, instead of being composed of three, should consist of one, judge in each district. The argument is that this local law, in so far as it changed the district courts, and especially in so far as it provided for one instead of three judges to preside over each courts, was void, because in conflict with the provision of the 33d section of the \n\n[207 U.S. 113, 116]\n\u00a0\n act of Congress. The contention amounts to this: that there were no district courts in Porto Rico from the time of the going into effect of the Porto Rican act, in 1904, up to the present time. Whilst the proposition presents a formal Federal question, we think it is clear that it is so frivolous as to bring it within the rule announced in American R. Co. v. Castro, supra. We say this because we think that no other conclusion is reasonably possible from a consideration of the whole of  33 of the act of Congress and the context of that act, particularly  15 thereof, both of which are reproduced in the margin. \n We do not deem it necessary to analyze the text of the act*\n Sec. 15. That the legislative authority hereinafter provided shall have power by due enactment to amend, alter, modify, or repeal any law or ordinance, civil or criminal, continued in force by this act, as it may from time to time see fit.\n Sec. 33. That the judicial power shall be vested in the courts and tribunals of Porto Rico as already established and now in operation, including municipal courts, under and by virtue of general orders numbered one hundred and eighteen, as promulgated by Brigadier General Davis, United States Volunteers, August sixteenth, eighteen hundred and ninety- nine, and including also the police courts established by general orders numbered one hundred and ninety-five, promulgated November twenty-ninth, eighteen hundred and ninety-nine, by Brigadier General Davis, United States Volunteers, and the laws and ordinances of Porto Rico and the municipalities thereof in force, so far as the same are not in conflict herewith, all which courts and tribunals are hereby continued. The jurisdiction of said courts and the form of procedure in them, and the various officials and attach es thereof, respectively, shall be the same as defined and prescribed in and by said laws and ordinances, and said general orders numbered one hundred and eighteen and one hundred and ninety-five, until otherwise provided by law: Provided, however, that the chief justice and associate justices of the supreme court and the marshal thereof shall be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and the judges of the district courts shall be appointed by the governor, by and with the advice and consent of the executive council, and all other officials and attach es of all the other courts shall be chosen as may be directed by the legislative assembly, which shall have authority to legislate from time to time as it may see fit with respect to said courts, and any others they may deem it advisable to establish, their organization, the number of judges and officials and attach es for each, their jurisdiction, their procedure, and all other matters affecting them. \n\n[207 U.S. 113, 117]\n\u00a0\n of Congress to point out the inevitable result just stated, since the obvious meaning of the act is established by a decision heretofore rendered. Dones v. Urrutia, \n202 U.S. 614\n, 50 L. ed. 1172, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 767. In that case Dones, who had been convicted and sentenced to death for murder, unsuccessfully sought release by habeas corpus at the hands of the supreme court of Porto Rico upon the identical ground presented in the assignment of error which we are considering, and upon an additional ground relating to an alleged personal disqualification of the judge who presided at his trial. On appeal to this court the questions raised were fully argued in printed briefs, but were deemed to be of such a frivolous character as not to require an opinion, and were hence disposed per curiam, referring to the provisions of the statute and pertinent authorities. True it is that in the Dones Case, in conformity to the practice in cases of habeas corpus, the formal order was to affirm, but this would not justify us in assuming jurisdiction on this record when the necessary result of the action of the court in the Dones Case is to establish the frivolous nature of the contention here relied upon as the basis of jurisdiction. Equitable Life Assur. Soc. v. Brown, \n187 \nU.S. 308, 311\n, 314 S., 47 L. ed. 190, 192, 193, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 123.\n The second of the asserted Federal questions relates to the action of the courts below in respect to a certain letter claimed to constitute a confession of guilt and written by the accused to a private person before this prosecution was commenced. It is insisted that by the actions of the trial court on the subject the plaintiff in error was deprived of rights guaranteed by the 5th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. Conceding, arguendo, the applicability of the constitutional provision relied upon to the subject and that it was operative in the island of Porto Rico, we think the record demonstrates that the claim here made was not raised below, is a mere afterthought, and is established by the record to be without color of merit.\n When the document was offered in evidence the record recites that 'the defendant objected on the ground that its com- \n\n[207 U.S. 113, 118]\n\u00a0\n petency had not been established in accordance with the custom in law, inasmuch as it had not been shown to have been free and voluntary and given without promise of reward or without promise of freedom from prosecution.'\n It is next stated that 'the accused requested that the jury withdraw while the question of the competency of the evidence should be decided by the court.' The request was acceded to and evidence was introduced on the subject of the voluntary nature of the alleged confession. The court decided to admit the document and overruled 'an extensive oral argument, requesting the court to reconsider its decision to admit the document in evidence.' After such admission in evidence it is stated merely that 'the defendant duly excepted to the admission.'\n Again, after the close of all the evidence, the record recites:\n'Counsel for the defense asked that that part of the record in which appeared the testimony of the witnesses Dix, Kent, and Dexter concerning the so-called confession which the fiscal had offered in evidence be transcribed by the stenographer and given to the jury so that the jury might have full knowledge of all of the circumstances connected with the so-called confession, which motion was denied by the court, in accordance with the law and especially  274 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and the accused duly excepted.\n\n'Whereupon, the defendant moved through his attorneys, that Messrs. Dexter and Kent be allowed to testify as to the circumstances surrounding the alleged confession before the jury, which motion was granted by the court, and the witnesses testified.'\n\n Further, after thus, at the request of the counsel for the accused, allowing testimony as to the voluntary nature of the confession to go to the jury, the court, in instructing them, after calling their attention to the proceedings had at the trial in respect to the circumstances surrounding the making of the confession which had been given before the jury, submitted the matter to the jury and no exception was noted. That this ac- \n\n[207 U.S. 113, 119]\n\u00a0\n tion of the court was proper, if there was conflict of testimony, is not open to controversy. Wilson v. United States, \n162 U.S. 613\n, 40 L. ed. 1090, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 895.\n Nor does the record disclose that the errors assigned in the supreme court of Porto Rico involved any contention that rights under the Constitution of the United States had been denied. The supreme court, in approaching the consideration of an assigned error which complained of the action of the trial court in admitting the confession in evidence, made an elaborate statement of what it deemed to be the rules applicable to the admissibility of confessions, and in so doing referred to the 5th Amendment and to a multitude of cases in this and other courts concerning the principle to be applied in determining such admissibility. It is a matter of no concern, however, in ascertaining whether rights under the Federal Constitution were asserted and denied, to consider the accuracy of all the statements made by the appellate court in its elaborate review of the subject, since the conclusion which it reached was that, as a general principle of law, confessions, in order to be admissible, 'must have been made without compulsion or undue promise or inducement, and be entirely voluntary.' Besides, the ultimate and decisive ruling of the supreme court of Porto Rico was that the trial court had not erred in acceding to the request of the accused in allowing the evidence concerning the voluntary nature of the confession to be heard by the jury, and leaving that subject to its determination. True it is that the opinion indicates that the court deemed that the proof as to the voluntary nature of the confession was of such a preponderating character that the court would have been authorized in not submitting it to the jury. But the correctness of that conclusion is not a matter of concern in view of the fact that the question of the voluntary nature of the confession was submitted to the jury at the request of the accused. As from no possible view of the action of the courts below concerning the confession can we discover even the semblance of the assertion of denial of a right under the Constitution, it follows \n\n[207 U.S. 113, 120]\n\u00a0\n that the errors assigned on that subject furnish no basis for the exercise of our jurisdiction.\n As the matters which we have considered dispose of all the alleged Federal questions asserted to come within the second clause of  35 of the act of April 12, 1900, the conclusion follows that we are without jurisdiction, and the writ of error is therefore dismissed for want of jurisdiction. \n\n\n\n","88":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKESSLER v. ELDRED(1907)\nNo. 196\nArgued: Decided: May 13, 1907\n\n\n\n This case comes to this court from the circuit court of appeals for the seventh circuit upon a certificate of that court of questions of law concerning which it desires instructions. Accompanying the certificate is a statement of facts. The statement of the facts and the certificate of the questions of law are as follows:\n Kessler, a citizen of Indiana, prior to 1898, had built up an extensive business in the manufacture and sale of electric cigar lighters, and had customers throughout the United States. Eldred, a citizen of Illinois, and an inhabitant of the northern district, was the owner of patent No. 492,913, issued to Chambers on March 7, 1893, for an electric lamp lighter. Eldred was a competitor of Kessler's and manufactured a similar form of lighter (entirely dissimilar from that described in the Chambers patent), so that it was not a matter of much importance to customers which lighter they bought. In 1898 Eldred began a suit against Kessler in the district of Indiana for the infringement of the Chambers patent. The bill alleged that Kessler's manufacture and sale of the Kessler lighter infringed all the claims. The answer denied that Kessler's lighter infringed any of the Chambers claims. On final hearing the circuit court found for Kessler on the issue of noninfringe- \n\n[206 U.S. 285, 286]\n\u00a0\n ment and dismissed the bill. That decree was affirmed in 1900 by the circuit court of appeals for the seventh circuit. Eldred v. Kessler, 45 C. C. A. 454, 106 Fed. 509.\n Subsequently, Eldred brought suit on the same patent in the northern district of New York against Kirkland, who was selling a similar lighter, but not of Kessler's make. The circuit court found for Kirkland on the issue of noninfringement and dismissed the bill. The circuit court of appeals for the second circuit reversed that decree and held the Kirkland lighter to be an infringement. Eldred v. Kirkland, 64 C. C. A. 588, 130 Fed. 342.\n In June, 1904, Eldred filed a bill for infringement of the same patent in the Western district of New York against Breitwieser, user of Kessler lighters, which were identical with those held in Eldred v. Kessler, to be no infringement of the Chambers patent. Many of Kessler's customers were intimidated by the Breitwieser suit, so that they ceased to send in further orders for lighters, and refused to pay their accounts for lighters already sold and delivered to them. Kessler assumed the defense of the Breitwieser suit, and will be compelled, in the proper discharge of his duty to his customers, to assume the burden and expense of all suits which may be brought by Eldred against other customers. In this state of affairs Kessler, a citizen of Indiana, in July, 1904, filed a bill against Eldred in the circuit court for the northern district of Illinois, the state and district of Eldred's citizenship and residence, to enjoin Eldred from prosecuting any suit in any court of the United States against anyone for alleged infringement of the Chambers patent by purchase, use, or sale of any electric cigar lighter manufactured by Kessler and identical with the lighter in evidence before the circuit court for the district of Indiana and the circuit court of appeals for the seventh circuit in the trial and adjudication of the suit of Eldred against Kessler. From an adverse decree by the circuit court Kessler perfected an appeal to this court.\n Upon the foregoing facts the questions of law concerning \n\n[206 U.S. 285, 287]\n\u00a0\n which this court desires the instruction and advice of the Supreme Court are these:\n First. Did the decree in Kessler's favor, rendered by the circuit court for the district of Indiana in the suit of Eldred against Kessler, have the effect of entitling Kessler to continue the business of manufacturing and selling throughout the United States the same lighter he had theretofore been manufacturing and selling, without molestation by Eldred, through the Chambers patent?\n Second. Did the decree mentioned in the first question have the effect of making a suit by Eldred against any customer of Kessler's for alleged infringement of the Chambers patent by use or sale of Kessler's lighters a wrongful interference by Eldred with Kessler's business?\n Third. Did Kessler's assumption of the defense of Eldred's suit against Breitwieser deprive Kessler of the right, if that right would otherwise exist, of proceeding against Eldred in the state and district of his citizenship and residence for wrongfully interfering with Kessler's business?\n Fourth. If Eldred's acts were wrongful, had Kessler an adequate remedy at law?\n Messrs. Robert S. Taylor and Elwin M. Hulse for Kessler.\n Messrs. Charles C. Linthicum and Louis K. Gillson for Eldred.\n\n Mr. Justice Moody delivered the opinion of the court:\n The industry of counsel has not discovered any decision on the exact questions presented by the certificate, and they agree that those questions are not settled by controlling authority. The decision of the case turns upon the effect of the judgment in the suit which Eldred brought against Kessler. Both manufactured and sold electric cigar lighters. Eldred, being \n\n[206 U.S. 285, 288]\n\u00a0\n the owner of a patent issued to one Chambers for an electric lamp lighter, brought a suit against Kessler, in which it was alleged by the plaintiff and denied by the defendant that the cigar lighters manufactured by Kessler infringed each and all of the claims of the Chambers patent. On the issue thus joined there was final judgment for Kessler. This judgment, whether it proceeds upon good reasons or upon bad reasons, whether it was right or wrong, settled finally and everywhere, and so far as Eldred, by virtue of his ownership of the Chambers patent, was concerned, that Kessler had the right to manufacture, use, and sell the electric cigar lighter before the court. The court, having before it the respective rights and duties on the matter in question of the parties to the litigation, conclusively decreed the right of Kessler to manufacture and sell his manufactures free from all interference from Eldred by virtue of the Chambers patent, and the corresponding duty of Eldred to recognize and yield to that right everywhere and always. After this conclusive determination of the respective rights and duties of the parties, Eldred filed a bill for an infringement of the same patent against Breitwieser, on account of his use of the same kind of Kessler cigar lighter which had been passed on in the previous case, and Kessler has assumed the defense of that suit. Whether the judgment between Kessler and Eldred is a bar to the suit of Eldred v. Breitwieser, either because Breitwieser was a privy to the original judgment, or because the articles themselves were, by that judgment, freed from the control of that patent, we deem it unnecessary to inquire. We need not stop to consider whether the judgment in the case of Eldred v. Kessler had any other effect than to fix unalterably the rights and duties of the immediate parties to it, for the reason that only the rights and duties of those parties are necessarily in question here. It may be that the judgment in Eldred v. Kessler will not afford Breitwieser, a customer of Kessler, a defense to Eldred's suit against him. Upon that question we express no opinion. Neither it nor the case in which it is raised are before us. But the question here \n\n[206 U.S. 285, 289]\n\u00a0\n is whether, by bringing a suit against one of Kessler's customers, Eldred has violated the right of Kessler. The effect which may reasonably be anticipated of harassing the purchasers of Kessler's manufactures by claims for damages on account of the use of them would be to diminish Kessler's opportunities for sale. No one wishes to buy anything if with it he must buy a law suit. That the effect to be anticipated was the actual effect of the Breitwieser suit is shown by the statement of facts. Kessler's customers ceased to send orders for lighters, and even refused to pay for those which had already been delivered. Any action which has such results is manifestly in violation of the obligation of Eldred, and the corresponding right of Kessler, established by the judgment. Leaving entirely out of view any rights which Kessler's customers have or may have, it is Kessler's right that those customers should, in respect of the articles before the court in the previous judgment, be let alone by Eldred, and it is Eldred's duty to let them alone. The judgment in the previous case fails of the full effect which the law attaches to it if this is not so. If rights between litigants are once established by the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction those rights must be recognized in every way, and wherever the judgment is entitled to respect, by those who are bound by it. Having, then, by virtue of the judgment, the right to sell his wares freely, without hindrance from Eldred, must Kessler stand by and see that right violated, and then bring an action at law for the resulting damage, or may he prevent the infliction of the unlawful injury by proceedings in personam in equity? If Eldred succeeds in his suit against one of Kessler's customers, he will naturally bring suits against others. He may bring suits against others, whether he succeeds in one suit or not. There may be, and there is likely to be, a mutiplicity of suits. It is certain that such suits, if unsuccessful, would, at the same time, tend to diminish Kessler's sales, and to impose upon him the expense of defending many suits in order to maintain the right which, by a judgment, has already been declared to exist. If the suits are \n\n[206 U.S. 285, 290]\n\u00a0\n successful the result will be practically to destroy Kessler's judgment right. Moreover though the impairment or destruction of Kessler's right would certainly follow from the course of conduct which Eldred has begun, it would be difficult to prove, in an action at law, the extent of the damage inflicted. An action at law would be entirely inadequate to protect fully Kessler's unquestioned right, and, under these circumstances, though there may be no exact precedent, we think that the jurisdiction in equity exists. Nor do we see any good reason why Kessler's interposition for the defense in the suit of Eldred v. Breitwieser debars him from his remedy in equity.\n It follows from the foregoing reasoning that the first and second questions certified should be answered in the affirmative, and the third and fourth in the negative, and it is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","89":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKESSLER v.

U S MIN CO(1907)\n\nArgued: Decided: October 21, 1907\n\n\n\n\n[207 U.S. 1, 2]\n\u00a0\n This suit was commenced in the circuit court of the United States for the district of Utah by the United States Mining Company, claiming to be the owner of certain mining property, and praying that its title thereto be quieted and the defendant restrained from taking any ore therefrom. Jurisdiction was founded on diverse citizenship. In an amended complaint, filed June 2, 1902, it was alleged that the plaintiff is the owner and in possession of four mining claims known as the Jordan Extension, the Northern Light, the Grizzly, and the Fairview lode mining claims, the boundaries of each being given; that these mining claims are adjacent to each other and to certain other mining claims, all owned and worked by the plaintiff as one property for mining purposes; that beneath the surface of the claims above mentioned is a vein or lode of great value; that the defendants wrongfully claim to own said vein or lode and the ores and minerals therein contained; that they have, by means of secret underground works, obtained access thereto and have mined, extracted, and removed large quantities of valuable ores therefrom; that they threaten to continue such wrongful and unlawful invasion of the premises, and to continue to mine, extract, and remove ores and minerals; that the defendants are in possession of a mining claim adjacent to the four mining claims of plaintiff, known as the Kempton mining claim, united States lot 255, which was located in the year 1871, and, on information and belief, that the defendants pretend that the mineral deposits and ores under and beneath the surface of the four mining claims above mentioned are in and part of a mineral vein and lode belonging to and haveing its apex in said Kempton mining claim and on the dip of said alleged vein, which pretense the plaintiff charges to be contrary to the truth. The plaintiff further alleges that it is the owner and in possession of two certain mining claims, one named the Jordan Silver Mining Company's mine, but usually known as the 'Old Jordan,' located December 17, 1863; the other the Mountain Gem Lode and Mining claim located August 20, 1864, the boundaries of each of which are given; \n\n[207 U.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n that in these two claims there is a lode, bearing silver and other metals, whose apex is within the surface boundaries; that the dip of said lodes is toward the Kempton claim occupied by the defendants, and that if there be any mineral vein or lode in the Kempton claim it is not one that has its apex within the limits of that claim, but is a part of the lodes apexing within the 'Old Jordan' and Mountain Gem claims. The relief prayed for was a decree quieting plaintiff's title and restraining the defendants from mining and removing any ores or minerals. To this amended complaint the defendants filed a demurrer, stating, as one of the grounds thereof, that the plaintiff had an adequate remedy at law. This demurrer was overruled, and thereupon the defendants filed an answer and subsequently an amended answer, setting forth their title to the Kempton mining claim, and also to a claim known as the Ashland mining claim, and alleging that there are lodes whose apices are within these claims; that on their dip they enter beneath the surface of the plaintiff's claims, and that it is upon them that defendants have been mining; that the Kempton claim was patented to their grantors and predecessors in interest on February 23, 1875. They further deny that the 'Old Jordan' claim was located on December 17, 1863, or patented July 14, 1877; deny that the Mountain Gem claim was located on August 20, 1864, or that a patent had been issued on said alleged location. They further aver that if there be any lode or vein in either the 'Old Jordan' or the Mountain Gem claims, that such lode or vein is entirely distinct from those which have their apices in the Kempton and Ashland claims. On the hearing the court denied the application of the defendants to set the case for trial as a law case before a jury. At the same time it entered a decree dismissing the plaintiff's bill. From this decree the plaintiff appealed to the circuit court of appeals (67 C. C. A. 587, 134 Fed. 769), which reversed the decree of dismissal, and remanded the case with instructions to enter a decree for the plaintiff in conformity with the prayer of the bill. Thereupon, \n\n[207 U.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n on application of the defendants, the case was brought to this court on certiorari.\n [ Messrs. Charles J. Hughes, Jr., Ogden Hiles, and Charles C. Dey for petitioners.\n\n\n[207 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William H. Dickson, George Sutherland, A. C. Ellis, A. C. Ellis, Jr., E. M. Allison, and Waldemar Van Cott for respondent.\n\n\n[207 U.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n The first question is whether the plaintiff can maintain this suit in equity without a prior adjudication in an action at law of its legal title. The bill alleges ownership and possession. It supported this allegation by patents from the United States of the first four claims mentioned in the bill, and proved that the defendants were working on a vein or body of mineral beneath the surface and extracting ores therefrom. The bill has a double aspect, to quiet title and to restrain defendants from removing any more ores from beneath the surface of these claims. Title by patent from the United States to a tract of ground, theretofore public, prima facie carries ownership of all beneath the surface, and possession under such patent of the surface is presumptively possession of all beneath the surface. This is the general law of real estate. True, in respect to mining property, this presumption of title to mineral beneath the surface may be overthrown by proof that such mineral is a part of a vein apexing in a claim belonging to some other party. But this is a matter of defense; and while proof of ownership of the spex may be proof of the ownership of the vein descending on its dip below the surface of property belonging to another, yet such ownership of the apex must first be established before any extralateral title to the vein can be recognized. This suit was not in the nature of an ejectment, to put the defendants out of possession of the space beneath the surface of plaintiff's claims from which they had extracted ore, but to quiet the title of the plaintiff to the vein in which they had been working, and to restrain them from mining and removing any more ore.\n Sec. 3511, Utah Rev. Stat. 1898, reads:\n'Sec. 3511. An action may be brought by any person against another who claims an estate or interest in real property adverse to him, for the purpose of determining such adverse claim.' \n\n[207 U.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n A statute of a similar character was before this court in Holland v. Challen, \n110 U.S. 15\n, 28 L. ed. 52, 3 Sup. Ct. Rep. 495, and it was held that under it a suit might be maintained by one out of possession against another also out of possession, to quiet the title of the former to the premises. It was said, quoting from a prior opinion, that it was 'a case in which an enlargement of equitable rights is effected, although presented in the form of a remedial proceeding.' It was also said (p. 20) :\n\n'To maintain a suit of this character it was generally necessary that the plaintiff should be in possession of the property, and, except where the defendants were numerous, that his title should have been established at law or be founded on undisputed evidence or long-continued possession. Alexander v. Pendleton, 8 Cranch, 462, 3 L. ed. 624; Peirsoll v. Elliott, 6 Pet. 95, 8 L. ed. 332; Orton v. Smith, 18 How. 263, 15 L. ed. 393.\n\n'The statute of Nebraska suthorizes a suit in either of these classes of cases without reference to any previous judicial determination of the validity of the plaintiff's right, and without reference to his possession. Any person claiming title to real estate, whether in or out of possession, may maintain the suit against one who claims an adverse estate or interest in it, for the purpose of determining such estate and quieting the title.'\n\n The same question was considered and decided in the same way in respect to a suit based upon a similar statute, in Iowa, in Wehrman v. Conklin, \n155 U.S. 314\n, 39 L. ed. 167, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 129. Of course, as pointed out in Whitehead v. Shattuck, \n138 U.S. 146\n, 34 L. ed. 873, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 276, such a statute cannot be relied upon in the Federal courts to sustain a bill in equity by one out of possession against one in possession, for an action at law in the nature of an action of ejectment affords a perfectly adequate legal remedy. There is nothing in the point decided in Boston & M. Consol. Copper & S. Min. Co. v. Montana Ore Purchasing Co. \n188 U.S. 632\n, 47 L. ed. 626, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 434, which, rightly considered, conflicts with the case of Holland v. Challen.\n It will be further borne in mind that this question was raised by demurrer to the plaintiff's bill and by motion after the \n\n[207 U.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n plaintiff had finished its testimony and before the defendants had introduced theirs, and was not renewed at the close of the trial, althought until then the motion was not decided. At the time the motion was made the case presented was one of a clear legal title to the four mining claims by patent from the United States, and an unauthorized entry by subterranean workings into the ground below the surface and the mining and extracting of ores therefrom,-a case for restraint by injunction, which was part of the relief asked for in the bill. It is insisted that in Park v. Wilkinson, 21 Utah, 279, 81 Am. St. Rep. 693, 60 Pac. 945, the supreme court of that state has given a different construction to the statute, but in this we think counsel are mistaken. In that case the plaintiff brought an action which the court says 'was in the nature of one in ejectment.' To the complaint the defendant, as authorized by the practice in Utah, answered with a cross complaint, demanding equitable relief. A jury was empaneled. After the testimony was all in the court ruled against the claim for equitable relief, discharged the jury, and entered judgment for the plaintiff. This was held to be erroneous, the supreme court saying that 'after determining the equitable issue the court should have submitted the case to the jury upon proper instructions.' In other words, the equitable relief sought by the defendant having been denied, the case stood as one in the nature of an action of ejectment, which was a common-law action, entitling the party to a jury. But in this case, upon the allegations of the complaint, the plaintiff was in possession, and therefore could not maintain an action of ejectment. The testimony which plaintiff offered showed that it was the owner and in possession, and, of course, at that time nothing in the nature of an action of ejectment was shown. And it was only by demurrer to the complaint and by motion after the plaintiff had rested that the question of a right to a jury was raised by the defendants. The decision of the court of appeals in this matter was right.\n Coming now to the merits, it is not open to dispute that the defendants were taking ore from beneath the surface of the \n\n[207 U.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n plaintiff's four claims. The question therefore arises, What right had they to thus mine and remove ore? They must show that the ore was taken from a vein belonging to them. Was there a vein? Where was its apex, and who was the owner of that apex? The testimony is voluminous, and even with the accompanying diagrams it is difficult to come to a satisfactory conclusion as to the facts.\n It is insisted that the findings of the circuit court should have bound and concluded the court of appeals upon questions of fact. The difficulty with this contention is that there is nothing to show what the circuit court found to be the facts. Whatever might have been suggested by the course of the argument at the hearing, the comments of the court upon such argument, or in announcing its decision, there is nothing in the record to indicate whether its decision was based upon a question of fact or a matter of law. The record only contains its decree, dismissing the bill. All else is a matter of surmise, except as may be inferred from the allegations of the pleadings and the scope of the testimony. While it is apparent that the circuit court must have based its decision upon one of two or three grounds, yet upon which it is not certain. The circuit court of appeals made no separate finding of facts, but it filed an opinion which indicates the scope of its decision, and it is the decree of that court which is before us for consideration. The attitude of the case is very like that of one in which a trial court refers all things to a master, who takes the testimony and reports it, with a general finding for the plaintiff or defendant, upon which report the trial court states its views of the facts and the law and enters its decree. An appellate court, reviewing such decree, will give its consideration to the conclusions stated by the trial court, irrespective of the report of the master, unless the issue be so narrow that sustaining the decree of the court necessarily involves an overruling of the master on a matter of fact.\n From the opinion of the court of appeals it appears that it found that there was a broad vein. It says: 'A careful \n\n[207 U.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n examination and consideration of the evidence clearly convinces us that the stratum of limestone constitutes a single broad vein or lode of mineral-bearing rock extending from the quartizite on one side to the quartzite on the other.' This stratum of limestone underlies the four claims of the plaintiff, and one of the contentions of the defendants is that there are several independent veins, one of which has its apex within the surface lines of the Kempton and another its apex in the Ashland, that these independent veins continue down through the stratum of limestone beneath the surface of the plaintiff's claims, and that it was only from these independent veins that the defendants were mining and removing ore. Of course, this difference between the conclusions of the court and the contentions of the defendants affects materially the scope of the inquiry. If the limestone is not, strictly speaking, a vein, but a mere stratum of rock through which run several independent veins, then the inquiry must extend to the location of the apex of each separate vein; whereas, if the stratum of limestone is itself a single broad vein, then the inquiry is narrowed to the location of its apex.\n With reference to the conclusion of the court of appeals it is sufficient to say that if the testimony does not show that it is correct, it fails to show that it is wrong, and under those circumstances we are not justified in disturbing that conclusion. It is our duty to accept a finding of fact, unless clearly and manifestly wrong.\n Treating this limestone as a single broad vein, it is apparent that the entire apex is not within the surface of either the Kempton and Ashland, but that it is also found in the Old Jordan and Mountain Gem, properties of the plaintiff. The line which divides the surface of the claims of the defendants from the Old Jordan and Mountain Gem claims also bisects the vein as it comes to the surface. In other words, part of the apex is within plaintiff's claims and part within defendants.' In such a case the senior location takes the entire width of the vein on its dip. This was the conclusion of the \n\n[207 U.S. 1, 13]\n\u00a0\n court of appeals, as shown by this quotation from its opinion (p. 592):\n'Where two or more mining claims longitudinally bisect or divide the apex of a vein, the senior claim takes the entire width of the vein on its dip, if it is in other respects so located as to give a right to pursue the vein downward outside of the side lines. This is so because it has been the custom among miners, since before the enactment of the mining laws, to regard and treat the vein as a unit and indivisible, in point of width, as respects the right to pursue it extralaterally beneath the surface; because usually the width of the vein is so irregular, and its strike and dip depart so far from right lines, that it is altogether impracticable, if not impossible, to continue the longitudinal bisection at the apex throughout the vein on its dip or downward course; and because it conforms to the principle pervading the mining laws, that priority of discovery and of location gives the better right, as is illustrated in the provision giving to the senior claim all ore contained in the space of intersection where two or more veins intersect or cross each other, and in the further provision giving to the senior claim the entire vein at and below the point of union, where two or more veins with distinct apices and embraced in separate claims unite in their course downward. Rev. Stat.  2336, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1436.'\n\n We fully indorse the views thus expressed. Discovery is the all- important fact upon which title to mines depends. Lindley, in his work on Mines, 2d ed. vol. 1,  335, says:\n'Discovery in all ages and all countries has been regarded as conferring rights or claims to reward. Gamboa, who represented the general thought of his age on this subject, was of the opinion that the discoverer of mines was even more worthy of reward than the inventor of a useful art. Hence, in the mining laws of all civilized countries, the great consideration for granting mines to individuals is discovery. 'Rewards so bestowed,' says Gamboa, 'besides being a proper return for the labor and anxiety of the discoverers, have the further effect of \n\n[207 U.S. 1, 14]\n\u00a0\n stimulating others to search for veins and mines, on which the general prosperity of the state depends.\"\n\n The two thoughts here presented are reward for the time and labor spent in making the discovery, thus adding to the general wealth, and incentive to others to prosecute searches for veins and mines. To take from the discoverer a portion of that which he has discovered and give it to one who may have been led to make an adjoining location by a knowledge of the discovery, and without any previsous searching for mineral, is manifest injustice.\n Again, as indicted in the quotation from the court of appeals, continuing the line of dividion shown upon the surface through the descending vein would be attended with great difficulty and uncertainty. Dealing with question of this nature, a peactical view must to taken. Veins do not continue of uniform width in their descent, but are often irregular and broken, and to attempt to make a division of ore according as it appears on the surface, or equally, would require the constant supervision of a court. It is not strange, then, that the custom of miners has been, as stated by the court of appeals, to regard and treat the vein as a unit and indivisible in point of width, and belonging to the discoverer. This question has been before this court, as well as several of the courts in the mining districts. In Argentine Min. Co. v. Terrible Min. Co. \n122 \nU.S. 478, 484\n, 30 S. L. ed. 1140, 1142, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1356, we said:\n'Assuming that on the same vein there were surface outcroppings within the boundaries of both claims, the one first located necessarily carried the right to work the vein.'\n\n In Bullion, B. & C. Min. Co. v. Eureka Hill Min. Co. 5 Utah, 3, 11 Pac. 515, the question is discussed at some length by Chief Justice Zane. In the course of the opinion it is said (p. 54):\n'Under the law of 1866 the surface ground was merely for the convenient working of the lode. The discoverer and first locator took the lode in its entirety. The law contemplated its segregation in its length, not in its width. It refers to lodes between the end lines, not to a part of a lode. No \n\n[207 U.S. 1, 15]\n\u00a0\n expression can be found in it indicating an intention to limit the rights of the locator to a portion of the lode in its width. The discovery of any part of the apex of a vein is regarded by it as a discovery of the entire apex. And we think that the law of 1872, when all of its provisions are considered together, and in connection with the former law on the subject, as it should be, evinces the same intent. Under this law the discoverer of any part of the apex gets the right to its entire width, despite the fact that a portion of the width may be outside of the surface side lines of his claim extended downwards vertically. While he has no right to the extralateral surface, he has a right to the extralateral lode beneath the surface.'\n\n See also St. Louis Min. & Mill. Co. v. Montana Min. Co. (C. C. App. 9th C.) 56 L.R.A. 725, 44 C. C. A. 120, 104 Fed. 664; Empire State-Idaho Min. & Developing Co. v. Bunker Hill & S. Min. & Concentrating Co. (C. C. App. 9th C.) 52 C. C. A. 219, 114 Fed. 417. Also another suit between the same parties in the same court, 66 C. C. A. 99, 131 Fed. 591; Last Chance Min. Co. v. Bunker Hill & S. Min. & Concentrating Co. (C. C. App. 9th C.) 66 C. C. A. 299, 131 Fed. 579.\n But it is contended by the defendants that both the entries and patents of the Ashland and Kempton claims were prior in time to the entries and patents of the Old Jordan and Mountain Gem, and that such priority of entry and patent conclusively establishes the prior right of the owners to this broad vein; that the failure of the owners of the Old Jordan and Mountain Gem to adverse the applications of the owners of the Ashland and Kempton for patent was an admission that the latter had priority of right, and is conclusive against any present testimony as to the dates of the locations. We had occasion in the recent case of Creede & C. C. Min. & Mill. Co. v. Uinta Tunnel Min. & Transp. Co. \n196 U.S. 337\n, 49 L. ed. 501, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 266 to consider to what extent the issue of a mining patent worked an estoppel of the claims of third parties, and it is unnecessary now to repeat the discussion there had.\n This case presents the question under different aspects. The entries and patents of the Ashland and Kempton claims \n\n[207 U.S. 1, 16]\n\u00a0\n were, as stated, prior in time to the entries and patents of the Old Jordan and Mountain Gem. There is no record of any adverse suits, although it is intimated that there were such suits. In the absence of a record thereof we cannot assume that anything more was presented and decided than was necessary to justify the patents. A patent is issued for the land described, and all that is necessarily determined in an adverse suit is the priority of right to the land. This is evident from  2325, Rev. Stat. ( U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1429), which says: 'A patent for any land claimed and located for valuable deposits may be obtained in the following manner.' In the section the only matters mentioned for examination and consideration relate to the surface of the ground. There is no suggestion or provision for any inquiry or determination of subterranean rights. Lindley, in his work on Mines, 2d ed. vol. 2,  730, says:\n'An application for patent invites only such contests as affect the surface area. A possible union of veins underneath the surface cannot be foreshadowed at the time the application is made. When such a condition arises, it is adjusted by reference to surface apex ownership and priority of location not involving any surface conflict. The rule is well settled that conflicting adverse rights set up to defeat an application for patent cannot be recognized in the absence of an alleged surface conflict. Prospective underground conflicts . . . are not the subject of adverse claims.'\n\n In New York Hill Co. v. Rocky Bar Co. 6 Land Dec. 318, the Commissioner of the General Land Office declined to recognize an adverse claim where there was no surface conflict, saying (p. 320):\n'In the event that patent should be issued upon said application and any question should thereafter arise as to the right, under such patent, to follow any vein or lode, as indicated in said  2322 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1425), it would be a matter for the courts to settle, and I am of the opinion, there being no surface conflict alleged in this case, and without considering any other question relating to the sufficiency of the so-called adverse claim, that you properly \n\n[207 U.S. 1, 17]\n\u00a0\n declined to receive the same as an adverse claim, and to that extent your decision is affirmed.'\n\n The same ruling was made in Smuggler Min. Co. v. Trueworthy Lode Claim, 19 Land Dec. 356.\n Without determining what would be the effect of a judgment in an adverse suit in respect to subterranean rights, if any were in fact presented and adjudicated, it is enough now to hold that there is no presumption, in the absence of the record, that any such rights were considered and determined. Indeed, in the absence of a record, or some satisfactory evidence, it is to be assumed that the patents were issued without any contest and upon the surveys made under the direction of the United States surveyor general, and included only ground in respect to which there was no conflict. If the surface ground included in an application does not conflict with that of an adjoining claimant, the latter is in no position to question the right of the former to a patent. Take the not infrequent case of two claims adjoining each other, the boundary line between which is undisputed. If the owner of one applies for a patent the owner of the other is clearly under no obligation to adverse that application, even if, under any circumstances, he might have a right to do so. Other necessary conditions being proved, the applicant is entitled to a patent for the ground. Generally speaking, if the boundary between the two claims is undisputed the foundation for an adverse suit is lacking. While a patent is evidence of the patentee's priority of right to the ground described, it is not evidence that that right was initiated prior to the right of the patentee of adjoining tract to the ground within his claim.\n Section 2336, Rev. Stat. (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1436), makes provision for conflict as to certain subterranean rights. The last sentence of the section reads: 'And, where two or more veins unite, the oldest or prior location shall take the vein below the point of union, including all the space of intersection.' Argentine Min. Co. v. Terrible Min. Co. supra. As the place of union may be far below the surface, this evidently contemplates inquiry and decision \n\n[207 U.S. 1, 18]\n\u00a0\n after patent, and then it can only be in the courts. And the same rule will obtain as to other subterranean rights.\n It is further contended that there is no evidence of a valid location of the 'Old Jordan' and Mountain Gem prior to the entries of the Ashland and Kempton. Location notices of the Old Jordan and Mountain Gem were admitted in evidence, that of the former being as follows:\n Notice. Jordan S. M. Co.\n The undersigned members of the Jordan Silver Mining Co. claim for mining purposes one share of 200 feet each and one additional claim of 200 feet for original discoverer, George R. Ogilvie, on this lead of mineral ore, with all its dips, spurs, and angles, beginning at the stake situated 100 feet northeast of Gardner's shanties in Bingham (Canion) Kanyon, in West Mountain, and running 2,200 feet in a westerly direction along the said of said mountain, on a line with Bingham canyon, and intend to work the same according to the mining laws of this mining district.\n (Signed by 25 locators.)\n Bingham Kanyon, Salt Lake City, Utah territory, Sep 17, 1863\n\n\n A. Gardner, Recorder.\n The Mountain Gem location was similar in form, dated August 20, 1864, and recorded August 24, 1864. Now these location notices were long before the time of the locations of the defendants' claims. It is further contended that the locations of the 'Old Jordan' and Mountain Gem were anterior to the act of July 26, 1866 (14 Stat. at L. 251, chap. 262), which was the first legislation of Congress in respect to the granting of mineral claims, and that while that act, in its 2d section, recognizes the rights of locators in so far as they have proceeded according to the local custom or rules of miners of the districts in which the mines are situated, yet in this case there is no evidence that these locations were made in conformity to any such local custom or rules. It is sufficient to say that by stipula- \n\n[207 U.S. 1, 19]\n\u00a0\n tion of counsel it was agreed that the patents to the 'Old Jordan' and Mountain Gem were issued upon the location notices. Inasmuch as they were accepted by the government, and patents issued thereon, it was a recognition by the Department of the conformity of the proceedings to the local rules and customs of the district, and such ruling is not open to challenge by third parties claiming rights arising subsequently to such notices.\n Summing up our conclusions, the findings of fact as stated in the opinion of the court of appeals are not clearly against the testimony, and must, therefore, be sustained. According to those findings there was a single broad vein,-the apex or autcroppings of which extended through the limits of some of the plaintiff's and defendants' claims,-and not several independent veins. The ore which was being mined and removed by the defendants was taken from this single broad vein beneath the surface ground of claims belonging to the plaintiff. Where there is a single broad vein whose apex or outcroppings extend into two adjoining mining claims the discoverer has an extralateral right to the entire vein on its dip. Acceptance by the government of location proceedings had before the statute of 1866, and issue of a patent thereon, is evidence that those location proceedings were in accordance with the rules and customs of the local mining district. The priority of right to a single broad vein vested in the discoverer is not determined by the dates of the entries or patents of the respective claims, and priority of discovery may be shown by testimony other than the entries and patents. In the absence from the record of an adverse suit there is no presumption that anything was considered or determined except the question of the right to the surface.\n From these conclusions it is obvious that the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals was right, and it is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","91":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLEATHE v. THOMAS(1907)\nNo. 21\nArgued: October 17, 1907Decided: November 11, 1907\n\n\n\n Messrs. John Maynard Harlan, James S. Harlan, and Victor Koerner for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[207 U.S. 93, 94]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Edward L. Thomas in propria persona for defendant in error.\n\n\n[207 U.S. 93, 96]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an action upon judgments obtained in Missouri by the plaintiff in error against the defendant in error, hereafter called respectively plaintiff and defendant. The defendant, not denying the judgments, pleaded four pleas in set-off. The first was for money had and received, interest, and upon an account stated. The second was upon an alleged contract of January 24, 1893. The third set up an alleged contract of March 25, 1893, to pay the debt of a railroad company to the defendant, a suit and judgment for the defendant against the railroad company, a bill in equity brought by the plaintiff to enjoin the proceedings in that suit, upon which one of the issues was the liability under the contract, and that after a hearing the bill was dismissed. The fourth plea was on the contract of March 25, without more. There was a general replication denying the pleas, and also a special replication to the third and fourth, to the effect that a suit upon the alleged contract was brought against the plaintiff for the use of the defendant and removed to the United States circuit court and there determined in favor of the present plaintiff, the proceedings set up in the third plea being held not conclusive. The suit referred to is Belleville & St. L. R. Co. v. Leathe, 28 C. C. A. 279, 53 U. S. App. 718, 84 Fed. 103. The case was sent to a referee to report his conclusions of law and fact. The referee reported in favor of the defendant and also reported the evidence. The trial court ordered judgment on the referee's report. This judgment was affirmed by an intermediate court and then was taken by writ of error to the supreme court of the state. That court held that the judgment of the United States circuit court made the matter of the third and fourth pleas in set-off res judicata, and reversed the judgment of the court below. But, upon a rehearing, the court, while adhering \n\n[207 U.S. 93, 97]\n\u00a0\n to its judgment upon the third and fourth pleas, stated that it had overlooked the first and second, that the judgment could be sustained upon them, that there was evidence to support them both, or at least the first, and that the referee's finding might be supported under the first. On these grounds the judgment was affirmed. 218 Ill. 246, 75 N. E. 810.\n The case now is here on a writ of error, the errors alleged being that full faith and credit was not given to the judgment of the United States court, and that the present judgment was rendered without due process of law. It is true that the judgment of the United States court was held binding against the pleas to which it applies, but it is said that it is emptied of all real effect if a judgment can be entered upon the first and second pleas, referring to earlier stages of the same transaction, because it is said that there was no evidence to support those pleas and no finding upon them, so that to support the judgment by their presence on the record is a mere pretense, and either is a denial of due credit to the former judgment or deprives the plaintiff of his property without due process of law.\n In order to dispose of the case it is not necessary to state the dealings in detail; the following outline is enough: The defendant wanted money from the plaintiff to start a railway company. An agreement with regard to it was made on January 24, 1893, out of which, with the accompanying and subsequent transactions, the defendant sought to establish a right to be reimbursed for his advances to the road. L ater, on March 25 of the same year, there was a conveyance of its property by the railway company to the plaintiff and a conveyance by him to another company. The former deed was for $1 and 'other valuable considerations to it from him moving,' and the defendant alleged that the other considerations embraced a promise of the plaintiff to reimburse him. The referee's report refers to the dealings of January, but seemingly discovers no contract of reimbursement in them. It shows that the plaintiff insisted that all that he did was under the agreement of that month, but says that the evidence does not prove it \n\n[207 U.S. 93, 98]\n\u00a0\n conclusively. It says that matters culminated in the agreement of March 25, and finds that as part of the consideration of that deed the plaintiff promised to pay.\n The judgment purported to be based upon the referee's report, and it may be that, if it were our concern to deal with it, we should find it hard to discover sufficient warrant for a judgment on the first or second pleas. The general line of thought which the report follows seems to lead to the third and fourth. The conclusion is that the defendant is entitled to recover the amount of the judgment mentioned in the third plea, and this follows immediately after the finding of the plaintiff's promise. The plaintiff excepted to the referee's failure to find that everything was done under the January contract. And further reasons might be given for thinking that the court below was wrong. Even if the words of the judgment, 'renders judgment on said referee's report,' should be held to include the evidence as well as the referee's findings, and if it should be presumed that one of the courts below the supreme court of the state had reconsidered the evidence before entering or affirming the judgment, still, although there was evidence enough of the defendant's advances to the railway company, we might assume, for purposes of argument, that there was nothing sufficient to make out a promise on the plaintiff's part before March. But on the most favorable statement that we can make on the side of the plaintiff in error we can see no ground for coming to this court.\n It is admitted that the general and wellsettled rule is that in a case coming from a state court this court can consider only Federal questions, and that it cannot entertain the case unless the decision was against the plaintiff in error upon those questions. Murdock v. Memphis, 20 Wall. 590, 22 L. ed. 429; Sauer v. New York, \n206 \nU.S. 536, 546\n, 51 S. L. ed. 1176, 1181, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 686. It is admitted further, that a decision upon those questions must have been necessary to the decision of the case, so that, if the judgment complained of is supported also upon other and independent grounds, the judgment must be affirmed or the writ of error dismissed, as the case may be. \n\n[207 U.S. 93, 99]\n\u00a0\n Murdock v. Memphis, supra. But Murdock v. Memphis does not stop there. It further establishes that when the record discloses such other and completely adequate grounds this court commonly does not inquire whether the decision upon them was or was not correct, or reach a Federal question by determining that they ought not to have been held to warrant the result. 20 Wall. 590, 635, 22 L. ed. 429, 444; Eustis v. Bolles, \n150 \nU.S. 361, 369\n, 37 S. L. ed. 1111, 1113, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 131; Castillo v. McConnico, \n168 \nU.S. 674, 679\n, 42 S. L. ed. 622, 624, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 229.\n Of course, there might be cases where, although the decision put forward other reasons, it would be apparent that a Federal question was involved, whether mentioned or not. It may be imagined, for the sake of argument, that it might appear that a state court, even if ostensibly deciding the Federal question in favor of the plaintiff in error, really must have been against him upon it, and was seeking to evade the jurisdiction of this court. If the ground of decision did not appear and that which did not involve a Federal question was so palpably unfounded that it could not be presumed to have been entertained, it may be that this court would take jurisdiction. Johnson v. Risk, \n137 \nU.S. 300, 307\n, 34 S. L. ed. 683, 686, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 111. But there is nothing of that sort in this case. At first, having in mind only the third and fourth pleas, to which alone the judgment of the United States court was a bar, the supreme court decided in favor of the plaintiff. It affirmed the judgment below only upon a rehearing, and after its attention had been called to the first and second pleas. It did not recede from or qualify its former decision so far as that went, but simply pointed out that there were other pleas to which the replication of res judicata did not apply, and on which the judgment might be upheld. Suppose that it was mistaken as to the evidence, the mistake was upon a matter admitting of hesitation, for which it would seem from the opinion that there were special reasons in the state of the record and the admission of counsel. The question is one with which, by the general rule, we have nothing to do, and we see no reason why the general rule should not be applied.\n The first and second pleas were on the record and at issue. \n\n[207 U.S. 93, 100]\n\u00a0\n The plaintiff had notice that the defendant meant to prevail on whatever ground he could. He had his hearing, even if it should be thought that he might have insisted on a ruling that there was no evidence to support those pleas. However it is put, the claim of a right to resort to this court after the only Federal question has been decided in the plaintiff's favor must fail.\n Writ of error dismissed.\n Mr. Justice Harlan and Mr. Justice Day dissent. \n\n\n\n","92":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLEE v. STATE OF NEW JERSEY(1907)\nNo. 16\nArgued: October 16, 1907Decided: October 28, 1907\n\n\n\n\n[207 U.S. 67, 68]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. E. A. Armstrong and William T. Read for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n\n[207 U.S. 67, 69]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Nelson B. Gaskill and Robert H. McCarter for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n The plaintiffs in error were convicted in the court of quarter sessions of Cumberland county, New Jersey, at the May term, 1903, of the offense of unlawfully dredging upon certain oyster beds for the purpose of catching oysters, contrary to the statute enacted in that state. This judgment was affirmed in the court of errors and appeals of New Jersey and this writ of error seeks the reversal of that judgment.\n Section 20 of the act of 1899, amended, Laws of 1901, p. 307, provides:\n'Any person or persons who shall hereafter dredge upon or throw, take, or cast his oyster dredge, or any other instrument used for the purpose of catching oysters, upon any oyster bed or ground duly marked, buoyed, or staked up within the waters of the Delaware river, Delaware bay, and Maurice River cove, in this state, belonging to any other person, without the permission of the lessee or lessees thereof, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and of the violation of the provisions of this act.'\n\n It is the contention of the plaintiffs in error that this statute violates the right of free navigation, and undertakes to regulate interstate commerce in violation of  8, article 1, of the Federal Constitution, and deprives the plaintiffs in error of rights secured by the 14th Amendment.\n The power of the state to regulate the oyster industry, \n\n[207 U.S. 67, 70]\n\u00a0\n although the same is carried on under tidal waters in the state, is not contested, and could not successfully be. Smith v. Maryland, 18 How. 71, 15 L. ed. 269; McCready v. Virginia, \n94 U.S. 391\n, 24 L. ed. 248; Manchester v. Massachusetts, \n139 U.S. 240\n, 35 L. ed. 159, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 559.\n The objection to the legality of the conviction from the standpoint of rights protected by the Federal Constitution, as urged upon our attention, rests upon the argument that  20, amended as above quothed, permits the conviction of a person who shall take an oyster dredge or other instrument used for the purpose of catching oysters on any oyster bed or grounds within such navigable waters, thereby abridging and interfering with the right of free commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states. And it is argued that persons sailing over such waters, having an oyster-dredge aboard a boat, might be convicted of thus taking a dredge over such ground, in violation of the statute. Of this contention it is enough to say that in this case no such construction of the statute was made or enforced against the plaintiffs in error. Nor were they convicted because of any such state of facts; and it is well settled in this court that, because a state statute, when enforced in a state court against a class to which the party complaining does not belong, may work a deprivation of constitutional rights, that fact does not authorize the reversal of a judgment of a state court not enforcing the statute so as to deprive the party complaining of rights which are protected by the Federal Constitution. New York ex rel. Hatch v. Reardon, \n204 U.S. 152\n-160, 51 L. ed. 415-422, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 188, and cases there cited.\n An inspection of this record shows that the court of the indictment under which the plaintiffs in error were convicted charged them with unlawfully dredging, throwing, and casting dredges for the purpose of catching oysters upon certain leased lands, in violation of the statute.\n The testimony offered on the part of the state tends to show that certain dredges were thus thrown and cast for the purpose of catching oysters upon leased lands belonging to one Allen. \n\n[207 U.S. 67, 71]\n\u00a0\n On the part of the defense the witnesses testify that the dredges were not thus cast and used upon the lands in question. There was no pretense in the charge in the indictment, or in the testimony offered by the people, that a conviction could be had for the mere taking of a dredge over the leased lands. The conviction depended, both in the charge and in the testimony, upon establishing the fact that the plaintiffs in error thus illegally used the dredges.\n It is contended that the plaintiffs in error might have been convicted for the mere sailing over the lands with a dredge aboard the boat, because of the following language in the court's charge:\n'It then remains to be considered whether or not the defendants on that day dredged or threw, took or cast, a dredge or other instrument used for the purpose of catching oysters upon that ground. If they find that they did, then they should be convicted of illegal dredging, as charged in the first count of the indictment.'\n\n But this excerpt must be read in connection with the rest of the charge, and it is perfectly apparent that it was not intended that the jury might convict for taking a dredge across the lands in sailing over them, under the indictment which made no mention of such taking, but distinctly counted upon the unlawful throwing and casting of the dredge upon the leased ground for the purpose of catching oysters. For immediately following the language quoted the learned judge goes on to say:\n'Now, the state produces, bearing upon that question, the owner of the ground, and he testifies that on the day named in the indictment he, aboard of the Golden Light, with Captain Hilton, visited his ground; that as they approached it,-you will recall just how near they placed themselves, from their testimony,-as they approached it they saw these defendants aboard of a vessel called the Lee, maneuvering up and down this ground, No. 137, section B, of Captain Allen, and heaving their dredges thereon. Now, gentlemen, if you believe that \n\n[207 U.S. 67, 72]\n\u00a0\n testimony, if you believe that occurred as these witnesses for the state say it occurred, then, regardless of whether or not they got any oysters, if they were throwing their dredges there upon that ground they should be convicted under the first count of this indictment.\n\n ... * *\n'Now, considering all of this testimony and any other testimony in the case, you ought to determine whether or not the defendants were there heaving their dredges and dredging upon this ground. And in endeavoring to ascertain the truth from this conflicting testimony it is but the dictate of common sense that you should consider whether any of the witnesses have a motive to testify falsely.'\n\n It is therefore apparent that the possible construction of the statute in such manner as to convict plaintiffs in error of a crime in merely exercising their right to navigate interstate waters was not made essential to the determination of the case.\n A conviction was had because of the use of a dredge upon leased lands, in violation of the New Jersey statute for the protection of the oyster industry. Against the statute, as thus enforced, no valid objection can be urged for want of power to pass or enforce it because of rights protected by the Federal Constitution.\n Judgment of the Court of Errors and Appeals of New Jersey is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","93":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLOUISVILLE & N R. CO. v. SMITH, HUGGINS & CO(1907)\nNo. 198\nArgued: Decided: February 25, 1907\n\n\n This suit was brought in the chancery court for the county of Jefferson, state of Tennessee, by defendant in error against the plaintiff in error and the Southern Railway Company, for damages alleged to have been received by the defendant in error to certain car loads of corn shipped over the Southern Railway Company from certain points in Tennessee, to be delivered to defendant in error or its order at Birmingham, Alabama.\n The bill alleged that at the time of the shipments the two \n\n[204 U.S. 551, 552]\n\u00a0\n railway companies were common carriers of goods and chattels, the Southern Railway being the receiving and initial carrier, and the one with which the contracts were made, and the plaintiff in error being the connecting and ultimate carrier, and, as such, bound by said contracts and the law relative to common carriers to receive said cars of corn, and to forward and deliver them to destination whereunto consigned, in good order and in a reasonable time. It was alleged that one of said companies 'breached the said several contracts,' whereby the damage complained of accrued.\n The companies filed separate answers. That of the Southern Railway Company we need not set out. Plaintiff in error, in its answer, neither admitted nor denied certain of the allegations of the bill, and expressed want of knowledge as to others. Touching the allegation of the bill, that it was a common carrier, it admitted that it was such in certain states and portions of the country where it operated lines of roads, but denied 'that it was the connecting and ultimate carrier of the car loads of corn alleged to have been delivered to the Southern Railway Company,' denied that it made the contracts or was liable under them, or 'that it was bound by law to receive said alleged car loads of corn and forward and deliver them to their ultimate destination in good order and in reasonable time.'\n The chancellor adjudged that there was no liability on the part of plaintiff in error, and dismissed the bill as to it. He held the Southern Railway Company liable for not delivering the cars, according to its contracts, within a reasonable time, and, after report by a master, to whom the cause was referred, decreed that complainant have and recover the sum of $1,015.69. The case was taken to the court of chancery appeals, both by defendant in error and the Southern Railway Company. And that court adjudged that the court of chancery erred (1) in adjudging that the Southern Railway Company was liable for any part of the damages to the corn which accrued after its arrival upon the delivery tracks of the company in \n\n[204 U.S. 551, 553]\n\u00a0\n Birmingham, and after notice to the consignees of its arrival; (2) in adjudging that plaintiff in error was not liable for the damages suffered by the corn after its arrival in Birmingham and while it was in the yards prior to being unloaded. The court said:\n'This court is of the opinion that the Southern Railway Company is only liable for such portion of the damages as accrued by reason of the delay in transition of the cars shipped, which is fixed by the concurrent finding of the master and chancellor at 40 per cent of the entire damages.\n\n'This court is further of the opinion and decrees that the Louisville & Nashville Railroad Company is liable for 60 per cent of the damages reported by the master, being the per cent of damages which accrued while the corn remained undelivered in the yards at Birmingham.'\n\n It was accordingly adjudged and decreed that the complainant recover of the Southern Railway Company $415.84, and of the Louisville & Nashville Railroad Company $609.42, being 60 per cent of the recovery awarded by the chancellor, together with interest from May 8, 1905, making a total of $ 623.73. The plaintiff in error took an appeal to the supreme court of the state. It assigned as error the action of the court of chancery appeals (1) 'In refusing to find certain uncontradicted facts when specially requested to so find.' The facts were set out. (2) That the court erred in holding the company liable for any portion of the alleged damage 'because, under the facts of the case, it was not a connecting carrier, and was not bound to handle these shipments.' The other errors assigned we are not concerned with. The decree of the chancery court of appeals was affirmed without an opinion by the supreme court. The order of affirmance recites that the cause came 'on to be heard upon the transcript of the record from the chancery court of Jefferson county, the opinion and findings of fact of the court of chancery appeals, and the assignment of errors filed to the decree of said court of chancery appeals by the defendant, Louisville & Nash- \n\n[204 U.S. 551, 554]\n\u00a0\n ville Railroad Company, and the reply brief of complainants.'\n The assignments of error in this court are to the effect that the supreme court erred in not giving full force and effect to the interstate commerce act, which, it is contended, governed the shipments, and in not disregarding the statutes and decisions of the state in conflict therewith, and in denying the rights claimed by plaintiff in error under the interstate commerce act. And that the court erred in holding that it was the duty of plaintiff in error to switch over its yards and terminals cars tendered to it by the Southern Railway Company; in holding that it did not have the right to discriminate as to freight arriving on its own lines, or could not prefer its own business; in rendering judgment against it because it would not turn over its private switch yards and terminals to a competing road, and because of its refusal to make a through routing with the Southern Railway Company; in holding that it was its duty to switch cars for other roads within its terminals to the exclusion of its own business, the effect being to cause an obstruction to interstate commerce and an interference with the paramount duties to which to was subjected by the Constitution and laws of the United States.\n Other facts will appear in the opinion.\n Messrs. James B. Wright and John H. Frantz for plaintiff in error. \n\n[204 U.S. 551, 555]\n\u00a0\n Mr. C. T. Rankin for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice McKenna: \n\n[204 U.S. 551, 556]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n A motion is made to dismiss the writ of error, on the ground that no Federal question was raised in the state courts or decided by them. In opposition to the motion plaintiff in error contends that the allegations of the bill and its denial thereof sufficiently raise a Federal question, and that the courts of the state, in rendering judgment against plaintiff in error, necessarily decided that question. And it is further contended that, even if those courts did not pass on the Federal question, their failure or refusal to do so is equivalent to a decision against the Federal rights involved. A number of cases are cited to sustain these propositions. But is the basis of the propositions sound? In other words, was a Federal question raised, or, if raised, ignored? First, as to the pleadings. The bill charges a breach of the contracts of ship- \n\n[204 U.S. 551, 557]\n\u00a0\n ment by one or the other of the railway companies who, the bill alleges, were connecting common carriers, and, as such, bound by the contracts and the law relative to common carriers to receive and forward to destination the goods shipped, in good order and in a reasonable time. Plaintiff in error admitted that it was a common carrier in some states, but was not a connecting and ultimate carrier of the corn in question, denied that it was bound by the contracts, and denied that 'it was bound by law' to receive the corn and forward and deliver it to its ultimate destination. And this denial, it is insisted, raised a Federal question. We do not think so. The denial was of a legal conclusion resulting from the facts alleged, and added nothing to them. Besides, if a party relies upon a Federal right, he must specially set it up, and a denial of liability under the law is not a compliance with that requirement. For this we need not cite cases.\n Was a Federal question decided or ignored? To answer the question a review of the proceedings is necessary. The chancery court held that, as between the complainant and plaintiff in error, there was no liability upon the part of the latter. The rights of the railway companies, between themselves, the court said, need not be determined. The opinion and findings of the chancery court of appeals are very elaborate. They state the issue, the proceedings in and the judgment of the chancery court, and recite that--\n'Now, it appears that the Louisville & Nashville Railway denies any liability for its refusal to receive corn shipped over the Southern Railway after its arrival at Birmingham and deliver it over its terminal tracks to the American Mill & Elevator Company, to whom the corn had been sold.\n\n'Of course, this denial is predicated upon the idea that it was not a connecting carrier in handling the shipments of corn involved in this case, or that it was under any obligation respecting the same.'\n\n Passing on these denials the court said that at the time of the shipments the Southern Railway Company was placing \n\n[204 U.S. 551, 558]\n\u00a0\n shipments, as they were requested, upon the spur track of plaintiff in error, and that the latter was accustomed to receive them and remove them to places where they were to be delivered; and this was its custom for years, and, until about the time or just before the corn reached Birmingham, 'it was a part of its business and a daily occurrence to receive and remove such cars of freight.' And this was done for all persons offering them and without discrimination. For this service it received compensation. The court, however, also found that plaintiff in error 'placed an embargo upon the receipt or handling of such cars, November 13, 1902, after the complainant had contracted to sell the car loads of corn, and after most of them were shipped.'\n The contention of the Louisville & Nashville Railroad Company, the court stated as follows:\n'The contention of the Louisville & Nashville Railroad Company, reduced to its simplest statement, is that it was not bound to receive these cars of corn and place them.\n\n'This insistence on its part rests upon the proposition that, in the matter of handling the cars of other roads in its yards or over its spur tracks, it was not a common carrier, but simply a private carrier, and that, this being so, it had the right to refuse to receive and handle these cars, and, as a corollary to this proposition, that it had the right to discriminate between freight arriving in Birmingham over its lines and freight arriving over other lines, and could give preference between those that it chose to serve in this business.'\n\n The court decided against the contention, and that the company, by reason of its practice in handling freight, 'assumed with respect thereto the character of a common carrier, and hence incurred the duties and liabilities of such character.' The court added:\n'The result is that we are of opinion that the Louisville & Nashville Railway Company was bound, by virtue of its previous course of business, to accept these cars of corn and deliver them to their destination on its terminal or spur \n\n[204 U.S. 551, 559]\n\u00a0\n tracks, and that, by reason of its failure to do so, it is liable for all damages resulting from its failure, . . .'\n\n There was a petition for an additional finding of fact and a rehearing, which the court said would take in the neighborhood of one hundred pages of typewritten information to set out and answer in the form in which they were presented. Some, however, were granted; some qualified. We give only those which we think are relevant. The fifteenth request was that the court set out in full from the evidence, which was, it was said, uncontradicted, the conditions which caused the embargo to be laid by plaintiff in error against switching. The evidence was set out. The court, answering the request, said:\n'The simple fact in connection with this matter is that the Louisville & Nashville Railroad Company declined to receive these cars of corn and deliver them to their destination on their spur or side tracks, because it deemed it to its advantage to use its said tracks for and in its own special business.'\n\n The twenty-fifth request was 'that the terminals and equipment of the Louisville & Nashville Railroad Company at that time were sufficient under ordinary circumstances and conditions.' In granting this request the court remarked:\n'The twenty-fifth request is granted, with the statement that, in our opinion, based upon the evidence as we construe it, the Louisville & Nashville Railroad Company could have handled this corn and delivered it to its destination much sooner than it did had it not preferred other business, and even with that business, with the energetic appliance of all the means and facilities at its command.'\n\n It will be seen from this statement of the case that there is not a word in it which refers to the interstate commerce act or the assertion of any rights under that act. Plaintiff in error accounts for the want of explicit statement on the ground that the action was instituted and tried, until the decision of the chancery court, upon the theory that the Southern Railway Company and plaintiff in error were 'connecting car- \n\n[204 U.S. 551, 560]\n\u00a0\n riers,' and that this theory of the case having been disproved and the appeal dismissed as to plaintiff in error, complainant (defendant in error) shifted its position, and, under the broad practice and pleading in the state court, was allowed to proceed and procure judgment upon the theory that plaintiff in error had discriminated against defendant in error by preferring its own business, that it had failed to furnish equal facilities for interchange as to this shipment, and that, on account of its previous switching arrangements with the Southern Railway Company, it had no right to refuse to 'switch' the cars over its terminals. The record furnishes no justification for this contention. The bill charged the railroad companies as being connecting common carriers, plaintiff in error being the ultimate carrier, and that both were bound by the contracts made, and bound to carry the corn from the points of shipment to destination. Plaintiff in error denied these allegations, as we have seen, and on the issue thus formed proof was taken.\n The chancery court found, it is true, in favor of plaintiff in error. The case was taken to the court of chancery appeals, where it was heard, the record recites, 'upon the transcript of the record from the chancery court of Jefferson county and upon the assignments of error and briefs of counsel.' In other words, the court of chancery appeals heard the case as made in the chancery court. What the chancery court of appeals said of the issues and contentions of the parties we have already stated, and we need only repeat that the assignment of error by complainant (defendant in error) in the chancery court of appeals was general, and showed no change in the theory upon which the case was brought and conducted. It was that the chancery court erred in holding that there was no liability on the part of the Louisville & Nashville Railroad Company, and in refusing to hold that it was liable either alone or jointly with the other company. And the court said that the denial of plaintiff in error of liability was 'predicated upon the idea that it was not a \n\n[204 U.S. 551, 561]\n\u00a0\n connecting carrier in handling the shipments of corn involved in this case, or that it was under no obligations respecting the same.' It is true the court also said that plaintiff in error contended 'that it had the right to discriminate between freight arriving in Birmingham over its lines and freight arriving over other lines, and could give preference between those that it chose to serve in this business,' but this contention, it was also said, was 'as a corollary' to the proposition that plaintiff in error was not a common carrier, but simply a private carrier. The court determined against this proposition, and in consequence adjudged plaintiff in error liable. In other words, the judgment of the court was in exact response to the pleading. Nor was there any change on appeal to the supreme court. The railroad company's second assignment of error was (and it is the only one with which we can concern ourselves) that it was not 'liable for any portion of the alleged damage to these various shipments, because, under the facts of this case, it was not a connecting carrier, and was not bound to handle these shipments. . . .'\n There is in the printed record a certificate of the chief justice of the supreme court of the state, given when the writ of error was applied for, to the effect that the supreme court of the state was of opinion 'that the statutes and laws of Tennessee were not in conflict with the act of Congress regulating interstate commerce, and that the act of Congress did not control the shipments in controversy.' Counsel concedes the rule to be that the certificate of the presiding judge of a state court is insufficient to give us jurisdiction, but insists that it can make more certain and specific what is too general and indefinite in the record. There is no doubt of the rule, but there is nothing in this record to justify its application. There is nothing in the record to specialize. It is less open to conjecture than the certificate. As no Federal question was raised, the motion to dismiss must be granted.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","94":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLOVE v. FLAHIVE(1907)\nNo. 236\nArgued: Decided: March 25, 1907\n\n\n\n\n[205 U.S. 195, 196]\n\u00a0\n On December 3, 1900, Edward H. Love commenced this suit in the district court of Missoula county, Montana, to have Annie Flahive, the holder of the legal title to a specified tract in that county, adjudged to hold it in trust for him. A demurrer to the complaint was sustained by the district court, and, no amendment being asked, judgment was entered for the defendants. This judgment was affirmed by the supreme court of the state (33 Mont. 348, 83 Pac. 882), from which court the case was brought here on writ of error.\n The facts, as stated in the complaint and attached exhibits, are that plaintiff, with the purpose of entering the land as a homestead, and being qualified therefor, in May, 1882, settled upon, occupied, and fenced the entire tract, with the exception of the north 20 acres thereof. In addition to a controversy in the Land Department with the Northern Pacific Railroad Company, which claimed the land under its grant, but whose claim was finally rejected, he had a contest in the Land Department with Michael Flahive, who was also seeking to enter the land, which, after several hearings before the local land officers, with appeals to and decisions by the Commissioner of the General Land Office and the Secretary of the Interior, resulted in a final decision against him and an award of the land to the defendant Annie Flahive, the widow of Michael Flahive, who had died pending the proceedings. In pursuance of that award a patent was issued to her in December, 1899\n\n\n Messrs. Thomas C. Bach and Charles Edmund Pew for plaintiff in error. \n\n[205 U.S. 195, 197]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. S.

Hershey, and Woody & Woody for defendants in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Brewer: \n\n[205 U.S. 195, 198]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n Plaintiff rests his case on the contention that in the conclusions of the Secretary of the Interior there was error in matter of law, inasmuch as it is well settled that in the absence of fraud or imposition the findings of the Land Department on matters of fact are conclusive upon the courts. Johnson v. Towsley, 13 Wall. 72, 20 L. ed. 485; Lee v. Johnson, \n116 U.S. 48\n, 29 L. ed. 570, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 249; Lake Superior Ship Canal, R. & Iron Co. v.

Rep. 271, to the effect that when, by the action of the Department, a right of property has become vested in an applicant, it can be taken away only by a \n\n[205 U.S. 195, 199]\n\u00a0\n proceeding directly for that purpose, and contends that his right to the land was determined by certain findings of the Commissioner of the General Land Office on July 26, 1892, affirmed by the Secretary of the Interior on January 12, 1894. It is doubtless true that when once a patent has issued the jurisdiction of the Land Department over the land ceases, and any right of the government or third parties must be asserted by proceedings in the courts. United States v. Stone, 2 Wall. 525, 235, 17 L. ed. 765, 767; Michigan Land & Lumber Co. v. Rust, \n168 \nU.S. 589, 593\n, 42 S. L. ed. 591, 592, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 208, and cases cited. It may also be conceded that a right of property may become vested by a decision of the Land Department, of which the applicant cannot be deprived except upon proceedings directly therefor, and of which he has notice. Cornelius V. Kessel, \n128 U.S. 456\n, 32 L. ed. 482, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 122; Orchard v. Alexander, \n157 \nU.S. 372, 383\n, 39 S. L. ed. 737, 741, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 635; Parsons v. Venzke, \n164 U.S. 89\n, 41 L. ed. 360, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 27; Michigan Land & Lumber Co. v. Rust, supra. Without undertaking to indicate the limits to which this can be carried, it is enough to say that the proceedings in this case, both in the local land offices and by appeals and reviews in the General Land Office, were within the settled rules of procedure established by the Department in respect to such matters. Generally speaking, the Land Department has jurisdiction until the legal title has passed, and the several steps in this controversy were before the issue of the patent, while the jurisdiction of the Land Department continued, and with both parties present and participating. The question of title was in process of administration, and until the patent issued nothing was settled so as to stop further inquiry. Knight v. United Land Asso. \n142 U.S. 161\n, 35 L. ed. 974, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 258; Michigan Land & Lumber Co. v. Rust, supra. So, although it be conceded that the findings of the Secretary of the Interior, in 1894, were to the effect that the plaintiff had a right to enter the land, that decision was not final, and it was within the jurisdiction of the Land Department to institute further inquiry, and upon it to finally award the land to the party held to have the better right. \n\n[205 U.S. 195, 200]\n\u00a0\n This brings us to the pivotal fact. It appears from the complaint and exhibits that during the time that these proceedings were pending in the Lond Department, Love made a sale to James Rundall of the tract in controversy, or some other tract, or some logs, and that Rundall thereafter made a sale of the same property to Flahive. What was the thing sold is not positively shown by the testimony. In the final decision of the case the Secretary of the Interior, after giving a synopsis of the testimony, which he says is largely incomplete and irrelevant and not entirely satisfactory upon the question, says:\n'The witnesses Vanderpool and Lynch testify that Love had a place for sale which included the tract in controversy; Rundall, that he purchased the tract in controversy from Love. The latter denies any sale of the land, but states that he sold some logs for W. H. Finley. It is evident from Love's statement of the transaction that, conceding the sale to be only of logs, he was aware that the land upon which the logs were situated would be claimed by the purchaser of the logs, not by virtue of the sale of the logs, but because it appears that he sold the logs for the reason that the claim of W. H. Finley, upon which the logs were situated, was about to be taken by Rundall.\n\n ... * *\n'It appears that a clear preponderance of the testimony shows that the logs were situated upon the land in controversy; and from Love's evidence it is shown that he, at the time of this sale, laid no claim to the land upon which this unfinished cabin was erected.\n\n ... * *\n'It thus appears that from a preponderance of the testimony it is shown that this tract of land was not claimed by Love at the date of the sale of this land or of these logs; for it is evident that in either case Love asserted no title. It matters not, under the peculiar circumstances of this case, whether Love sold his own land or the land of W. H. Finley, or simply \n\n[205 U.S. 195, 201]\n\u00a0\n logs; as in the first instance it would work an estoppel of the assertion of claim now, in the second it would be conclusive evidence that the land was not claimed by him, and in the third it would be equally evidence of the same fact, as, from his own testimony, it appears that he laid no claim to the land upon which the logs were situated.\n\n'This decision is not to be understood as holding that Love, in selling the Finley claim to Rundall, conveyed to the latter any title, or that Rundall, in selling to Flahive, did so; but it appearing that this sale was made, it is conclusive evidence that Love asserted, at that time, no title in himself, or, if he had prior to such time asserted title, that by such sale he relinquished all claim in and to the tract in controversy; and that he is in equity and good faith estopped from asserting title against the vendee of the purchaser from him.\n\n'The decision appealed from is therefore affirmed and the application of Love to enter the tract in controversy is held subject to the rights of Annie Flahive, the widow of Michael Flahive.'\n\n Of course, whether there was a sale, and what was the thing sold, were matters of fact to be determined by the testimony, and the findings of the Land Department in that respect are conclusive in the courts. It is objected by the plaintiff that a sale of a homestead prior to the issue of patent is void under the statutes of the United States. Anderson v. Carkins, \n135 U.S. 483\n, 34 L. ed. 272, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 905. This is undoubtedly the law, and the ruling of the Secretary was not in conflict with it; but the fact that one seeking to enter a tract of land as a homestead cannot make a valid sale thereof is not at all inconsistent with his right to relinquish his application for the land, and so the Secretary of the Interior ruled. While public policy may prevent enforcing a contract of sale, it does not destroy its significance as a declaration that the vendor no longer claims any rights. He cannot sell and at the same time deny that he has made a sale. The government may fairly treat it as a relinquishment-an abandonment-of his application \n\n[205 U.S. 195, 202]\n\u00a0\n and entry. No man entering land as a homestead is bound to perfect his title by occupation. He may abandon it at any time, or he may in any other satisfactory way relinquish the rights acquired by his entry. Having done that, he is no longer interested in the title to the land. That is a matter to be settled between the government and other applicants. In this case, Love having relinquished his claim, it does not lie in his mouth to challenge the action of the government in patenting the land to Mrs. Flahive.\n We see no error in the record, and the judgment of the Supreme Court of Montana is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice White took no part in the decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","95":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLOVE v. FLAHIVE(1907)\nNo. 236\nArgued: Decided: May 27, 1907\n\n\n\n Messrs. C. B. Nolan and C. E. Pew in support of petition.\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n A petition for rehearing calls our attention to a misstatement in the opinion. We said that 'it appears from the complaint and exhibits that during the time that these proceedings were pending in the Land Department, Love made a sale to James Rundell,' etc. The facts are that in May, 1882, Love settled upon and occupied the tract in controversy with the purpose of entering it as a homestead; that the land was then unsurveyed public land; that it was not surveyed until 1888, and that on January 2, 1889, plaintiff for the first time filed in the land office an application for an entry. It further appears that the sale to Rundell was made in September, 1883, after the original settlement by the plaintiff, while the land was unsurveyed, and before the application to enter. Hence it is not strictly true that while 'proceedings were pending in the Land Department \n\n[206 U.S. 356, 357]\n\u00a0\n Love made a sale,' for there was nothing of record or on file in that Department until after the entry.\n Now the plaintiff contends that, conceding that there was a sale, and that thereby the plaintiff relinquished the right of entry which he had acquired by his settlement, yet thereafter, without having abandoned the possession, he filed his application in the land office; that that application must be considered as an entirely new proceeding, initiated by one in actual possession, desiring to take the land as a homestead, and that it is error, and error of law, to adjudge it vitiated or affected by the prior sale.\n Conceding that the effect of a sale prior to the application projects into the case a question of law, we are still of opinion that the decision of the Secretary was right, and that the award of the patent to Mrs. Flahive must be sustained. A sale made by a party who is in possession of a tract of public land with an intent thereafter to enter it as a homestead is equivalent to a relinquishment of his right to enter, and the Department may properly treat him as having no further claims upon the land. He may not sell, and still have the rights of one who has not sold. He does not, by merely continuing in possession, create a new right of entry as against the party in whose favor he has relinquished his right.\n We are of opinion, therefore, that the sale in 1883 was rightfully held by the Department to estop the plaintiff from subsequent entry of the land; at least, as against one who was a purchaser from his vendee.\n The petition for rehearing is denied. \n\n\n\n","96":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLOWREY v. TERRITORY OF HAWAII(1907)\nNo. 195\nArgued: Decided: May 13, 1907\n\n\n\n This action was brought in the supreme court of the territory of Hawaii to recover from the territory the sum of $15,000 as the alternative of the reconveyance of certain property conveyed by the American Board of Commissioners of Foreign Missions in 1849 to the Hawaiian government, for the nonfulfilment of the conditions upon which the property was con- \n\n[206 U.S. 206, 207]\n\u00a0\n veyed. A demurrer was sustained to the petition and thereupon this appeal was taken.\n The following is an outline of the principal facts alleged:\n The American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, hereinafter called the American Board, for many years prior to 1850 had conducted and maintained a Protestant mission in the Hawaiian Islands, and, as an essential part of its missionary work, carried on many schools. Its most notable educational work was centered in a school established in 1831 at Lahainaluna, on the Island of Maui, where it possessed a large tract of land. This school and the premises occupied by it were set off by the chiefs to the protestant mission in 1835. On the building and other improvements many thousands of dollars were expended, and the school had, in 1850, become a most important factor in the life and progress of the Hawaiian people, and was recognized as the leading educational institution in the kingdom.\n The course of instruction comprised not only the usual topics belonging to secular learning, but included also direct religious teaching and training in the doctrines represented by the mission. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[206 U.S. 206, 208]\n\u00a0\n These facts were established before the board of commissioners to quiet land titles, to which the claim of the American Board to Lahainaluna, as an established part of its system, was duly presented and recognized, and the board of commissioners adjudged as follows: 'Lahainaluna, part 5, section 2, claim relinquished before the land commission in consequence of an after-arrangement having been entered into with the Hawaiian government by the mission. Vol. 3 L. C. Award, pp. 143 et seq., upon the final confirmation which was duly made to the said A. B. C. F. M. all the lands claimed were awarded, 'with the exception of section 2, Lahainaluna, which had been withdrawn.\" The 'after-arrangement' referred to in the records of the land commissioners was as follows:\n'Because of financial stress, and also feeling that the school, which had really become a national institution, should be conducted by the government at its own expense, in April, 1849, the mission, at its general mission held in Honolulu, voted as follows: 'To make over this seminary to the government, it being understood that it is to be conducted on the same principles as heretofore.'\n\n'An offer was thereupon made to the government in pursuance to this vote of the mission to make over the school to the government on condition that it should 'be continued at its expense as an institution for the cultivation of sound literature and solid science, and further, that it shall not teach or allow to be taught any religious tenet or doctrine contrary to those heretofore inculcated by the mission, a summary of which will be found in the confession of faith herewith inclosed, \n\n[206 U.S. 206, 209]\n\u00a0\n and that, in case of the nonfulfilment or violation of the conditions upon which this transfer is made by the said government, the whole property hereby transferred, hereinbefore specified, together with any additions of improvements, should revert to the said mission.\"\n\n This offer as made was not accepted by the government, but it instread submitted a counter offer to the mission, by which it offered to take over the school on the conditions made in the mission's original offer, but 'provided that, in case of the nonfulfilment on the part of this government of the conditions specified in the letter of the above- named gentlemen, it shall be optional with this government to allow the institution, with all additions and improvements which may have been made upon the premises and all rights and privileges connected therewith, to revert to the said mission, to be held in behalf of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, or to pay the sum of $15,000; provided also that, in case this government shall find it expedient to divert this establishment to other purposes than those of education, it shall be at liberty to do so, on condition that it sustain an institution of like character and on similar principles in some other place on the island, or pay the sum of $15,000 to said mission in behalf of the Mission Board in Boston.'\n A more definite form of the 'confession of faith' was substituted and accepted by the government, and the whole arrangement ratified by the Hawaiian legislature, Law of 1850 (F. C. 1850) 158,  1 of Civil Code ( 1859)  783, and by the prudential committee of the American Board.\n The letter of the mission to the Minister of Public Instruction is inserted in the margin. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[206 U.S. 206, 210]\n\u00a0\n The Hawaiian government at once took possession of the Lahainaluna seminary and carried on the school exactly as it had been conducted by the Mission, both in religious instruction and the inculcation of sound literature and solid science.\n For many years after the government had taken over the school the principals of the school continued their relations as missionaries of the American Board in their work in the school, and continued to make reports of their educational and religious \n\n[206 U.S. 206, 211]\n\u00a0\n work and instruction in the school to the general meetings of the mission.\n In 1862 the seminary buildings were burned down. Other buildings were built. The principal, in his report for that year, 1862-63, reviewing the history of the school, says: 'The Hawaiian government has always been a liberal friend and benefactor. . . . Never in any way have they interfered with our manner of instruction, or in the course of instructions \n\n[206 U.S. 206, 212]\n\u00a0\n pursued. In our work we have had all the freedom which we possibly could have had under the A. B. C. F. M.' Also, referring to pupils who, under the religious instruction at the school, became ministers, he says: 'While six who were connected with it since it has been under the care of the Hawaiian government have been ordained to the same office.'\n Prior to the establishment of the Anglican Church in Hawaii the board of education appointed as instructors such persons as were acceptable to the mission, generally selecting those nominated by the mission. When the Anglican mission was established it was proposed that the forms and probably the substance of religious instruction should be changed, and advice was asked of the Attorney General. His reply reviewed the whole arrangement upon which the government received the seminary, and concluded as follows: 'Should the government not be willing to keep the conditions as far as I have shown, then the property and improvements must be restored to the A. B. C. F. M.' \n\n[206 U.S. 206, 213]\n\u00a0\n In 1865 the Hawaiian Gazette, the official mouthpiece of the government, declared that the government had resolved that its support should be given to schools irrespective of their religious teaching, but pointed out that the board of education might be chargeable with partiality for supporting a state church, inasmuch as it paid large sums to defray the expenses of Lahainaluna, where the principles and theology of one particular sect were exclusively taught, although opposed to the belief of all in communion with Roman Catholic and Episcopal churches.\n In the following years, upon the suggestion by the mission of certain instructors, a correspondence arose between the board of education and the mission, in which the board of education said that it was understood that the institution was to be continued so as to aid instead of to defeat the purpose for which it had been founded, and that nothing had been done to justify the intimation that the board had any desire to defeat such purpose, and admitted 'that a full compliance with agreement consists in appointing persons teaching in the doctrine and after the manner of the Congregational and Presbyterian churches of the United States.' And further: 'The board are fully aware that if they do not see fit to carry on the institution according to the terms of the contract, they have to reconvey it, or pay the sum of $15,000.'\n After 1865 the seminary continued to be conducted on the same lines as prior thereto.\n In 1894, in the Constitution of the Republic of Hawaii, it was provided that '. . . No public money shall be appropriated . . . for the support of (or?) benefit of any sectarian, denominational, or private school.' This provision is continued and remains in full force as a part of  55 of the organic act.\n Religious instruction ceased to be a part of the curriculum at Lahainaluna, as provided in the agreement, on or about September 1, 1903, at which date the religious tenets and doctrines, in accordance with the creed and articles of faith \n\n[206 U.S. 206, 214]\n\u00a0\n of the mission, ceased to be taught, and are no longer taught. The 'cultivation of sound literature and solid science' has also ceased, and the institution has become a technical school under the name of 'The Lahainaluna Agricultural School.'\n The territory maintains no other institution of like character and on similar principles in any other place on the island.\n The appellants are the successors of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions.\n Upon these facts, it is alleged, that appellants have become entitled to a return of the property conveyed or to the payment of $15,000; that the territory has refused to do either, but has elected to retain the property, which election is evidenced by its refusal to pay the said sum, and the further fact that it is proceeding to erect expensive buildings thereon and expend large sums of money in fitting the property and the school to become a technical school,-namely, an agricultural college.\n The petition was demurred to upon the grounds substantially as follows:\n\n 1. \nThat the court had no jurisdiction of the subject-matter of the claim. 2. That the United States was a necessary party, the property described in the petition having been transferred and ceded to the United States by the treaty of annexation of July 7, 1898. 3. That the petition did not set out facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action in that, ( a) it did not appear that the agreement set forth in the petition was ratified by the legislature; (b) that the right of action accrued more than two years prior to the commencement of the action; (c) it did not appear that there had been a breach of the conditions of the agreement; (d) or, if so, that it occurred in compliance with law and statutes which rendered the fulfilment of the conditions impossible. 4. That the petition was indefinite and uncertain, in that the allegations as to breach of conditions pleaded were conclusions of law, it nowhere appearing in the petition in what respect the conditions had been broken. The supreme court overruled the first, second, \n\n[206 U.S. 206, 215]\n\u00a0\n and fourth grounds, and divisions a and b of the third ground of demurrer.\n Messrs. David L. Withington, William R. Castle, W. O. Smith, A. Lewis, Jr., and C. H. Olson for appellants.\n\n\n[206 U.S. 206, 217]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Lorrin Andrews, E. C. Peters, and M. F. Prosser for appellee. \n\n[206 U.S. 206, 218]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n The contentions of the parties are sharply in opposition as to the agreement, and the necessity and competency of extrinsic evidence to explain it. Appellee contends that we are confined to the letter of the agreement, and, so confined, its conditions have been fulfilled. In other words, that 'sound literature and solid science' are still cultivated, and that no religious tenet or doctrine contrary to those heretofore inculcated by the mission is taught. Or, to express the contention in language other than that of the agreement, that a school devoted to one subject of secular science, and which excludes all religious teaching, was contemplated by or is permitted by the agreement. Opposing these views, appellants contend that a mere technical school does not fulfil the agreement; that the terms of the agreement require the 'inculcation of general learning and knowledge,' accompanied with religious instruction in accordance with the confession of faith submitted to the Hawaiian government. And it is insisted that, if there is any- \n\n[206 U.S. 206, 219]\n\u00a0\n thing doubtful in the agreement, it may be interpreted by the circumstances which preceded it and the immediate and long-continued practice under it. If we may resort to those circumstances and that practice there cannot be a shade of doubt as to the intention of the parties. It is insisted, however, by the appellee, that the agreement is clear and unambiguous, and that it does not present a case for the resort to extrinsic evidence. We cannot concur with this view. There is quite a range of meaning in the words 'sound literature and solid science.' To interpret or specialize them and make definite application of them would certainly receive aid from the practice of the parties. It is contended by appellants that there was a close connection between them and the 'definite system of doctrine' which was the 'central purpose of the mission.' We, however, need not dwell further upon this contention, though a plausible argument has been advanced to sustain it, and we pass to the next controverted contention. The words of the agreement are that the government 'shall not teach or allow to be taught any religious tenet or doctrine contrary to those heretofore inculcated by the mission, a summary of which will be found in the confession of faith herewith inclosed . . .' Were these words all there was of prohibition and purpose as to religion? May we believe that it became suddenly the purpose to change an institution which had had its impulse and foundation in religious zeal to convert the Hawaiians to Christianity and to educate young men to be 'teachers of religion,' to one simply literary and scientific and nonsectarian? Had the belief of the mission in its form of Christian faith become so indifferent that it would transfer a seminary instituted for the propagation of that faith with no other condition than that contrary tenets should not be taught? There is not a syllable in this record to justify such assumptions. It must be remembered that we are considering a transaction which occurred in the Hawaiian Islands in 1849, and by the conditions of that time were the acts of the parties induced. Besides, the agreement is not in a formally executed \n\n[206 U.S. 206, 220]\n\u00a0\n paper. It is found in a correspondence, and is constituted and explained by the whole of the correspondence. And, taking the whole of it, there is very little aid from extrinsic evidence needed to demonstrate its meaning and purpose.\n The mission reminds the Minister of Public Instruction that the seminary was established in 1831, 'to promote the diffusion of enlightened literature and Christianity throughout the islands,' and that it had been unceasingly watched over, cherished, and cared for by the mission, and that $77,000 had been expended for its benefit. It was stated that, in consequence of debts incurred 'in the prosecution of its labors of benevolence and mercy,' the American Board of Commissioners of Foreign Missions was compelled to diminish its grants to each of the missions under its care, including the Hawaiian mission, and that the latter, for that reason, would be 'unable to carry forward its operations with the vigor to be desired in all of its departments of labor.' In view of these facts, it was stated and believed that, under the circumstances, the tranfser of the institution 'to the fostering care and patronage of the government' would 'promote the highest interest of the Hawaiian people.' An offer was then made to transfer the seminary with the conditions which we have referred to. A confession of faith was inclosed. The government modified the proposal by reserving the right to pay $15,000 as an alternative to the reversion of the property to the mission if the government should not fulfil the conditions of the grant. The modification was accepted, and, in a subsequent communication, a new confession of faith was substituted for that originally proposed. The following are the reasons which were given:\n'The reasons for requesting the substitution are, that the previously presented confession, although according in all its specified doctrines with our belief and with that also of the churches by whom that institution has been founded and sustained, is yet not so distinctive as to present a barrier to the introduction there of other deleterious doctrine not speci- \n\n[206 U.S. 206, 221]\n\u00a0\n fied in said confession. It will admit, also, of teachings of this mission and of the churches sustaining it, such as we feel to be entirely subversive of evangelical Christianity. Not doubting but that these reasons will commend themselves to the members of his Majesty's government, we beg leave to express, in presenting them, the high consideration with which we remain.'\n\n The correspondence concerned the transfer of a school established in 1835, the design of which was to perpetuate the Christian religion, and with an object described to be 'still more definite and of equal or greater importance,'-that is, 'to educate young men to be Christian ministers.' A religious instruction was prescribed. All this the government was informed of when the proposition was made to transfer the school to its 'fostering care and patronage.' And the government accepted the grant, accepted as it was tendered, and necessarily for the purpose it was tendered.\n Even if we stopped here, conviction of the justness of that conclusion is almost indisputable. It becomes indisputable if extrinsic evidence be considered, and we have no doubt that it may be. In Bradley v. Washington, A. & G. Steam Packet Co. 13 Pet. 89, 10 L. ed. 72, a contract expressed in a correspondence between the parties for the hire of a steamboat, an exception was ingrafted which was not expressed, upon evidence that the owner of the boat knew the service for which it was intended, and that when navigation was obstructed by ice another mode of transportation was resorted to. The court said, as to extrinsic evidence, it was applied in some cases 'to ascertain the identity of the subject; in others its extent. In some, to ascertain the meaning of a term, where it had acquired by use a particular meaning; in others, to ascertain in what sense it was used where it admitted of several meanings. But in all the purpose was the same. To ascertain by this medium of proof the intention of the parties, where, without the aid of such evidence, that could not be done, so as to give a just interpretation to the contract.' And it was expressed 'as the just result' of the cases, \n\n[206 U.S. 206, 222]\n\u00a0\n 'that, in giving effect to a written contract by applying it to its proper subject-matter, extrinsic evidence may be admitted to prove the circumstances under which it was made, whenever, without the aid of such evidence, such application could not be made in the particular case.' In Brooklyn L. Ins. Co. v. Dutcher, \n95 U.S. 269\n, 24 L. ed. 410, it was said: 'There is no surer way to find out what parties meant than to see what they have done.' So obvious and potent a principle hardly needs the repetition it has received. And equally obvious and potent is a resort to the circumstances and conditions which preceded a contract. Necessarily in such circumstances and conditions will be found the inducement to the contract and a test of its purpose. The conventions of parties may change such circumstances and conditions, or continue them, but it cannot be separated from them. And this makes the value of contemporaneous construction. it is valuable to explain a statute where disinterested judgment is alone invoked and exercised. It is of greater value to explain a contract where self-interest is quick to discern the extent of rights or obligations, and never yield more than the written or spoken word requires. See, for further illustration, the following: Reed v. Merchants' Mut. Ins. Co. \n95 U.S. 23\n, 24 L. ed. 348; District of Columbia v. Gallaher, \n124 U.S. 505\n, 31 L. ed. 526, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 585; Topliff v. Topliff, \n122 U.S. 121\n, 30 L. ed. 1110, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1057; Paige v. Banks, 13 Wall. 608, 20 L. ed. 709; Philadelphia, W. & B. R. Co. v. Trimble, 10 Wall. 367, 19 L. ed. 948; Chicago v. Sheldon, 9 Wall. 50, 19 L. ed. 594; Cavazos v. Trevino, 6 Wall. 773; 18 L. ed. 813; Simpson v. United States, \n199 \nU.S. 397, 399\n, 50 S. L. ed. 245, 246, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 54; Chicago Great Western R. Co. v. Northern P. R. Co. 42 C. C. A. 25, 101 Fed. 792. And many state cases could be cited.\n The design of studies for the school we have detailed. The government recognized and continued both without question or change in any way. The seminary buildings were burned down in 1862. The government rebuilt them and continued the school. The petition alleges that the principal of the school, in 1862-63, in his report, said: 'The Hawaiian government has always been a liberal friend and benefactor. . . . \n\n[206 U.S. 206, 223]\n\u00a0\n Never, in any way, have they interfered with our manner of instruction or in the course of instruction pursued. In our work we have had all the freedom which we possibly could have had under the A. B. C. F. M.' Also, referring to pupils who, under the religious instruction at the school, became ministers, he says: 'While six who were connected with it since it has been under the care of the Hawaiian government have been ordained to the same office.'\n In 1864 new interests appeared and a change in the purpose of the school commenced to be urged. It was met by an adverse opinion of the Attorney General, who pointed out the conditions of the transfer, and the condition of their nonfulfilment to be the restoration of the property to the A. B. C. F. M. And, again, in 1865, the board of education, while denying the right of the mission to nominate instructors, conceded the obligation to continue the institution, 'so as to aid, instead of defeating, the purpose for which it was founded,' and the alternative to be the surrender of the property or the payment of $15,000. 'Religious instruction,' it is alleged, 'upon the lines formerly pursued by the mission and subsequently by the government, in accordance with the agreement, was continued up to or about September 1, 1903.' We hence see that not only the immediate practice of the government construed the agreement as contended for by appellants, but the practice of over fifty years proclaimed the same meaning,-proclaimed it without question and against a suggestion and agitation to reject it. It is somewhat staggering to be told that such continuity of practice is not a legal interpreter of the meaning of the parties, and that the only criterion can be a precise and isolated from of words which, at the end of a half a century of contrary admission and declaration, one of the parties finds it convenient to bring forward.\n It is no defense that the government's policy has changed. It cannot so release itself from its engagement. The provision for the teaching of 'sound literature and solid science' might be considered of 'expansive character,' to use the \n\n[206 U.S. 206, 224]\n\u00a0\n description of Lieber, and change with the progress of both. The provision for religious teaching is unchanging. It is as definite and absolute to- day as it was when it was written. The alternative of it the agreement has made the return of the property conveyed, or the payment of $15,000.\n Judgment reversed and case remanded, with directions to proceed in conformity with this opinion.\n Mr. Justice Brewer took no part in the decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Laws of the High School, as Amended and Adopted by the Mission, June, 1835.\n Chapter I.\n Design of the School.\n The design of the High School is, \n[\nFootnote 1\n] To aid the mission in accomplishing the great work for which they were sent hither; that is, to introduce and perpetuate the religion of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, with all its accompanying blessings, civil, literary, and religious. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] Another object, still more definite and of equal or greater importance, is, to educate young men of piety and promising talents, with a view to their becoming assistant teachers of religion, or fellow laborers with us in disseminating the gospel of Jesus Christ to their dying fellow men.\n Chapter VII.\n Of the Studies of the School. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] The whole school shall meet between daylight and sunrise each week day for prayer, at which one of the instructors shall preside; the roll shall be called, absentees marked and called to an account at least once a week. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] On the afternoons of Tuesdays and Thurdays each week, or at other times equivalent, the whole school shall meet for biblical instruction, embracing the interpretation of Scripture, evidence of Christianity, archaeology, and sacred geography.

R. Armstrong, Minister of Public Instruction of the Hawaiian Islands.\n Sir: The undersigned, a committee of the general meeting of the mission of the A. B. C. F. M., at the Sandwich Islands, appointed in reference to the Mission Seminary at Lahainaluna, Maui, beg leave, through your Excellency, \n to offer a few remarks respecting that institution, and make some proposals in reference to it to his Majesty's government for its consideration.\n It is well known to his Majesty, and also to most of the members of his government, that, in the year 1831, the mission commenced the establishment of the institution now known as the Mission Seminary of Lahainaluna, Maui, to promote the diffusion of enlightened literature and Christianity throughout the islands.\n From that period to the present time this institution has been unceasingly and anxiously watched over, cherished, and cared for by the mission. No expense or pains coming within its appropriate means or power have been spared to promote its usefulness and secure the objects of its establishment.\n Three missionaries have, for a large portion of the time, been devoted to its interests, and two at all times since the two or three first years of its existence. About $77,000.00 have been expended for its benefit, including the support of the teachers and the dwellings erected for their accommodation.\n We need not point you to the fruits of this cherished institution, scattered throughout the islands, filling various posts of honor, responsibility, and usefulness, both in and out of the government. They are well known to his Majesty and the officers of his government, and to none better than yourself.\n The institution has been planted and sustained to the present time by the American Board of Commissioners of Foreign Missions, from donations given by the American churches for the spread of the gospel in heathen lands. That board, as we learn by recent intelligence, was, at the close of its last financial year, embarrassed by a debt of $60,000.00, incurred in the prosecution of its labors of benevolence and mercy.\n As a consequence of its indebtedness, it has been obliged to curtail its expenditures by diminishing its grants to each one of the missions under its care, and this mission, in common with others, has shared in the general reduction.\n For this reason the mission will be unable to carry forward its operations with the vigor to be desired in all of its departments of labor. Some must almost inevitably suffer for want of pecuniary means.\n In view of these facts, and believing that, under present circumstances, the transfer of this institution to the fostering care and patronage of government will promote the highest interests of the Hawaiian people, we beg leave, \n through your Excellency, to submit to his Majesty's government for its consideration the following proposals, viz:\n That the mission of the A. B. C. F. M. at the Sandwich Islands, acting for and in behalf of the said American Board of Commissioners of Foreign Missions, having its headquarters in Boston, state of Massachusetts, in the United States of America, relinquish all of their right, title, and interest to and in the seminary buildings located at Lahainaluna on the island of Maui, and known as the Mission Seminary, together with all of the dwelling houses at that station erected by the mission at the expense of the said A. B. C. F. M., for the use of the teachers in the said Mission Seminary; also the building erected by the mission as a printing office and bindery; also all lands pertaining to and granted for the use of the Missionary Seminary, and also all philosophical and other apparatus procured for the use of the said seminary, also the public library of the said institution, and to transfer the same to the Hawaiian government for its use, benefit, and behoof, to have and to hold the same forever.\n Providing, however, and this transfer is made upon the express condition, that the said Hawaiian government agrees that the said institution shall be continued at its expense, as an institution for the cultivation of sound literature and solid science; and, further, that it shall not teach or allow to be taught any religious tenet or doctrine contrary to those heretofore inculcated by the mission, which we represent, a summary of which will be found in the confession of faith herewith inclosed, and in that in case of the nonfulfilment or violation of the conditions upon which this transfer is made by the said government, the whole property hereby transferred, hereinbefore specified, together with any additions or improvements which may have been made upon the premises, and all the right and privileges hereby conveyed or transferred to the Hawaiian government by the said island mission, shall revert to the said mission, to have and to hold the same for and in behalf of the American Board of Commissioners of Foreign Missions.\n These proposals, if accepted, by the Hawaiian government, shall not have binding force until they shall have received the sanction of the prudential committee of the American Board Commissioners of Foreign Missions in Boston; and further, should the said Hawaiian government accept the proposals here presented, and enter forthwith upon the fulfilment of the condi- \n tions, and should the said transfer not meet the approbation of the prudential committee, the mission, on its part, pledges itself to refund to the said government any necessary expenses it may have incurred in carrying on the institution whilst the parties were awaiting the ratification or rejection of this transfer by the said prudential committee. Provided, however, that moneys shall not have been expended in enlargement or improvements, other than what may have been actually necessary to keep the buildings in repair and carry on the institution.\n In case of disagreement of the parties as to the amount proper to be refunded, in case of the nonratification of this conveyance by the prudential committee, the sum shall be determined by two arbitrators, one of which shall be chosen by each of the respective parties, and which arbitrators, in case of disagreement, shall elect a third to decide upon the award.\n The foregoing remarks and proposals are respectfully submitted for the consideration of his Majesty's government, and I feel greatly obliged by an early answer.\n We have the honor to be,\n Very respectfully, your ex. friends and most obedient servants,\n W. P. Alexander,\n C. B. Andrews,\n S. N. Castle, Com.,\n By S. N. Castle. \n\n\n\n\n","97":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMARTIN v. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA(1907)\nNo. 190\nArgued: January 29, 1907Decided: March 11, 1907\n\n\n\n Messrs. Edwin C. Brandenburg, George E. Sullivan, and Clarence A. Brandenburg for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n[205 U.S. 135, 136]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Francis H. Stephens and Edward H. Thomas for defendant in error.\n\n\n[205 U.S. 135, 137]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n These are writs of certiorari to test the validity of assessments for the widening of an alley in Washington under the \n\n[205 U.S. 135, 138]\n\u00a0\n act of Congress of July 22, 1892, chap. 230 (27 Stat. at L. 255), as amended by the act of August 24, 1894, chap. 328 (28 Stat. at L. 501). The writs were quashed by the supreme court of the District and the judgments affirmed by the court of appeals. 26 App. D. C. 140, 146. The principal case is that of Brandenburg, the owner of land taken for the widening. That of Martin raises questions as to the rights of a mortgagee of the same land. The main issue is upon the constitutionality of the act. The statute authorizes the commissioners of the District to condemn, open, widen, etc., alleys upon the presentation to them of a plat of the same accompanied by a petition of the owners of more than one half of the real estate in the square in which such alley is sought to be opened, etc., or in certain other cases. After prescribed preliminaries the commissioners are to apply to the marshal of the District to impanel a jury of twelve disinterested citizens, and the marshal is to impanel them, first giving ten days' notice to each proprietor of land in the square. The jury is to appraise the damages to real estate and also is to 'apportion an amount equal to the amount of said damages so ascertained and appraised as aforesaid,' including fixed pay for the marshal and jury, 'according as each lot or part of lot of land in such square may be benefited by the opening, widening, extending, or straightening such alley,' with certain deductions. The amendment authorizes the commissioners to open minor streets, to run through a square, etc., whenever, in the judgment of said commissioners, the public interests require it.\n The law is not a legislative adjudication concerning a particular place and a particular plan, like the one before the court in Wight v. Davidson, \n181 U.S. 371\n, 45 L. ed. 900, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 616. It is a general prospective law. The charges in all cases are to be apportioned within the limited taxing district of a square, and therefore it well may happen, it is argued, that they exceed the benefit conferred, in some case of which Congress never thought and upon which it could not have passed. The present is said to be a flagrant instance of that sort. If this be true, perhaps the objection \n\n[205 U.S. 135, 139]\n\u00a0\n to the act would not be disposed of by the decision in Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Barber Asphalt Paving Co. \n197 U.S. 430\n, 49 L. ed. 819, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 466. That case dealt with the same objection, to be sure, in point of form, but a very different one in point of substance. The assessment in question there was an assessment for grading and paving, and it was pointed out that a legislature would be warranted in assuming that grading and paving streets in a good-sized city commonly would benefit adjoining land more than it would cost. The chance of the cost being greater than the benefit is slight, and the excess, if any, would be small. These and other considerations were thought to outweigh a merely logical or mathematical possibility on the other side, and to warrant sustaining an old and familiar method of taxation. It was emphasized that there should not be extracted from the very general language of the 14th Amendment, a system of delusive exactness and merely logical form.\n But when the chance of the cost exceeding the benefit grows large, and the amount of the not improbable excess is great, it may not follow that the case last cited will be a precedent. Constitutional rights like others are matters of degree. To illustrate: Under the police power, in its strict sense, a certain limit might be set to the height of buildings without compensation; but to make that limit 5 feet would require compensation and a taking by eminent domain. So it well might be that a form of assessment that would be valid for paving would not be valid for the more serious expenses involved in the taking of land. Such a distinction was relied on in French v. Barber Asphalt Paving Co. \n181 \nU.S. 324, 344\n, 45 S. L. ed. 879, 889, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 625, to reconcile the decision in that case with Norwood v. Baker, \n172 U.S. 269\n, 43 L. ed. 443, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 187.\n And yet it is evident that the act of Congress under consideration is very like earlier acts that have been sustained. That passed upon in Wight v. Davidson, it is true, dealt with a special tract, and so required the hypothesis of a legislative determination as to the amount of benefit conferred. But the real ground of the decision is shown by the citation ( \n181 \nU.S. 378, 379\n, 45 S. L. ed. 904, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 616) of Bauman v. Ross, \n167 U.S. 548\n, 42 L. ed. 270, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 966, when the \n\n[205 U.S. 135, 140]\n\u00a0\n same principle was sustained in a general law. \n167 \nU.S. 589, 590\n, 42 S. L. ed. 288, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 966. It is true again that in Bauman v. Ross the land benefited was to be ascertained by the jury instead of being limited by the statute to a square; but it was none the less possible that the sum charged might exceed the gain. As only half the cost was charged in that case it may be that, on the practical distinction to which we have adverted in connection with Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Barber Asphalt Paving Co. the danger of such an excess was so little that it might be neglected, but the decision was not put on that ground.\n In view of the decisions to which we have referred it would be unfortunate if the present act should be declared unconstitutional after it has stood so long. We think that without a violent construction of the statute it may be read in such a way as not to raise the difficult question with which we have been concerned. It is true that the jury is to apportion an amount equal to the amount of the damage ascertained, but it is to apportion it 'according as each lot or part of lot of land in such square may be benefited by the opening, etc.' Very likely it was thought that in general, having regard to the shortness of the alleys, the benefits would be greater than the cost. But the words quoted permit, if they do not require, the interpretation that in any event the apportionment is to be limited to the benefit, and if it is so limited all serious doubt as to the validity of the statute disappears.\n It is clear, however, from the petitions and the returns that the jury did not administer the statute in the way in which we have determined that it should be read. About one fifth of each lot was taken, and was valued at $92 and $75 respectively. That would give a value of $368 and $ 300, at the most, to the remaining portions, before the improvement was made. These lots were assessed $650 less said $92, or $558, and $550 less said $75, or $475. It is most improbable that the widening of an alley could have nearly trebled the value of each lot. We think it apparent, as was assumed by the court of appeals, \n\n[205 U.S. 135, 141]\n\u00a0\n that the jury understood their duty to be to divide the whole cost among the landowners, whether the benefit was equal to their share of the cost or not. It must be admitted that the language of the statute more or less lent itself to that understanding. There is nothing in the record sufficient to show that the jury took a different view, or that they limited the assessment to the benefit actually conferred on these lots. For this reason the assessment must be quashed, and it will not be necessary to consider the special objections of the mortgagee.\n Judgments reversed.\n Mr. Justice Harlan, Mr. Justice White, and Mr. Justice McKenna concur in the judgment. \n\n\n\n","98":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMASON CITY & FT. D. R. CO. v. BOYNTON(1907)\nNo. 170\nArgued: Decided: February 25, 1907\n\n\n \/ This case comes here on the following certificate:\n'The United States circuit court of appeals for the eighth circuit, sitting at the city of St. Louis, Missouri, on the 8th day of December, A. D. 1905, certifies that the record on file in the above-entitled cause, which is pending in such court upon a writ of error duly issued to review a judgment rendered in such cause in favor of the defendant in error in the circuit court of the United States for the southern district of Iowa, discloses the following:\n\n'The Code of Iowa, 1897, in a chapter relating to the taking of private property for works of internal improvement, including the construction and repair of railways, contains the following: \n\n[204 U.S. 570, 571]\n\u00a0\n \"Sec. 1999. If the owner of any real estate necessary to be taken for either of the purposes mentioned in this chapter refuses to grant the right of way or other necessary interest in said real estate required for such purposes, or if the owner and the corporation cannot agree upon the compensation to be paid for the same, the sheriff of the county in which such real estate may be situated shall, upon written application of either party, appoint six freeholders of said county not interested in the same or a like question, who shall inspect said real estate, and assess the damages which said owner will sustain by the appropriation of his land for the use of said corporation, and make report in writing to the sheriff of said county; and, if the corporation shall, at any time before it enters upon said real estate for the purpose of constructing said railway, pay to the sheriff, for the use of the owner, the sum so assessed and returned to him as aforesaid, it may construct and maintain its railway over and across such premises.'\n\n\"Sec. 2009. Either party may appeal from such assessment to the district court within thirty days after the assessment is made, by giving the adverse party, or, if such party is the corporation, its agent or attorney, and the sheriff notice in writing that such appeal has been taken. The sheriff shall thereupon file a certified copy of so much of the appraisement as applies to the part appealed from, and said court shall try the same as in an action by ordinary proceedings. The landowner shall be plaintiff and the corporation defendant.\n\n\"Sec. 2010. An appeal shall not delay the prosecution of work upon said railway if said corporation pays or deposits with the sheriff the amount assessed. The sheriff shall not pay such deposit over to the person entitled thereto after the service of notice of appeal, but shall retain the same until the determination thereof. . . .\n\n\"Sec. 2011. On the trial of the appeal no judgment shall be rendered except for costs. The amount of damages shall be ascertained and entered of record, and, if no money has \n\n[204 U.S. 570, 572]\n\u00a0\n been paid or deposited with the sheriff, the corporation shall pay the amount so ascertained, or deposit the same with the sheriff before entering upon the premises. Should the corporation decline to take the property and pay the damages awarded on final determination of the appeal, then it shall pay, in addition to the costs and damages actually suffered by the landowner, a reasonable attorney's fee, to be taxed by the court.\n\n\"Sec. 2012. If, on the trial of the appeal, the damages awarded by the commissioners are increased, the corporation shall pay or deposit with the sheriff the whole amount of damages awarded before entering on or using or controlling the premises. The sheriff, upon being furnished with a certified copy of the assessment, may remove said corporation, and all persons acting for or under it, from said premises, unless the amount of the assessment is forthwith paid or deposited with him.\n\n\"Sec. 2013. If the amount awarded by the commissioners is decreased on the trial of the appeal, the reduced amount only shall be paid the landowners.'\n\n'Section 3497 of the Code of Iowa, 1897, also provides:\n\n\"An action may be brought against any railroad corporation, . . . in any county through which such road or line passes or is operated.'\n\n'The Mason City & Fort Dodge Railroad Company, plaintiff in error, hereinafter called 'railroad company,' was a railroad corporation organized and existing under the laws of the state of Iowa, and, as such, entitled to avail itself of the provisions of the foregoing statutes of Iowa. C. D. Boynton, defendant in error, hereinafter called the owner, was the owner of certain lots of ground in the town of Carroll, Carroll county, in the state of Iowa, and was, at all times mentioned herein, a citizen of the state of Missouri. Prior to February 18, 1902, the railroad company, requiring Boynton's lots as a right of way for the construction of its railroad, filed an application in the office of the sheriff of Carroll county, asking \n\n[204 U.S. 570, 573]\n\u00a0\n for the appointment of six freeholders to inspect the lots and assess the damages which the owner would sustain by the appropriation of his lots for the use of the railroad company. On February 18, 1902, the commissioners were duly appointed by the sheriff and made their report, assessing the owner's damages occasioned by the appropriation of his lots by the railroad company at $4,750.\n\n'On the same day the railroad company paid the sheriff that amount of money for the use of the owner.\n\n'Afterwards, and within the time fixed by the state statute, the owner appealed from the commissioners' award to the district court of Carroll county. In due time, the owner filed in the last-mentioned court a petition for the removal of the cause into the circuit court of the United States for the western division of the southern district of Iowa, on the ground of diversity in citizenship. In his petition and bond to secure such removal the owner referred to and treated himself as the defendant, and referred to and treated the railroad company as the plaintiff, in the case.\n\n'In due course the cause came on for hearing in the circuit court, when the parties, by a written stipulation filed with the clerk, waived a jury and agreed to try the case to the court. Both parties introduced evidence and fully submitted themselves to the jurisdiction of the court ( if they could do so). The trial resulted in an assessment of the owner's damages at $11,445, and in a judgment against the railroad company for costs, including a fee of $300 for the owner's attorneys. In due time the railroad company regularly sued out a writ of error to the end that the record and proceedings in the circuit court might be reviewed by this court. The assignment of errors which accompanied the petition for the writ of error alleged that the circuit court erred in ascertaining and fixing the amount of damages to be paid by the railroad company for its appropriation of the owner's lots, in that there was an entire absence of evidence of support the award and finding. At no time during the pendency of the pro- \n\n[204 U.S. 570, 574]\n\u00a0\n ceedings in the circuit court did the railroad company question the jurisdiction of that court or the right of the owner to remove the cause into that court, but both parties participated in the trial up to a final judgment, and in the proceeding to secure a writ of error, as if there was no question of jurisdiction in the case. Not until the railroad company filed its brief in this court was the jurisdiction of the circuit court in any manner challenged. But, in its brief, as also in the oral argument made in its behalf, the chief point relied upon by the railroad company to secure a reversal of the finding and judgment of the circuit court is that the owner was the plaintiff in said cause and proceeding, and did not have the right to remove the same into the circuit court, and that therefore that court could not entertain jurisdiction thereof.\n\n'And the circuit court of appeals for the eighth circuit further certifies that the following questions of law are presented in this cause, that their decision is indispensable to a decision of the cause, and that to the end that such court may properly decide the issues of law so presented it desires the instruction of the Supreme Court of the United States upon such questions, to wit:\n\n'1. Was the landowner a defendant within the meaning of the removal statute, when the suit was removed into the circuit court?\n\n'2. If the landowner was not a defendant, within the meaning of the removing statute, could the circuit court take cognizance of the suit through a removal by him? Stated in other words, the question is this: Is the provision of the removal statute, to the effect that the removal, on the ground of diverse citizenship, may be 'by the defendant or defendants therein, being nonresidents of that state,' restrictive and jurisdictional in the sense that cognizance of the suit can be taken by the circuit court through a removal only when it is by the defendant, or is the provision only modal and formal in the sense that noncompliance therewith, or nonconformity thereto, may be waived? \n\n[204 U.S. 570, 575]\n\u00a0\n\n'3. Is the judicial proceeding which the landowner is authorized by the statutes of Iowa to initiate in the district court of the state, by way of a so-called appeal from the assessment of the commissioners selected by the sheriff, a suit which can be originally instituted in the circuit court of the United States, when the citizenship of the parties and the sum or value of the matter in dispute are such as to make the suit otherwise cognizable in that court?\n\n\n'4. If the circuit court could not have taken cognizance of the suit through the removal by the landowner, and if the circuit court could have taken cognizance of the suit through its original institution in that court after the assessment by the commissioners, did the parties, by appearing in the circuit court and there litigating to a final conclusion the matter in dispute, without any objection to the jurisdiction of the court or to the manner in which its jurisdiction was invoked, authorize the circuit court to exercise jurisdiction and to proceed to final judgment in like manner and with like effect as if the suit had been originally instituted in that court, the citizenship of the parties and the sum or value of the matter in dispute being such as to make the suit otherwise cognizable in that court?'\n\n Messrs. Thomas D. Healy, A. G. Briggs, John L. Erdall, M. F. Healy, and Robert Healy for the Mason City & Fort Dodge Railroad Company. \n\n[204 U.S. 570, 576]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Benjamin I. Salinger for Boynton.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Holmes:\n\n\n[204 U.S. 570, 578]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n In Madisonville Traction Co. v. St. Bernard Min. Co. \n196 U.S. 239\n, 49 L. ed. 462, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 251, it was decided that proceedings of this character could be removed to the United States circuit court. The question to be decided now is only whether the removal in this case can be upset on the ground that it was asked by the wrong party. The railroad company relies upon the words of the Iowa Code,  2009, quoted above, and upon a decision of the supreme court of the state in a case like the present, except that the railroad was a foreign company, in which it was held that the railroad had a right to remove. Myers v. Chicago & N. W. R. Co. 118 Iowa, 312, 324, 91 N. W. 1076. See \n\n[204 U.S. 570, 579]\n\u00a0\n also Kirby v. Chicago & N. W. R. Co. 106 Fed. 551. It is said that this court is bound by the construction given to the state law by the state court. Indeed, the above  2009 does not need construction; it enacts, in terms, that the landowner shall be plaintiff. As the right to remove a suit is given only to the defendants therein, being nonresidents of the state, it is argued that the state decision ends the case.\n But this court must construe the act of Congress regarding removal. And it is obvious that the word 'defendant' as there used is directed toward more important matters than the burden of proof or the right to open and close. It is quite conceivable that a state enactment might reverse the names which, for the purposes of removal, this court might think the proper ones to be applied. In condemnation proceedings the words 'plaintiff' and 'defendant' can be used only in an uncommon and liberal sense. The plaintiff complains of nothing. The defendant denies no past or threatened wrong. Both parties are actors: one to acquire title, the other to get as large pay as he can. It is not necessary, in order to decide that the present removal was right, to say that the state decision was wrong. We leave the latter question where we find it. But we are of opinion that the removal in this case was right for reasons which it will not take long to state.\n It is said the proceedings only become a case, within the meaning of the act of Congress, after the preliminary assessment and the appeal, and that then the landowner is in the position of one demanding pay for property which he has lost. If we take a general view of the Iowa statutes, this conclusion is not correct. The railroad might have taken the appeal. If it had, the landowner would have been on the defensive in endeavoring at least to uphold the assessment, but he would have been called the plaintiff none the less. Whichever party appeals, it is not true that the landowner is seeking pay for what he has lost. By  2011 the railroad is free to decline to take the property if it thinks the price too large. Even if, as in this case, it deposits the amount \n\n[204 U.S. 570, 580]\n\u00a0\n first assessed with the sheriff, the latter is not to pay it over until the determination of the appeal.  2010. We see no reason to suppose that the deposit impairs the railroad's right to withdraw, although the supreme court of Iowa says ubi supra, that, by payment and entry, the railroad appropriates the land. See  2013. Probably, too, the position of the parties under the act of Congress should be determined upon general considerations, without regard to what has happened. Looked at as a whole, the Iowa statutes provide a process by which railroads and others may acquire land for their purposes which the owner refuses to sell. The first step is the valuation. Whether it is part of the case or not, it is a necessary condition to the proceedings in court. Against the will of the owner the title to the land is not acquired until the case is decided and the price paid. The intent of the railroad to get the land is the mainspring of the proceedings from beginning to end, and the persistence of that intent is the condition of their effect. The state is too considerate of the rights of its citizens to take from them their land in exchange for a mere right of action. The land is not lost until the owner is paid. Therefore, in a broad sense, the railroad is the plaintiff, as the institution and continuance of the proceedings depend upon its will. Hudson River R. & Terminal Co. v. Day, 54 Fed. 545.\n It is not argued that this is any the less a suit because the railroad is free to decline to take the property. The adjudication fixes the right of the railroad to take the land at the price adjudged, and charges it with costs and attorney's fees taxed by the court, in case it elects not to take. The question is not discussed in Madisonville Traction Co. v. St. Bernard Min. Co. supra, where, if there had been anything in it, possibly it might have been raised. As what we have said is sufficient to dispose of the matter of the certificate, we think it unnecessary to consider other arguments, or to answer any question but the first.\n The first question is answered 'Yes.' \n\n\n\n","99":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMAYOR AND ALDERMEN OF CITY OF VICKSBURG v. VICKSBURG WATERWORKS(1907)\nNo. 275\nArgued: April 24, 1907Decided: May 27, 1907\n\n\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Day: \n\n[206 U.S. 496, 497]\n\u00a0\n Cases involving the rights of the Vicksburg Waterworks Company, under the contract made between the city of Vicksburg and the company, for furnishing the water supply of the city, have been before this court in two preceding actions, viz.: Vicksburg Waterworks Co. v. Vicksburg, \n185 U.S. 65\n, 46 L. ed. 808, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 585, and \n202 U.S. 453\n, 50 L. ed. 1102, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 660.\n Owing to the previous statements of the case, it is only necessary to set out enough of the facts involved in the controversy now before us to make plain the conclusions at which we arrive.\n The city of Vicksburg, by act of the legislature of Mississippi (Laws of 1886, chap. 358,  5, p. 695), was authorized 'to provide for the erection and maintenance of a system of waterworks to supply said city with water, and to that end to contract with a party or parties, who shall build and operate waterworks.'\n Acting under this authority conferred by the legislature, the city of Vicksburg made a contract with Samuel R. Bullock & Company, their associates and assigns, for the supply of water to the city and its inhabitants, which was contained in the ordinance of November 18, 1886,  13 thereof providing that--\n'The said Samuel R. Bullock & Company, their associates, successors, or assigns, shall have the right to make all needful rules and regulations governing the consumption of water, the tapping of pipes, and general operation of the works, and to make such rates and charges for the use of said water as they may determine, provided that such rates and charges shall not exceed 50 cents for ac h thousand gallons of water.'\n\n The ordinance, by its terms, ran for thirty years, and Bullock & Company, as provided in  5 of the ordinance, assigned the contract to the Vicksburg Water Supply Company, \n\n[206 U.S. 496, 498]\n\u00a0\n and it was duly accepted by that company. The supply company put in the works and operated until August, 1900, when the mortgage upon the property, including all the franchises and contract rights, was foreclosed and purchased by a Mr. Crumpler, who assigned all his rights and title to the Vicksburg Waterworks Company, the appellee herein, which company has operated the works since.\n The contract contained an agreement to pay a stipulated rental for certain hydrants for public use.\n The legislature of Mississippi, on March 18, 1900, passed an act authorizing the city to issue bonds and build a waterworks system of its own for the supply of the city and its inhabitants, and on the 3d of July, 1900, an election was held in the city under the statute, which resulted in a vote to build or buy a waterworks plant of its own.\n The city repudiated any contract relations with the company. Thereupon the company filed its bill in the United States circuit court for the district of Mississippi on the 14th day of February, 1901, the objects of which were thus stated by Mr. Justice Shiras, in delivering the opinion of the court (\n185 U.S. 65\n, 46 L. ed. 808, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 585):\n The bill prays for an injunction to restrain the defendant from assuming to abrogate and take away the franchises and contract rights of the complainant, and from attempting to coerce the company to sell its works to the defendant for an inadequate price, and that said act of the legislature of Mississippi, adopted on March 9, 1900, and said resolution and ordinance adopted and passed by said city on the 7th day of November, 1900, be declared to impair the obligations of said contract between said city and said Bullock & Company and their assigns, and to cast a cloud upon the title, franchises, and rights of complainant, and said act, ordinance, and resolution, and each of them, are alleged to be in contravention of the Constitution of the United States in this: that they impair the obligations of said contract between said city and said Bullick & Company and their assigns.' \n\n[206 U.S. 496, 499]\n\u00a0\n In the court of original jurisdiction the bill was dismissed for want of jurisdiction. On appeal, \n185 U.S. 65\n, 46 L. ed. 808, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 585, the judgment was reversed, and this court held that there was jurisdiction, and the cause was remanded. The case went to trial upon its merits, and on May 18, 1904, a final decree was rendered, which was affirmed on appeal to this court in the case reported in \n202 U.S. 453\n, 50 L. ed. 1102, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 660. The decree in that case, known in the record as No. 41, is given in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n[206 U.S. 496, 500]\n\u00a0\n During the pendency of the original action the legislature of Mississippi passed an act authorizing the cities and villages of the state to prescribe, by ordinance, maximum rates and charges for the supply of water, electric light, and gas furnished to cities and the inhabitants thereof. Laws of Mississippi 1904, p. 231. Section 1 of this act is inserted in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[206 U.S. 496, 501]\n\u00a0\n On April 20, 1904, about one month before the rendition of the final decree in the original case, the city adopted two ordinances fixing the maximum charge for the use of water, one by what is known as the 'flat rate' and the other for water measured by meters.\n On December 7, 1903, the city passed an ordinance prohibiting the water company and gas company from charging damages and other penalties for failure to pay bills, until ten days after presenting the same, and giving an opportunity for the payment thereof.\n On the 7th of January, 1905, the water company, in view of this action by the city, filed another bill, which is the original bill in this case, and was numbered 79, in which it set forth the preceding history of the litigation, the decree of May 18, 1904, the city ordinance of December 7, 1903, and the two of April 20, 1904, and in that bill alleged its contract under the ordinance of 1886 and the former decree, and that the enforcement of the ordinances was in violation of that decree and the company's contract of 1886, and would be destructive of its business, and they prayed for an injunction. A temporary injunction was allowed, and afterwards, the case standing on the bill, answer, and exhibits attached thereto, a final decree was rendered in the case, which final decree is set forth in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[206 U.S. 496, 502]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Hannis Taylor and George Anderson for appellant. \n\n[206 U.S. 496, 504]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. J. Hirsh and Murray F. Smith for appellee.\n\n\n[206 U.S. 496, 506]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n It is contended on behalf of the appellee that the original decree of May 18, 1904, finally disposed of all the issues between the parties, including the right of the city to make rates for water consumption to private consumers under the authority of the act of March 19, 1904, and that the present controversy is foreclosed by the decree in the former case.\n While it is true that the decree is very broad, we cannot agree to the contention of the appellee that it finally disposed of the matter now in controversy. When the case was first here, reported in \n185 U.S. 65\n, 46 L. ed. 808, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 585, while there are expressions in the opinion affirming the validity of the contract and the authority of the city to make it, the issue really decided was as to the jurisdiction of the court as a Federal court, which was sustained, and the cause remanded for further proceedings. Upon the second hearing of the case, and the appeal here, the opinion shows that the adjudication was regarded as settling the right of the Vicksburg Waterworks Company, under the contract, to carry on its business without the competition of works to be built by the city itself, as the city had lawfully excluded itself from the right of competition; and it was further held, as incidental to that controversy, in passing upon an issue made in the suit, that the Vicksburg Waterworks Company had succeeded to all the right, title, and interest of the original contracting party, and that the contract, having been made prior to the Constitution of 1890, was not controlled by its provisions. The right to recover for rentals was also directly involved, as the city had denied its liability therefor, and an accounting was prayed in the original bill, and the decree specifically disposed of that issue. It is true that in the answer it was averred that the alleged contract imposed upon the inhabitants of Vicksburg an onerous \n\n[206 U.S. 496, 507]\n\u00a0\n and extortionate burden; 'that no such contract would now be made with the Vicksburg Waterworks Company or any other company; that the rates ath orized in said ordinance far exceeded the rates charged in other cities under like circumstances, and, in general terms,' the city denied that it was bound to the complainant by contract; 'that, for the many reasons therein set forth, no liability existed on the part of the city by reason of the contract.'\n An examination of the record in the former case shows that the only testimony taken in the case, as to the reasonableness of the rates charged to private consumers, was on behalf of the company, and tended to show that the rates charged were reasonable, and if it could be said that the pleadings put in issue the reasonableness of the rates then charged, was the right of the city to regulate rates under a subsequent law of the state necessarily involved and concluded? The determination of issues as to the right of injunction against the city building its own works, or denying liability or refusing to pay the rentals contracted for, and a finding that existing rates were reasonable, did not necessarily conclude a controversy which might thereafter arise, as to the right of the city to fix rates when the legislature of Mississippi should pass a law for that purpose, giving the city the right to regulate the same. It is to be remembered that when the bill was filed in the original case no such law had been passed; that when the act of March, 1904, went into effect the case was nearly ready for final decree, and the city passed its ordinances long after the beginning of the suit, an shortly before that decree. No supplemental bill was filed, but after the decree, in January, 1905, the present independent suit was brought, with a view to enjoining the proposed action of the city in enforcing ordinances regulating the rates by charges other than those contained in the contract.\n Upon the appeal, the question seems to have been argued by the city as though made in the case, though the brief on behalf of the appellee contends that the act of 1904 was not \n\n[206 U.S. 496, 508]\n\u00a0\n involved. But a decree must be read in the light of the issues involved in the pleadings and the relief sought, and we are of opinion that the matters now litigated were not involved in or disposed of in the former case, and that, when properly construed, the decree does not finally dispose of the right of the city to regulate rates under a law passed after the contract went into effect, and long after the bill was filed in the case.\n Holding, then, that the plea of res judicata must be denied, had the city authority, under the charter of Vicksburg, passed in 1886, to make a binding contract, fixing maximum rates for water supply to private consumers for a definite period, thirty years in the present case? The grant of legislative power upon its face is unrestricted, and authorizes the city 'to provide for the erection and maintenance of a system of waterworks to supply said city with water, and to that end to contract with a party or parties who shall build and operate waterworks.'\n That a state may, in matters of proprietary rights, exclude itself from the right to make regulations of this kind, or authorize municipal corporations to do so, when the power is clearly conferred, has been too frequently declared to admit of doubt. Los Angeles v. Los Angeles City Water Co. \n177 U.S. 558\n, 44 L. ed. 886, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 736; Walla Walla v. Walla Walla Water Co. \n172 U.S. 1\n-7, 43 L. ed. 341-344, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 77; New Orleans Waterworks Co. v. Rivers, \n115 U.S. 674\n, 29 L. ed. 525, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 273; Freeport Water Co. v. Freeport, \n180 U.S. 587\n-593, 45 L. ed. 679-686, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 493.\n In the latter case this court, following the construction of the supreme court of Illinois, held that where a city council was authorized to contract with any person or corporation to construct and maintain waterworks at such a rate as may be fixed by ordinance for a period not exceeding thirty years, the words 'fixed by ordinance' being capable of application so as to make one ordinance endure for the period of thirty years, fr which the contract was made, or to give the right to pass ordinances from time to time regulating rates, the latter construction was adopted. \n\n[206 U.S. 496, 509]\n\u00a0\n In the cases generally in this court it will be found that, in determining the matter of contract, the local decisions have been given much weight and, ordinarily, followed. As this is a Mississippi contract, and the power was exercised under the authority of an act of the legislature of that state, we naturally look to the decisions of the courts of that state, particularly to such as had given construction to similar charters at the time the contract was made, with a view to determining the extent of the power conferred.\n While the case now before us was pending, Griffith and others, citizens of Vicksburg, filed a bill, setting forth the city ordinances of 1903 and 1904, and asking to have them established and maintained and an injunction granted against enforcing charges for higher rates, and, upon appeal, the case went to the supreme court of Mississippi, and is reported in 40 So. 1011. In that case the supreme court of Mississippi held that the municipal corporation represented the citizens and taxpayers of the city, and that, where a right had been adjudged as between the company and the city, it would conclude private citizens; and while the court declined to pass directly upon the question here involved, because of its pendency in the Federal courts, it used this pertinent and suggestive language:\n'We decline to follow the decision in Griffin v. Goldsboro Water Co. 122 N. C. 206, 41 L.R.A. 240, 30 S. E. 319, in holding that while a water company which accepts an ordinance by which a maximum rate is fixed is bound, and cannot exceed the same because of its contract, yet such rates are not binding upon consumers, who have a right to litigate against unreasonable charges. This holding, it seems to us, practically denies the power of a company, under a contract embodied in its charter giving the power, so to fix a rate as to bind a private consumer at all. It opens a never-ending and limitless field of litigation. It is well settled that the courts cannot fix a rate; and if, proceeding duly under statutes enacted for that purpose, the municipality cannot do so, or authorize the com- \n\n[206 U.S. 496, 510]\n\u00a0\n pany by contract to do so, and thereby bind the citizens, then there is no authority by which it can be done.\n\n'It is not a matter open to serious discussion in this state, since the decision by this court in the case of Stone v. Yazoo & M. Valley R. Co. 62 Miss. 607, 52 Am. Rep. 193, decided at the April term, 1885, and before the act of 1886 (Laws 1886, p. 694, chap. 358), amending the charter of Vicksburg, was enacted, that a quasi-public corporation may have a contract right to fix rates within a certain designated maximum, and that the rates so fixed are matter of contract, guaranteed by the contract clauses of the United States Constitution. In that decision the court was manifestly directing it observations to the binding character of the rates as between the company and the shippers; otherwise, the decision was practically meaningless and without point. The philosophy of the situation is simple. Granting that the company is lawfully invested with authority to fix its rate, then such rate being so fixed by it within the maximum limit allowed by the charter, or allowed by the duly authorized ordinance, is by the courts presumed to be reasonable; and it is not permissible for each individual citizen, in every controversy that may arise, to have that question, once passed upon by the lawfully constituted public authorities charged with power in the premises, reopened and litigated anew.'\n\n The case to which the court refers in the preceding extract, Stone v. Yazoo & M. Valley R. Co. supra, as having been decided prior to the enactment of the charter of Vicksburg under which the contract in question was made, did not directly involve the question of authorizing municipal corporations to make such contracts, but did ai ntain, after an exhaustive consideration of the subject, that a grant to a railroad company, in the charter, of a right to fix rates within maximum limits named, was a contract, within the meaning of the Federal and state Constitutions, which could not be violated by a subsequent attempt to prescribe different rates, and held that the railroad company's grant was not a renun- \n\n[206 U.S. 496, 511]\n\u00a0\n ciation of the legislative power to secure reasonable rates, but rather an exercise of that power, and, when rights were thus conferred, to that extent there was a renunciation of the right of the state to control the subject. In the course of the discussion the learned judge, speaking for the court, said:\n'The power to contract is an essential attribute of sovereignty and is of prime importance. Its exercise has been productive of incalculable benefits to society, however great may be the evils incident to its injudicious employment. It cannot be denied merely because of its liability to abuse. The power to contract implies the power to make a valid contract. . . . The right to grant charters includes the right to grant such as will be upheld. Conferring power on the grantee of the franchise to fix rates of compensation at discretion, or within prescribed limits fixed by the charter, has been the common practice of the legislatures of the states of the United States from an early period of their history. The fight of the corporators to exercise the powers conferred by the act of incorporation, whether to fix rates themselves or to take those fixed by their charter, and to rest securely on its provisions in this respect, has hitherto been generally regarded as indisputable.\n\n'A grant in general terms of authority to fix rates is not a renunciation of the right of legislative control so as to secure reasonable rates. Such a grant evinces merely a purpose to confer power to exact compensation which shall be just and reasonable.\n\n ... * *\n'If the grant can be interpreted without ascribing to the legislature an intent to part with any power, it will be done. Only what is plainly parted with is gone. Fixing rates in a charter is a specification of what is reasonable,-an exclusion of tacit or implied conditions on the subject. it is an essential part of the contract of incorporation, the most important condition of its existence, the inducing cause of its acceptance.' \n\n[206 U.S. 496, 512]\n\u00a0\n We are referred to other cases in Mississippi which deal directly with the extent of the power conferred upon municipal corporations in charters in general terms, some of which we may notice.\n\n In Light, Heat, & Water Co. v. Jackson, 73 Miss. 598, 19 So. 771, the city of Jackson had filed its bill, undertaking to annul a contract binding the city to pay for water for a period of twenty years at a price and rate fixed in a certain ordinance, on the ground that it was ultra vires and without authority from the legislature. In that case the authority conferred was in general terms, authorizing the city to contract with any reliable corporation, association, or individual for supplying the city of Jackson with water and electric or gas lights from year to year. Under authority of this general power the city undertook to make a contract with the Light, Heat, & Power Company of Jackson, contracting for the furnishing of water to the public at certain annual rentals for a period of twenty years, and fixing a certain rate for annual rentals to private consumers. The supreme court of Mississippi dealt directly with the question: Was the contract made between the city and company, and set forth in the bill, invalid for want of power in the city to contract for a series of years? And the court said:\n'In view of the nature and character of the subject-matter of the contract which the board of mayor and aldermen of the city of Jackson was authorized to make by the 3d section of the act of February 29th, 1888, we think the contract entered into with the appellant was within the delegation of power, so far as the time ofit  duration is involved. . . . We know that the machinery, mains, and appliances required for supplying the city with water are costly to begin with, and are relatively of little value if removed when once located. Permanency of the plant is essential to the realization of any profit in the enterprise, and in cities having no greater population than that of Jackson the use of water for municipal purposes would probably be a prerequisite to secure the in- \n\n[206 U.S. 496, 513]\n\u00a0\n vestment of the capital necessary to the construction of the plant. The words from 'year to year' relied upon by the appellee as limiting the power of the officers of the city to the making of the annual contracts, derived much of their significance from the subject and nature of the thing contracted for, the character of the body on which the power is conferred, the end to the attainment of which the power is to be exercised, and the extent to which such powers for such purposes are usually conferred. . . .\n\n'A few days after the act was passed, a commission was appointed by the legislature to contract for water for the state institutions, situated in and near the city, for the term of twenty-five years. in this act power was conferred upon all municipalities to enter into contracts for a term not exceeding twenty-five years, for supplies of water, on a two-thirds affirmative vote of the qualified electors, but the act provided that it should not apply to municipalities whose cahrters already conferred the power of making contracts for water.'\n\n'A contract made by the authorities of a municipality with a water company for supplying the city with water for a period of twenty years is within the power conferred on them by an act of the legislature authorizing them to contract with any reliable corporation for supplying the city with water from year to year, in view of the purpose of the delegation of power, the nature of the body on which it was conferred, the subject-matter of the contract, the large outlay for machinery and appliances, the profit of which was dependent upon the permanency of the enterprise, and the cotemporaneous legislation, from which the intent to authorize a contract of as great duration as twenty-five years is deducible.'\n\n Again, in the case of Reid v. Trowbridge, 78 Miss. 542, 29 So. 167, the mayor and aldermen of the city of Vicksburg had been authorized, in general terms, to provide for the lighting of said city by electric light or other method. Under this general power the city made a contract with the Vicksburg Railroad, \n\n[206 U.S. 496, 514]\n\u00a0\n Power, & Manufacturing Company for lighting the streets by electricity, at a given rental per annum, for 125 lights, for a period of ten years. The taxpayers of the city of Vicksburg filed a bill to enjoin the carrying out of the contract, alleging that the city had no authority to make such a contract without submitting it to a vote of the people, under the act of March, 1888, passed subsequent to the charter, requiring submission to a vote of the people, that the contract was unreasonable and oppressive, and that the council had acted arbitrarily and without exercising discretion in awarding it. The court held that the act of 1888 had no application to the case, and, speaking of the general terms of the charter authorizing a contract for lighting purposes, said:\n'The intent of the legislature to confer the power without restriction appears to us to be too plain, from the collocation and order and sequence of the sections and article of the charter act, to admit of obscuration by learned argument about original power. The very last legislative action on the subject, that in the municipal charter of the Code of 1892, shows that the lawmakers thought the power to be one to be conferred or prohibited, because it expressly confers it on cities and towns and prohibits its exercise by villages.\n\n ... * *\n'It is claimed now that the last clause of  1 of the first quoted of the above acts (that approved March 10, 1888) applied to and modified the charter of the city of Vicksbug so as to make the contract here in controversy void because not submitted to vote. In order to this result it is claimed that, in the charter of Vicksburg, it is not 'otherwise provided,' . . . because the charter expressly confers the power, without restriction, on the municipal board at any 'regular or special meeting.' Besides, in construing the section of the act secondly above quoted, this court expressly so held in the case of Light, Heat, & Water Co. v. Jackson, 73 Miss. 644, 19 So. 771. It the precise point was not made, the omission is quite significant of the opinion of the emininent counsel for appellee in that case \n\n[206 U.S. 496, 515]\n\u00a0\n that there was nothing in it. aside from this, the question was at the very root of the cause, and was considered and decided, and it is the exact question in the case at bar, except that this case is somewhat stronger in favor of the power than the case decided.\n\n'By  3 of the act of February 29, 1888, the Jackson board was 'hereby authorized and empowered to contract.' etc., while, by the Vicksburg charter act, the board was authorized to so contract 'at any regular or special meeting.' We presume that no charter then existent 'otherwise provided' by an express prohibition of electric lighting without vote. The grant of the power without restriction is to 'otherwise provide.\"\n\n And the court held that, under this power, the municipal authorities had the right to make the contract for electric lights without advertising for bids, and without submitting the matter to a popular vote, and the power was not taken away by the act of March, 1888\n\n\n In this case the learned judge, speaking for the court, further said:\n'Within its charter powers, the board has a discretion independent of courts, and no exercise of it will be held void for unreasonableness, unless so gross as to strongly suggest fraud or corruption. The people elect their council, and the courts are not chosen members of it.'\n\n In the light of these decisions, and others might be cited, we reach the conclusion that, under a broad grant of power, conferring, without restriction or limitation, upon the city of Vicksburg, the right to make a contract for a supply of water, it was within the right of the city council, in the exercise of this power, to make a binding contract, fixing a maximum rate at which water should be supplied to the inhabitants of the city for a limited term of years; and, in the absence of a showing of unreasonableness 'so gross,' as the court of Mississippi has said, 'as to strongly suggest fraud or corruption,' this action of the council is binding, and for the time limited puts the \n\n[206 U.S. 496, 516]\n\u00a0\n right beyond legislative or municipal alteration to the prejudice of the other contracting party.\n While we, therefore, reach the conclusion that the former case did not adjudicate the matter, we think the contract in this respect was within the power of the council, and cannot be violated consistently with the contract rights of the company by the subsequent ordinances of the city.\n In this case the circuit court rendered a final decree practically upon the bill and answer. No testimony was taken, and all that was before the court was the bill, answer, and exhibits. We think the decree goes too far in enjoining the city from interfering with the contract right of the company to charge the rates fixed thereby, in view of the allegations of the answer, that the rates charged by the company exceeded those named in  13 of the ordinance of 1886.\n The decree should be modified, so as to enjoin interference on the part of the city during the term of this contract, with the right of the company to charge rates not in excess of 50 cents a thousand gallons to private consumers, as set forth in the ordinance.\n With this modification, the decree will be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Equity, No. 41.\n Vicksburg Waterworks Company\n vs.\n Mayor and Aldermen of the City of Vicksburg, Mississippi.\n This day this cause came to be heard in accordance with the motion of complainant and defendant filed January 12th, 1904, upon the original bill, amended and supplemental bill, exhibits, answer of defendant, proof, and exhibits, and the court, after hearing and attending the evidence and the arguments of counsel, and being fully advised in the premises, and being satisfied that the complainant is entitled to the relief prayed for in its original and amended and supplemental bills, and for full relief, it is thereupon hereby ordered, adjudged, and decreed:\n First.

GERSTLEY(1907)\nNo. 168\nArgued: Decided: February 25, 1907\n\n\n\n The defendants in error, who were the plaintiffs below, and are hereafter so called, brought an action in the supreme court of the District of Columbia on December 10, 1904, against the plaintiffs in error and others, hereafter called the defendants, on a bond, and obtained a judgment, which was entered February 24, 1905, for $5,000 and interest thereon from that date. On appeal the court of appeals of the District affirmed the judgment (26 App. D. C. 193), and the defendants (the two McGuires) brought the case here by writ of error.\n The declaration in the action alleged the execution of a bond by all of the defendants in the action, dated the 11th day of September, 1903, which bound the defendants in the \n\n[204 U.S. 489, 490]\n\u00a0\n sum of $5,000, to be paid to the plaintiffs, subject to the condition therein stated. The recital in the bond was that Monaghan and J. Charles McGuire were desirous of purchasing merchandise from plaintiffs, 'now and from time to time hereafter, which the said John F. Monaghan and J. Charles McGuire have bound and hereby bind themselves to pay for in four months after the date of each respective purchase,' and the condition was as follows:\n'That if the said John F. Monaghan and J. Charles McGuire shall strictly and faithfully pay or cause to be paid to said Rosskam, Gerstley , & Company for merchandise now and hereafter so purchased, the moneys due and to become due thereon when and as the same shall become due and payable, then this obligation shall be null and void, otherwise it shall remain in full force and virtue.'\n\n The defendants John F. Monaghan and J. Charles McGuire were principals, and the other defendants, William McGuire and John W. Clark, were sureties. Clark sued out a separate writ of error, which is hereafter disposed of. It was further alleged in the declaration that, on the days set forth in the particulars of demand annexed, and which formed part of the declaration, the defendants Monaghan and J. Charles McGuire purchased from the plaintiffs merchandise aggregating the sum of $14,497.16; that they had paid on account thereof, at various times, as shown in said particulars of demand above mentioned, the sum of $9,100.48, leaving a balance overdue and unpaid amounting to $5,396.68, which it was averred the defendants had not paid or caused to be paid to the plaintiffs, and that the whole balance was still due to the plaintiffs, to their damage of $ 5,000, with interest, besides costs.\n The statement annexed to the declaration showed merchandise sold to the defendants by the plaintiffs, commencing September 24, 1903, through almost every month from that time up to and including July 27, 1904, and amounting to the total sum stated in the declaration. The credit side of the \n\n[204 U.S. 489, 491]\n\u00a0\n demand also showed payments by the defendants from and including October 27, 1903, up to and including November 11, 1904, and amounting to the sum stated in the declaration, and leaving a balance due as stated therein.\n Judgment by confession was obtained against the defendant Monaghan for $5,000, with interest and costs. The defendants J. Charles McGuire, one of the principals in the bond, and William McGuire, one of the sureties therein, filed two joint pleas to the declaration, and the defendant William McGuire, subsequently filed three separate pleas, and, still later, three additional pleas.\n The plaintiffs first demurred to the joint pleas of the defendants J. Charles McGuire and William McGuire, and to the three separate pleas of the defendant William McGuire. They thereafter filed a demurrer to the three additional pleas of defendant William McGuire which had subsequently been filed. Both demurrers were sustained, and, the defendants refusing to amend their pleas, final judgment was entered against them.\n The first (so numbered in the record) joint plea of defendants J. Charles McGuire and William McGuire alleged the indebtedness of the plaintiffs to the defendants John F. Monaghan and J. Charles McGuire in the sum of $10,000, because that, on the 25th of August, 1903, the plaintiffs entered into an agreement with Monaghan and J. Charles McGuire ( the two principals in the bond), by which the plaintiffs agreed that if the principals would form a copartnership for carrying on, in the District of Columbia, a wholesale liquor dealer's business, and deal in spirituous liquors, to be furnished by the plaintiffs, and would also furnish to plaintiffs a bond in the sum of $5,000, with the defendants Clark and William McGuire as sureties, conditioned for the payment to the plaintiffs of the amount of the indebtedness to be incurred by Monaghan and McGuire in the purchase by them from the plaintiffs, from time to time, of such merchandise, that then, in consideration thereof, the plaintiffs would sell and furnish to \n\n[204 U.S. 489, 492]\n\u00a0\n Monaghan and McGuire, whenever requested by them, from time to time, at and for certain prices then specified and agreed upon by the parties to that agreement, the merchandise required in said business and so to be requested, and would allow to them for the goods so requested and required a continuous credit of $10,000, and that they should sell such merchandise to their customers tomers in said business upon such terms as to time and otherwise as they should find and believe to be the best terms obtainable, having in view the establishment and maintenance in said District of a demand for the plaintiffs' goods, and that the said Monaghan and McGuire would not be required to pay for the goods so sold to their customers until they could make collections therefor from their said customers. It was then further understood by and between all the parties to the said agreement, and as part thereof, that said Monaghan and McGuire would enter upon said business without means or capital to sustain the same other than the continuous credit aforesaid, and that, in order to perform their part of said agreement, they would be required to make sales of said merchandise to their customers on credit, to be paid for by said customers in periods varying according to circumstances, as stated. The plea then set up that, on the date first mentioned (August 25, 1903), the said Monaghan and McGuire formed a copartnership for the purpose stated, and thereafter furnished to the plaintiffs a bond (the one in suit) prepared by the plaintiffs, and which the plaintiffs accepted, and the defendants then entered upon and fully established the business mentioned, and in all respects performed their said agreement, so far as they were permitted by the plaintiffs to perform the same. That they had obtained a large number of customers, to wit, from seventy to eighty, at great labor and expense, to whom they sold on the terms mentioned goods purchased by them from the plaintiffs, and that, from the 24th day of September, 1903, to the 10th day of December, 1903, the plaintiffs furnished to Monaghan and McGuire, from time to time under said \n\n[204 U.S. 489, 493]\n\u00a0\n agreement, merchandise amounting in the aggregate to $10,617.55, which they in turn sold to their customers, excepting only a portion of said merchandise, which they returned to, and which was accepted by, the plaintiffs. That the plaintiffs, on the 10th day of December, 1903, wrongfully, and with the intent to destroy the business so established, and to sell goods directly to said customers, drew on said Monaghan and McGuire for the sum of $1,500 on their said account, and sent through various banks the draft to them, and on the 11th of December, 1903, the plaintiffs wrongfully refused to furnish merchandise to the above-named defendants at the price stated, but demanded a large increase over those prices, and, on the 13th day of January, 1904, wrongfully refused to furnish more goods under said agreement or further to perform said agreement, and forced the said Monaghan and McGuire to abandon their said business, which they had established at great expense, to wit, an expense of not less than $10,000 and in which their profits were very great; whereby the plaintiffs wrongfully destroyed the credit and business of said Monaghan and McGuire and violated the agreement of August 25, 1903, and the said Monaghan and McGuire were and each of them was thereby injured and damaged in the sum of $10,000, for which sum the said J. Charles McGuire claims judgment against the plaintiffs; and the defendants aver that they are willing that the same may be set off against the plaintiffs' demand.\n The second joint plea of the same defendants (so numbered in the record) set up in substance the same agreement as the first, except that agreement was alleged to have been made September 11, 1903, and the bond was conditioned for the payment by the principals for all merchandise to be furnished by the plaintiffs on four months' credit. The plea also omitted the agreement that the principals (Monaghan and McGuire) would not be required to pay the plaintiffs until they (the principals in the bond) could make collections from their customers. The plea also alleged that the plaintiffs, shortly \n\n[204 U.S. 489, 494]\n\u00a0\n after the execution of the bond in suit, wrongfully refused to sell to the principals therein merchandise on credit to the amount of $10,000 at and for the prices stated in the agreement, and wholly neglected and refused to perform the agreement between them and the principals in the bond, whereby Monaghan and McGuire were forced to abandon their said business and lose all the money and time expended by them in and about the same, and amounting to not less than $10,000, and were, and each of them was, injured and damaged in the sum of $10,000, for which sum the said J. Charles McGuire claimed judgment against the plaintiffs, and the defendants were willing that the same should be set off against the claim of plaintiffs.\n Thereafter the defendant William McGuire filed three separate pleas. The first separate plea (numbered 1 in the record) alleged an indebtedness of the plaintiffs to William McGuire in the sum of $5,000, for that, on the 11th day of September, 1903, and in consideration of plaintiffs agreeing to sell merchandise to Monaghan and McGuire at and for certain prices named in the agreement, and to give them a continuous credit of $10, 000 for merchandise sold to them by plaintiffs, the defendants did agree to and did sign the bond mentioned in the declaration, but the plaintiffs wrongfully refused to perform the agreement, or to sell to Monaghan and McGuire merchandise at the prices named in the agreement, or to allow them the continuous credit mentioned therein, whereby they were prevented from paying for the merchandise purchased and mentioned in the declaration, and the defendant thereby incurred great liability, and was injured and damaged in the sum of $5,000, and claimed judgment therefor, and was willing that the same might be set off against the demand of plaintiffs.\n The second separate plea (numbered 2 in the record) set forth the same agreement and bond and consideration therefor that is mentioned in the first separate plea, and added that the plaintiffs, on December 11, 1903, and, again, on the 23d day of March, 1904, without the knowledge or consent \n\n[204 U.S. 489, 495]\n\u00a0\n of the defendant, entered into other agreements with Monaghan and McGuire to sell to them, at different prices and terms of sale, the merchandise purchased from plaintiffs by them, and that since December 11, 1903, the plaintiffs have refused to sell merchandise to Monaghan and McGuire at the prices named in the agreement, though requested to do so, whereby the defendant was discharged from his liability.\n The third separate plea (numbered 3 in the record) alleged that the merchandise mentioned in the declaration as having been sold was purchased by the defendants Monaghan and McGuire under an agreement not under seal, entered into before and since the 11th day of September, 1903, between them and the plaintiffs, and not according to the terms of the bond mentioned in the declaration, wherefore the defendant prayed judgment if he ought to be charged with the said debt by virtue of said bond.\n Subsequently the same defendant filed three additional pleas. By the first additional plea (which is numbered 4 in the record) he alleges that prior to signing the bond plaintiffs agreed with the principals therein to sell the merchandise referred to in the bond at and for certain prices specified in a letter dated August 25, 1903, sent by the plaintiffs to the principals in the bond. The plaintiffs represented to the defendant that the agreement was applicable to all merchandise to be purchased under the bond, and plaintiffs thereby intended to induce defendant to sign the bond, which he did in reliance upon that statement. Thereafter the principals purchased from the plaintiffs merchandise amounting to $14,477.16 and no more, and the sum of $10,617.55 was for merchandise purchased at the prices agreed upon, and the balance, $3,859.61, was for merchandise purchased at greatly enhanced prices, made under an agreement entered into on or about the 11th day of December, 1903, without the knowledge or consent of defendant; that the principals paid plaintiffs on account of said sum of $10,617.55 the sum of $9,100.48, leaving due to the plaintiffs under the bond $1,517.07 and no more. \n\n[204 U.S. 489, 496]\n\u00a0\n By the second additional plea (numbered 5 in the record) the defendant set up substantially the same agreement as to signing the bond and the consideration therefor, and then made the additional averment that the agreement was that the plaintiffs would not at any time exceed the sum of $10,000 in their sales to the principals, but the plaintiffs failed to perform the conditions, or any of them, and refused to sell at the agreed prices, and also permitted the indebtedness of the principals to continue from December 10, 1903, to January 21, 1904, to be greatly in excess of $ 10,000, by all of which defendant was discharged.\n By the third additional plea (numbered 6 in the record) the defendant alleged the partnership agreement between the principals in the bond, but did not allege that there had been any time ever agreed upon for the continuance of such partnership, and further alleged that during the year 1903 the principals in the bond had established a good business, and the bond was executed and delivered to the plaintiffs for the purpose of establishing and maintaining the credit of the principals with the plaintiffs; but that, on or about January 12, 1904, the plaintiffs, for the purpose of securing the customers which the principals in the bond had obtained for themselves, and for the purpose of selling directly to those customers, wrongfully induced Monaghan to withdraw from the partnership and enter the employ of plaintiffs, which Monaghan did, and that thereby the business of the principals was wholly destroyed, and by reason thereof they were unable to pay for the merchandise referred to in the bond and declaration, all of which was without the knowledge or consent of the defendant, by reason whereof defendant was discharged from all liability under the bond.\n Mr. Lorenzo A. Bailey for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n[204 U.S. 489, 498]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Eugene A. Jones, Simon Wolf, and Myer Cohen for defendants in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Peckham: \n\n[204 U.S. 489, 499]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The declaration in this case is attacked by the defendants under the rule that the court will go back to the first substantial defect appearing in the pleadings before the filing of the demurrer. The criticism made by the defendants upon the declaration is that it does not sufficiently show a violation of the terms of the bond. The defendants say the bond limits the liability of the sureties to pay for such mer- \n\n[204 U.S. 489, 500]\n\u00a0\n chandise only as was sold on a four months' credit, and that the declaration does not show that the terms of the sale of the merchandise were those which were set forth in the bond. The declaration shows a failure to pay for certain merchandise alleged to have been sold to the defendants, amounting to a stated sum on the date set forth in the particulars of demand, which demand was annexed to and forms a part of the declaration. This demand showed that the last item of sale was made July 27 prior to December 11, 1904. The condition of the bond meant that the defendants should not be called upon to pay until after the expiration of four months from the date of each of the respective purchases. The defendants had, as the pleadings show, paid for all the merchandise purchased, except the balance therein stated, and four months had in fact elapsed since the last sale. The defendants have, therefore, obtained four months after the purchase before they were called upon to pay. We think the declaration was sufficient.\n We are also of opinion that the two joint pleas of J. Charles McGuire and William McGuire, and the first separate plea of the latter, which, it is contended, set up offsets to the plaintiffs' claim, did not allege facts with sufficient distinctness to constitute a defense to the action. Neither of these pleas is sufficiently distinct to constitute a good pleading. What the special agreement was that is alleged to have been made between the principals in the bond and the plaintiffs, in consideration of which the bond was signed by the surety, is not stated with any degree of particularity. It simply states that the agreement in this respect was that the merchandise should be sold to the principals in the bond at and for certain prices specified in the agreement, but the pleas do not set them forth, nor do they state for how long a time such agreement was to remain in existence, nor how the defendants suffered damage to the extent named in the pleas, or to any extent. It is impossible for a court to see how these damages would necessarily or probably flow from a violation of said \n\n[204 U.S. 489, 501]\n\u00a0\n agreement, or that they could form a basis for any legal demand flowing from not longer fulfilling the terms of the alleged contract. The damages alleged in the pleas are most remote, vague, and shadowy in their nature, such as could not have been contemplated by any party to the alleged agreement, as the probable result of its violation. While rules of pleading have become more liberal in modern days, yet, in order to found a cause of action on the alleged shortcomings of another, they must at least be so far plainly set up as to show actual damage and the wrongful act of the other party as the proximate and natural cause. The particulars of the alleged resulting damages should be so far set forth that the court may be able to see therefrom that such alleged damages are neither obscure, vague, nor shadowy, but might, and probably would, naturally result from the acts complained of. Within such limitations, which have always existed, the three pleas are insufficient.\n The next succeeding plea is marked in the record the second separate plea of the defendant William McGuire. The court below treated this plea, together with the third separate plea of the defendant, and his fifth (in truth, the second) additional plea, as together resting upon common ground. We think they may be properly so regarded. It is seen from the whole record that the principals in the bond sued on were expecting to have business transactions with the plaintiffs, by purchasing from them liquors, which they expected to sell to others at profit, but the plaintiffs did not care to sell the goods to these principals without some security for payment of the goods sold when cash payment was not exacted. The bond in suit was thereupon agreed to be given as security for the payment of the merchandise to be sold by the plaintiffs to the principals, and which the principals were bound to pay for in four months after the date of each respective purchase. This is a clear and separate contract between the plaintiffs and the signers of the bond, and there is nothing in the declaration or bound which shows the existence of any \n\n[204 U.S. 489, 502]\n\u00a0\n other agreement than that mentioned therein, or that an alteration in the prices of the goods sold to the principals by the plaintiffs could, or would, have any effect upon the liability of the sureties. The bond being complete in itself on its face, it cannot be seen that any future alteration of the prices for the sale of the merchandise, arrived at between the plaintiffs and the principals in the bond, would be material to or alter the liability of the sureties for the payment of the merchandise sold and delivered at the prices agreed upon, after four months from the date of purchase. There is no allegation in these pleas that any separate agreement was in writing, and the bond itself does not show the existence of any other agreement or the sale of the property upon any other conditions than those mentioned in the bond itself. Under such circumstances evidence by parol going to show any other agreement between the principals of the bond and the plaintiffs would not be admissible. Seitz v. Brewers' Refrigerating Mach.

In holding these pleas insufficient we think the court below was right.\n This leaves the fourth (the first additional) and the sixth (the third additional) pleas. The fourth plea alleges that the merchandise referred to in the bond was to be sold at and for certain prices specified in a letter dated August 25, 1903, and sent by plaintiffs to Monaghan and McGuire. What those prices were is not stated in the plea, while the representations alleged in the plea to have been made, that the agreement was applicable to all merchandise to be purchased under the bond, would require parol evidence, as there is no pretense that these representations were made in writing, or that the letter referred to them in any way. The same consideration existing in regard to the pleas last mentioned would operate here and render the plea insufficient.\n The third additional plea (marked 6 in the record) attempts to set up a cause of action against the plaintiffs because, as alleged, they induced the defendant Monaghan to dissolve \n\n[204 U.S. 489, 503]\n\u00a0\n the partnership between him and McGuire and to enter the plaintiffs' employ, for the purpose, on plaintiffs' part, of increasing the plaintiffs' profits and with intent to wrongfully destroy the business of the defendants Monaghan and McGuire. As the court below well says, there is in this plea no allegation as to how long the partnership was to continue, and no action would lie for terminating or inducing the termination of a partnership at will. Karrick v. Hannaman, \n168 \nU.S. 328, 333\n, 42 S. L. ed. 484, 488, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 135. We do not see how any legal damage to the sureties under such circumstances can be said to be the proximate, natural, or probable result of such action on the part of the plaintiffs. After the dissolution of the partnership of course no sales could thereafter be made, and in relation to sales already made with credit according to the terms of the bond, it is impossible to see how it could be said that the ruin of the business of the principals of the bond, and hence the damage to the sureties, could be regarded as the probable consequence of the act of the plaintiffs in procuring Monaghan to dissolve the partnership and enter their employ. Whether treated as an offset or recoupment, or simply as an independent cause of action, the plea does not set up facts sufficient to constitute a valid set-off, recoupment, or cause of action.\n The judgment of the Court of Appeals was right and is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","101":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMCKAY v. KALYTON(1907)\nNo. 181\nArgued: January 25, 1907Decided: February 25, 1907\n\n\n\n This suit was commenced in the circuit court of Umatilla county, Oregon, by the filing of a complaint in the name of Agnes Kalyton, suing by her mother, Louise Kalyton, as guardian ad litem. Mary Kalyton and six other persons were made defendants, one such (Charles Wilkins) being sued as the acting United States Indian agent at the Umatilla reservation.\n It was alleged in substance as follows: By virtue of an act of Congress approved March 3, 1885 (23 Stat. at L. 340, chap. 319), and the amendments \n\n[204 U.S. 458, 459]\n\u00a0\n thereto, a tract of land in the Umatilla Indian reservation was duly allotted on April 21, 1891, to one Joe Kalyton, a member of the Cayuse tribe, residing on said reservation. It was alleged that in or about the year 1893 Joe Kalyton, the allottee, in accordance with the customs of the Cayuse tribe, married Louise _____, an Indian woman of that tribe, and the plaintiff, Agnes Kalyton, was issue of the marriage. In 1898 Joe Kalyton died intestate, leaving the plaintiff as his sole heir, and, under the laws of Oregon and the provisions of the act of Congress referred to, she became entitled to the land allotted to her father, and to the possession and enjoyment thereof. It was charged that Mary Kalyton and four of the defendants, all insolvent, claiming to be the heirs of the deceased, had taken and held possession if the land in question, which had a rental value of $274.75 per annum. It was alleged that one of the defendants, named Glasscock, claimed to have some interest in the land, and was confederating with the other defendants, who were wrongfully alleging themselves to be the heirs of Joe Kalyton, with the object of depriving plaintiff of the use of the land and the enjoyment of the rents and profits thereof. Averring that, under the rules and regulations of the Department of the Interior, in order that plaintiff might obtain the use and enjoyment of the land, it was requisite that her status as legal heir of the deceased should be adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction, the court was asked to so decree and to perpetually restrain the defendants from interfering with her possession and use of the land. General relief was also prayed.\n An answer was filed on behalf of the defendant Mary Kalyton. It was therein denied in substance that there had been a marriage between Joe and Louise Kalyton, and that the plaintiff was their child, and, averring that Joe Kalyton was a resident and citizen of Oregon and had died intestate, unmarried, and without any lineal descendant, it was alleged that the defendant, as the sister of Joe Kalyton, was his sole heir, and as such was the owner of, and entitled to the posses- \n\n[204 U.S. 458, 460]\n\u00a0\n sion of , the land in controversy and to its enjoyment. A decree was prayed quieting her alleged title.\n The others of the defendants, who were alleged to be confederating with Mary Kalyton, filed a disclaimer of any interest in the lands in controversy. The cause was heard by the court. Deciding that, if Joe Kalyton and Louis Kalyton had been married according to the custom of the Indians of the Cayuse tribe, such marriage would have been void, and that there had been no marriage between the parties, because none had been solemnized in accordance with the laws of the state of Oregon, the plaintiff was held to be an illegitimate child of the deceased, and to have no right, title, or interest in or to the lands in question, and a decree was entered in favor of the defendant Mary Kalyton.\n The cause was appealed to the supreme court of the state of Oregon. That court, having found that Joe and Louise Kalyton were married according to the custom and usage of the Indian tribe to which they belonged, and that the plaintiff was the issue of such marriage, held, in view of the legislation of Congress, 'that the plaintiff herein was born in lawful wedlock and is the sole heir of Joe Kalyton, deceased, and, as such, entitled to the possession of the real property of which he died seised.' The decree of the trial court was, therefore, reversed, and a decree was entered in favor of the appellant in accordance with the opinion. A motion for a rehearing was made and overruled. This motion was based upon the contention that the court had erred in taking jurisdiction of the cause, for the reason that it involved the title and right to possession of public land held in trust by the United States for the benefit of Indians, and hence the United States was a necessary party defendant, and not subject to the jurisdiction of a state court. We say the petition for a rehearing was based upon the grounds just stated, although the petition is not in the record, because it is manifest that such was the case from the opinion which the court delivered in refusing the rehearing. 45 Or. 116, 74 Pac. 491, 78 Pac. 332. In that opinion \n\n[204 U.S. 458, 461]\n\u00a0\n the question whether the matter was one of exclusive Federal cognizance was elaborately considered, and it was decided that it was not, because a decree as to the right of possession would not interfere with the title or trust interest of the United States. And the court declared that, for the purposes of determining its jurisdiction, it was wholly irrelevant to consider whether it would have the power to enforce its decree for the possession of the allotted land against the officer of the United States in charge of the Indian reservation in case that official should decline to give effect to the decree for possession.\n The case was then brought to this court.\n Messrs. Samuel Herrick, T. G. Hailey, and R. J. Slater for plaintiffs in error. \n\n[204 U.S. 458, 462]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William Frye White and John B. Cotton for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice White: \n\n[204 U.S. 458, 463]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice White, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n It is contended that we are without jurisdiction because no title, right, or immunity was specially set up or claimed under any Federal statute and denied. But, leaving aside for a moment all other considerations, it is plain that the defendant below set up a claim of immunity from suit in the state court under the laws of the United States, and that the right to the immunity so asserted under an act or acts of Congress was expressly considered and denied by the state court. True it is that the immunity which was asserted was first claimed in a petition for rehearing; but, as the question was raised, was necessarily involved, and was considered and decided adversely by the state court, there is jurisdiction. Leigh v. Green, \n193 U.S. 79\n, 48 L. ed. 623, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 390. \n\n[204 U.S. 458, 464]\n\u00a0\n At the threshold lies the question raised and decided below relative to the jurisdiction of the state court over the controversy.\n Allotments of land in severalty to Indians residing upon the Umatilla reservation, in Oregon, were authorized by the act of Congress of March 3, 1885, chap. 319 (23 Stat. at L. 340), which contained the following provision:\n'The President shall cause patents to issue to all persons to whom allotments of lands shall be made under the provisions of this act, which shall be of the legal effect and declared that the United States does and will hold the land thus allotted, for the period of twenty-five years, in trust for the sole use and benefit of the Indian to whom such allotment shall have been made, or, in case of his decease, of his heirs, according to the laws of the state of Oregon, and that, at the expiration of said period, the United States will convey the same by patent to said Indian or his heirs as aforesaid, in fee, discharged of said trust, and free of all charge or encumbrance whatsoever. Provided, That the law of alienation and descent in force in the state of Oregon shall apply thereto after patents have been executed, except as herein otherwise provided.'\n\n The allotment to Joe Kalyton was made on April 21, 1891. Before that allotment, Congress, on February 8, 1887 (chap. 119, 24 Stat. at L. 388), passed what is known as the general allotment act. By that act, as said in United States v. Rickert, \n188 \nU.S. 432, 435\n, 47 S. L. ed. 532, 535, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 478, provision was made for the allotment of lands in severalty to Indians on the various reservations, and for extending the protection of the laws of the United States and the territories over the Indians. To that end the President was authorized, whenever, in his opinion, a reservation or any part thereof was advantageous for agriculture and grazing purposes, to cause it, or any part thereof, to be surveyed, or resurveyed, if necessary, and to allot the lands in the reservation in severalty to any Indian located thereon, in certain quantities specified in the statute, the allotments to be made by special agents appointed for that purpose, and by the \n\n[204 U.S. 458, 465]\n\u00a0\n agents in charge of the special reservations on which the allotments were made. In one of the provisos of the 1st section of the act it was declared--\n'That where the treaty or act of Congress setting apart such reservation provides for the allotment of lands in severalty in quantities in excess of those herein provided, the President, in making allotments upon such reservation, shall allot the lands to each individual Indian belonging thereon in quantity as specified in such treaty or act.'\n\n A provision of like nature to that heretofore excerpted from the act of March 3, 1885, was embodied in  5 of the general allotment act of 1887, reading as follows (24 Stat. at L. 389, chap. 119):\n'Sec. 5. That, upon the approval of the allotments provided for in this act by the Secretary of the Interior, he shall cause patents to issue therefor in the name of the allottees, which patents shall be of the legal effect, and declare, that the United States does and will hold the land thus allotted, for the period of twenty-five years, in trust for the sole use and benefit of the Indian to whom such allotment shall have been made, or, in case of his decease, of his heirs, according to the laws of the state or territory where such land is located, and that, at the expiration of said period, the United States will convey the same by patent to said Indian, or his heirs, as aforesaid, in fee, discharged of said trust, and free of all charge or encumbrance whatsoever: Provided, That the President of the United States may, in any case, in his discretion, extend the period. And if any conveyance shall be made of the lands set apart and allotted as herein provided, or any contract made touching the same, before the expiration of the time above mentioned, such conveyance or contract shall be absolutely null and void: Provided, That the law of descent and partition in force in the state or territory where such lands are situate shall apply thereto after patents therefor have been executed and delivered, except as herein otherwise provided.' \n\n[204 U.S. 458, 466]\n\u00a0\n The supervisory power possessed by the United States over allotted lands while the title remains in the United States was pointed out in the opinion in United States v. Rickert, supra, a case which came to this court upon questions certified from a circuit court of appeals. The suit was instituted under the direction of the Attorney General of the United States for the purpose of restraining the collection of taxes alleged to be due the county of Roberts, South Dakota, in respect of certain permanent improvements on, and personal property used in the cultivation of, lands in that county occupied by members of the Sisseton band of Sioux Indians in the state of South Dakota. The lands referred to had been allotted under the provisions of an agreement made in 1889, ratified by an act of Congress in 1891 [26 Stat. at L. 1036, chap. 543], and more particularly under  5 of the act of February 8, 1887, heretofore referred to. Discussing the interest which the Indians primarily acquired in the allotted land, it was concluded that 'the United States retained the legal title, giving the Indian allottee a paper or writing improperly called a patent, showing that, at a particular time in the future, unless it was extended by the President, he would by entitled to a regular patent conveying the fee. . . . These lands are held by the United States in execution of its plans relating to the Indians-without any right in the Indians to make contracts in reference to them, or to do more than to occupy and cultivate them-until a regular patent conveying the fee was issued to the several allottees.' And the court approvingly quoted the following passage from an opinion of the Attorney General, delivered in 1888, advising that allotments of lands provided for in an act of Congress were exempt from state or territorial taxation, 'that the lands covered by the act are held by the United States for the period of twenty-five years in trust for the Indians, such trust being an agency for the exercise of a Federal power, and therefore outside the province of state or territorial authority.' 19 Ops. Atty. Gen. 169.\n\n It was decided, in view of the object to be accomplished \n\n[204 U.S. 458, 467]\n\u00a0\n by allotting Indian lands in severalty, that it was not within the power of a state to tax either the permanent improvements made on allotted lands or the personal property consisting of cattle, horses, and other property of like character which might be furnished to Indians for use upon such land. And, answering a question as to whether the United States had such an interest in the controversy or in its subjects as entitled it to maintain the suit, the court declared (p. 444, 188 U. S., p. 538, 47 L. ed ., p. 483, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep.) that no argument to establish that proposition was necessary. Nor are the principles which were thus announced as to the nature and character of an allotment of Indian lands and the interest of the United States therein as trustee before the expiration of the period for their final disposition in any way affected by the decision in Re Heff, \n197 U.S. 488\n, 49 L. ed. 848, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 506, dealing with the subjection of allottee Indians in their personal conduct to the police regulations of the state of which they had become citizens.\n The present suit was commenced in 1899. At that time there was in force an act approved August 15, 1894, chap. 290 (28 Stat. at L. 286), in which it was provided inter alia, as follows (p. 305):\n'That all persons who are, in whole or in part, of Indian blood or descent, who are entitled to an allotment of land under any law of Congress, or who claim to be so entitled to land under any allotment act or under any grant made by Congress, or who claim to have been unlawfully denied or excluded from any allotment or any parcel of land to which they claim to be lawfully entitled by virtue of any act of Congress, may commence and prosecute or defend any action, suit, or proceeding in relation to their right thereto in the proper circuit court of the United States.'\n\n And it was provided that 'the judgment or decree of any such court in favor of any claimant to an allotment of land shall have the same effect, when properly certified to the Secretary of the Interior, as if such allotment had been allowed and approved by him.' \n\n[204 U.S. 458, 468]\n\u00a0\n Considering the act of 1894 in Hy-Yu-Tse-Mil-Kin v. Smith, \n194 U.S. 413\n, 48 L. ed. 1045, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 681, the court said:\n'Under this statute there is no provision rendering it necessary, in a private litigation between two claimants for an allotment, to make the United States a party. The statute itself provides that the judgment or decree of the court, upon being properly certified to the Secretary of the Interior, is to have the same effect as if the allotment had been allowed and approved by the Secretary. This provision assumes that an action may be maintained without the government being made a party, and provides for the filing of a certificate of the judgment and its effect; and the government thereby, in substance and effect, consents to be bound by the judgment, and to issue a patent in accordance therewith.'\n\n The Rickert Case settled that, as the necessary result of the legislation of Congress, the United States retained such control over allotments as was essential to cause the allotted land to inure during the period in which the land was to be held in trust 'for the sole use and benefit of the allottees.' As observed in the Smith Case, \n194 U.S. 408\n, 48 L. ed. 1043, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 676, prior to the passage of the act of 1894, 'the sole authority for setting disputes concerning allotments resided in the Secretary of the Interior.' This being settled, it follows that, prior to the act of Congress of 1894, controversies necessarily involving a determination of the title, and, incidentally, of the right to the possession, of Indian allotments while the same were held in trust by the United States, were not primarily cognizable by any court, either state or Federal. It results, therefore, that the act of Congress of 1894, which delegated to the courts of the United States the power to determine such questions, cannot be construed as having conferred upon the state courts the authority to pass upon Federal questions over which, prior to the act of 1894, no court had any authority. The purpose of the act of 1894 to continue the exclusive Federal control over the subject is manifested by the provision of that act which commands that a judgment or decree rendered \n\n[204 U.S. 458, 469]\n\u00a0\n in any such controversy shall be certified by the court to the Secretary of the Interior. By this provision, as pointed out in the Smith Case, supra, the United States consented to submit its interest in the trust estate and the future control of its conduct concerning the same to the result of the decree of the courts of the United States,-a power which such courts could alone exercise by virtue of the consent given by the act. The subsequent legislation of Congress, instead of exhibiting a departure from this policy, confirms it. By the amendments to the act of 1894, approved February 6, 1901, chap. 217 (31 Stat. at L. 760) it is expressly required that in suits authorized to be brought in the circuit courts of the United States respecting allotments of Indian lands, 'the parties thereto shall be the claimant as plaintiff and the United States as party defendant.' Nothing could more clearly demonstrate than does this requirement, the conception of Congress that the United States continued, as trustee, to have an active interest in the proper disposition of allotted Indian lands, and the necessity of its being made a party to controversies concerning the same, for the purpose of securing a harmonious and uniform operation of the legislation of Congress on the subject.\n The suggestion made in argument that the controversy here presented involved the mere possession, and not the title, to the allotted land, is without merit, since the right of possession asserted of necessity is dependent upon the existence of an equitable title in the claimant under the legislation of Congress to the ownership of the allotted lands. Indeed, that such was the case plainly appears from the excerpt which we have made from the concluding portion of the opinion of the supreme court of Oregon.\n Because, from the considerations previously stated, we are constrained to the conclusion that the court below was without jurisdiction to entertain the controversy, we must not be considered as intimating an opinion that we deem that the principles applied by the court in disposing of the merits of the case were erroneous. \n\n[204 U.S. 458, 470]\n\u00a0\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of Oregon is reversed and the cause remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice Brewer, and Mr. Justice Peckham dissent. \n\n\n\n","102":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMERCANTILE TRUST CO. v. HENSEY(1907)\nNo. 245\nArgued: Decided: April 8, 1907\n\n\n\n The Mercantile Trust Company, by this writ of error, seeks to review a judgment of the court of appeals of the District of Columbia, affirming a judgment against it of the supreme court of the District for the sum of $ 8,468. The action was brought upon a bond for $50,000 executed January 24, 1900, by the company as surety for one Jones, for the performance by him of a written contract entered into on the same date between him and the defendant in error, who was the plaintiff below, relative to the completion by Jones for the defendant in error of certain houses already in process of construction in the city of Washington. The condition of the bond was, in substance, that if the principal, Jones, should duly and faithfully perform and fulfil all the conditions of the contract entered into between him and the defendant in error the bond was to be void, otherwise to remain in force.\n The contract provided that Jones, for the consideration mentioned therein, would, within seven months from the date thereof, well and sufficiently erect and replace all defective \n\n[205 U.S. 298, 299]\n\u00a0\n work and finish the twenty-one brick dwelling houses mentioned 'agreeably to the drawings and specifications made by Melville D. Hensey, architect, and which plans and specifications are signed by the said parties hereto and hereunto annexed, within the time aforesaid, in a good, workmanlike, and substantial manner, to the satisfaction and under the direction of Bates Warren, or the architect placed in charge by him to be testified by writing or certificate under the hand of Bates Warren, or the architect placed in charge by him, and also shall and will find and provide such good, proper, and sufficient material of all kinds whatsoever as shall be proper and sufficient for the completing and finishing all of said twenty- one houses and other works of the said buildings mentioned in the said specifications for the sum of $89,250, to be paid as set out in the schedule of payments hereto annexed, and signed by the parties hereto and made a part hereof.' Hensey, 'in consideration of the covenants and agreements being strictly performed and kept by the said party of the second part as specified,' agreed to pay the contractor the above-named sum 'as the work progresses, in the manner and at the time set out in the schedule of payments hereto annexed and signed by the parties hereto and made a part of this agreement; provided that in each of the said cases a certificate shall be obtained from and signed by the architect in charge that the contractor is entitled to payment, said certificate, however, in no way lessening the total and final responsibility of the contractor; neither shall it exempt the contractor from liability to replace work if it be afterwards discovered to have been ill done or not according to the drawings and specifications, either in execution or materials; and, further, that the party of the second part shall furnish, if required, satisfactory evidence that no lien does or can exist upon the work.' The last payment provided for in the contract was to be made 'when the houses are fully campleted in accordance with the said agreement and the plans and specifications prepared therefor.' \n\n[205 U.S. 298, 300]\n\u00a0\n All the materials were to be new and of the best quality, and the contractor was to 'execute and complete all the work as set forth in the specifications and drawings in the best and most workmanlike manner.' It was agreed that 'in all cases of doubt as to the meaning of the drawings reference is to be made to the architect in charge, whose decision will be final.'\n Although this contract was entered into in January, 1900, and under it the houses were to be completed in seven months, yet, for some reason, Bates Warren, the person named in the contract, did not appoint an architect until April, 1901, when he appointed Mr. W. J. Palmer. The evidence given, on the part of the plaintiff tended to prove that the contractor, Jones, abandoned the work on the houses early in the fall of 1900, leaving them uncompleted, and the work was otherwise carried on during the following winter, but that there was no architect in charge until Mr. Palmer's appointment. From that time Mr. Palmer seems to have in some degree superintended the work, and on the 29th of July, 1901, reported in writing to Mr. Warren the completion of the houses in question. In his letter Mr. Palmer said: 'The work has been done according to my interpretation of the plans and specifications, and where deviations have been made from the plans and specifications it has been where the same were inconsistent and ambiguous, and in all cases of inconsistency and ambiguity the work has been done according to the interpretation most beneficial to the houses.'\n This action was subsequently commenced for the purpose of recovering the damages which the plaintiff Hensey alleged he had sustained by reason of the failure of Jones to fulfil and carry out the contract. Issue being duly joined between the parties, the plaintiff gave evidence tending to prove that the houses were not completed within the contract time, nor according to the plans and specifications in the particulars stated, and that the value of the houses was between two and three thousand dollars less on each house than it would have been had they been completed according to the contract, \n\n[205 U.S. 298, 301]\n\u00a0\n plans, and specifications. The defendant duly objected to such evidence and took exceptions to its admission.\n A verdict was rendered in favor of the plaintiff in the sum of $8,468, after allowing the defendant's claim of set-off of $29,032.\n Messrs. Hayden Johnson and John Ridout for plaintiff in error. \n\n[205 U.S. 298, 302]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Arthur A. Birney and Henry F. Woodard for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Peckham: \n\n[205 U.S. 298, 303]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n After even more than the usual number of pleas, additional pleas, replications, rejoinders, and demurrers, which are to be \n\n[205 U.S. 298, 304]\n\u00a0\n found in the pleadings in this District, the parties came to trial on the issues of fact, and the plaintiff recovered a verdict as stated. The judgment entered on the verdict was affirmed by the court of appeals. 27 App. D. C. 210.\n The grounds submitted in this court for the reversal of the judgment are reduced to two, set forth in the brief for the plaintiff in error, as follows:\n'First, that the testimony of all the plaintiff's witnesses who testified in respect of deficiencies in construction being as to the total damage sustained by the plaintiff as the result of structural defects, defective materials, and omissions, and the trial court having ruled that the jury should consider omissions alone, there was no basis upon which the jury could segregate damages caused by defective materials and damages caused by omissions, so as to reach a verdict in accordance with the court's ruling.\n\n'Second, that under the building agreement, the architect's certificate of completion should have been held to be final and conclusive of such completion, there being no evidence of fraud or bad faith on his part.'\n\n In regard to this first ground of reversal the record is at first sight somewhat confused. The plaintiff in error asserts that there was no evidence given segregating the items upon which the sum total of the damage was arrived at; that the evidence given on the part of the plaintiff was that the houses were each worth between two and three thousand dollars less on account of the failure of plaintiff in error to fulfil the conditions of the contract, but that it is impossible to discover from that evidence what amount of the damage was due to omissions, what amount to structural defects, and what amount to defective material; and, as the court instructed the jury that in considering the question of structural defects they were not at liberty to consider anything but omissions, and were not entitled to consider substitutions of material or modifications of construction made with the approval of the architect under his interpretation of the plans and specifications, there \n\n[205 U.S. 298, 305]\n\u00a0\n was in reality no evidence before the jury upon which they could have estimated the damages under the instruction given them by the court; that all the witnesses testified simply as to the total diminution in value, as a result of the three items mentioned,-omissions, structural defects, and defective material,-while the court charged, agreeably to the twelfth request of the plaintiff in error, that they were at liberty only to consider damages resulting from omissions.\n The twelfth prayer of the plaintiff in error, which its counsel asserts was granted by the court, is as follows:\n'The jury are instructed that, in considering the question of structural defects, they are not at liberty to consider anything but omissions, if any they find, and are not entitled to consider substitutions of materials or modifications of construction made with the approval of the architect, under his interpretation of the plans and specifications.'\n\n There are several answers to the first ground urged by the plaintiff in error for a reversal of this judgment.\n\n\n (1)\n It does not appear that there is any basis in the record for the assertion of the plaintiff in error that there was no evidence given showing the amount of damage sustained from each of the breaches of the contract, but only a statement of the sum total sustained by reason of all the breaches. The bill of exceptions does not purport to set forth all the evidence given upon the trial of the case. There is a general statement that the plaintiff gave evidence by several witnesses that the houses were not completed according to the plans and specifications in the contract, in the particulars set forth in the assignment of breaches, and that the value, by reason of the omissions, structural defects, and defective materials was from two to three thousand dollars less on each house than it would have been had they been completed according to the contract, plans, and specifications. This is not at all equivalent to saying that there is no evidence except as to the total damage. It is much more probable that on the trial such evidence was given, and that the statement \n\n[205 U.S. 298, 306]\n\u00a0\n in the bill is simply a summary of the total amount of damage, which the evidence showed in detail had been sustained from each particular breach. It does not mean that there was no evidence of the amount of the damage caused from each breach that was proved. It is very improbable that the case was tried in any such manner. The amount of damage on account of each breach that was proved would most naturally have also been proved as part of the case.\n It is part of the duty of a plaintiff in error affirmatively to show that error was committed. It is not to be presumed, and will not be inferred from a doubtful statement in the record. We think in this case the record fails to show the absence of the evidence as argued by the plaintiff in error.\n\n\n (2)\n If, however, we assume that there was no such evidence in detail and only a conclusion given as to the total amount of damage, and if we further assume that the twelfth request of the plaintiff in error was charged by the court, and the right of recovery was thereby limited as stated, it does not appear that the plaintiff in error made any point on the trial of the absence of the evidence of damage in detail, or that the court was asked to direct a verdict for the defendant on account of its absence. If there were no evidence of the amount of damage caused by each particular breach, but only of the total amount sustained, and the plaintiff in error desired to avail itself of that objection to a recovery for the particular damage permitted, counsel should have called the attention of the court to the point, and requested a direction of a verdict for the defendant on that ground. No such request was made, and nothing was said which would show that counsel for the plaintiff in error had any such objection in mind, and he cannot argue an objection here which was never taken in the trial court.\n\n\n (3)\n In truth the court did not limit the recovery of damages, as is set forth in the above-mentioned twelfth request to charge, but permitted a recovery for the total sum of the various items proved. \n\n[205 U.S. 298, 307]\n\u00a0\n The defendant in error insists that the twelfth request, instead of being charged, was in fact refused by the court. We think that in this assertion the defendant in error is perfectly right. Some little confusion at first appears on looking in the record, caused by a mistaken reference to the request which was charged, but a more careful perusal of all that appears regarding the charge of the court, and the requests and refusals to charge, bring us to the conclusion that there is not the slightest doubt that the court refused the twelfth request, instead of charging it. In such case there was no occasion for segregating the items of damage proved.\n This leaves the argument of the plaintiff in error upon the first ground wholly without merit.\n The other ground taken for a reversal in this case is that the architect's certificate of July 29, 1901, was conclusive between the parties and was a bar to the maintenance of this action.\n Mr. Palmer, in his letter or certificate, reported the completion of the buildings according to his interpretation of the plans and specifications, and that where deviations had been made from them it was where the same were inconsistent and ambiguous, and in all cases of inconsistency and ambiguity the work had been done according to the interpretation most beneficial to the houses.\n We do not think this certificate was conclusive, and it did not, therefore, bar the maintenance of this action. The language of the contract, upon which the claim is based, is set out in the foregoing statement, and while it provides that the work shall be completed agreeably to the drawings and specifications made by M. D. Hensey, architect, in a good, workmanlike, and substantial manner, to the satisfaction and under the direction of Bates Warren, or the architect placed in charge by him, to be testified by writing or certificate under the hand of Bates Warren, or the architect placed in charge by him, it omits any provision that the certificate shall be final and conclusive between the parties. In other words, \n\n[205 U.S. 298, 308]\n\u00a0\n the contract provides that before the builder can claim payment at all he must obtain the certificate of the architect; but, after such certificate has been given, there is no provision which bars the plaintiff from showing a violation of the contract in material parts, by which he has sustained damage. A contract which provides for the work on a building to be performed in the best manner and the materials of the best quality, subject to the acceptance or rejection of an architect, all to be done in strict accordance with the plans and specifications, does not make the acceptance by the architect final and conclusive, and will not bind the owner, or relieve the contractor from the agreement to perform according to plans and specifications. Glacius v. Black, 50 N. Y. 145, 10 Am. Rep. 449; Fontano v. Robbins, 22 App. D. C. 253. There is also in the contract the provision already mentioned in the statement of facts in regard to payments as the work progressed, which showed that a certificate was to be obtained from and signed by the architect in charge before the contractor was entitled to payment, but it was provided that the certificate should 'in no way lessen the total and final responsibility of the contractor; neither shall it exempt the contractor from liability to replace work, if it be afterwards discovered to have been done ill, or not according to the drawings and specifications, either in execution or materials.' There is the further positive agreement of the contractor to execute and complete all the work as set forth in the specifications in the best and most workmanlike manner, and also that final payment is to be made only when the houses are completed in accordance with the agreement and the plans and specifications prepared therefor.\n The whole contract shows, in our opinion, that the certificate that the houses had been completed according to the contract and its plans and specifications was not to be conclusive of the question, and the plaintiff was not thereby precluded from showing that in fact the contractor had not complied with his contract, and the plaintiff had thereby sustained \n\n[205 U.S. 298, 309]\n\u00a0\n damage. The cases cited in the opinion of the court below (Fontano v. Robbins, supra; Bond v. Newark, 19 N. J. Eq. 376; Memphis, C. & L. R. Co. v. Wilcox, 48 Pa. 161; Adlard v. Muldoon, 45 Ill. 193) are in substance to this effect. To make such a certificate conclusive requires plain language in the contract. It is not to be implied. Central Trust Co. v. Louisville, St. L. & T. R. Co. 70 Fed. 282. 284. The cases of Sweeney v. United States, \n109 U.S. 618\n, 27 L. ed. 1053, 3 Sup. Ct. Rep. 344; Martinsburg & P. R. Co. v.

Rep. 343,-were all cases in which the contract itself provided that the certificate should be final and conclusive between the parties.\n The only case in which the certificate of the architect or his decision was by the contract made final was in case of doubt as to the meaning of drawings, in which case reference was to be made to the architect in charge, whose decision was to be final.\n Both grounds urged by the plaintiff in error in this court for reversal of the judgment are untenable, and it must therefore be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice Brewer took no part in the decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","103":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMERCHANTS' HEAT & LIGHT CO. v. JAMES B. CLOW & SONS(1907)\nNo. 118\nArgued: January 15, 1907Decided: January 28, 1907\n\n\n\n Messrs. W. H. H. Miller, James W. Fesler, C. C. Shirley, and Samuel D. Miller for plaintiff in error.[ Merchants' Heat & Light Co. v. James B. Clow & Sons \n204 U.S. 286\n (1907) ]\n\n\n[204 U.S. 286, 288]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Newton Wyeth, Warren B. Wilson, and Walter L. Fisher for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case comes up on the single question of the jurisdiction of the circuit court, which was saved by bill of exceptions and stipulation, and which is certified to this court. The defendant in error, the original plaintiff, and hereafter called plaintiff, is an Illinois corporation; the plaintiff in error is a purely local Indiana corporation, organized for the furnishing of heat, light, and power in Indianapolis. The questions are whether the service of the writ was good (Board of Trade v. Hammond Elevator Co. \n198 \nU.S. 424, 435\n, 49 S. L. ed. 1111, 1116, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 740), or, if not, whether the defendant submitted to the jurisdiction. The material facts are these: The service was upon one Schott in Chicago. By the laws of Illinois a foreign corporation may be served with process by leaving a copy with its general agent, or with any agent of the company. Schott had an entire contract with the defendant by which he was to build and equip the plant, assume general management of it, and operate it for the company until fully completed, 'approve contracts therefor,' certify bills, and have the heating plant ready for service on December 1, 1902, and finally finished by July 1, 1903. Schott was acting as general manager under this contract at the date of service, March 23, 1903, and did any purchasing \n\n[204 U.S. 286, 289]\n\u00a0\n required for the company in Illinois. In the same capacity he made the contract sued upon, which was for materials to be used for equipping the plant. He made it in the city of Chicago. After the suit was begun, a motion to quash the return of service was made and overruled, and thereupon the defendants, after excepting, appeared, so ordered, and pleaded the general issue and also a recoupment or set-off of damages under the same contract, and overcharges, in excess of the amount ultimately found due to the plaintiff. There was a finding for the plaintiff of $9,082.21.\n It is tacitly conceded that the provision as to service does not apply unless the foreign corporation was doing business in the state. If it was, then, under the decisions of this court, it would be taken to have assented to the condition upon which alone it lawfully could transact such business there. Old Wayne Mut. Life Asso. v. McDonough, \n204 U.S. 8\n, 51 L. ed. 345, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 236.\n Whether the purchase of materials for the construction or equipment of its plant, as a preliminary to doing its regular and proper business, which necessarily would be transacted elsewhere, in the state of its incorporation, is doing business, within the meaning of the Illinois statute, was argued at length and presents a question upon which the decisions of the lower courts seem not to have agreed. We shall intimate no opinion either way, because it is not necessary for the decision of the case, in view of the submission to the jurisdiction which the facts disclose.\n We assume that the defendant lost no rights by pleading to the merits, as required, after saving its rights. Harkness v. Hyde, \n98 U.S. 476\n, 25 L. ed. 237; Southern P. Co. v. Denton, \n146 U.S. 202\n, 36 L. ed. 943, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 44. But by setting up its counterclaim the defendant became a plaintiff in its turn, invoked the jurisdiction of the court in the same action, and, by invoking, submitted to it. It is true that the counterclaim seems to have arisen wholly out of the same transaction that the plaintiff sued upon, and so to have been in recoupment rather than in set-off proper. But, even at common law, since the doctrine has been developed, \n\n[204 U.S. 286, 290]\n\u00a0\n a demand in recoupment is recognized as a cross demand, as distinguished from a defense. Therefore, although there has been a difference of opinion as to whether a defendant, by pleading it, is concluded by the judgment from bringing a subsequent suit for the residue of his claim, a judgment in his favor being impossible at common law, the authorities agree that he is not concluded by the judgment if he does not plead his cross demand, and that whether he shall do so or not is left wholly to his choice. Davis v. Hedges, L. R. 6 Q. B. 687; Mondel v. Steel, 8 Mees. & W. 858, 872; O'Connor v. Varney, 10 Gray, 231. This single fact shows that the defendant, if he elects to sue upon his claim in the action against him, assumes the position of an actor and must take the consequences. The right to do so is of modern growth, and is merely a convenience that saves bringing another suit, not a necessity of the defense.\n If, as would seem and was assumed by the form of pleading, the counterclaim was within the Illinois statutes (Charnley v. Sibley, 20 C. C. A. 157, 34 U. S. App. 705, 73 Fed. 980, 982), the case is still stronger. For by that statute the defendant may get a verdict and a judgment in his favor if it appears that the plaintiff is indebted to him for a balance when the two claims are set against each other; and after the cross claim is set up the plaintiff is not permitted to dismiss his suit without the consent of the defendant or leave of court granted for cause shown. Ill. Rev. Stat. chap. 110,  30, 31; East St. Louis v. Thomas, 102 Ill. 453, 458; Butler v. Cornell, 148 Ill. 276, 279, 35 N. E. 767.\n There is some difference in the decisions as to when a defendant becomes so far an actor as to submit to the jurisdiction, but we are aware of none as to the proposition that when he does become an actor in a proper sense he submits. De Lima v. Bidwell, \n182 \nU.S. 1, 174\n, 45 S. L. ed. 1041, 1047, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 743; Fisher v. Shropshire, \n147 \nU.S. 133, 145\n, 37 S. L. ed. 109, 115, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 201; Farmer v. National Life Asso. 138 N. Y. 265, 270, 33 N. E. 1075. As we have said, there is no question at the present day that, by an answer in recoupment, the defendant makes himself an actor, and, to the extent of his claim, a cross plaintiff in the suit.

Spencer for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[205 U.S. 395, 396]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. H. Garland Dupr e, George H. Terriberry, F. C. Zacharie, and Samuel L. Gilmore for defendants in error.\n\n\n\n[205 U.S. 395, 397]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Moody delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a writ of error to review the judgment of the supreme court of Louisiana, which sustained a tax on the 'credits, money loaned, bills receivable,' etc., of the plaintiff in error, a life insurance company incorporated under the laws of New York, where it had its home office and principal place of business. It issued policies of life insurance in the state of Louisiana, and, for the purpose of doing that and other business, had a resident agent, called a superintendent, whose duty it was to superintend the company's business generally in the state. The agent had a local office in New Orleans. The company was engaged in the business of lending money to the holders of its policies, which, when they had reached a certain point of maturity, were regarded as furnishing adequate security for loans. The money lending was conducted in the following manner: The policy holders desiring to obtain loans on their policies applied to the company's agent in New Orleans. If the agent thought a loan a desirable one he advised the company of the application by communicating with the home office in New York, and requested that the loan be granted. If the home office approved the loan the company forwarded to the agent a check for the amount, with a note, to be signed by the borrower. The agent procured the note to be signed, attached the policy to it, and forwarded both note and policy to the home office in New York. He then delivered to the borrower the amount of the loan. When interest was due upon the notes it was paid to the agent and by him transmitted to the home office. It does not appear whether or not the notes were returned to New Orleans for the indorsement of the payments of interest. When the notes were paid it was to the agent, to whom they were sent \n\n[205 U.S. 395, 398]\n\u00a0\n to be delivered back to the makers. At all other times the notes and policies securing them were kept at the home office in New York. The disputed tax was not eo nomine on these notes, but was expressed to be on 'credits, money loaned, bills receivable,' etc. and its amount was ascertained by computing the sum of the face value of all the notes held by the company at the time of the assessment. The tax was assessed under a law (act 170 of 1898) which provided for a levy of annual taxes on the assessed value of all property situated within the state of Louisiana, and in 7 provided as follows:\n'That it is the duty of the tax assessors throughout the state to place upon the assessment list all property subject to taxation, including merchandise or stock in trade on hand at the date of listing within their respective districts or parishes. . . . And provided further, In assessing mercantile firms the true intent and purpose of this act shall be held to mean the placing of such value upon stock in trade, all cash, whether borrowed or not, money at interest, open accounts, credits, etc., as will represent in their aggregate a fair average on the capital, both cash and credits, employed in the business of the party or parties to be assessed. And this shall apply with equal force to any person or persons representing in this state business interests that may claim domicil elsewhere, the intent and purpose being that no nonresident, either by himself or through any agent, shall transact business here without paying to the state a corresponding tax with that exacted of its own citizens; and all bills receivable, obligations, or credits arising from the business done in this state, are hereby declared as assessable within this state and at the business domicil of said nonresident, his agent or representative.'\n\n The evident purpose of this law is to lay the burden of taxation equally upon those who do business within the state. It requires that in the valuation for the purposes of taxation of the property of mercantile firms the stock, goods, and credits shall be taken into account, to the end that the average \n\n[205 U.S. 395, 399]\n\u00a0\n capital employed in the business shall be taxed. This method of assessment is applied impartially to the citizens of the state and to the citizens of other states or countries doing business, personally or through agents, within the state of Louisiana. To accomplish this result the law expressly provides that all bills receivable, obligations, or credits arising from the business done in this state shall be assessable at the business domicil of the resident. Thus it is clear that the measure of the taxation designed by the law is the fair average of the capital employed in the business. Cash and credits and bills receivable are to be taken into account merely because they represent the capital, and are to be omitted because their owner happens to have a domicil in another state. The law was so construed by the supreme court of Louisiana, where, in sustaining the assessment, it was said:\n'There can be doubt that the 7th section of the act of 1898, quoted in the judgment of the district court, announced the policy of the state touching the taxation of credits and bills of exchange representing an amount of the property of nonresidents equivalent or corresponding to said bills or credits which was utilized by them in the prosecution of their business in the state of Louisiana. The evident object of the statute was to do away with the discrimination theretofore existing in favor of nonresidents as against residents, and place them on an equal footing. The statute was not arbitrary, but a legitimate exercise of legislative power and discretion.' [115 La. 708, 39 So. 850.]\n\n The tax was levied in obedience to the law of the state, and the only question here is whether there is anything in the Constitution of the United States which forbids it. The answer to that question depends upon whether the property taxed was within the territorial jurisdiction of the state. Property situated without that jurisdiction is beyond the state's taxing power, and the exaction of a tax upon it is in violation of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution. Louisville & J. Ferry Co. v. Kentucky, \n188 U.S. 385\n, 47 L. ed. 513, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 463; Delaware \n\n[205 U.S. 395, 400]\n\u00a0\n L. & W. R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n198 U.S. 341\n, 49 L. ed. 1077 25 Sup. Ct.

But personal property may be taxed in its permanent abiding place, although the domicil of the owner is elsewhere. It is usually easy to determine the taxable situs of tangible personal property. But where personal property is intangible, and consists, as in this case, of credits reduced to the concrete form of promissory notes, the inquiry is complicated not only by the fiction that the domicil of personal property follows that of its owner, but also by the doctrine, based upon historical reasons, that where debts have assumed the form of bonds or other specialties, they are regarded for some purposes as being the property itself, and not the mere representative of it, and may have a taxable situs of their own. How far promissory notes are assimilated to specialties in respect of this doctrine need not now be considered.\n The question in this case is controlled by the authority of the previous decisions of this court. Taxes under this law of Louisiana have been twice considered here, and assessments upon credits arising out of investments in the state have been sustained. A tax on credits evidenced by notes secured by mortgages was sustained where the owner, a nonresident, who had inherited them, left them in Louisiana in the possession of an agent, who collected the principal and interest as they became due. New Orleans v. Stempel, \n175 U.S. 309\n, 44 L. ed. 174, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 110. Again, it was held that where a foreign banking company did business in New Orleans, and through an agent lent money which was evidenced by checks drawn upon the agent, treated as overdrafts and secured by collateral, the checks and collateral remaining in the hands of the agent until the transactions were closed, the credits thus evidenced were taxable in Louisiana. State Assessors v. Comptoir National D'Escompte, \n191 U.S. 388\n, 48 L. ed. 232, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 109. In both of these cases the written evidences of the credits were continuously present in the state, and their presence was clearly the dominant factor in the decisions. Here the notes, though present in the state at all times when \n\n[205 U.S. 395, 401]\n\u00a0\n they were needed, were not continuously present, and during the greater part of their lifetime were absent and at their owner's domicil. Between these two decisions came the case of Bristol v. Washington County, \n177 U.S. 133\n, 44 L. ed. 701, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 585. It appeared in that case that a resident of New York was engaged, through an agent, in the business of lending money in Minnesota, secured by mortgages on real property. The notes were made to the order of the nonresident, though payable in Minnesota, and the mortgages ran to her. The agent made the loans, took and kept the notes and securities, collected the interest, and received payment. The property thus invested continued to be taxed without protest in Minnesota until finally the course of business was changed by sending the notes to the domicil of the owner in New York, where they were kept by her. The mortgages were, however, retained by the agent in Minnesota, though his power to discharge them was revoked. The interest was paid to the agent and the notes forwarded to him for collection when due. Taxes levied after this change in the business were in dispute in the case. In delivering the opinion of the court Mr. Chief Justice Fuller said: 'Nevertheless, the business of loaning money through the agency in Minnesota was continued during all these years, just as it had been carried on before, and we agree with the circuit court that the fact that the notes were sent to Mrs. Bristol in New York, and the fact of the revocation of the power of attorney, did not exempt these investments from taxation under the statutes, as expounded in the decision to which we have referred.'\n Referring to the case of New Orleans v. Stempel, the Chief Justice said:\n'There the money, notes, and evidences of credits were in fact in Louisiana, though their owners resided elsewhere. Still, under the circumstances of the case before us, we think, as we have said, that the mere sending of the notes to New York and the revocation of the power of attorney did not take these investments out of the rule. \n\n[205 U.S. 395, 402]\n\u00a0\n 'Persons are not permitted to avail themselves, for their own benefit, of the laws of a state in the conduct of business within its limits, and then to escape their due contribution to the public need, through action of this sort, whether taken for convenience or by design.'\n\n Accordingly it was held that the tax was not forbidden by the Federal Constitution.\n In this case the controlling consideration was the presence in the state of the capital employed in the business of lending money, and the fact that the notes were not continuously present was regarded as immaterial. It is impossible to distinguish the case now before us from the Bristol Case. Here the loans were negotiated, the notes signed, the security taken, the interest collected, and the debts paid within the state. The notes and securities were in Louisiana whenever the business exigencies required them to be there. Their removal with the intent that they shall return whenever needed, their long-continued though not permanent absence, cannot have the effect of releasing them as the representatives of investments in business in the state from its taxing power. The law may well regard the place of their origin, to which they intend to return, as their true home, and leave out of account temporary absences, however long continued. Moreover, neither the fiction that personal property follows the domicil of its owner, nor the doctrine that credits evidenced by bonds or notes may have the situs of the latter, can be allowed to obscure the truth. Blackstone v. Miller, \n188 U.S. 189\n, 47 L. ed. 439, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 277. We are not dealing here merely with a single credit or a series of separate credits, but with a business. The insurance company chose to enter into the business of lending money within the state of Louisiana, and employed a local agent to conduct that business. It was conducted under the laws of the state. The state undertook to tax the capital employed in the business precisely as it taxed the capital of its own citizens in like situation. For the purpose of arriving at the amount of capital actually employed, it caused the credits arising \n\n[205 U.S. 395, 403]\n\u00a0\n out of the business to be assessed. We think the state had the power to do this, and that the foreigner doing business cannot escape taxation upon his capital by removing temporarily from the state evidences of credits in the form of notes. Under such circumstances they have a taxable situs in the state of their origin.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of Louisiana is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","105":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMONTANA MIN. CO. v. ST. LOUIS MIN. & MILL. CO.(1907)\nNo. 402\nArgued: Decided: January 14, 1907\n\n\n\n The litigation between these parties has been protracted through a series of years. A brief history will help to an understanding of the present questions. Prior to 1884 Charles \n\n[204 U.S. 204, 205]\n\u00a0\n Mayger had located the St. Louis lode claim in Lewis and Clarke county, Montana territory, and william Robinson and others had located, adjoining thereto, the Nine Hour lode claim. These claims conflicted. Mayger made application for a patent. Thereupon adverse proceedings were commenced by Robinson and his associates against Mayger in the district court of the third judicial district of Montana. For the purpose of settling and compromising that action on March 7, 1884, a bond was executed by Mayger to the other parties, in which he agreed to proceed as rapidly as possible to obtain a patent, and then to execute and deliver to Robinson a good and sufficient deed of conveyance of a tract described as 'comprising a part of two certain quartz lode mining claims, known as the St. Louis lode claim and the Nine Hour lode claim, and particularly described as follows, to wit.' Then follows a description of what is known as the compromise ground,-a tract including an area of 12,844.5 square feet, 'together with all the mineral therein contained.' Mayger proceeded to obtain a patent for the St. Louis claim, including the compromise ground, as did also Robinson and his associates, a patent to the Nine Hour claim, omitting the compromise ground. Thereafter the plaintiff in error acquired the interest of Robinson and his associates and the defendant in error the interest of Mayger. The former company demanded a conveyance of the compromise ground in accordance with the terms of the bond executed by Mayger, which being refused, suit was brought in a district court of the state, which rendered a decree in its favor. That decree having been affirmed by the supreme court of the state, the St. Louis company brought the case to this court, and on October 31, 1898, the judgment of the supreme court of Montana was affirmed. \n171 U.S. 650\n, 43 L. ed. 320, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 61. In pursuance of the decree the St. Louis company deeded the tract described in the bond, giving its boundaries, the number of square feet contained therein, and adding, 'together with all the mineral therein contained. Together with all the dips, spurs, and angles, \n\n[204 U.S. 204, 206]\n\u00a0\n and also all the metals, ores, gold and silver-bearing quartz rock and earth therein, and all the rights, privileges, and franchises thereto incident, appended, or appurtenant, or therewith usually had and enjoyed; and also all and singular the tenements, hereditaments, and appurtenances thereto belonging or in anywise appertaining, and the rents, issues, and profits therein, and also all and every right, title, interest, property, possession, claim, and demand whatsoever, as well in law as in equity, of the said party of the first part, of, in, or to the said premises and every part and parcel thereof, with the appurtenances.'\n Prior explorations, the exact date of which is not shown, but apparently long after the compromise agreement, had disclosed the fact that beneath the surface of this compromise ground there was a large body of ore which, it was claimed, belonged to a vein apexing in the territory of the St. Louis claim. This was not the discovery vein, but a secondary vein, frequently called the Drumlummon vein or lode, whose apex was between the compromise ground and the apex of the St. Louis discovery vein. Some of this ore was mined and removed by the Montana company. On September 16, 1893, a year before the specific performance suit was brought, the St. Louis company filed its complaint in the circuit court of the United States for the district of Montana, against the Montana company and several individual defendants, claiming to recover $200,000 for the damages sustained by the trespass of the defendants in removing the ore. In its complaint the St. Louis company alleged that it was a corporation organized under the laws of Montana, and that the Montana company was a corporation incorporated under the laws of the Kingdom of Great Britain, but nothing was said as to the residence or citizenship of the individual defendants.\n On November 21, 1898, three weeks after the decision by this court in the specific performance suit, an amended and supplemental complaint was filed, which omitted the individual defendants and sought a recovery from the Montana \n\n[204 U.S. 204, 207]\n\u00a0\n company alone for the ore so wrongfully removed, as alleged. On June 26, 1899, a second amended and supplemental complaint was filed, also against the Montana company alone, and asking for the same relief. To this an answer was filed, setting up the bond and deed heretofore referred to, and pleading that thereby the plaintiff was estopped from claiming any part of the compromise ground or any mineral contained therein.\n Pending this litigation, and on respectively the sixth and twelfth days of December, 1898, orders were issued by the circuit court restraining severally each of the parties to this litigation from taking any more mineral from the disputed ground. On the second amended and supplemental complaint a trial was had in which judgment was rendered in favor of the St. Louis company for $23,209. To review this judgment, the Montana company prosecuted a writ of error from the circuit court of appeals of the ninth circuit, which writ was dated October 7, 1899, and the judgment was affirmed May 14, 1900. 42 C. C. A. 415, 102 Fed. 430. The St. Louis company took out a cross writ of error from the circuit court of appeals dated January 30, 1900, and that court reversed the judgment October 8, 1900, and remanded the case for a new trial as to the recovery sought for the conversion and value of certain ores, which had been excluded by the circuit court from the consideration of the jury. 56 L.R.A. 725, 44 C. C. A. 120, 104 Fed. 664. The parties then brought, by separate writs of error, these two decisions of the court of appeals to this court, on consideration whereof this court held that the judgment in the circuit court was entirely set aside by the second decision of the court of appeals, and therefore dismissed both cases on the ground that there was no final judgment. \n186 U.S. 24\n, 46 L. ed. 1039, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 744.\n Whereupon the court of appeals sent down to the circuit court a mandate setting aside the judgment in toto, and ordering a new trial. This new trial was held on May 31, 1905, and resulted in a judgment in favor of the St. Louis company for \n\n[204 U.S. 204, 208]\n\u00a0\n $195,000, which judgment was affirmed by the circuit court of appeals, to reverse which decision the Montana company sued out this writ of error.\n After this last decision by the court of appeals, the circuit court, on the application of the St. Louis company, set aside the order which restrained it from extracting ore from the disputed territory. Thereupon the Montana company filed its application in this court for a reinstatement of that order and that it be continued in force until the final termination of the litigation.\n The St. Louis company filed a motion to dismiss the writ of error sued out by the Montana company, on the ground that the jurisdiction of the circuit court depended entirely on diverse citizenship, and therefore the decision of the court of appeals was final. The Montana company then made application for a writ of certiorari, which application was passed for consideration to the final hearing of the case.\n Messrs. Charles J. Hughes, Jr., W. E. Cullen, Aldis B. Browne, and Alexander Britton for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[204 U.S. 204, 211]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Milton S. Gunn, Arthur Brown, J. H. Ralston, Thomas C. Bach, J. B. Clayberg, F. L. Siddons, Ira T. Wight, and W. E. Richardson for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[204 U.S. 204, 212]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n The first question is, of course, the one of jurisdiction. if \n\n[204 U.S. 204, 213]\n\u00a0\n the jurisdiction of the circuit court depended alone on diverse citizenship, then, undoubtedly, the decision of the court of appeals was final, and the case could only be brought here on certiorari. On the other hand, if it did not depend alone on diverse citizenship, the decision of the court of appeals was not final, and the case is properly here on writ of error. The original complaint alleged the citizenship of the two corporations, plaintiff and defendant, but did not allege the citizenship of the individual defendants. In order to sustain the jurisdiction of the circuit court on the ground of diverse citizenship, the citizenship of all the parties on one side must be diverse from that of those on the other. So, unless there was a Federal question presented by that complaint, as the citizenship of the individual defendants was not shown, the circuit court had no jurisdiction of the case. It may be that this was remedied by the subsequent first and second amended complaints, in which the individual defendants were left out, the citizenship of the two corporations, plaintiff and defendant, alleged, and to which complaints the Montana company, without raising any question of jurisdiction, appeared and answered. Conolly v. Taylor, 2 Pet. 556, 7 L. ed. 518; Anderson v. Watt, \n138 U.S. 694\n, 34 L. ed. 1078, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 449. Be that as it may, in view of the fact that this litigation has been twice before this court, has been protracted for many years, involves so large an amount, and also presents questions of Federal mining law which, though perhaps not necessary for our decision, have yet been elaborately argued by counsel, we are or opinion that if the jurisdiction of the circuit court did, after the filing of the amended complaints, depend entirely on diverse citizenship, the case ought to be brought here by writ of certiorari. As either by writ of error or certiorari the decision of the court of appeals can be brought before this court, and as each has been applied for, and as the importance of the case seems to demand our examination, it is scarcely necessary to consume time in attempting to decide positively whether there was a Federal question involved, or the jurisdiction depended solely on diverse citizenship. The \n\n[204 U.S. 204, 214]\n\u00a0\n writ of error was duly allowed prior to the filing of the record in the first instance, and, to avoid any further question of our jurisdiction, we allow the certiorari. Pullman's Palace Car Co. v. Central Transp. Co. \n171 U.S. 138\n, 43 L. ed. 108, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 808.\n We pass, therefore, to a consideration of the merits; and the first question presented by counsel-indeed, as we look at it, the pivotal question-is the proper construction of the bond and deed by which the plaintiff in error claims title to the compromise ground.\n The bond described the ground, adding, 'together with all the mineral therein contained.' The deed executed in pursuance of the judicial decree contains the same description, followed by the words above quoted and also the further words given in the statement of facts,-'together with all the dips, spurs, and angles,' etc.\n Now, the contention of the defendant in error is that the effect of the compromise followed by the bond and conveyance was simply to locate the boundary line between the two claims, leaving all subsurface rights to be determined by the ordinary rules recognized in the mining districts and enforced by the statutes of Congress.\n The argument in favor of this construction is forcibly put by Circuit Judge Gilbert, delivering the opinion of the court of appeals, when the case was first presented to that court. 42 C. C. A. 415, 102 Fed. 430. Without quoting it in full it is to the effect that agreements and conveyances of the whole or parts of mining claims are to be construed in the light of the mining law, as, generally speaking, we construe a contract, not merely by its terms, but having regard to the subject-matter involved and the surrounding circumstances, in order to ascertain the intention of the parties. Particular reference was made to Richmond Min. Co. v. Eureka Min. Co. \n103 U.S. 846\n, 26 L. ed. 557, in which this court held that a line specified in a contract between the owners of contiguous mining claims to be one continued downward to the center of the earth was not a vertical plane, but must be construed as \n\n[204 U.S. 204, 215]\n\u00a0\n extending the boundary line downward through the dips of the veins or lodes whereever they might go in their course toward the center of the earth.\n Further, the argument is that the adverse proceedings were maintained by the owners of the Nine Hour claim on the theory that the strip of land so contracted to be conveyed was a portion of that claim; that if the action had gone to judgment, sustaining their contention, the result would have been simply to fix the surface line of division between the two claims, without affecting the subsurface rights. Reference was also made to the suit for specific performance brought by the present plaintiff in error, in which it alleged that the contract had been made for the purpose of settling and agreeing upon the boundary line between the two claims, and that the suit was maintained upon the theory that, as owner of the Nine Hour claim, it owned the compromise ground afterwards conveyed.\n We are not insensible to the force of this argument, and also appreciate fully what is said by counsel in reference to the familiarity of the several concurring justices with mining law and contracts and conveyances made under it.\n Yet, notwithstanding, we are compelled to dissent from their construction of these instruments, and to hold that something more was intended and accomplished than the mere establishment of a surface boundary line. We premise by saying that nothing can be invoked in the nature of an estoppel from the averments in the pleadings in the suit for specific performance. True, the plaintiff in error alleged that the compromise ground was a part of its mining claim, and that the bond was executed 'to settle and compromise the said suit and adverse claims, and for the purpose of settling and agreeing upon the boundary line between' the two claims; but the bond itself, reciting the fact of a settlement and compromise, and an agreement by the contestants to withdraw their objections to the application for a patent, stipulates for a conveyance, after patent, of the compromise ground, 'co- \n\n[204 U.S. 204, 216]\n\u00a0\n mprising a part of two certain quartz lode mining claims, known as the St. Louis lode claim and the Nine Hour lode claim,' they being, respectively, the two claims owned by the parties hereto. Further, the answer denied that the compromise ground was a part of the Nine Hour lode claim, and alleged that the then owner of the St. Louis lode claim executed the bond as a compromise of the adverse claim and suit, and to enable him to obtain a patent for the whole of his claim.\n The facts in the case, as well as the allegations in these pleadings, show that the two claims conflicted, that when application was made for a patent adverse proceedings were instituted, and that rather than try the title of the respective locators to the territory in conflict, and by way of compromise, they agreed that the owner of the St. Louis claim might proceed to patent, and then convey the compromise ground to the grantors of the plaintiff in error.\n It must also be noticed that the dispute between the two claims was not simply in respect to the compromise ground,-at least, testimony offered to prove this was ruled out,-but involved a larger area, and that the disputing parties settled by the bond, describing what was to be conveyed.\n It is undoubtedly true that if the bond had simply described the surface area or fixed a boundary line between the two claims, the subsurface and extralateral rights might have been determined by the mining law. It might have been implied that there was no intention to disturb the rights given by it.\n Further, while it may be true that the words 'together with all the dips, spurs, and angles,' etc., are generally employed in conveyances of mining claims in order to emphasize the fact that not merely the surface but the extralateral rights which go with a mining claim are conveyed, yet it must be noticed that in addition to these customary words are these, found in both the bond and the deed: 'Together with all the mineral therein contained;' and they cannot be ignored, but must be given a meaning reasonable and consistent with other parts of the instruments. It is not satisfactory to say that they \n\n[204 U.S. 204, 217]\n\u00a0\n are only equivalent to those that follow, 'dips, spurs,' etc., that the same thing is meant by each expression. While, of course, repetition is possible, yet it is not to be expected; and when, in addition to the ordinary words found in conveyances of mining claims, is this extra clause, we naturally regard it as making some further grant.\n The scope of this deed would not be open to doubt if only the common law was to be considered. And in this connection it may be remarked that the common law has been kept steadily in force in Montana. 'The common law of England, so far as the same is applicable and of a general nature, and not in conflict with special enactments of this territory, shall be the law and the rule of decision, and shall be considered as of full force until repealed by legislative authority.' Laws of Montana, 1871, 1872, chap. 13,  1, p. 388, substantially re-enacted in Mont. Anno. Code,  5152. See also Territory v. Ye Wan, 2 Mont. 478, 479; Territory ex rel. Blake v. Virginia Road Co. 2 Mont. 96; Butte Hardware Co. v. Sullivan, 7 Mont. 312, 16 Pac. 588; Palmer v. McMaster, 8 Mont. 186, 192, 19 Pac. 585; Milburn Mfg. Co. v. Johnson, 9 Mont. 541, 24 Pac. 17; Forrester v. Boston & M. Consol. Copper & S. Min. Co. 21 Mont. 544, 556, 55 Pac. 229, 353. By that law a deed of real estate conveys all beneath the surface, unless there be some words of exception or limitation. But the mining laws of both state and territory were in force, and in construing conveyances of mining claims the provisions of those laws must be taken into account, and may add to or subtract from the rights passing by a common-law conveyance of agricultural or timber lands. It is probably not necessary to specify extralateral rights in order that a conveyance of a mining claim be operative to transfer them, and yet it is not strange that the custom grew up of naming them for the sake of avoiding the possibility of disputes. While the bond made no mention of extralateral rights, yet in all probability it would have been held to pass them and the court may have thought that the single specification, 'all the mineral therein contained,' was liable to be construed as narrowing the conveyance so as to \n\n[204 U.S. 204, 218]\n\u00a0\n include only the mineral beneath the surface, and therefore required that there should be incorporated in the deed the words 'together with all the dips, spurs,' etc. Yet, in requiring the introduction of these words, which in terms define extralateral rights, it also retained the phrase 'together with all the mineral therein contained.'\n To the suggestion that giving this construction to the bond and conveyance is in effect the granting of a section of a vein of mineral, the answer is that there is nothing impractical or unnatural in such a conveyance. It does not operate to transfer the vein in toto, but simply carves out from the vein the section between the vertical side lines of the ground, and transfers that to the grantee. The title to the balance of the vein remains undisturbed.\n To the further suggestion that the owner of the apex might be left with a body of ore on the descending vein beyond the further side line of the compromise ground which he could not reach, the answer is that this assumes as a fact that which may not be a fact. The owner of the apex may be the owner of other ground by which access can be obtained to the descending vein, and it also is a question worthy of consideration whether granting a section out from a descending vein does not imply a right reserved in the grantor to pass through the territory of the section conveyed in order to reach the further portion of the vein. Those are questions which need not now be determined. This secondary vein does not appear to have been known at the time of the compromise, and while, of course, there is always a possibility of such a vein being discovered, yet parties are more apt to contract and settle upon the basis of what they know than upon the possibilities of future discovery.\n The action of the parties hereto is suggestive, although not of itself decisive. This action for the recovery of ore taken out from beneath the surface of the compromise ground was pending when the suit for specific performance was brought in 1894. Nothing was done in this action from that time until \n\n[204 U.S. 204, 219]\n\u00a0\n three weeks after a final decision of the specific performance case by this court, when an amended complaint was filed, and the case thereafter proceeded by ordinary stages to trial and judgment. The original complaint alleged the ownership by the St. Louis company of its mining claim and of all veins, lodes, or ledges having their tops or apexes inside of its surface boundary lines, with the right to follow those veins, lodes, or ledges on the dips or angles outside the side lines of the mining claim. It also alleged that the defendants entered wrongfully upon one of the veins, lodes, or ledges having its top or apex within the surface location of the St. Louis claim, and which had in its dip or angle passed outside the side lines of the St. Louis claim and 'entered beneath the mining property claimed or pretended to be claimed by the said defendants or some of them and that, in utter disregard of the right or title of plaintiff, the said defendants ever since have been and now are extracting and taking therefrom large quantities of coarse rock and ore,' etc. In other words, it sought to recover from the Montana company the value of the ore taken by the latter from a vein whose apex was within the surface boundaries of the former's claim, but which in its dip had passed outside the side lines into territory claimed by the Montana company. With that as its claim the litigation was dormant for four years. Now, if it were true that the apex of the vein was within the side lines of the St. Louis claim and the ore taken by the defendants was taken from below the surface of the compromise ground, and all that was accomplished by the compromise and bond was the establishment of a boundary line, leaving subsurface and extralateral rights undisturbed, there was no necessity of postponing the litigation until the question of title to the surface was disposed of. As we have said, we do not mean that this is decisive, because the St. Louis company may have thought that all controversies would be ended if it could once establish that the Montana company took nothing by virtue of the compromise and bond. Still the delay in the litigation is in harmony with the belief that \n\n[204 U.S. 204, 220]\n\u00a0\n the words in the bond, 'together with all the mineral therein contained,' meant all the mineral below the surface.\n The disposition of this question compels a reversal of the judgment. It may also effectually dispose of all disputes between the parties, and, therefore, it would be a mere waste of time to attempt to consider other questions which have been discussed with ability and elaboration by counsel.\n In view of this conclusion it is also apparent that the order restraining defendant in error from removing ore from the disputed territory ought not to have been set aside.\n The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the case remanded to the Circuit Court with instructions to grant a new trial. Further, the order restraining defendant in error from mining and removing any of the ore in dispute will be reinstated and continued in force until the final disposition of the case. \n\n\n\n","106":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMOORE v. MCGUIRE(1907)\nNo. 222\nArgued: Decided: March 25, 1907\n\n\n\n\n[205 U.S. 214, 215]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. U. M. Rose, D. E. Myers, W. E. Hemingway, G. B. Rose, Lem Banks, and J. W. Apperson for appellants.\n\n\n\n[205 U.S. 214, 217]\n\u00a0\n messrs. J. M. Moore, Charles Scott, E. H. Woods, and Alexander Y. Scott for appellees. \n\n[205 U.S. 214, 218]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a bill to quiet and remove a cloud upon the title to land alleged to be in Arkansas. The circuit court found that \n\n[205 U.S. 214, 219]\n\u00a0\n the land was in Mississippi and dismissed the case for want of jurisdiction. 142 Fed. 787. The judge made the usual certificate, and an appeal was taken to this court.\n The land in controversy is Island No. 76, formerly called Chapeau island, in the Mississippi river, and whether it is part of Arkansas or of Mississippi depends, as both parties agree, on what was the western boundary of Mississippi, as established by the act of Congress admitting that state to the Union. Act of March 1, 1817, chap. 23 (3 Stat. at L. 348 ). In that act the state is bounded by a line 'beginning on the river Mississippi' and running around the state 'to the Mississippi river, thence up the same to the beginning.' The plaintiffs contend that these words should be construed to bound the state on the eastern bank of the river, while the defendants maintain that they refer to the middle of the main channel, as it then was. The chief difference is upon the question of fact whether the main channel was to the east or west of the island in 1817; but as the construction of the statute also is in dispute, there is jurisdiction, and Joy v. St. Louis, \n201 U.S. 332\n, 50 L. ed. 776, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 478, cited by the appellees, does not apply.\n We shall assume for the purposes of decision that the boundary is the middle of the main channel as it was in 1817, and address ourselves at once to the chief issue. Some facts are clear. Arkansas was admitted to the Union by act of Congress of June 15, 1836, chap. 100 (5 Stat. at L. 50 ). This act purported, in terms, to bound the new state by the middle of the main channel; that is, of course, as it then was, so that if at that time the channel was on the Mississippi side, the act of the government imported an understanding that the boundary of Mississippi went no farther. In 1847, 1848, and 1849 there were purchases of a great part of the island at the United States land office in Helena, Arkansas, and certificates and patents were issued by the United States government. The titles thus created are not attacked, but are said to have been lost by the Mississippi tax sale hereafter mentioned. The small remnant was conveyed by the United States to Arkansas \n\n[205 U.S. 214, 220]\n\u00a0\n ten years later by a patent under the swamp land act. Arkansas regularly taxed the island as far back as its books are preserved, and presumably before. The above-mentioned greater part was forfeited for taxes to the state. Then the state instituted a statutory proceeding to decide whether the forfeiture was valid, and, if not, to collect the taxes by a new sale. A new sale was ordered in due time, made, and the deed approved by the court. The plaintiffs are purchasers from the grantor under this sale and also from grantees of the residue patented under the swamp land act to the state.\n Thus it is apparent that Arkansas has exercised dominion over the island from 1847 down to recent times. The state of Mississippi, on the other hand, only recently, and since the channel has changed, as we shall state, has attempted to tax it. In 1891 it purported to sell the land for taxes, but the next year the money paid was refunded to the purchaser, on the certificate of the governor and attorney general of the state that the land was 'within the limits, and the property, of the state of Arkansas.' Later, in 1899, the state changed its mind and sold the land for taxes again, the defendants getting their title from this sale, but the possession of Arkansas and the plaintiffs under it has remained. In view of these conditions there may be a doubt whether courts should go beyond them in a private controversy, rather than leave it to the state of Mississippi, of dissatisfied, to bring a suit in its own name. See Jones v. United States, \n137 U.S. 202\n, 34 L. ed. 691, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 80; Foster v. Neilson, 2 Pet. 253, 7 L. ed. 415; Filhiol v. Torney, \n194 U.S. 356\n, 48 L. ed. 1014, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 698; Bedel v. Loomis, 11 N. H. 9; State v. Dunwell, 3 R. I. 127; State v. Wagner, 61 Me. 178, 184. But, however this may be the facts stated give us a starting point and raise a presumption which is fortified by some further matters also beyond dispute.\n The court below finds that 'ever since 1839, and probably two or three years before that time, up to the year 1881, the main channel was east of the island in controversy, and, since 1881 up to the present time, west of the island;' the change \n\n[205 U.S. 214, 221]\n\u00a0\n being due, it seems, to the washing away of the old Napoleon island, 10 miles or so above. There is no serious attempt to cast doubt upon this finding and we deem it correct. In connection with the finding it should be noticed that a Mississippi statute of 1839, repeated in the Code of 1857, p. 64, gives as one boundary of Bolivar county, 'thence down the main channel of the said Mississippi,' thus seemingly adopted the channel as it then was, on the Mississippi side, as the true boundary, and furnishing evidence from which we should not lightly depart. In 1849 the island was surveyed and platted as part of Arkansas, and the survey was certified by William Pelham, the surveyor of public lands in Arkansas. The field notes state that the main channel is on the Mississippi side, and that the inhabitants of the island vote and pay taxes in Arkansas. They add that the channel or chute on the other side is wide, but in low water very shallow, and that on December 27, 1845, the surveyor got his skiff through with diffculty. This is the most exact and authentic of the surveys produced on either side.\n The presumption raised by the facts thus far recited is confirmed by the evidence of an old steamboat captain, whose personal experience went back to 1839. He testified that he learned under his father and brother, and that they instructed him that the channel was on the east side in 1812. He further stated that one of the first wood yards established on the Mississippi river for selling wood to steamer was just above No. 76 on the Mississippi side. Another witness, who lived in the neighborhood in 1839 and after, testified that the channel was considered to be on the east side, that the boats passed directly in front of her house, and that they could not pass up the chute on the other side, except in very high water. Having in mind the finding that we have quoted, we mention the last testimony only for the indication that it gives of a more or less permanent condition existing at the time when the witness's memory began.\n As against this consensus of action on the part of the two \n\n[205 U.S. 214, 222]\n\u00a0\n states concerned and the United States, this presumption from the establishment of the channel for a time running back nearly or quite to the admission of Arkansas, and this testimony from memory and tradition, the chief reliance of the defendants is upon certain maps and the statement in a letter to which we shall refer. The first and most important of the maps is one of a 'Reconnoissance of the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers,' made during the months of October, November, and December, 1821, by two captains and a lieutenant of engineers under the direction of the board of engineers. This exhibits Chapeau island with a dry sand bar on the Mississippi side, and indicates by dots that the channel is to the west. If the distances are accurate the sand bar at the top approaches pretty near to Mississippi; but in view of the small scale of the map and the absence of measurements there is no sufficient warrant for assuming that the distances are accurate. As to the indication of the channel, it would not be surprising, considering the short time during which the reconnoiter extended, if it had been determined by nothing more than the visible width. But in any event it hardly would do more than confirm a conjecture suggested by other sources which we shall mention, that in some years the western passage was as good as or better than the more permanent one to the east.\n The next map is one certified January 22, 1829, of a survey in February, 1827, showing the Arkansas shore sectionized and the island sketched in, with distances indicated at some points, but not sectionized. This map cannot be said to help either side except by speculation of an uncertain sort. The next map, however, is more definite. It is a map of township 21, range 8 wast, Mississippi, said to be projected from field notes of Benjamin Griffin, also produced, made in January and February, 1830. Here the island is divided up as part of the township, although not sectionized under the United States statutes, and there are other slight indications that the draftsman regarded the island as belonging to Mississippi. \n\n[205 U.S. 214, 223]\n\u00a0\n This map is more or less counteracted by another map of the same township signed by Benjamin Griffin, which does not sectionize the island, and indicates, if it indicates anything about it, that the channel is on the east side. The field notes in two places speak of 'where the west boundary comes to the river,' and they give the width of the east channel at the top as 2,920 feet. The defendants contend that the first mentioned of these two maps is the completed work, but that hardly can be said to be proved.\n In addition to these maps there is some correspondence, etc, from which it appears that the island was selected by Mississippi under the swamp land act, and that after the selection had been approved by the Secretary of the Interior, but before any patent had issued, the island was sold by the state in 1854 to one Ford. In 1859 Ford wrote to the governor of Mississippi complaining that Arkansas claimed jurisdiction and that the island had been disposed of as public domain within the limits of that state, asking the governor to claim a patent form Washington, and inclosing a letter to the writer, Ford, from one Downing, who is said to have been surveyor general of Mississippi at an earlier date. This letter is much relied upon. It purports to answer an inquiry as to the island, refers to the survey of 1830 or 1831, and says that at that time, and for some years after, the island chute, as it was called, was quite narrow, not over 100 yards wide about opposite the middle of the island, and that at that time the writer never heard of a steamboat going up or down on the east side. The main river then passed on the west side. The writer adds that he thinks it was in 1835 that he spent some time in examining the land in T. 21, R. 8 W., and that the island chute was quite narrow thcn.\n Presumably this letter was written with knowledge of Ford's object, and it hardly can be said to stand on the footing of disinterested tradition. Whether it was admissible or not we need not consider. It was forwarded to the Department of the Interior by the governor with Ford's claim. The \n\n[205 U.S. 214, 224]\n\u00a0\n Commissioner answered the letter, expressing an opinion favorable to Mississippi from inspection of the plats and Downing's statement, and inclosing a similar opinion of a former Commissioner in 1855, also from inspection of the plats. Both letters, however, called for evidence of the condition in 1817, and the later one specifically asked for an affidavit from Downing and another disinterested witness. It was assumed that the land, or most of it, was disposed of, and that the question would be of reimbursement. The affidavits asked for seem not to have been furnished, and nothing more appears to have been done until June 27, 1896. At that date another letter from the Acting Commissioner speaks of the land as having been mostly disposed of before the swamp land act, and therefore not granted by it, and suggests the submission of a list containing the 51 acres not so disposed of for approval to Mississippi, giving the governor sixty days for action. Nothing further was done.\n This evidence appears to us insufficient to meet the established facts to which we have referred. It must be admitted to raise a doubt whether the channel has not varied from time to time before the great changes about 1881. This doubt is enhanced by other sources of information not put in evidence, but partially referred to by the plaintiffs at the argument. A map in Samuel Cummings's Western Navigator, Philadelphia, 1822, vol. 1, indicates the channel on the Arkansas side, and this is confirmed by the text. Vol. 2, p. 44. In the Navigator, Zadok Cramer, published for a number of years at Pittsburg for the information of pilots, in 1806 the channel is said to be good on both sides. In 1808 and 1811 it is said that the left (east) side is the best in low water. In 1814, 1817, and 1818, on the other hand, the best channel is said to be on the right side at all stages. We refer to all the years that we have seen. In view of this statement for the very year when Mississippi was admitted, it is impossible not to hesitate, but in Cummings's Western Pilot for 1833 we read 'channel either side: the right is nearest, and the left \n\n[205 U.S. 214, 225]\n\u00a0\n is probably rather deepest;' and this seems to us to have been true for the whole time. Upon the whole evidence we are compelled to decide that the plaintiffs have made out their case.\n Decree reversed.\n Mr. Justice Harlan agrees with the circuit court as to both the facts and the law, and therefore dissents.\n Mr. Justice Peckham took no part in the decision. \n\n\n\n","107":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNEWMAN v. GATES(1907)\n\nArgued: Decided: January 7, 1907\n\n\n\n Jacob Newman, George Northrop, Jr., and S. O. Levinson commenced this action in the superior court of Marion county, Indiana, against the defendant in error, Harry B. Gates. Recovery of the sum of $1,400, was sought upon a judgment obtained by Newman and his coplaintiffs against Gates in the circuit court of Cook county, Illinois. The defendant filed an answer in two paragraphs, but, as the defenses therein \n\n[204 U.S. 89, 90]\n\u00a0\n asserted were ultimately abandoned, they need not be detailed. A counterclaim was also filed, in which it was alleged that the plaintiffs were, and for more than two years had been, attorneys at law engaged in the practice of their profession at Chicago, Illinois, under the firm name of Newman & Northrop; that the Illinois judgment sued upon was founded upon a claim for legal services rendered to the defendant; that the services had been rendered in advising the defendant, as trustee, in and about the management of the property and assets of a corporation known as the American Motor Company while in course of administration in insolvency proceedings, and that the defendant had sustained damage to the extent of $ 2,000 by reason of a breach of duty alleged to have been committed by the plaintiffs in the course of their employment in failing to obtain an order of the court in the insolvency proceedings relieving the defendant from personal liability for attorney's fees, and providing for payment of his compensation, etc. It was also charged that the plaintiffs had been guilty of a breach or neglect of duty in connection with a sale of the trust property in the insolvency proceedings, whereby defendant had sustained damages in the sum of $2,500. A reply was filed to the counterclaim, in two paragraphs, one embracing a general denial and the other setting up the Illinois judgment as res judicata as to all the matters embraced in the counterclaim.\n In due course the case came on for trial and the plaintiffs recovered a judgment for the amount of their claim. The case was taken to the appellate court of Indiana. That court reversed the judgment and remanded the case for a new trial (18 Ind. App. 392, 46, N. E. 654), and far want of authority a petition for a writ of certiorari was denied by the supreme court of Indiana (150 Ind. 59, 49 N. E. 826). In the opinion of the appellate court, as also in a dissenting opinion, the character of the counterclaim and the question whether, as respects the matters therein set forth, the Illinois judgment was res judicata, were considered at great length. Following an in- \n\n[204 U.S. 89, 91]\n\u00a0\n spection of the record of the Illinois action the court held that the counterclaim stated matters which constituted something more than a mere defense to the claim asserted in the Illinois action, that it could not be said that, under the plea of the general issue, interposed by the defendant in that action, the matters averred in the counterclaim were necessarily adjudicated, and that it was a question to be determined upon the trial whether in fact such matters had been theretofore litigated and determined. On the new trial the court held that certain of the issues made by the counterclaim and reply had been litigated in the Illinois action and that the Illinois judgment was res judicata as to such issues, but submitted to the jury the question of the alleged neglect of plaintiffs in failing in the insolvency proceedings to procure an order charging the trust estate with the fees in question and the compensation earned by defendant as trustee. And the court left it to the jury to determine, upon a preponderance of evidence, whether or not it was the law of Illinois that the failure of plaintiffs to procure such an order-if they did so fail-was a matter which was adjudicated in the Illinois action, whether evidence was introduced on such point or not, and the jury was instructed that, if such was the law of Illinois, recovery could not be had upon the counterclaim.\n The second trial resulted in a verdict of $181.74 for the defendant Gates, that being the sum found to be due him in excess of the amount of the judgment sued upon. After the entry of judgment and before the taking of an appeal, George W. Northrop, Jr., one of the original plaintiffs, died. An appeal, however, was taken to the appellate court of Indiana by Jacob Newman and S. O. Levinson, describing themselves as surviving partners of the firm of Newman, Northrop, & Levinson. The personal representative of the deceased partner was not made a party to the appeal. The appellate court of Indiana overruled an objection to the sufficiency of the appeal and on the merits reversed the judgment and ordered the cause remanded for a new trial. On the petition of the \n\n[204 U.S. 89, 92]\n\u00a0\n defendant Gates the supreme court of Indiana removed the cause into that court for decision and subsequently dismissed the appeal, holding that, on account of the omission to make the personal representative of George W. Northrop, Jr., a coappellant, the appeal could not be determined upon the merits. 165 Ind. 171, 72 N. E. 638. A petition for a rehearing having been denied, the cause was brought here.\n Messrs. Charles Martindale and S. S. Gregory for plaintiffs in error.\n Messrs. Edward E. Gates, Albert Baker, Edward Daniels, and Lewis C. Walker for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice White:\n\n Mr. Justice White, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n A motion has been filed to dismiss the writ of error or to affirm, and we proceed at once to its consideration. Several grounds are urged in argument in support of the motion, but we do not find it necessary to do more than consider an objection based upon the absence of a Federal question.\n The errors assigned are as follows:\n'The supreme court of Indiana erred in holding and deciding:\n\n'1. That the counterclaim set up by appellee Gates, the defendant in the trial court, based upon a breach of the same contract of hiring, which was the basis of the action of the appellants against the appellee Gates in the circuit court of Cook county, Illinois, was not adjudicated by the judgment in the circuit court of Cook county, Illinois, and by so deciding denied to the judgment of the circuit court of Cook county, Illinois, the force and effect which it has between the parties in the state of Illinois, wherein it was rendered, and denies full faith and credit to said judgment, contrary to and in \n\n[204 U.S. 89, 93]\n\u00a0\n violation of article 4,  1, of the Constitution of the United States.\n\n'2. That the appellee's counterclaim being valid, and not merged and adjudicated by the judgment of the circuit court of Cook county, Illinois, it was of a nature which survived against the personal representatives of a member of the partnership of Newman, Northrop, & Levinson, and that the personal representatives of the deceased partner were necessary parties to the appeal, and, not having been made parties, that neither the appellate court of the state of Indiana, nor the supreme court of the state of Indiana, has jurisdiction to determine the appeal, and the same must be dismissed, and judgment of dismissal was so rendered. Which final judgment of the supreme court necessarily involved the adjudication of the claim of the appellants to the protection of article 4,  1, of the Constitution of the United States, 'that full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings, of every other state,' which adjudication was adverse to appellants' claim under said provision of the Constitution of the United States.'\n\n These assignments plainly import that the supreme court of Indiana, on dismissing the appeal, considered and decided a question which had been submitted to the jury on the trial; viz., whether the matters alleged in the counterclaim as the basis for a recovery over against the plaintiffs had or had not been concluded by the Illinois judgment sued upon by the plaintiffs. We do not so construe the opinion and decision of the court.\n The appellate court of Indiana had held on the first appeal that the action of the trial court, in refusing to admit evidence in support of the counterclaim, because the Illinois judgment constituted res judicata, was error. It had further decided that the counterclaim was 'based upon a breach of contract,' and constituted an independent, affirmative cause of action in favor of the defendant, and that whether the questions therein involved were in fact adjudicated in the Illinois action \n\n[204 U.S. 89, 94]\n\u00a0\n was a question for the jury. As a result of this ruling evidence was introduced at the subsequent trial to establish what were the questions litigated and determined in theIllinois action and the extent to which, by the laws of Illinois, the judgment in that case possessed conclusive force.\n Now, in the opinion delivered by the supreme court of Indiana, on dismissing the appeal, the court did not discuss or in any wise refer to the scope and conclusive effect of the Illinois judgment. Undoubtedly, the court, in view of the law of the case as declared on the first appeal, treated the counterclaim as containing allegations of actionable breaches of duty which might have formed the subject of an independent action, and it is likewise evident that the court was of opinion that the plaintiffs were bound to perfect their appeal from the judgment upon the counterclaim, upon the hypothesis that the counterclaim set forth a valid cause of action against three individuals, viz., the plaintiffs in the main action. But substantially the court only considered and disposed of a preliminary question as to its authority to pass upon the controverted questions contained in the record before it. It found that there were in the counterclaim averments which it had been held early in the litigation required to be submitted to a jury, that the record exhibited a recovery upon the counterclaim against three persons, and that one of such persons had died after the rendition of judgment against him and his associates. Construing the statutes of Indiana, the court held that the cause of action asserted in the counterclaim survived the death of the party deceased, against whom a recovery had been had, that such cause of action could have been revived against the personal representative of the deceased, and that the personal representative was a necessary party appellant, and, not having been made a coappellant and served with notice of the appeal, the court was without jurisdiction to pass upon the errors assigned upon the appeal. To give effect to the assignments of error we should be obliged to make the impossible ruling that, despite the overruling of a demurrer \n\n[204 U.S. 89, 95]\n\u00a0\n to the counterelaim by the trial court, and the decision in respect to that pleading made by the appellate court on the first appeal, a mere inspection of the counterclaim so plainly demonstrates that the pleading is destitute of merit that it should be held to have been the duty of the state court of last resort to have treated the pleading as a sham and to have disposed of the appeal upon the hypothesis that the counterclaim was nonexistent.\n The removal of the cause from the appellate court into the supreme court of Indiana vacated the decision of the former tribunal, and after transfer the case stood in the highest court of Indiana as though it had been appealed to that court directly from the trial court. Oster v. Broe, 161 Ind. 114, 64 N. E. 918. Had the appeal been properly taken it would have been the duty of the supreme court of Indiana to pass upon the questions presented by the record before it, including, it may be, a Federal question, based upon the due faith and credit clause of the Constitution, which, on various occasions, was pressed upon the attention of the trial court. In legal effect, however, the case stands as though no appeal had been prosecuted from the judgment rendered by the trial court. As the jurisdiction of this court to review the judgments or decree of state courts when a Federal question is presented is limited to the review of a final judgment or decree, actually or constructively deciding such question, when rendered by the highest court of a state in which a decision in the suit could be had, and as, for the want of a proper appeal, no final judgment or decree in such court has been rendered, it results that the statutory prerequisite for the exercise in this case of the reviewing power of this court is wanting.\n Writ of error dismissed. \n\n\n\n","108":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNORTHERN LUMBER CO. v. O'BRIEN(1907)\nNo. 121\nArgued: Decided: January 14, 1907\n\n\n\n Messrs. Charles W. Bunn and James B. Kerr for appellant.[ Northern Lumber Co. v. O'Brien \n204 U.S. 190\n (1907) ]\n\n\n[204 U.S. 190, 192]\n\u00a0\n Mr. J. N. Searles for appellees.\n\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of the court:\n This suit involves the title to the south half of the southeast quarter of section twenty-seven, township fifty-two north, range fifteen west, in the state of Minnesota. \n\n[204 U.S. 190, 193]\n\u00a0\n The principal question in the case is whether the land in dispute was embraced by the grant of public lands made by Congress July 2d, 1864 (13 Stat. at L. 365, 367, chap. 217), to the Northern Pacific Railroad Company, in aid of the construction of a railroad and telegraph line from Lake Superior to Puget sound. If it was not, then the decree of the circuit court dismissing the bill was right, as was that of the circuit court of appeals, affirming that decree.\n By the act of May 5th, 1864 (13 Stat. at L. 64, chap. 79), Congress made a grant of public lands to the state of Minnesota in aid of the construction of a railroad from St. Paul to the head of Lake Superior. This grant was vested in the Lake Superior & Mississippi Railroad Company, and that company, on the 7th day of May, 1864, filed its map of General route. This map was accepted by the Land Department, and a copy was transmitted May 26th, 1864, to the proper local land office, which was informed of the approval by the Secretary of the Interior of a withdrawal of lands for the Lake Superior & Mississippi road, and that office was ordered to suspend, and it did suspend, 'from pre-emption, settlement, and sale a body of land about 20 miles in width,' as indicated on the above map. The land in dispute was within the exterior lines of this general route of the Lake Superior & Mississippi road, as defined by its map, and was part of the land so withdrawn.\n After the acceptance of the map of general route of the Lake Superior & Mississippi Railroad, and after the withdrawal by the Land Department, for the benefit of that company, of the lands covered by that map, Congress, by the above act of July 2d, 1864 (13 Stat. at L. 365, 367, chap. 217), declared 'that there be, and hereby is, granted to the 'Northern Pacific Railroad Company,' its successors and assigns, for the purpose of aiding in the construction of said railroad and telegraph line to the Pacific coast, and to secure the safe and speedy transportation of the mails, troops, munitions of war, and public stores, over the route of said line of railway, every alternate section of public land, not mineral, designated by odd numbers, to the \n\n[204 U.S. 190, 194]\n\u00a0\n amount of twenty alternate sections per mile, on each side of said railroad line, as said company may adopt, through the territories of the United States, and ten alternate sections of land per mile on each side of said railroad whenever it passes through any state, and whenever, on the line thereof, the United States have full title, not reserved, sold, granted, or otherwise appropriated, and free from pre-emption or other claims or rights, at the time the line of said road is definitely fixed, and a plat thereof filed in the office of the Commissioner of the General Land Office.'\n In 1866 the Lake Superior & Mississippi Railroad Company filed a map of the definite location of its road, from which it appeared that the land in dispute was outside of the place, indemnity, and terminal limits of that road as thus located.\n In 1882 the Northern Pacific Railroad Company filed its map of definite location, which showed that the particular lands here in dispute were in the place limits indicated by that map.\n In 1883 the latter company filed in the proper office a list of lands which it asserted were covered by the grant made to it on July 2d, 1864, and on that list, among other lands, were those here in dispute.\n In 1901 the Commissioner of the Land Office refused to approve, and rejected, the list so far as the lands now in question were concerned, upon the ground that, although they appeared, after the definite location of the Northern Pacific Railroad, to be within the primary limits of the grant made for that road by the act of July 2d, 1864, they 'were excepted from the operation of said grant, because they were, at the date of the passage of said act, within 10 miles of the probable route of the Lake Superior & Mississippi Railroad, in aid of the construction of which a grant was made by the act of May 5th, 1864, and were embraced within the withdrawal of May 26th, 1864, made on account of the last-mentioned grant.' The question was taken on appeal to the Secretary of the Interior, and he also rejected the above list, rendering a decision under date of \n\n[204 U.S. 190, 195]\n\u00a0\n July 16th, 1901, affirming the decision of the Commissioner,-the Secretary ruling that, as these lands were, at the date of the grant to the Northern Pacific Railroad Company, already 'included within an existing and lawful withdrawal made in aid of a prior grant,' they were not to be deemed 'public lands' when the Northern Pacific grant of 1864 was made, and, consequently, were not embraced by that grant. The Secretary held that the fact that a right under a prior grant did not eventually attach to the lands here in question was immaterial; 'first, because the act of July 2, 1864, was a grant in proesenti, and second, because a reservation on account of a prior grant will defeat a later grant like that of July 2, 1864, whether the lands are needed in satisfaction of the prior grant or not.' Re Northern P. R. Co. 31 Land Dec. 33. Under that decision the above list filed by the Northern Pacific Railroad Company was formally and finally canceled, and these lands were never assigned to it by the Land Department.\n Although the stipulation of the parties as to the facts is very lengthy, those here stated are sufficient to present the point upon which, it is agreed, the decision of the case depends.\n We have seen that, at the date of the grant of July 2d, 1864, to the Northern Pacific Railroad Company, the particular land in dispute was within the lines designated by the accepted map of the general route of the Lake Superior & Mississippi Railroad; and that the grant for the Northern Pacific Railroad was of 'public land.' Was the land here in dispute public land at the date of the passage of that act? If, by reason of its having been then withdrawn by the Land Department from pre-emption, settlement, and sale, it was not, at the date of the Northern Pacific grant, to be deemed public land, did that grant attach to it when the Northern Pacific road was definitely located in 1882? These questions were answered in the negative by both the circuit court and the unanimous judgment of the circuit court of appeals. 134 Fed. 303, 139 Fed. 614.\n It has long been settled that the grant to the Northern \n\n[204 U.S. 190, 196]\n\u00a0\n Pacific Railroad Company by the act of 1864 was one in proesenti; that is, the company took a present title, as of the date of the act, to the lands embraced by the terms of the grant; the words 'that there be, and hereby is, granted' importing 'a transfer of present title, not a promise to transfer one in the future.' In St. Paul & P. R. Co. v. Northern P. R. Co. \n139 \nU.S. 1, 5\n, 35 S. L. ed. 77, 79, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 389, 390, the court said that 'the route not being at the time determined, the grant was in the nature of a float, and the title did not attach to any specific section until they were capable of identification; but, when once identified, the title attached to them as of the date of the grant, except as to such sections as were specifically reserved. It is in this sense that the grant is termed one in proesenti; that is to say, it is of that character as to all lands within the terms of the grant, and not reserved from it at the time of the definite location of the route. This is the construction given to similar grants by this court, where the question has been often considered; indeed, it is so well settled as to be no longer open to discussion. Schulenberg v. Harriman, 21 Wall. 44, 60, 22 L. ed. 551, 554; Leavenworth, enworth, L. & G. R. Co. v. United States, \n92 U.S. 733\n, 23 L. ed. 634; Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. v. Kansas P. R. Co. \n97 U.S. 491\n, 24 L. ed. 1095; St. Joseph & D. C. R. Co. v. Baldwin, \n103 U.S. 426\n, 26 L. ed. 578.' The same principle was reaffirmed in Bardon v. Northern P. R. Co. \n145 \nU.S. 535, 543\n, 36 S. L. ed. 806, 810, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 856, and in many other cases which are familiar to the profession and need not be cited.\n Again, no lands passed that were not, at the date of the grant, public land; that is, lands 'open to sale or other disposition under general laws;' not lands 'to which any claims or rights of others have attached.' Bardon v. Northern P. R. Co. supra. At the time of the grant of 1864 to the Northern Pacific Railroad Company the lands here in dispute were, as we have seen, among those withdrawn by the Land Department from pre-emption, settlement, and sale, and were held specifically under the grant of May 5th, 1864, for the Lake Superior & Mississippi Railroad. They were not, therefore, public lands embraced by the later grant to the other company. \n\n[204 U.S. 190, 197]\n\u00a0\n The grant of the Northern Pacific Railroad Company spoke as of the date of the act of July 2d, 1864; and that company did not acquire any title to these lands, then withdrawn, by reason of the fact that when its line, at a subsequent date, was definitely located, they had become freed from the grant made by the act of May 2th, 1864, to the state of Minnesota. Being at the date of the grant of July 2d, 1864,under the operation of an order of withdrawal by the Land Department, they were not in the category of lands embraced by that grant of 'public lands.' When the withdrawal order ceased to be in force the lands so withdrawn did not pass under the later grant, but became a part of the public domain, subject to be disposed of under the general land laws, and not to be claimed under any railroad land grant. There is no escape from this conclusion under the adjudged cases.\n In Kansas P. R. Co. v. Dunmeyer, \n113 U.S. 629\n, 28 L. ed. 1122, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 566, in which the attempt was made to include within a railroad grant lands to which a homestead claim had previously attached, but which claim had ceased to exist when the line of the railroad was definitely fixed, the court, speaking by Mr. Justice Miller, said: 'No attempt has ever been made to include lands reserved to the United States, which reservation afterwards ceased to exist, within the grant, though this road, and others with grants in similar language, have more than once passed through military reservations, for forts and other purposes, which have been given up or abandoned as such reservations, and were of great value. Nor is it understood that, in any case where lands had been otherwise disposed of, their reversion to the government brought them within the grant.'\n In Bardon v. Northern P. R. Co. supra, Mr. Justice Field, delivering the unanimous judgment of the court, said: 'In the Leavenworth Case, supra, the appellant, the railroad company, contended that the fee of the land was in the United States, and only a right of occupancy remained with the Indians; that, under the grant, the state would hold the title subject to their right of occupancy; but, as that had \n\n[204 U.S. 190, 198]\n\u00a0\n been subsequently extinguished, there was no sound objection to the granting act taking full effect. The court, however, adhered to its conclusion, that the land covered by the grant could only embrace lands which were, at the time, public lands, free from any lawful claim of other parties, unless there was an express provision showing that the grant was to have a more extended operation,-citing the decision in Wilcox v. Jackson, 13 Pet. 498, 10 L. ed. 264, to which we have referred above, that land once legally appropriated to any purpose was thereby severed from the public domain, and a subsequent sale would not be construed to embrace it, though not specially reserved. And of the Indians' right of occupancy it said that this right, with the correlative obligation of the government to enforce it, negatived the idea that Congress, even in the absence of any positive stipulation to protect the Osages, intended to grant their land to a railroad company, either absolutely or cum onere. 'For all practical purposes,' the court added, 'they owned it; as the actual right of possession, the only thing they deemed of value, was secured to them by treaty, until they should elect to surrender it to the United States,' Three justices, of whom the writer of this opinion was one, dissented from the majority of the court in the Leavenworth Case; but the decision has been uniformly adhered to since its announcement, and this writer, after a much larger experience in the consideration of public land grants since that time, now readily concedes that the rule of construction adopted, that, in the absence of any express provision indicating otherwise, a grant of public lands only applies to lands which are at the time free from existing claims, is better and safer, both to the government and to private parties, than the rule which would pass the property subject to the liens and claims of others. The latter construction would open a wide field of litigation between the grantees and third parties.'\n Again, in the same case, where the contention was that the Northern Pacific grant embraced lands to which pre-emption claim had previously attached, but which claim was canceled \n\n[204 U.S. 190, 199]\n\u00a0\n after the date of that grant, the court said: 'That pre-emption entry remained of record until August 5, 1865, when it was canceled; but this was after the date of the grant to the Northern Pacific Railroad Company, and also after the dates of the several grants made to the state of Wisconsin to aid in the construction of railroad and telegraph lines within that state. The cancelation, as already said, did not have the effect of bringing the land under the operation of the grant to the Northern Pacific Railroad Company; it simply restored the land to the mass of public lands, to be dealt with subsequently in the same manner as any other public lands of the United States not covered by or excepted from the grant.'\n In United States v. Southern P. R. Co. \n146 \nU.S. 570, 606\n, 36 S. L. ed. 1091, 1101, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 152, 160, this court, speaking by Mr. Justice Brewer, said: 'Indeed, the intent of Congress in all railroad land grants, as has been understood and declared by this court again and again, is that such grant shall operate at a fixed time, and shall take only such lands as at that time are public lands, and, therefore, grantable by Congress, and is never to be taken as a floating authority to appropriate all tracts within the specified limits which, at any subsequent time, may become public lands.' In Whitney v. Taylor, \n158 \nU.S. 85, 92\n, 39 S. L. ed. 906, 908, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 796, 799, Mr. Justice Brewer, again speaking for the court, said: 'That when, on the records of the local land office, there is an existing claim on the part of an individual under the homestead or pre- emption law, which has been recognized by the officers of the government, and has not been canceled or set aside, the tract in respect to which that claim is existing is excepted from the operation of a railroad land grant containing the ordinary excepting clauses, and this notwithstanding such claim may not be enforceable by the claimant, and is subject to cancelation by the government at its own suggestion or upon the application of other parties. It was not the intention of Congress to open a controversy between the claimant and the railroad company as to the validity of the former's claim. It was enough that the claim existed, and the question of its validity was a matter to be settled between \n\n[204 U.S. 190, 200]\n\u00a0\n the government and the claimant, in respect to which the railroad company was not permitted to be heard.' In Spencer v. McDougal, \n159 U.S. 65\n, 40 L. ed. 77, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1026, the court referred to Wolcott v. Des Moines Nav. & R. Co. 5 Wall. 681, 18 L. ed. 689, in which the question arose whether a grant of public lands on each side of Des Moines river, in aid of navigation, terminated at the mouth of Raccoon fork or extended along the whole length of the river to the northern boundary of the state, and said: 'The Land Department ordered that lands the whole length of the river within the state should be withdrawn from sale. In the course of subsequent litigation it was decided by this court that the grant terminated at the mouth of the Raccoon river. But in the case cited it was held that the withdrawal by the Land Department of lands above the mouth of the Raccoon river was valid, and that a subsequent railroad grant, with the ordinary reservation clause in it, did not operate upon lands so withdrawn.' So, in Northern P. R. Co. v. Musser-Sauntry Land, Logging, & Mfg. Co. \n168 \nU.S. 604, 607\n, 611 S., 42 L. ed. 596, 597, 599, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 205, 206, 207: 'But a single question is presented in this case, and that is whether the withdrawal from sale by the Land Department in March, 1866, of lands within the indemnity limits of the grant of 1856 and 1864 exempted such lands from the operation of the grant to the plaintiff. It will be perceived that the grant in aid of the defendant railway company was prior in date to that to the plaintiff, and that before the time of the filing of plaintiff's maps of general route and definite location the lands were withdrawn for the benefit of the defendant. The grant to the plaintiff was only of lands to which the United States had 'full title, not reserved, sold, granted, or otherwise appropriated, and free from pre- emption, or other claims or rights, at the time the line of said road is definitely fixed.' The withdrawal by the Secretary in aid of the grant to the state of Wisconsin was valid, and operated to withdraw the odd- numbered sections within its limits from disposal by the land officers of the government under the general land laws. The act of the Secretary was in effect a reservation. Wolcott v. Des Moines Nav. & R.

Western Land Co. \n147 U.S. 531\n, 37 L. ed. 267, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 353, and cases cited in the opinion. It has also been held that such a withdrawal is effective against claims arising under subsequent railroad land grants. St. Paul & P. R. Co. v. Northern P. R. Co. \n139 \nU.S. 1, 17\n, 18 S., 35 L. ed. 77, 83, 84, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 389; Wisconsin C. R. Co. v. Forsythe, \n159 \nU.S. 46, 54\n, 40 S. L. ed. 71, 73, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1020; Spencer v. McDougal, \n159 U.S. 62\n, 40 L. ed. 76, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1026 . . . . All that we here hold is, that when a withdrawal of lands within indemnity limits is made in aid of an earlier land grant, and made prior to the filing of the map of definite location by a company having a later grant,-the latter having such words of exception and limitation as are found in the grant to the plaintiff,-it operates to except the withdrawn lands from the scope of such later grant.' The doctrines of these cases were recognized in the recent case of Northern P. R. Co. v. DeLacey, \n174 U.S. 622\n, 43 L. ed. 1111, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 791.\n In view of these decisions it is clear that, as the lands in dispute were, at the date of the grant to the Northern Pacific Railroad Company, withdrawn, of record, for the benefit of the Lake Superior & Mississippi Railroad, under a prior grant, they were not public lands within the meaning of the later grant, and did not come under it, when or because it was subsequently ascertained that they were without the line of the definite location of the road of the Lake Superior Railroad Company, and within the place limits of the Northern Pacific, as defined by its map of definite location. When freed from the operation of the accepted map of general route filed by the Lake Superior & Mississippi Railroad Company, they did not come under the operation of the later grant to the Northern Pacific Railroad, but became a part of the public lands constituting the public domain, and subject only to be disposed of under the general laws relating to the public lands. If, by the act of July 2d, 1864, or before the line of the Northern Pacific Railroad was definitely located, Congress had, in terms, appropriated, for the benefit of that road, any of the lands embraced in the general route of the \n\n[204 U.S. 190, 202]\n\u00a0\n other road, a different question would be presented. But it did not do so. It only granted for the benefit of the Northern Pacific Railroad lands which then, July 2d, 1864, were public lands, and no lands were public lands, within the meaning of Congress, which, at that time, were withdrawn by the Land Department; that is, reserved for the purposes of a grant prior, although such reservation turned out to have been a mistake.\n The suggestion is made in this connection that the order of the Land Department was too uncertain and indefinite to have any legal force, because the direction of the local land office was to suspend from pre- emption, settlement, and sale 'a body of land about 20 miles in width.' We deem this suggestion without merit. The order for withdrawal referred to the diagram or map showing the road's probable route; and it is agreed that the lands in dispute are coterminous and within 10 miles of the line of the general route of the Lake Superior & Mississippi Railroad, as defined by the above diagram or map. The map, however indefinite, was intended to cover these lands. It sufficiently indicated these lands and the probable route of the road, and that was enough.\n Many cases are called to our attention which are supposed to militate against the views we have here expressed. We have examined those referred to and do not perceive that any one of them decided the particular question now before us. No one of them holds that a grant, in proesenti, of public lands, with the ordinary reservations, embraces lands which, at the date of such grant, are under the operation of a formal order of the Land Department, of record, withdrawing them for the benefit of a prior grant in the event they should be needed for the purposes of such grant. Nor does any of them hold that the subsequent cancelation of such withdrawal order had the effect to bring them under the operation of a later grant of public lands. It is said that United States v. Oregon & C. R. Co. \n176 U.S. 28\n, 44 L. ed. 358, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 261, and Wilcox v. Eastern Oregon Land Co. \n176 U.S. 51\n, 44 L. ed. 368, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 269, should be regarded as controlling and decisive of this case for the appellant. We do not think so. The \n\n[204 U.S. 190, 203]\n\u00a0\n principal point decided in those cases was that nothing in the act of 1864 prevented Congress by legislation from appropriating for the benefit of other railroad corporations lands that might be or were embraced within the general route of the Northern Pacific Railroad; and this for the reason that an accepted map of general route only gave the company filing it an inchoate right, and did not pass title to specific sections until they were identified by a definite location of the road. Besides, in neither case was there in force, at the date of the later grant, an accepted, effective order of the Land Department withdrawing the lands there in dispute pursuant to an accepted map of the general route of the Northern Pacific Railroad. If there had been an order of that kind, it would still have been competent for Congress to dispose of the lands within such general route, as it saw proper, at any time prior to the definite location of the road under the later grant. In conformity with prior decisions it was so adjudged in the two cases above cited. Those cases did not adjudge that a grant of 'public land,' with the usual reservations, embraced any lands which, at the time, were formally withdrawn by the Land Department from pre-emption, settlement, or sale, for the benefit of a prior grant.\n We are of opinion that the Circuit Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals correctly interpreted the decisions of this court and did not err as to the law of the case. The judgment below must, therefore, be affirmed.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","109":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNORTHERN PAC R. CO. v.

This tract was described. Defendant in error was adjudged entitled to recover 'all the rest of the land described in the amended complaint.' And that a writ issue to put him in possession thereof, but not until ninety days from the date of the judgment, and, if an appeal should be taken and proceedings stayed, then not until ninety days from the time the remittitur from the supreme \n\n[205 U.S. 122, 126]\n\u00a0\n court affirming the judgment should be filed; and if, in the meantime, the railway company should commence proceeding in the proper court to condemn the land claimed by it and described in its answer, for railroad purposes, then said writ should not be issued as to such land as it might seek to condemn, unless the company should afterwards dismiss such proceedings or fail to prosecute the same to final judgment and pay the award that might be made therein. The supreme court affirmed the judgment. 39 Wash. 576, 81 Pac. 1062\n\n\n The facts, as far as necessary to be stated, are that after proceedings in the land office, to which the railway company was a party, a homestead patent was issued to defendant in error April 20, 1897, to lots 10, 11, 14, and 15 of section 1, township 16 N., range 45 E., Willamette meridian. Defendant in error established his residence upon the land in 1883.\n In 1886 and the first half of 1887 the Spokane & Palouse Railway Company constructed and completed, at great expense, a railroad over lots 10 and 11, conforming to the survey previously made and staked out, and from and after its completion it was operated daily and continuously in the carrying of freight, passengers, and mail. The right of way claimed was 100 feet wide on either side of the main line of railroad. It would be possible for plaintiff in error, who is the successor of the Spokane company, to carry freight, passengers, and mail over a right of way not exceeding 25 feet in width, and a space of 100 feet square would permit of the erection of a depot at the town of Palouse. But great inconvenience would result to the citizens of that town and vicinity and the railway company. For the convenient, prompt, and expeditious handling of freight and the erection of elevators for storing grain and wheat a right of way of 200 feet is necessary. At the time the railroad was surveyed and constructed defendant in error resided upon said lands and knew of its construction and the expenditure of large sums of money therefor. About the \n\n[205 U.S. 122, 127]\n\u00a0\n time of the survey he published a notice in the Palouse News, a newspaper published in the vicinity of the land, forbidding all persons from trespassing thereon. This is the only objection he made. In the month of August, 1887, the Northern Pacific Railroad Company, claiming to be the owner of lots 10 and 11, conveyed the same to William S. Powers, and he, on the 14th of September of the same year, conveyed to the Spokane & Palouse Railway Company a right of way 200 feet wide over lots 10 and 11, being the same then claimed by that company and now claimed by plaintiff in error, the Northern Pacific Railroad Company. On the 12th of May, 1897, the Spokane & Palouse Railway Company, Powers, and others, as successors in interest of Powers under the above deed of conveyance from the Northern Pacific Railroad Company, brought a suit against the defendant in error which will hereafter be referred to and described. The complaint was amended. The date of its filing as amended does not appear. It was sworn to February 19, 1898. A demurrer to the amended complaint was sustained and, the plaintiffs declining to plead further, a judgment was entered June 24, 1898, dismissing the suit. The judgment was affirmed successively by the supreme court of the state and by this court. No suit of any kind was commenced by defendant in error enjoin the construction of, or the maintenance of, said railroad over said right of way, except the suit at bar, which was brought shortly after the decision of this court above mentioned. The summons was served on the Northern Pacific Railway Company on the 9th of October, 1901, and the complaint was filed on the 4th of June, 1902.\n The Spokane & Palouse Railway Company conveyed the right of way in controversy and all of its property on the 21st of February, 1899, to the Northern Pacific Railway Company, which has ever since maintained and operated said road from Spokane, Washington, to Lewiston, Idaho, and intervening points. \n\n[205 U.S. 122, 128]\n\u00a0\n The Northern Pacific Railway Company (we shall follow counsel's example and treat the Northern Pacific Railway Company as the sole plaintiff in error, the individuals named being its lessees) assigns as error in its brief the ruling of the supreme court of the state, that the company 'had no right of way under the act of Congress of March 3, 1875' ( 18 Stat. at L. 482, chap. 152, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1568), and the ruling, 'that the statute of limitations of Washington could not, because the laws of the United States forbade, commence to run until patent issued.' The limitation of the statute is ten years.\n The defendant in error opposes as a bar to these defenses the judgment in his favor in the suit brought by the Spokane & Palouse Railway Company and William S. Powers and others, which judgment was affirmed by this court. \n180 U.S. 173\n, 45 L. ed. 479, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 319. Plaintiff in error is the successor in interest of the Spokane & Palouse Railway Company, and is estopped by the judgment if that company would be.\n The object of the suit in which the judgment was rendered, as appears from the findings of fact of the trial court, was to have Slaght, defendant in error, 'declared a trustee, and as holding the land in trust' for the plaintiffs in the suit, and to require a conveyance from him to them, and to enjoin him from bringing any action to oust them. The amended complaint, which is made part of the findings, averred that the patent to Slaght was 'issued under a misconstruction and misinterpretation of the law,' and that, at the date of the issuance of said patent, the land was not, nor was it at the time he applied to enter the same, public land, subject to settlement or entry under the land laws of the United States, other than the act of Congress approved July 2, 1864 [13 Stat. at L. 365, chap. 217], granting land to the Northern Pacific Railroad Company. The facts and circumstances from which these conclusions were deduced and justified were set forth with great particularity. It was averred that the Spokane & Palouse Railway Company and other plaintiffs asserted and claimed title to certain portions of the land under and by virtue of certain instruments \n\n[205 U.S. 122, 129]\n\u00a0\n duly made and delivered by Powers and his grantees. And it was also averred that the questions involved were of common and general interest to many persons whom it was impracticable to make parties, and that such persons and the plaintiffs were the owners in fee simple and had an indefeasible title, and were in possession of lots 10, 11, 14, and 15 of section 1, township 16 N., range 45 E., Willamette meridian, and that Slaght claimed an interest or estate therein adverse to the plaintiffs, which claim was without any right whatever and that he had no estate, right, title, or interest whatever in the land or any part thereof. And it was averred that he threatened to commence suits in ejectment, and, without suit, forcibly to dispossess and eject plaintiffs from said premises or a portion thereof unless enjoined. An injunction was prayed restraining him from selling the land and doing the acts described; that he be required to set forth the nature of his claim, and that his claim be determined; that he be adjudged to have no title or interest whatever to the land or any part thereof, and be enjoined from ever asserting any; 'that the title of plaintiffs be decreed good, valid, indefeasible fee simple, and free from all claims of said defendant;' that the patent be declared to have issued under a misconstruction of law, that he be held to be a trustee for the plaintiff, William L. Powers, and his grantees, both direct and through mesne conveyance, and that Slaght be required to convey the land to Powers and his grantees. Slaght demurred to the complaint and the demurrer was sustained. The plaintiffs electing to stand on the demurrer, judgment was entered dismissing the suit. This judgment was affirmed by the supreme court of the state and by this court, as we have seen.\n The complaint in the suit did not show what land or interest Powers deeded to the Spokane & Palouse Railway Company, but it appears from the findings that the Northern Pacific Railroad Company conveyed lots 10 and 11 to Powers in August, 1887, and in September, 1887, Powers conveyed to the Spokane & Palouse Railway Company the tract of \n\n[205 U.S. 122, 130]\n\u00a0\n land then used as its right of way, and that it is the same tract which was occupied by the plaintiff in error as its right of way. The basis of the title alleged in the suit was the grant to the Northern Pacific Railroad Company by act of Congress of July 2, 1864. Rights under the act of Congress of March 3, 1875, or under the statute of limitations of the state, were not set up. The Spokane & Palouse Railway Company, however, alleged that it and the other plaintiffs in the suit had a title in fee simple, and prayed, in the most comprehensive and detailed way, to have it quieted against the claims of the defendant in error, which, it was alleged, were threatened to be asserted by suits and by force without suit. The question now to be decided is, Is the decree in the suit res judicata? Against this effect of the decree the railway company urges that it was rendered on demurrer and 'the estoppel extends only to the very point raised in the pleading, and does not bar another action based upon other facts.' The effect of the decree, it is insisted, was only to decide against the title specially set forth in the pleading. And further, 'in this action [that at bar] the right asserted is a perpetual easement or way by virtue of the act of 1875 through the lands involved in the former suit. Not only was this right not pleaded in the former complaint, but under it the title now asserted could not have been proved.' To sustain these conclusions the following authorities are cited: Wiggins Ferry Co. v. Ohio & M. R. Co. \n142 \nU.S. 396, 410\n, 35 S. L. ed. 1055, 1060, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 188; Gilman v. Rives, 10 Pet. 298, 9 L. ed. 432; Freeman, Judgm. 4th ed. 267; Van Fleet, Former Adjudication,  306 and following.\n The citations are not apposite to the present controversy. It is well established that a judgment on demurrer is as conclusive as one rendered upon proof. Gould v. Evansville & C. R. Co. \n91 U.S. 526\n, 23 L. ed. 416; Bissell v. Spring Valley Twp. \n124 U.S. 225\n, 31 L. ed. 411, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 495; Freeman, Judgm.  267. The question as to such judgment when pleaded in bar of another action will be necessarily its legal identity with such action. The general rule of the extent of the bar is not only \n\n[205 U.S. 122, 131]\n\u00a0\n what was pleaded or litigated, but what could have been pleaded or litigated. There is a difference between the effect of a judgment as a bar against the prosecution of a second action for the same claim or demand, and its effect as an estoppel in another action between the same parties upon another claim or demand (Cromwell v. Sac County, \n94 U.S. 351\n, 24 L. ed. 195; Bissell v. Spring Valley Twp. supra; New Orleans v. Citizens' Bank, \n167 U.S. 396\n, 42 L. ed. 210, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 905; Southern P. R. Co. v. United States, \n168 U.S. 1\n, 42 L. ed. 355, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 18; Gunter v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. \n200 U.S. 273\n, 50 L. ed. 477, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 252; Deposit Bank v. Frankfort, \n191 U.S. 499\n, 48 L. ed. 276, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 154); and a distinction between personal actions and real actions is useful to observe. Herman, Estoppel,  92. It is there said: 'Although there may be several different claims for the same thing, there can be only one right of property in it; therefore, when a cause of action has resulted in favor of the defendant, when the plaintiff claims the property of a certain thing there can be no other action maintained against the same party for the same property, for that would be to renew the question already decided; for the single question in litigation was whether the property belonged to the plaintiff or not; and it is of no importance that the plaintiff failed to set up all his rights upon which his cause of action could have been maintained; it is sufficient that it might have been litigated.'\n In United States v. California & O. Land Co. \n192 U.S. 355\n, 48 L. ed. 476, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 266, this principle was applied. In that case a decree rendered upon a bill in equity brought under an act of Congress to have patents for land declared void, as forfeited, and to establish the title of the United States to the land, was held to be a bar to a subsequent bill brought against the same defendants to recover the same land, on the ground that it was excepted from the original grant as an Indian reservation. And, speaking of the two suits, we said, by Mr. Justice Holmes: 'The best that can be said, apart from the act just quoted, to distinguish the two suits, is that now the United States puts forward a new ground for its prayer. \n\n[205 U.S. 122, 132]\n\u00a0\n Formerly it sought to avoid the patents by way of forfeiture. Now it seeks the same conclusion by a different means; that is to say, by evidence that the lands originally were excepted from the grant. But in this, as in the former suit, it seeks to establish its own title to the fee.' And further: 'But the whole tendency of our decisions is to require a plaintiff to try his whole cause of action and his whole case at one time. He cannot even split up his claim (Fetter v. Beale, 1 Salk. 11; Trask v. Hartford & N. H. R. Co. 2 Allen, 331; Freeman, Judgm. 4th ed.  238, 241); and, a fortiori, he cannot divide the grounds of recovery.'\n This doctrine has illustrations in suits to quiet title. It was decided in Parrish v. Ferris (Doe ex dem. Parrish v. Ferris) 2 Black, 606, 17 L. ed. 317, that the judgment in an action to quiet title is conclusive of the title, whether adverse to the plaintiff in the action or to the defendant. In other words, determines the merits of the plaintiff's title as well as that of the defendant. In Indiana, B. & W. R. Co. v. Allen, 113 Ind. 581, 15 N. E. 446, it was held that the railway company could not assert against a judgment decreeing title in the plaintiff in such an action the right to construct and maintain a railway over it. And in Davis v. Lennen [125 Ind. 185, 24 N. E. 885], it was decided that every possible interest of a defendant is cut off. And necessarily every possible interest of the plaintiff is cut off if the judgment is in favor of the defendant. Parrish v. Ferris, supra.\n The Spokane & Palouse Railway Company alleged a title in fee simple, and the truth of the allegation could be determined as well by demurrer as by proof, and the same legal consequences followed from it. Clearwater v. Meredith (Ferguson v. Meredith) 1 Wall. 25, 17 L. ed. 604; Goodrich v. Chicago, 5 Wall. 566, 18 L. ed. 511; Aurora v. West, 7 Wall. 82, 19 L. ed. 42; Black, Judgm.  707; Freeman, Judgm. 267, and cases hereinbefore cited. The record shows that the demurrer was not upon merely formal or technical defects, but went to the merits. It was directed to the second amended complaint of the plaintiffs. They elected to stand on that complaint, and declined to plead \n\n[205 U.S. 122, 133]\n\u00a0\n further. They asserted its sufficiency by an appeal to the supreme court of the state and again to this court, and met defeat in both, as we have seen. Whether the Spokane & Palouse Railway Company could have pleaded, in addition to the right it alleged under the deed from Powers, the rights that plaintiffs in error contend it acquired under the act of Congress of 1875, or the statute of limitations of the state, we need not determine. See  97, 120, 14 L. ed. 942 et seq.; Story, Eq. Pl.; Smith v. Swormstedt, 16 How. 288, 14 L. ed. 942. It elected between those rights and rights under the Powers deed, and we think its grantee is now bound by that election. The interest that the Spokane & Palouse Railway Company derived from Powers was of the right of way, which is now claimed by plaintiff in error. In other words, plaintiff in error, as successor of the Spokane & Palouse Railway Company, again asserts title to the very property that was the subject of the other suit, the source of title, only, being different. If this may be done, how often may it be repeated? If defeated upon the new title, may plaintiff in error assert still another one, either in its predecessor or in itself, and repeat as often as it may vary its claim? The principle of res judicata and the cases enforcing and illustrating that principle declare otherwise.\n In the discussion thus far we have assumed, as contended by plaintiff in error, that the statute of limitations could commence to run before the patent issued, and we have also assumed that rights under it were complete in the Spokane & Palouse Railway Company at the time of its suit against Slaght. Lest the latter assumption be questioned it may be well to determine whether the other assumption be true. The supreme court decided against it on the authority of Gibson v. Chouteau, 13 Wall. 92, 20 L. ed. 534, and Redfield v. Parks, \n132 U.S. 239\n, 33 L. ed. 327, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 83; that is, decided that the statute did not commence to run until the patent issued to Slaght, and that, therefore, this action was not barred. The ruling, we think, was right. The act of Congress of 1875 and the statute of limitations are \n\n[205 U.S. 122, 134]\n\u00a0\n independent defenses, and, being so, the latter comes within the rule announced. Of course, if the act of Congress of 1875 was a grant of the right of way in proesenti, 'conveying a good title when the road was completed,' as contended, it needs no aid from the statute of limitations, and would be an effectual defense if it were not barred by the judgment which we have considered.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","111":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nOHIO VALLEY NAT BANK v. HULITT(1907)\nNo. 108\nArgued: November 16, 1906Decided: January 7, 1907\n\n\n\n\n[204 U.S. 162, 163]\n\u00a0\n This case was begun in the United States circuit court by John Hulitt as receiver of the First National Bank of Hillsboro, Ohio, against the Ohio Valley National Bank, to recover the amount of an assessment upon certain shares of the stock of the Hillsboro Bank, which had become insolvent, which assessment was directed by the Comptroller of the Currency in accordance with the provisions of the national bank act. The case was tried upon an agreed statement of facts, from which it appears that on March 18, 1893, one Overton S. Price, for a loan of $10,000, gave his promissory note of that date to the Ohio Valley Bank, due ninety days after date, payable to his own order and indorsed by him, and deposited as collateral security for the note, among other securities, fifty shares of stock of the said First National Bank of Hillsboro, Ohio. The note had a power of sale attached to it, signed by Price, and authorizing the holder to sell or collect any portion of the collateral, at public or private sale, on the nonperformance of the promise, and at any time thereafter, without advertising or otherwise giving Price notice, and providing that, in case of public sale, the holder might purchase without liability to account for more than the net proceeds of the sale.\n On December 25, 1893, Price died, leaving the note due and unpaid, and no payments have been made thereon except as hereinafter stated.\n On June 18, 1894, the bank made a transfer of the pledged stock of the First National Bank of Hillsboro, and also of certain other stock in the Dominion National Bank of Bristol, Virginia, to one Henry Otjen, an employee of the bank, and pe- \n\n[204 U.S. 162, 164]\n\u00a0\n cuniarily irresponsible. The shares were transferred on the books of the banks and new certificates issued in the name of Otjen and delivered to him on July 7, 1894. Otjen indorsed the certificates in blank. No money passed in consideration of the transfer, and none was expected, nor was any credit given or indorsed on the note by reason thereof.\n The transfer was made upon the understanding and agreement between Otjen and the bank that Otjen should hold the stock as security for the indebtedness of the estate of Price upon the note, he to apply any amounts which he might realize from said stock as credits upon the note. In pursuance of this agreement Otjen subsequently paid the bank sums received from the Dominion National Bank on account of dividends received until the sale of that stock, when the proceeds of sale were likewise applied by him upon the note.\n On February 19, 1896, the bank prepared proof of claim against the estate of Price, and, at that time, believing the stocks transferred to Otjen to afford a reasonable security for the note to the amount of $4,484, indorsed a credit for that sum upon the note, as follows: 'Forty-four hundred and eighty-four ($4,484.00) dolls. paid on ac. of within note June 18, '94, being proceeds of sale of 30 shrs. stock Dominion National Bank and 20 shares of stock 1st National Bank of Hillsboro, O.' The bank filed its proof of claim for the balance of the indebtedness upon the note; that no consideration was paid for said credit, and the same was not entered on the bank's books; that all dividends arising upon the distribution of the estate of Price were applied upon the note.\n The Hillsboro bank continued to do business until July 16, 1896. From the date of transfer at all times the stock appeared on the books of the Hillsboro bank in the name of Otjen, there being nothing on the books to connect the Ohio Valley National Bank with the stock, or to indicate that it had any interest therein; that the defendant bank at no time performed any act of ownership, or exercised or attempted to exercise any of the rights of a stockholder in said bank, or of \n\n[204 U.S. 162, 165]\n\u00a0\n the Dominion National Bank, unless the acts stated were, in legal intendment, of that character. The Ohio Valley National Bank procured the shares to be transferred to Otjen because it was unwilling to assume the risk of the statutory liability of a stockholder in respect thereto. The circuit court of appeals held the bank liable as a stockholder (69 C. C. A. 609, 137 Fed. 461), and directed judgment accordingly.\n Messrs. Robert Ramsey and J. J. Muir for plaintiff in error.\n\n Messrs. Henry M. Huggins and R. T. Hough for defendant in error. \n\n[204 U.S. 162, 166]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n Section 5151 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3465) provides that the shareholders of every national banking association shall be held individually responsible, equally and ratably, not one for another, for all contracts, debts, and engagements of such association, to the extent of the amount of their stock therein, at the par value thereof, in addition to the amount invested in such shares. This section undertakes to hold all shareholders responsible, and questions have arisen under varying circumstances as to what constitutes such shareholder.\n In Anderson v. Philadelphia Warehouse Co. \n111 U.S. 479\n, 28 L. ed. 478, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 525, it was held that the mere pledgee, who had never acted as a shareholder, would not be liable as such, notwithstanding the stock was transferred on the books of the bank and the certificate issued to an irresponsible person, in that instance a porter in the employment of the company, and this although the transfer had been thus made for the purpose of avoiding liability which might be incurred by the shareholders of the bank, in case of insolvency. In the course of the opinion, Mr. Chief Justice Waite, speaking for the court, recognized that the real owner might be held liable as a shareholder, but in that case the facts showed the warehouse company, sought to be held as a shareholder, was never other than a pledgee, and that notwithstanding the transfer to the irresponsible person, the real ownership of the stock remained in the original holder.\n In Pauly v. State Loan & T. Co. \n165 U.S. 606\n, 41 L. ed. 844, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 465, the subject was considered at length, and it was held that one who was described in the certificate as a pledgee, and who in good faith held the shares as such, was not a shareholder, subject to the personal liability imposed by  5151. The previous cases in this court were reviewed, and, in summing up the rules relating to the liability of shareholders in \n\n[204 U.S. 162, 167]\n\u00a0\n national banks, deducible from previous decisions, among other things it was said: 'That the real owner of the shares of the capital stock of a national banking association may, in every case, be treated as a shareholder within the meaning of  5151.' And again: 'The object of the statute is not to be defeated by the mere forms of transactions between shareholders and their creditors. The courts will look at the relations of parties as they actually are, or as, by reason of their conduct, they must be assumed to be, for the protection of creditors. Congress did not say that those only should be regarded as shareholders, liable for the contracts, debts, and engagements of the banking association, whose names appear on the stock list distinctly as shareholders. A mistake or error in keeping the official list of shareholders would not prevent creditors from holding liable all who were, in fact, the real owners of the stock, and as such had invested money in the shares of the association. As already indicated, those may be treated as shareholders within the meaning of  5151 who are the real owners of the stock, or who hold themselves out, or allow themselves to be held out, as owners in such way and under such circumstances as, upon principles of fair dealing, will estop them, as against creditors, from claiming that they were not, in fact, owners.'\n And in Rankin v. Fidelity Ins. Trust & S. D. Co. \n189 \nU.S. 242, 252\n, 47 S. L. ed. 792, 796, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 553, the doctrine was stated that a defendant who was in fact the owner of shares of stock could not avoid liability by listing them in the name of another, notwithstanding it might do so if it were the mere pledgee of the stock; and further, that the case then under consideration turned upon the actual ownership of the shares, which question was properly left to the jury. And to the same effect are well-considered cases in other courts, Federal and state. It was held that the real owner might be charged, although his name never appeared upon the books of the bank. Davis v. Stevens, 17 Blatchf. 259, Fed. Cas. No. 3,653, opinion by Mr. Chief Justice Waite; Houghton v. Hubbell, 33 C. C. A. 574, 63 U. S. App. 31, \n\n[204 U.S. 162, 168]\n\u00a0\n 91 Fed. 453; Laing v. Burley, 101 Ill. 591; Lesassier v. Kennedy, 36 La. Ann. 539.\n Assuming, then, the established doctrine to be that the mere pledgee of national bank stock cannot be held liable as a shareholder so long as the shares are not registered in his name, although an irresponsible person has been selected as the registered shareholder, we deem it equally settled, both from the terms of the statute attaching the liability and the decisions which have construed the act, that the real owner of the shares may be held responsible, although in fact the shares are not registered in his name. As to such owner the law looks through subterfuges and apparent ownerships and fastens the liability upon the shareholder to whom the shares really belong.\n Applying these principles to the case at bar, we think there can be no doubt of the liability of the Ohio Valley National Bank in this case. Conceding that it was exempt so long as the relation which it held to the stock was that of a pledgee, and that Otjen was the registered stockholder, holding for the benefit of the bank as pledgee, and not as owner,-what was the attitude of the parties after the death of Price, and the credit of the supposed value of the stock upon the note, and its presentation for allowance and acceptance by the representatives of Price's estate? As the foregoing statement shows, the stock was originally delivered to the bank, with a power of public or private sale for the liquidation of the pledge. After the death of Price the bank caused the stock to be registered in the name of Otjen. After proof of the claim the dividends paid out of the Price estate were credited upon the note. If the bank had followed literally the authority of the power of attorney attached to the note and sold the stock at public or private sale, and itself become the purchaser, we take it there could be no question that it would thus have become the real owner of the stock, and, within the principles of the cases heretofore cited, the shareholder, liable under the terms of the statute. We think what was in fact done neces- \n\n[204 U.S. 162, 169]\n\u00a0\n sarily had the same effect; the bank applied the value of the stock with the consent of the pledgeor, and thus vested the title in the bank.\n It is urged that although the indorsement upon the note in the form in which it was presented to Price's administrator recited credit as of June 18, 1894, being proceeds of a sale of the stock, there never was a sale in fact, and that the bank is not estopped by anything shown in the case from showing the true situation and the actual transaction between the parties.\n Conceding, for this purpose, that Price's representative could have insisted upon a strict performance of the power conferred in the authority given to the bank as to the disposition of the collateral, yet, if the representative of Price desired to do so, there was nothing to prevent him from waiving a strict compliance with the terms named, and permitting the bank to acquire title to the stock by crediting its value on the note. This is in fact what was done. Instead of selling the stock, the bank, in executing the authority conferred, indorsed what it deemed the value of the stock, as of the date of the credit, upon the note, and, reduced by the amount of this valuation, presented the note to the administrator of Price, who must have allowed the claim in this form, as it is specifically stated that the subsequent dividends upon the claim were paid to the bank. By this transaction, who became the real owner of the stock? Certainly not Otjen, for it is not contended that he was other than a mere holder of the stock as collateral security to the bank, without any beneficial interest. Price had died, and his representative had allowed the claim, showing the application of the value of the stock as a credit upon the note. If Price's representative could have objected to the form in which the bank liquidated the pledge, he did not do so, but accepted the bank's method of devesting him of title by allowing the claim with the credit upon it. The bank thus become the beneficial owner of the stock, and had the Hillsboro National Bank continued solvent it certainly could not \n\n[204 U.S. 162, 170]\n\u00a0\n have denied to the Ohio Valley Bank, after this transaction, the rights and privileges of a stockholder.\n As we have seen, this court, in construing the banking act, has not limited the liability to the registered stockholders. While the registered stockholders may be held liable to creditors regardless of the true ownership of the stock, and the pledgee of the stock, not appearing otherwise, is not liable, although the registered stockholder may be an irresponsible person of his choice, yet, where the real ownership of the stock is in one, his liability may be established, notwithstanding the registered ownership is in the name of a person, fictitious or otherwise, who holds for him.\n We think the Circuit Court of Appeals did not err in holding the bank, in view of the facts shown in the case, as the true owner and responsible shareholder of the stock in question.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","112":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nOLD DOMINION S. S. CO. v. GILMORE(1907)\nNo. 71\nArgued: December 13, 1907Decided: December 23, 1907\n\n\n\n\n[207 U.S. 398, 399]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Harrington Putnam, Henry E.

Long, and Hunt, Hill, & Betts for respondents. \n\n[207 U.S. 398, 402]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a proceeding for the limitation of liability of the steamship Hamilton in respect of a collision on the high seas with the steamship Saginaw, in which the Saginaw was sunk and her chief mate and some of her crew and passengers were drowned. It is found, and not disputed, that both vessels were to blame. Both vessels belonged to corporations of the state of Delaware. A statute of that state, after enacting that actions for injuries to the person shall not abate by reason of the plaintiff's death, provides that, 'whenever death shall be occasioned by unlawful violence or negligence, and no suit be brought by the party injured to recover damages during his or her life, the widow or widower of any such deceased person, or, if there be no widow or widower, the personal representatives, may maintain an action for and recover damages for the death and loss thus occasioned.' Act of January 26, 1886, as amended \n\n[207 U.S. 398, 403]\n\u00a0\n by act of March 9, 1901. Delaware Laws 1901, vol. 31, p. 500. On the strength of this statute the representatives of a passenger and of three of the crew filed claims, and the claims were allowed by the district court (see 134 Fed. 95, 139 Fed. 906) and afterwards by the circuit court of appeals (77 C. C. A. 150, 146 Fed. 724). A certiorari was granted by this court to settle the question, as stated by the petitioner, whether the Delaware statute applies to a claim for death on the high seas, arising purely from tort, in proceedings in admiralty. Incidentally the right of representatives of the crew of the Saginaw to recover their claims in full against the Hamilton also has been discussed.\n Apart from the subordination of the state of Delaware to the Constitution of the United States, there is no doubt that it would have had power to make its statute applicable to this case. When so applied, the statute governs the reciprocal liabilities of two corporations, existing only by virtue of the laws of Delaware, and permanently within its jurisdiction, for the consequences of conduct set in motion by them there, operating outside the territory of the state, it is true, but within no other territorial jurisdiction. If confined to corporations, the state would have power to enforce its law to the extent of their property in every case. But the same authority would exist as to citizens domiciled within the state, even when personally on the high seas, and not only could be enforced by the state in case of their return, which their domicil by its very meaning promised, but, in proper cases, would be recognized in other jurisdictions by the courts of other states. In short, the bare fact of the parties being outside the territory, in a place belonging to no other sovereign, would not limit the authority of the state, as accepted by civilized theory. No one doubts the power of England or France to govern their own ships upon the high seas.\n The first question, then, is narrowed to whether there is anything in the structure of the national government and under the Constitution of the United States that takes away \n\n[207 U.S. 398, 404]\n\u00a0\n or qualifies the authority that otherwise Delaware would possess,-a question that seems to have been considered doubtful in Butler v. Boston & S. S. S. Co. \n130 \nU.S. 527, 558\n, 32 S. L. ed. 1017, 1024, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 612. It has two branches: First, whether the state law is valid for any purpose; and, next, whether, if valid, it will be applied in the admiralty. We will take them up in order.\n The power of Congress to legislate upon the subject has been derived both from the power to regulate commerce and from the clause in the Constitution extending the judicial power to 'all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.' Art. 3,  2. \n130 U.S. 557\n. The doubt in this case arises as to the power of the states where Congress has remained silent.\n That doubt, however, cannot be serious. The grant of admiralty jurisdiction, followed and construed by the judiciary act of 1789 [1 Stat. at L. 77, chap. 20,  9], 'saving to suitors, in all cases, the right of a common-law remedy where the common law is competent to give it' (Rev. Stat .  563, cl. 8, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 457), leaves open the common- law jurisdiction of the state courts over torts committed at sea. This, we believe, always has been admitted. Martin v. Hunter, 1 Wheat. 304, 337, 4 L. ed. 97, 105; The Hine v. Trevor (The Ad. Hine v. Trevor) 4 Wall. 555, 571, 18 L. ed. 451, 456; Leon v. Galceran, 11 Wall. 185, 20 L. ed. 74; Manchester v. Massachusetts, \n139 \nU.S. 240, 262\n, 35 S. L. ed. 159, 166, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 559. And as the state courts in their decisions would follow their own notions about the law and might change them from time to time, it would be strange if the state might not make changes by its other mouthpiece, the legislature. The same argument that deduces the legislative power of Congress from the jurisdiction of the national courts, tends to establish the legislative power of the state where Congress has not acted. Accordingly, it has been held that a statute giving damages for death caused by a tort might be enforced in a state court, although the tort was committed at sea. American S. B. Co. v. Chase, 16 Wall. 522, 21 L. ed. 369. So far as the objection to the state law is founded on the admiralty clause in the Constitution, it would seem not to matter whether the accident happened near shore or in mid-ocean, notwithstanding some expressions of doubt. The same conclusion was reached in Mc- \n\n[207 U.S. 398, 405]\n\u00a0\n Donald v. Mallory, 77 N. Y. 546, 33 Am. Rep. 664, where the death occurred on the high seas. Sherlock v. Alling, \n93 U.S. 99\n, 23 L. ed. 819, reinforces Chase's Case, and answers any argument based on the power of Congress over commerce, as to which we hardly need refer also to Cooley v. Port Wardens, 12 How. 299, 13 L. ed. 996; Ex parte McNeil, 13 Wall. 236, 20 L. ed. 624; Wilson v. McNamee, \n102 U.S. 572\n, 26 L. ed. 234; and Homer Ramsdell Transp. Co. v. La Compagnie G en erale Transatlantique, \n182 U.S. 406\n, 45 L. ed. 1155, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 831, concerning state pilotage laws.\n The jurisdiction commonly expressed in the formula that a vessel at sea is regarded as part of the territory of the state was held, upon much consideration, to belong to Massachusetts, so far as to give preference to a judicial assignment in insolvency of such a vessel over an attachment levied immediately upon her arrival at New York, in Crapo v. Kelly, 16 Wall. 610, 21 L. ed. 430. That decision was regarded as necessitating the conclusion reached in McDonald v. Mallory, supra. Other instances of state regulation are mentioned in The City of Norwalk, 55 Fed. 98, 106; but without further recapitulation of the authorities, we are of opinion that the statute is valid. See Workman v. New York, \n179 \nU.S. 552, 563\n, 45 S. L. ed. 314, 321, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 212. We should add, what has been assumed thus far, as it had to be assumed in order to raise the question discussed, that we construe the statute as intended to govern all cases which it is competent to govern, or, at least, not to be confined to deaths occasioned on land. McDonald v. Mallory, supra. If it touches any case at sea, it controls this. See The Belgenland (The Belgenland v. Jensen) \n114 \nU.S. 355, 370\n, 29 S. L. ed. 152, 157, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 860. Whether it is to be taken to offer a similar liability of Delaware owners to foreign subjects (Mulhall v. Fallon, 176 Mass. 266. 54 L.R.A. 934, 79 Am. St. Rep. 309, 57 N. E. 386) need not be determined now.\n We pass to the other branch of the first question,-whether the state law, being valid, will be applied in the admiralty. Being valid, it created an obligatio,-a personal liability of the owner of the Hamilton to the claimants. Slater v. Mexican Nat. R. Co. \n194 \nU.S. 120, 126\n, 48 S. L. ed. 900, 902, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 581. This, of course, the admiralty would not disregard, but would respect the right when brought before it in any legitimate way. Ex parte Mc- \n\n[207 U.S. 398, 406]\n\u00a0\n Niel, 13 Wall. 236, 243, 20 L. ed. 624, 626. It might not give a proceeding in rem, since the statute does not purport to create a lien. It might give a proceeding in personam. The Corsair (Barton v. Brown) \n145 \nU.S. 335, 347\n, 36 S. L. ed. 727, 731, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 949. If it gave the latter, the result would not be, as suggested, to create different laws for different districts. The liability would be recognized in all. Nor would there be produced any lamentable lack of uniformity. Courts constantly enforce rights arising from and depending upon other laws than those governing the local transactions of the jurisdiction in which they sit. But we are not concerned with these considerations. In this case the statutes of the United States have enabled the owner to transfer its liability to a fund and to the exclusive jurisdiction of the admiralty, and it has done so. That fund is being distributed. In such circumstances all claims to which the admiralty does not deny existence must be recognized, whether admiralty liens or not. This is not only a general principle (Andrews v. Wall, 3 How. 568, 573, 11 L. ed. 729, 731; The J. E. Rumbell, \n148 \nU.S. 1, 15\n, 37 S. L. ed. 345, 348, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 498; admiralty rule 43; The Galam, 2 Moore P. C. C. N. S. 216, 236), but is the result of the statute which provides for, as well as limits, the liability, and allows it to be proved against the fund (The Albert Dumois, \n177 \nU.S. 240, 260\n, 44 S. L. ed. 751, 762, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 595. See Workman v. New York, \n179 \nU.S. 552, 563\n, 45 S. L. ed. 314, 321, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 212).\n The second question concerns the right of the representatives of the crew to recover their claims in full. There is a faint suggestion that the mate of the Saginaw was negligent; but on this point we shall not go behind the findings below. The main objection is that the statute allows a recovery beyond the maintenance and support which were declared in The Osceola, \n189 \nU.S. 158, 175\n, 47 S. L. ed. 760, 764, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 483, to be the limit of a seaman's rights against his own vessel when injured by the negligence of the master or a fellow servant on his ship. But the question here regards the liability of the Hamilton, another vessel. The contract between the seaman and the owners of the Saginaw does not affect the case. Erie R. Co. v. Erie & W. Transp. Co. \n204 \nU.S. 220, 226\n, 51 S. L. ed. 450, 453, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 246. Neither does the Harter act, even if its terms could be extended to personal injuries and loss of life.

Worthington for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[204 U.S. 8, 12]\n\u00a0\n No counsel for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an action in an Indiana court against the plaintiff in error upon a judgment against it in a Pennsylvania court. The decisive questions in the case have reference to the clause of the Constitution of the United States, requiring full faith and credit to be given in each state to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of other states, and, also, to the clause forbidding the deprivation by a state of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. There was a judgment for the plaintiffs, which was affirmed by the supreme court of the state.\n The questions before us arise out of facts now to be stated.\n On the 22d day of February, 1900, the defendants in error brought an action in the court of common pleas of Susquehanna county, Pennsylvania, against the Old Wayne Mutual Life Association of Indianapolis, an Indiana corporation, upon a certificate or policy of life insurance dated December 3d, 1897, whereby that association agreed to pay to Winnifred Herrity and Sarah McDonough, of Scranton, Pennsylvania, or their legal representatives, the sum of $5,000 upon the condition, among others, that if the person whose life was insured-Patrick McNally, of Scranton, Pennsylvania-should die within one year from the date of the certificate, then Herrity and McDonough should not receive more than one fourth of the above sum. McNally died on the 14th day of November, 1898\n\n\n A summons, addressed to the sheriff of Susquehanna county, Pennsylvania, was sued out and the following return thereof was made: 'Served the Old Wayne Mutual Life Association \n\n[204 U.S. 8, 13]\n\u00a0\n of Indianapolis, Indiana, an insurance company incorporated under the laws of the state of Indiana, by giving, September 26th, 1900, a true and attested copy of the within writ to Israel W. Durham, insurance commissioner for the state of Pennsylvania, and making known to him the contents thereof, the said association having no attorney in the state of Pennsylvania upon whom service could be made.' It does not appear, if the fact be material, that any notice of this summons was given by the commissioner to the defendant.\n Subsequently, the plaintiffs filed a declaration or statement in the Pennsylvania case, which contained, among other things, the following: 'That the said the Old Wayne Mutual Life Association of Indianapolis, Indiana, defendant, is a mutual life insurance association, foreign to the state of Pennsylvania, to wit: of the state of Indiana, as aforesaid, and as such has been doing business of life insurance in the state of Pennsylvania, more particularly in the counties of Susquehanna and Lackawanna, in said state of Pennsylvania, issuing policies of life insurance to numerous and divers residents of said counties and state for many years, upon application therefor taken in said counties of Susquehanna and Lackawanna, and was transacting such business of life insurance in said state and counties on the 3d day of December, 1897, and before and since till July 5th, 1900, and after. That the said the Old Wayne Mutual Life Association has no duly appointed agent in said county of Susquehanna, state of Pennsylvania, for the acceptance of service of process other than the commissioner of insurance of the state of Pennsylvania. The writ of summons in this action, duly issued by the court of common pleas of Susquehanna county, directing the said defendant, the Old Wayne Mutual Life Association of Indianapolis, Indiana, to appear and answer, was legally and duly served on the commissioner of insurance of the state of Pennsylvania on the 26th day of September, 1900, the said commissioner of insurance for the state of Pennsylvania being the proper person for service in this case.' \n\n[204 U.S. 8, 14]\n\u00a0\n This was followed by a notice in that case addressed to the insurance commissioner, and stating that judgment would be taken if no appearance was entered or an affidavit of defense filed by the association within fifteen days after service of that notice. At a later date, the insurance commissioner not having appeared, and no affidavit of defense having been filed, judgment was taken against the life association, by default, April 16th, 1901.\n The present action was brought on that judgment. The complaint in this case, filed June 21st, 1900, alleged that the defendant association was, on the 3d day of December, 1897, and long prior and subsequent thereto, engaged in the transaction of business in Pennsylvania. After setting out the provisions of the statute of Pennsylvania (to be presently referred to), the issuing of the policy, the death of McNally, and the making of the requisite proofs of loss, the complaint alleged that process in the Pennsylvania case was served upon the insurance commissioner for Pennsylvania, 'the said defendant having no other agent or attorney upon whom process could be served in said state of Pennsylvania.'\n The defendant demurred to the complaint as insufficient in law, but the demurrer was overruled. It then filed its answer, denying 'each and every material allegation' in the complaint. In a separate paragraph it alleged that its only offices for the transaction of business were, and at all times had been, at Indianapolis, Indiana, where its officers had always resided; that it had never been admitted to do business in Pennsylvania, and never had an office or agency there for the transaction of business; that no one of its officers or agents was in that commonwealth at the date of the alleged suit, nor had been there since; that no summons was ever served upon it at any time, and that it did not appear in that action; that no one ever appeared for it there who had authority to do so; and that the first notice or knowledge it ever had of the alleged judgment against it was long after the day when it appears to have been rendered. \n\n[204 U.S. 8, 15]\n\u00a0\n The plaintiffs replied, denying each and every material allegation of the answer.\n The plaintiff in error insists that the Pennsylvania court had no jurisdiction to proceed against it; consequently the judgment it rendered was void for the want of the due process of law required by the 14th Amendment. If the defendant had no such actual, legal notice of the Pennsylvania suit as would bring it into court, or if it did not voluntarily appear therein by an authorized representative, then the Pennsylvania court was without jurisdiction, and the conclusion just stated would follow, even if the judgment would be deemed conclusive in the courts of that commonwealth. The constitutional requirement that full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other state is necessarily to be interpreted in connection with other provisions of the Constitution, and therefore no state can obtain in the tribunals of other jurisdictions full faith and credit for its judicial proceedings if they are wanting in the due process of law enjoined by the fundamental law. 'No judgment of a court is due process of law, if rendered without jurisdiction in the court, or without notice to the party.' Scott v. McNeal, \n154 \nU.S. 34, 46\n, 38 S. L. ed. 896, 901, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1108. No state can, by any tribunal or representative, render nugatory a provision of the supreme law. And if the conclusiveness of a judgment of decree in a court of one state is questioned in a court of another government, Federal or state, it is open, under proper averments, to inquire whether the court rendering the decree or judgment had jurisdiction to render it.\n Such is the settled doctrine of this court. In the leading case of Thompson v. Whitman, 18 Wall. 457, 468, 21 L. ed. 897, 901, the whole question was fully examined in the light of the authorities. Mr. Justice Bradley, speaking for the court and delivering its unanimous judgment, stated the conclusion to be clear that the jurisdiction of a court rendering judgment in one state may be questioned in a collateral proceeding in another state, \n\n[204 U.S. 8, 16]\n\u00a0\n notwithstanding the averments in the record of the judgment itself. The court, among other things, said that if it be once conceded that 'the validity of a judgment may be attacked collaterally by evidence showing that the court had no jurisdiction, it is not perceived how any allegation contained in the record itself, however strongly made, can affect the right so to question it. The very object of the evidence is to invalidate the paper as a record. If that can be successfully done no statements contained therein have any force. If any such statements could be used to prevent inquiry, a slight form of words might always be adopted so as effectually to nullify the right of such inquiry. Recitals of this kind must be regarded like asseverations of good faith in a deed, which avail nothing if the instrument is shown to be fraudulent.' This decision was in harmony with previous decisions. Chief Justice Marshall had long before observed in Rose v. Himely, 4 Cranch, 241, 269, 2 L. ed. 608, 617, that, upon principle, the operation of every judgment must depend on the power of the court to render that judgment. In Williamson v. Berry, 8 How. 495, 540, 12 L. ed. 1170, 1189, it was said to be well settled that the jurisdiction of any court exercising authority over a subject 'may be inquired into in every other court when the proceedings in the former are relied upon and brought before the latter by a party claiming the benefit of such proceedings,' and that the rule prevails whether 'the decree or judgment has been given in a court of admiralty, chancery, ecclesiastical court, or court of common law, or whether the point ruled has arisen under the laws of nations, the practice in chancery, or the municipal laws of states.' In his Commentaries on the Constitution, Story,  1313, referring to Mills v. Duryee, 7 Cranch, 481, 484, 3 L. ed. 411, 413, and to the constitutional requirement as to the faith and credit to be given to the records and judicial proceedings of a state, said: \"But this does not prevent an inquiry into the jurisdiction of the court in which the original judgment was given, to pronounce it; or the right of the state itself to exercise authority over the person or the subject-matter. The Con- \n\n[204 U.S. 8, 17]\n\u00a0\n stitution did not mean to confer [upon the states] a new power or jurisdiction, but simply to regulate the effect of the acknowledged jurisdiction over persons and things within the territory.\" In the later case of Galpin v. Page, 18 Wall. 350, 365, 366, 368, 21 L. ed. 959, 962, 963,-decided after, but at the same term as, Thompson v. Whitman,-the court, after referring to the general rule as to the presumption of jurisdiction in superior courts of general jurisdiction, said that such presumptions 'only arise with respect to jurisdictional facts concerning which the record is silent. Presumptions are only indulged to supply the absence of evidence or averments respecting the facts presumed. They have no place for consideration when the evidence is disclosed or the averment is made. When, therefore, the record states the evidence or makes an averment with reference to a jurisdictional fact, it will be understood to speak the truth on that point, and it will not be presumed that there was other or different evidence respecting the fact, or that the fact was otherwise than as averred.' In the same case: 'It is a rule as old as the law, and never more to be respected than now, that no one shall be personally bound until he has had his day in court; by which is meant until he has been duly cited to appear, and has been afforded an opportunity to be heard. Judgment without such citation and opportunity wants all the attributes of a judicial determination; it is judicial usurpation and oppression, and never can be upheld where justice is justly administered.'\n The question of the jurisdiction of the Pennsylvania court being, then, open, on this record, let us see what presumptions arise from the showing made by it.\n The complaint in this case, as we have seen, alleged that on the 3d day of December, 1897,-the date of the insurance certificate.-as 1897,-the date of the insurance certificate,-as well as prior and subsequent thereto, the defendant association engaged in business in Pennsylvania, soliciting applications for insurance and issuing policies to residents of that commonwealth. The answer denied each and every material allegation in the complaint, and such a \n\n[204 U.S. 8, 18]\n\u00a0\n denial under the Indiana Code of Civil Procedure was sufficient to put the plaintiffs upon proof of every fact that was essential in establishing their cause of action. Thornton's Code Ind. art. 10,  47, title 'Pleadings;' U. S. Rev. Stat.  914, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 684.\n The burden of proof was therefore upon the plaintiffs to show by what authority the Pennsylvania court could legally enter a personal judgment against a corporation which, according to the complaint itself, was a corporation of another state, and was not alleged to have appeared in person or by an attorney of its own selection, or to have been personally served with process. This burden the plaintiffs met by introducing in evidence a complete transcript of the record of the action in the Pennsylvania court, from which it appeared: 1. That the defendant association was sued in the Pennsylvania court as a life insurance association of Indiana, was alleged to have been engaged in business in Pennsylvania, and was so engaged before and after the certificate of insurance in question was issued. 2. That the summons in that action was served on the commissioner of insurance for Pennsylvania, the defendant association not having appointed an agent in that commonwealth upon whom process could be served nor having appeared by an attorney or representative. 3. That, the insurance commissioner not having appeared in the action, judgment was taken against the defendant; and that is the judgment here in suit.\n It was further made to appear in the present action that when the contract of insurance was executed, as well as before and since, it was provided by a statute of Pennsylvania, approved June 20th, 1883, amendatory of a previous statute of that commonwealth establishing an insurance department, as follows: 'No insurance company not of this state, nor its agents, shall do business in this state until it has filed with the insurance commissioner of this state a written stipulation, duly authenticated by the company, agreeing that any legal process affecting the company, served on the insurance commissioner, or the party designated by \n\n[204 U.S. 8, 19]\n\u00a0\n him, or the agent specified by the company to receive service of process for said company, shall have the same effect as if served personally on the company within this state, and, if such company should cease to maintain such agent in this state so designated, such process may thereafter be served on the insurance commissioner; but, so long, as any liability of the stipulating company to any resident of this state continues, such stipulation cannot be revoked or modified, except that a new one may be substituted, so as to require or dispense with the service at the office of the said company within this state, and that such service of process according to this stipulation shall be sufficient personal service on the company. The term 'process' shall be construed to mean and include any and every writ, rule, order, notice, or decree, including any process of execution that may issue in or upon any action, suit, or legal proceeding to which said company may be a party by themselves, or jointly with others, whether the same shall arise upon a policy of insurance or otherwise, by or in any other court of this commonwealth having jurisdiction of the subject-matter in controversy, . . . and, in default of an agent appointed by the company, as aforesaid, then the officer so charged with the service of said process shall, in like manner, deputize the sheriff, constable, or other officer aforesaid of the county where the agent, if any there be, named by the insurance commissioner, may reside, to serve the same on him, and, in default of such agent named by such commissioner, as aforesaid, then in like manner to deputize the sheriff, constable, or other officer, as aforesaid, of the county where the office of the insurance commissioner may be located, to serve the same on him; and each and every service so made shall have the same force and effect, to all intents and purposes, as personal service on said company in the county where said process issued; . . .'\n The defendant association introduced no evidence. If, looking alone at the pleadings in the Pennsylvania suit, it be taken that, at the time of the contract in question, the \n\n[204 U.S. 8, 20]\n\u00a0\n Indiana corporation was engaged in transacting, at least some business in Pennsylvania, without having complied with the provisions of the above statute of that commonwealty,-that is, without having filed with the insurance commissioner the written stipulation required by that statute,- still, plaintiffs cannot claim, on the present record, the full benefit of the general rule that the judgment of a court of superior authority, when proceeding within the general scope of its powers, is presumed to act rightly within its jurisdiction; that nothing shall be 'intended to be out of the jurisdiction of a superior court but that which specially appears to be so.' Peacock v. Bell, 1 Wms' Saund. 74. When a judgment of a court of superior authority is attacked collaterally for the want of jurisdiction, such a presumption cannot be indulged when it affirmatively appears from the pleadings or evidence that jurisdiction was wanting. We make this observation in view of the fact, distinctly shown by the plaintiffs themselves, that the policy of insurance and contract in question was, in fact, executed in Indiana, and not in Pennsylvaina. The policy sued on provided as one of its conditions that 'for all purposes and in all cases this contract shall be deemed to have been made at the special office of this association in the state of Indiana, U. S. A., and all benefits and claims thereunder shall be payable at such office.' Besides, to the complaint or petition in the Pennsylvania court was appended the following memorandum signed by the attorney for the plaintiffs: 'The above contract of insurance is governed by the laws of the state of Indiana, the contract having been entered into at Indianapolis.' And when the suit was brought in Pennsylvania the plaintiffs were confronted with the condition in the policy that 'it is expressly understood and agreed that no action shall be maintained nor recovery had for any claims under or in virtue of this policy, after the lapse of six months from the death of said member,'-McNally. More than six months had elapsed after McNally's death before the suit was instituted in Pennsylvania. In order to obviate this difficulty the plaintiffs, in \n\n[204 U.S. 8, 21]\n\u00a0\n their declaration or statement in assumpsit, in the Pennsylvania court, alleged that the contract of insurance was governed by the laws of Indiana, 'the contract having been entered into at Indianapolis, Indiana;' also, that 'said policy of insurance and the contract touching the issuing the same were executed in the state of Indiana, in which state all provisions limiting liability on policies where suit is not brought within a certain time are held void and of no account.' The plaintiffs cannot, therefore, be heard now to say that the contract was not, in fact, made in Indiana. What they alleged in the Pennsylvania suit precluded the idea that the contract of insurance was made in that commonwealth. Indeed, if they had alleged that the business was transacted in Pennsylvania, their action on the contract would have been defeated by the condition in the policy that no suit thereon could be brought on it after the expiration of six months from the death of the person whose life was insured.\n But even if it be assumed that the insurance company was engaged in some business in Pennsylvania at the time the contract in question was made, it cannot be held that the company agreed that service of process upon the insurance commissioner of that commonwealth would alone be sufficient to bring it into court in respect of all business transacted by it, no matter where, with, or for the benefit of, citizens of Pennsylvania. Undoubtedly, it was competent for Pennsylvania to declare that no insurance corporation should transact business within its limits without filing the written stipulation specified in its statute. Lafayette Ins. Co. v. French, 18 How. 404, 15 L. ed. 451; Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168, 19 L. ed. 357; Hooper v. California, \n155 \nU.S. 648, 653\n, 39 S. L. ed. 297, 300, 5 Inters. Com. Rep. 610, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 207, and authorities cited; Waters- Pierce Oil Co. v. Texas, \n177 \nU.S. 28, 45\n, 44 S. L. ed. 657, 664, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 518. It is equally true that, if an insurance corporation of another state transacts business in Pennsylvania without complying with its provisions, it will be deemed to have assented to any valid terms prescribed by that commonwealth as a condition of its right to do business there; and it will be estopped to say that it had not done what it should \n\n[204 U.S. 8, 22]\n\u00a0\n have done in order that it might lawfully enter that commonwealth and there exert its corporate powers. In Baltimore & O. R. Co. v. Harris, 12 Wall. 65, 20 L. ed. 354, the question was as to the jurisdiction of the supreme court of the District of Columbia of a suit against a corporation in Maryland, whose railroad entered the District with the consent of Congress. This court said: 'It [the corporation] cannot migrate, but may exercise its authority in a foreign territory upon such conditions as may be prescribed by the law of the place. One of these conditions may be that it shall consent to be sued there. If it do business there it will be presumed to have assented, and will be bound accordingly.' This language was cited and approved in Chicago & N. W. R. Co. v. Whitton, 13 Wall. 270, 285, 20 L. ed. 571, 576. The same question was before the court in Ex parte Schollenberger, \n96 \nU.S. 369, 376\n, 24 S. L. ed. 853, 854, and the principle announced in the Harris and Whitton Cases was approved. In the Schollenberger Case the Pennsylvania statute here in question was involved. To the same effect are the following cases: Ehrman v. Teutonia Ins. Co. 1 McCrary, 123, 129, 1 Fed. 471; Knapp, S. & Co. v. National Mut. F. Ins. Co. 30 Fed. 607; Berry v. Knights Templars' & M. Life Indemnity Co. 46 Fed. 439, 441, 442; Diamond Plate Glass Co. v. Minneapolis Mut. F. Ins. Co. 55 Fed. 27; Stewart v. Harmon, 98 Fed. 190, 192.\n Conceding, then, that by going into Pennsylvania, without first complying with its statute, the defendant association may be held to have assented to the service upon the insurance commissioner of process in a suit brought against it there in respect of business transacted by it in that commonwealth, such assent cannot properly be implied where it affirmatively appears, as it does here, that the business was not transacted in Pennsylvania. Indeed the Pennsylvania statute, upon its face, is only directed against insurance companies who do business in that commonwealth,-'in this state.' While the highest considerations of public policy demand that an insurance corporation, entering a state in defiance of a statute \n\n[204 U.S. 8, 23]\n\u00a0\n which lawfully prescribes the terms upon which it may exert its powers there, should be held to have assented to such terms as to business there transacted by it, it would be going very far to imply, and we do not imply, such assent as to business transacted in another state, although citizens of the former state may be interested in such business.\n As the suit in the Pennsylvania court was upon a contract executed in Indiana; as the personal judgment in that court against the Indiana corporation was only upon notice to the insurance commissioner, without any legal notice to the defendant association, and without its having appeared in person or by attorney or by agent in the suit; and as the act of the Pennsylvania court in rendering the judgment must be deemed that of the state within the meaning of the 14th Amendment, -we hold that the judgment in Pennsylvania was not entitled to the faith and credit which, by the Constitution, is required to be given to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of the several states, and was void as wanting in due process of law.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of Indiana must, therefore, be reversed, with directions for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n Ex parte Virginia, \n100 \nU.S. 339, 346\n, 347 S., 25 L. ed. 676-680; Neal v.

Granbery for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a bill to set aside a lease made by former trustees of Carrick Academy to the trustees of the Winchester Normal College, in pursuance of an act of the general assembly of Tennessee, authorizing the letting of the academy property to said lessees. The bill alleged that the act was contrary to the Constitution of the state for various reasons, but said nothing of the Constitution of the United States, and in no way implied a reliance upon any of its terms. An act of Congress of April 18, 1806 [2 Stat. at L. 381, chap. 31], was referred to, but was not alleged to be contravened. The defendants demurred, and the demurrer, after being overruled by the court of chancery appeals, was sustained by the supreme court of the state. 112 Tenn. 483, 80 S. W. 64. The case then was brought here by writ of error, and was argued both on the merits and upon a motion to dismiss.\n The assignment of errors sets up that the above-mentioned state law impairs the obligation of contracts, contrary to the Constitution of the United States, although it does not show definitely what contract, or how that contained in the charter of Carrick Academy is impaired. It sets up, also, that the act is repugnant to the act of Congress of April 18, 1806; and it alleges that the plaintiffs in error specially set up and claimed their rights in these respects in the chancery court of the state.\n To show that the Constitution of the United States was relied upon below, the plaintiffs in error refer to passages in the opinions of the court of chancery appeals and the supreme court, in which Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 4 Wheat. 518, 4 L. ed. 629, was discussed, as establishing the point. But we are \n\n[204 U.S. 565, 568]\n\u00a0\n unable to see that those passages prove the fact. The court of chancery appeals states the violations of the state Constitution set up in the bill, summarizes the questions presented by the bill and demurrer, and then addresses itself to answering those questions, suggesting no others, and saying nothing about the Constitution of the United States. After a statement of historical facts, it says that if the act authorizing the lease is constitutional, and the subject-matter of the act was under the control of the state, the case is at an end. If Carrick Academy is a public corporation, the state is assumed to have control. If it is a private corporation, the state Constitution is assumed to invalidate the statute by one of the clauses set up in the bill. The judge, speaking for himself, would regard the academy as a public corporation, but he yields to the weight of the decision in the Dartmouth College Case, or, at least, to the principle of that case, according to which, as he conceives, the academy is a private corporation, and therefore exempt from a diversion from its original charter purposes, such as the act authorizing the lease is assumed to effect. The objections to such a diversion that he is considering are those that he has stated as presented by the bill. The supreme court, after stating the nature of the corporation and the relations and course of dealing of the state with it, and citing cases to prove that Carrick Academy is a public agency, refers to the decision below and the citation there of the Dartmouth College Case only in order to show that that case was misapplied.\n But the plaintiffs in error say further that the question of their rights under the Constitution of the United States necessarily was involved in a decision upon the bill, and that that is enough when the validity of a state law is concerned. Columbia Water Power Co. v. Columbia Electric Street R. Light & P. Co. \n172 \nU.S. 475, 488\n, 43 S. L. ed. 521, 525, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 247; McCullough v. Virginia, \n172 \nU.S. 102, 117\n, 43 S. L. ed. 382, 387, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 134. These and similar cases, however, are not to be pressed to the point that, whenever it appears that the state law logically might have been assailed as invalid \n\n[204 U.S. 565, 569]\n\u00a0\n under the Constitution of the United States, upon grounds more or less similar to those actually taken, the question is open. If a case is carried through the state courts upon arguments drawn from the state Constitution alone, the defeated party cannot try his chances here merely by suggesting for the first time when he takes his writ of error that the decision is wrong under the Constitution of the United States. Crowell v. Randell, 10 Pet. 368, 398, 9 L. ed. 458, 470; Simmerman v. Nebraska, \n116 U.S. 54\n, 29 L. ed. 535, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 333; Hagar v. California, \n154 U.S. 639\n, 24 L. ed. 1044, 14 Sup. Ct.

Rep. 635.\n We are the less uneasy at the conclusion to which we are forced, that we do not apprehend that the statute of Tennessee is invalid for the reason now put forward. That reason is that the general assembly of the state had no authority to authorize the taking of the property of this corporation for the private use of another. This objection might be urged with some force, perhaps, to the lease that was made. But the statute, which alone could be brought in question here, merely authorized the trustees of Carrick Academy to let the academy property to the trustees of the Winchester Normal College for not more than fifty years, and required the trustees of the college to keep the property in good condition and free from debt or encumbrance, if the lease was made. It said nothing about terms. It left the academy free. There was no taking of property, but, at most, an authority to change an investment. So far as the act shows on its face, which is all that we have before us, it might have contemplated a lease of the present grounds merely as a means to keeping up the academy with increased resources in a better place elsewhere.\n Writ of error dismissed. \n\n\n\n","115":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nOZAN LUMBER CO. v. UNION COUNTY NAT BANK OF LIBERTY, IND(1907)\nNo. 37\nArgued: Decided: December 2, 1907\n\n\n\n\n[207 U.S. 251, 252]\n\u00a0\n This case comes here upon certiorari directed to the circuit court of appeals for the eighth circuit. The action was commenced in the United States circuit court for the western district of Arkansas, upon certain promissory notes, which the defendant, the Ozan Lumber Company, in its answer alleged had been given by it in payment for a patented article, such notes not being executed upon a printed form, showing they were given in consideration of a patented machine, as required by the statute of Arkansas. Kirby's Digest Laws of Arkansas,  513 to 516, inclusive.\n A demurrer to the defense was interposed on the ground that it did not state facts constituting a defense. The circuit court sustained the demurrer, because, as it held, the act was in violation of the 14th Amendment, as denying to the plaintiff the equal protection of the laws. 127 Fed. 206. The case was taken by writ of error to the circuit court of appeals, where the judgment was affirmed for the reason that the act was an illegal discrimination against patented articles. 76 C. C. A. 218, 145 Fed. 344. The application by defendant for a certiorari to review that judgment was granted.\n Messrs. U. M. Rose and Thomas C. McRae for petitioner.\n\n\n[207 U.S. 251, 253]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Morris M. Cohn for respondent.\n\n\n\n[207 U.S. 251, 254]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The validity of this very statute of Arkansas (at least, until Congress legislates upon the subject) has already been affirmed by this court (Woods v. Carl, \n203 U.S. 358\n, 51 L. ed. 219, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 99), and the validity of statutes of a somewhat similar nature has also been affirmed in the case of Allen v. Riley, \n203 U.S. 347\n, 51 L. ed. 216, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 95, immediately preceding the case above cited.\n It is sought to avoid the authority of our decision upon this Arkansas statute by asserting that nothing was therein decided except the validity of the 1st section of the act, and that the validity of the act when considered in connection with the 4th section was not argued or decided. The 4th section reads as follows: 'This act shall not apply to merchants and dealers who sell patented things in the usual course of business.' Other reasons for an affirmance are set up in the brief of respondent.\n The grounds given for the decision by the circuit court and the circuit court of appeals differ somewhat. The circuit court says that the effect of the 4th section of the statute is to violate that portion of the 14th Amendment to the Federal Constitution which provides that no state shall \n\n[207 U.S. 251, 255]\n\u00a0\n deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws; while the circuit court of appeals bases its judgment upon the unlawful discrimination evidenced by the act against those who are protected by a patent granted by the United States.\n In \n203 U.S. 358\n (supra) this court held the statute valid as against an objection of the same nature as that taken herein by the circuit court of appeals. Our decision in that case had not been made at the time of the decision of this case in the courts below. The ground taken by the circuit court was not discussed in our opinion in 203 U. S., and although it might be urged that all objections to its validity arising upon the face of the statute, even if not specially discussed, were overruled by the decision, yet, assuming that the particular question now presented is still open in this court, we are of opinion that the exception contained in  4 does not render the statute invalid. The plain purpose of the whole statute is to create and enforce a proper police regulation. Its passage showed that the legislature was of opinion that fraud and imposition were frequent in the sale of property of this nature, except in the cases mentioned in  4, and that temptations to false representations in regard to the virtues and value of the article sold were also frequently yielded to. When the sale of the article was effected by such representations, and a note given for the amount of the sale, a transfer of the note to a bona fide purchaser for value before its maturity prevented the vendee from showing the fraud by which the sale had been accomplished. In order to reach such a transaction and to permit the vendee to show the fraud, the statute was passed. It was doubtless thought that merchants and dealers, as mentioned in the statute, while dealing with the patented things in the manner stated, would not be so likely to make representations or to engage in a fraud to effect a sale, as those covered by the statute. The various itinerant venders of patented articles, whose fluency of speech and carelessness regarding the truth of their representations might almost be said to have \n\n[207 U.S. 251, 256]\n\u00a0\n become proverbial, were, of course, in the mind of the legislature, and were included in this legislation. Indeed, they are the principal people to be affected by it.\n The manufacturer of a patented article, who also sells it in the usual course of business in his store or factory, would probably come within the exception of  4. He may be none the less a dealer, selling in the usual course of his business, because he is also a manufacturer of the article dealt in. Exceptional and rare cases, not arising out of the sale of patented things in the ordinary way, may be imagined where this general classification separating the merchants and dealers from the rest of the people might be regarded as not sufficiently comprehensive, because in such unforeseen, unusual, and exceptional cases the people affected by the statute ought, in strictness, to have been included in the exception. See opinion of circuit court herein, 127 Fed., supra. But we do not think the statute should be condemned on that account. It is because such imaginary and unforeseen cases are so rare and exceptional as to have been overlooked that the general classification ought not to be rendered invalid. In such case there is really no substantial denial of the equal protection of the laws within the meaning of the Amendment.\n It is almost impossible, in some matters, to foresee and provide for every imaginable and exceptional case, and a legislature ought not to be required to do so at the risk of having its legislation declared void, although appropriate and proper upon the general subject upon which such legislation is to act, so long as there is no substantial and fair ground to say that the statute makes an unreasonable and unfounded general classification, and thereby denies to any person the equal protection of the laws. In a classification for governmental purposes there cannot be an exact exclusion or inclusion of persons and things. See Gulf, C. & S. F. R. Co. v. Ellis, \n165 U.S. 150\n, 41 L. ed. 666, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 255, and cases cited; Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. v. May, \n194 U.S. 267\n, 48 L. ed. 971, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. We can see reasons for excepting merchants and dealers who sell patented things, in the usual course of business, from the provisions of the statute, \n\n[207 U.S. 251, 257]\n\u00a0\n and we think the failure to exempt some few others, as above suggested, ought not to render the whole statute void as resulting in an unjust and unreasonable discrimination.\n The case of Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co. \n184 U.S. 540\n, 46 L. ed. 679, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 431, one of the cases cited by the circuit court, is not, in our opinion, applicable. The statute did not apply to agricultural products or live stock while in the hands of the producer or raiser. It was held that this exemption rendered the statute void, as denying to persons within the jurisdiction of the state the equal protection of the laws. The statute was held to create a classification of an arbitrary nature, applicable to large numbers of people, and yet not based upon any reasonable ground. Those who were exempted from its provisions were numerous and stood practically in the same relation to the subject-matter of the statute as did the other class upon whom the statute acted, and no valid reason could be given why, if one were included, the other should be exempted. The same reasons applied to all the classes, and should have led to the same results with regard to all. There was no room for a proper or fair discrimination.\n We think there is a distinction, founded upon fair reasoning, which upholds the principle of exemption as contained in the 4th section, and that, consequently, the statute does not violate the 14th Amendment on the ground stated.\n The case was decided by the courts below solely upon constitutional grounds, and upon those grounds the decision cannot rest. It must, therefore, be remanded, and if there be any other facts to be urged they can be presented on another trial.\n The judgments of the Circuit Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals must be reversed and the case remanded to the Circuit Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","116":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPARAISO v. U S(1907)\nNo. 23\nArgued: Decided: December 16, 1907\n\n\n\n\n[207 U.S. 368, 369]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Aldis B. Browne and Alexander Britton for plaintiff in error.\n Solicitor General Hoyt and Assistant Attorney General Russell for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n The plaintiff in error was convicted of falsification of documents, under article 300, subdivisions 4, 7 of the Philippine Penal Code. He brings the case here as one in which a statute of the United States is involved, under the act of July 1, 1902, chap. 1369,  10. 32 Stat. at L. 695, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1907, p. 214. By the article mentioned a public official is subjected to imprisonment and fine if he commits a falsification, clause 4, 'by perverting the truth in the narration of facts,' or, clause 7, 'by giving out an authentic copy of a fictitious document, or by stating therein a contrary or different thing from that contained in the genuine original.' It is assigned as error that the plaintiff in error was required to answer without being advised of the nature and cause of the accusation against him, and that he was convicted without due process of law. It is argued further, although not assigned as error, that the sentence inflicted a cruel and unusual punishment, by reason of the amount of the fine and the length of the term of imprisonment; and still further, that the fine was greater than that which the statute imposed, all contrary to the Philippine Bill of Rights. Act of July 1, 1902, chap. 1369,  5. 32 Stat. at L. 691, 692.\n There is no suggestion in the record that any of these ques- \n\n[207 U.S. 368, 370]\n\u00a0\n tions were raised at any stage below, except in an agreement of counsel that the full record showed that before any evidence was received the plaintiff in error asked leave to withdraw his plea of not guilty and substitute the statement that he did not know how to plead, which was denied, and that he objected to the reception of any evidence in support of the complaint, because it was incapable of being sustained by evidence, which objection was overruled. There was a motion for rehearing, on the grounds set out in the assignment of error, but, as the motion was denied, that cannot be relied upon here. See McMillen v. Ferrum Min. Co. \n197 U.S. 343\n, 49 L. ed. 784, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 533. It would be going far in allowance for different habits of thought and action, to treat what was done as equivalent to a demurrer. The court below does not so interpret it, but says that no exception was taken to the sufficiency of the complaint. It would be going farther to treat it as setting up the Philippine Bill of Rights in analogy to a claim of constitutional rights in a circuit court of the United States. If a case is brought up from the circuit court on the ground that it involves the construction or application of the Constitution of the United States, the record must show that the question was raised for the consideration of the court below. Carey v. Houston & T. C. R. Co. \n150 \nU.S. 170, 181\n, 37 S. L. ed. 1041, 1044, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 63; Ansbro v. United States, \n159 U.S. 695\n, 40 L. ed. 310, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 187; Cornell v. Green, \n163 \nU.S. 75, 78\n, 41 S. L. ed. 76, 77, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 969; Cincinnati, H. & D. R. Co. v. Thiebaud, \n177 \nU.S. 615, 619\n, 620 S., 44 L. ed. 911-913, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 822; Arkansas v. Schlierholz, \n179 U.S. 598\n, 45 L. ed. 335, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 229. The most that could be gathered from this record is that the plaintiff in error contended that the complaint was bad by the rules of criminal pleading. See Cornell v. Green, \n163 \nU.S. 75, 79\n, 41 S. L. ed. 76, 77, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 969. There was no hint that he relied on the Bill of Rights or contended that the complaint would not satisfy that. The Bill of Rights, in all probability, was an afterthought when everything else had failed.\n Our consideration of the case properly might stop here. But, as the rule laid down probably was not well known, we will add that we find nothing in the errors assigned. The com- \n\n[207 U.S. 368, 371]\n\u00a0\n plaint, however open it might be to criticism on demurrer, supposing the strict rules of the old common law should be applied, would leave no doubt in the mind of any person of rudimentary intelligence that it meant to charge the defendant with falsely entering on the stubs of certain specified tax certificates smaller sums than those shown by the certificates and actually received by him, and with altering such stubs to lower sums, with intent of gain; that is to say, with intent to settle his accounts as a public officer on the showing that less was due than was due in fact, contrary to article 300, clauses 4, 6, and 7 of the Penal Code. If the Philippine Code had sanc- \n\n[207 U.S. 368, 372]\n\u00a0\n tioned this form, it is extravagant to contend that the enactment would have been void under the laws of the United States. Yet that is a test. See Missouri v. Dockery, \n191 \nU.S. 165, 171\n, 48 S. L. ed. 133, 134, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 53. The Bill of Rights for the Philippines, giving the accused the right to demand the nature and cause of the accusation against him, does not fasten forever upon those islands the inability of the seventeenth century common law to understand stand or accept a pleading that did not exclude every misinterpretation capable of occurring to intelligence fired with a desire to pervert.\n We do not feel called upon to consider errors not assigned. See O'Neil v. Vermont, \n144 \nU.S. 323, 331\n, 36 S. L. ed. 450, 455, 12 Sup. Ct.

It further appears from the abstract submitted by him that the amount received was $2.00, thus defrauding the government to his personal advantage and gain.\n That at different times during the year 1904, in his capacity as municipal treasurer of the town of Lumbang, Laguna, he issued registration tax certificates to the following persons under the following numbers:\n Eduardo Llantos, No. 481,053; Damaso Garcia, No. 481,044; Apolinario Almario, No. 339,727; Cenon Labra, No. 339,899; Pablo Cristobal, No. 339, 897; Luis Abi, No. 339,877; Leon Mondes, No. 339,852; Luis Valdomora, No. 339,848; Gregorio Mulingbayan, No. 339,846; Filemon Mercado, No. 339,840; Pablo Samonte, No. 339,795; Mariano Magano, No. 339,785; Vicente Valdeavella, No. 339,783; Juan Wadis, No. 339,763; Mateo Laguartilla, No. 339,744; Faustino Rosales, No. 339,707; Deogracias Babia, No. 339,701; Dionisio Abad, No. 339,694; Eduardo Ramillosa, No. 339,673; Monico Abad, No. 339,660; Conrado Lagunda, No. 339,632; Juan Tablico, No. 339,605; Ubaldo Mercado, No. 339,541; Juan Puhauan, No. 339,510; Antonio Eborda, No. 339,379; Cirilia del Castillo, No. 339,375; Valeriano de Ramos, No. 339, 341; Mateo Pacoma, No. 339,313; Mariano Valdeavella, No. 339,491; Benedicto Valdeavella, No. 339,490; Juan Mercado, No. 339,477; Epifanio Vellestro, No. 339,445; Marcelino Cabalsa, No. 339,499; Marcelo Tabirao, No. 339,905; Placido Macadagay, No. 339,837; Juan Valeavella, No. 339,604; Bernabe Yamballa, No. 339,558; Leon Abi, No. 339,540; upon which said certificates there appear to have been entered and collected by the accused larger amounts than those shown on their corresponding stubs after he had settled his accounts with the provincial treasurer; and that the said stubs, or most of them, contain erasures, changes, and alterations, all of which said acts are punishable under paragraphs 4, 6, and 7 of  300 of the Penal Code, relating to the crime of falsification, for the purpose of gain.\n\n\n\n\n\n","117":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPATCH v. WABASH R. CO.(1907)\nNo. 57\nArgued: November 15, 1907Decided: December 2, 1907\n\n\n\n Mr. George C. Otto for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[207 U.S. 277, 279]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Frederic D. McKenney and Wells H. Blodgett for defendant in error. \n\n[207 U.S. 277, 280]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This was an action brought by the plaintiff in error to recover for the death of his intestate in a collision upon the defendant's railroad in Illinois. The action was begun in a court of the state and the defendant forthwith filed a petition for the removal of the cause to the United States circuit court. The petition averred, among other things, that the defendant was a corporation organized under the laws of Ohio, and a citizen of that state, and was not a resident of Illinois, and that the plaintiff was a citizen and resident of Illinois. The removal was ordered and completed. Thereupon the plaintiff filed in the United States court a plea, in which he alleged that the defendant was a corporation organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of Illinois, Missouri, Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio, by the consolidation of five other corporations, severally created by the laws of those states respectively, that the defendant was a citizen of and resident in Illinois and each of said other states, and that the plaintiff was a citizen of Ohio; and the plaintiff prayed judgment whether the court could take cognizance of the action.\n The defendant, after having pleaded the general issue to the action, demurred to the plaintiff's plea. Upon a hearing the demurrer was sustained, and the plaintiff electing to stand by his plea, a judgment was entered that the defendant recover its costs. The plaintiff prayed a writ of error, and the judge \n\n[207 U.S. 277, 281]\n\u00a0\n certified that the judgment was based solely on the ground that the controversy was one between citizens of different states, that in his opinion the record showed that the defendant was not a citizen of or resident in Illinois, that no other ground of jurisdiction appeared, and that jurisdiction was retained only for the reasons stated. A few days later, but after the writ of error had been taken out and filed, and after a new term of the circuit court had begun, the judge undertook to amend the certificate on the ground that it had been signed inadvertently, under a mistake as to its nature and contents, and to certify instead that the question of jurisdiction was not passed upon, but that the ground of the decision was that the plaintiff, being a citizen of Ohio, and therefore presumed not to be a resident of Illinois, was forbidden by the statutes of Illinois to act as administrator, and therefore had no standing to maintain the action or file the plea.\n It is obvious that the mistake alleged by the new certificate was not clerical. The judge did not write one thing when he meant to write another, and no inferior officer made a record not corresponding to the action of the court. We cannot read the words 'under a mistake as to the nature and contents thereof,' as meaning that the judge did not know that he was signing a certificate of this court, or as signifying more than that, if he had given the matter greater attention, he would not have signed one saying what it said. The certificate must have received some consideration, as it contains a statement or ruling adverse to the plaintiff, to which we shall refer in a moment. This being so, it appears to us extremely questionable, at least, whether such a certificate, which is an act of record, stands on any different ground from judgments and the like when the term has passed (see Wetmore v. Karrick, \n205 U.S. 141\n, 153, et seq. 51 L. ed. 745, 749, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 434; Michigan Ins. Bank v. Eldred, \n143 U.S. 293\n, 36 L. ed. 162, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 450); and also whether the so-called amendment, supposing it otherwise valid and properly made without leave of this court, can be considered by this court on the present writ of error (Michigan Ins. Bank v. Eldred, supra; McCarren v. \n\n[207 U.S. 277, 282]\n\u00a0\n McNulty, 7 Gray, 139; Rice v. Minnesota & N. W. R. Co. 21 How. 82, 16 L. ed. 31).\n If we were to consider the amendment it would amount to this: The plaintiff pleaded to the jurisdiction of the court as a court of the United States, and stood upon his plea. The judge, however, laid down a proposition of law on which he denied the right of the plaintiff to plead to the jurisdiction, and thereupon took jurisdiction so far as to give judgment for costs. By the analogies of the action of this court in other cases, we should decide for ourselves the preliminary as well as the final question of law, in order to decide whether the circuit court, as a court of the United States, had the right to give any judgment, even for costs. If the preliminary question should be considered, it would seem that the judge below was wrong in taking the proviso in the Illinois statute (Laws of 1905, p. 2; Hurd's Rev. Stat. 1905, chap. 3,  18, pp. 107, 108), 'that no nonresident of this state shall be appointed or act as administrator or executor,' as opening the appointment of a citizen of Ohio to this kind of collateral attack. See Simmons v. Saul, \n138 U.S. 439\n, 34 L. ed. 1054, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 369; Salomon v. People, 191 Ill. 290, 294, 61 N. E. 83. It is not reasonable to interpret it as making such a severance between the appointment, and the power to act which is a consequence of the appointment, as to leave the former unimpeachable in these proceedings, but its effect open to dispute. The words 'or act' may have reference more especially to executors, and may be a reminiscence of the ancient law, by which they derived their powers from the will,-a notion that has died hard. At all events presumably they offer an alternative to 'shall be appointed,' and refer to action without appointment in Illinois; for instance, action by an administrator appointed elsewhere, not to action after appointment when one is made. As we read them with our present light, at least, we deem them insufficient to prevent the plaintiff from insisting upon his right to keep out of the United States court.\n We proceed, then, to deal with the merits of the plea. The original certificate declares that the record shows that the de- \n\n[207 U.S. 277, 283]\n\u00a0\n fendant is not a citizen of or resident in the state of Illinois. If this be correct, it maintains the right to remove, so far as it goes. The right is given in cases of this sort to defendants 'being nonresidents of that state;' that is, of the state in which the suit is brought. Act of Aug. 13, 1888, chap. 866, 25 Stat. at L. 433, 434, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 508. If the defendant is to be regarded as a citizen of Illinois, the right to remove did not exist. Martin v. Snyder, \n148 U.S. 663\n, 37 L. ed. 602, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 706. It was for this reason, no doubt, that the petition for removal alleged that the defendant was a citizen of Ohio, and that the certificate declared that it was not a citizen of Illinois. But the plea averred that it was organized and existed under the laws of that state as well as of the others named. It is true, however, that it did not and could not traverse the averment of the petition, considered as an averment of fact, and it was demurred to specially on that ground. Therefore the question is raised how a corporation or corporations thus organized shall be regarded for the purposes of a suit like this. No nice speculation as to whether the corporation is one or many, and no details as to the particulars of the consolidation, are needed for an answer. The defendant exists in Illinois by virtue of the laws of Illinois. It is alleged to have incurred a liability under the laws of the same state, and is sued in that state. It cannot escape the jurisdiction by the fact that it is incorporated elsewhere. The assent of the state to such incorporation elsewhere, supposing it to have been given,-a matter upon which we express no opinion,-cannot be presumed to have intended or to import such a change. This seems to be the opinion of the supreme court of Illinois, as it certainly has been shown to be that of this court. Chicago & N. W. R. Co. v. Whitton, 13 Wall. 270, 20 L. ed. 571; Muller v. Dows, \n94 U.S. 444\n, 24 L. ed. 207; Memphis & C. R. Co. v. Alabama, \n107 U.S. 581\n, 27 L. ed. 518, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 432; Quincy R. Bridge Co. v. Adams County, 88 Ill. 615; Winn v. Wabash R. Co. 118 Fed. 55. What would be the law in case of a suit brought in Illinois upon a cause of action which arose in Ohio is a question that may be left on one side, as also may be the decisions in cases where a \n\n[207 U.S. 277, 284]\n\u00a0\n corporation originally created in one state afterwards becomes compulsorily a corporation of another state for some purposes in order to extend its powers. Southern R. Co. v. Allison, \n190 U.S. 326\n, 47 L. ed. 1078, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 713; St. Louis & S. F. R. Co. v. James, \n161 U.S. 545\n, 40 L. ed. 802, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 621. In the case at bar the incorporations must be taken to have been substantially simultaneous and free. See Memphis & C. R. Co. v. Alabama, supra. If any distinction were to be made it hardly could be adverse to the jurisdiction of Illinois, in view of the requirements of its Constitution and statutes, that a majority of the directors should be residents of Illinois, and that the corporation should keep a general office in that state. We are of opinion that the defendant must be regarded in this suit as a citizen of Illinois, and therefore as having had no right to remove. It follows that the cause should be remanded to the state court.\n Judgment reversed.\n Suit to be remanded to the state court. \n\n\n\n","118":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPATTERSON v.

Miller for defendant in error. \n\n[205 U.S. 454, 458]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a writ of error to review a judgment upon an information for contempt. 84 Pac. 912. The contempt alleged was the publication of certain articles and a cartoon, which, it was \n\n[205 U.S. 454, 459]\n\u00a0\n charged, reflected upon the motives and conduct of the supreme court of Colorado in cases still pending, and were intended to embarrass the court in the impartial administration of justice. There was a motion to quash on grounds of local law and the state Constitution and also of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. This was overruled and thereupon an answer was filed, admitting the publication, denying the contempt, also denying that the cases referred to were still pending, except that the time for motions for rehearing had not elapsed, and averring that the motions for rehearing subsequently were overruled, except that in certain cases the orders were amended so that the Democratic officeholders concerned could be sooner turned out of their offices. The answer went on to narrate the transactions commented on, at length, intimating that the conduct of the court was unconstitutional and usurping, and alleging that it was in aid of a scheme, fully explained, to seat various Republican candidates, including the governor of the state, in place of Democrats who had been elected, and that two of the judges of the court got their seats as a part of the scheme. Finally the answer alleged that the respondent published the articles in pursuance of what he regarded as a public duty, repeated the previous objections to the information, averred the truth of the articles, and set up and claimed the right to prove the truth under the Constitution of the United States. Upon this answer the court, on motion, ordered judgment fining the plaintiff in error for contempt.\n The foregoing proceedings are set forth in a bill of exceptions, and several errors are alleged. The difficulties with those most pressed is that they raise questions of local law, which are not open to re- examination here. The requirement in the 14th Amendment of due process of law does not take up the special provisions of the state Constitution and laws into the 14th Amendment for the purposes of the case, and in that way subject a state decision that they have been complied with to revision by this court. French v. \n\n[205 U.S. 454, 460]\n\u00a0\n Taylor, \n199 \nU.S. 274, 278\n, 50 S. L. ed. 189, 192, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 76; Rawlins v. Georgia, \n201 \nU.S. 638, 639\n, 50 S. L. ed. 899, 900, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 560; Burt v. Smith, \n203 \nU.S. 129, 135\n, 51 S. L. ed. 121, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 37. For this reason, if for no other, the objection that the information was not supported by an affidavit until after it was filed cannot be considered. See, further, Ex parte Wall, \n107 U.S. 265\n, 27 L. ed. 552, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 569. The same is true of the contention that the suits referred to in the article complained of were not pending. Whether a case shall be regarded as pending while it is possible that a petition for rehearing may be filed, or, if in an appellate court, until the remittitur is issued, are questions which the local law can settle as it pleases without interference from the Constitution of the United States. It is admitted that this may be true in some other sense, but it is not true, it is said, for the purpose of fixing the limits of possible contempts. But here again the plaintiff in error confounds the argument as to the common law, or as to what it might be wise and humane to hold, with that concerning the state's constitutional power. If a state should see fit to provide in its Constitution that conduct otherwise amounting to a contempt should be punishable as such if occurring at any time while the court affected retained authority to modify its judgment, the 14th Amendment would not forbid. The only question for this court is the power of the state. Virginia v. Rives (Ex parte Virginia) \n100 \nU.S. 313, 318\n, 25 S. L. ed. 667, 669; Missouri v. Dockery, \n191 \nU.S. 165, 171\n, 48 S. L. ed. 133, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 53.\n It is argued that the decisions criticized, and in some degree that in the present case, were contrary to well-settled previous adjudications of the same court, and this allegation is regarded as giving some sort of constitutional right to the plaintiff in error. But while it is true that the United States courts do not always hold themselves bound by state decisions in cases arising before them, that principle has but a limited application to cases brought from the state courts here on writs of error. Except in exceptional cases the grounds on which the circuit courts are held authorized to follow an earlier state decision rather than a later one, or to apply the rules of commercial law as understood by this court rather than those \n\n[205 U.S. 454, 461]\n\u00a0\n laid down by the local tribunals, are not grounds of constitutional right, but considerations of justice or expediency. There is no constitutional right to have all general propositions of law once adopted remain unchanged. Even if it be true, as the plaintiff in error says, that the supreme court of Colorado departed from earlier and well-established precedents to meet the exigencies of this case, whatever might be thought of the justice or wisdom of such a step, the Constitution of the United States is not infringed. It is unnecessary to lay down an absolute rule beyond the possibility of exception. Exceptions have been held to exist. But, in general, the decision of a court upon a question of law, however wrong and however contrary to previous decisions, is not an infraction of the 14th Amendment merely because it is wrong or because earlier decisions are reversed.\n It is argued that the articles did not constitute a contempt. In view of the answer, which sets out more plainly and in fuller detail what the articles insinuate and suggest, and in view of the position of the plaintiff in error that he was performing a public duty, the argument for a favorable interpretation of the printed words loses some of its force. However, it is enough for us to say that they are far from showing that innocent conduct has been laid hold of as an arbitrary pretense for an arbitrary punishment. Supposing that such a case would give the plaintiff in error a standing here, anything short of that is for the state court to decide. What constitutes contempt, as well as the time during which it may be committed, is a matter of local law.\n The defense upon which the plaintiff in error most relies is raised by the allegation that the articles complained of are true, and the claim of the right to prove the truth. He claimed this right under the Constitutions both of the state and of the United States, but the latter ground alone comes into consideration here, for reasons already stated. Re Kemmler, \n136 U.S. 436\n, 34 L. ed. 519, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 930. We do not pause to consider whether the claim was sufficient in point of form, although it is easier to refer to \n\n[205 U.S. 454, 462]\n\u00a0\n the Constitution generally for the supposed right than to point to the clause from which it springs. We leave undecided the question whether there is to be found in the 14th Amendment a prohibition similar to that in the 1st. But even if we were to assume that freedom of speech and freedom of the press were protected from abridgments on the part not only of the United States but also of the states, still we should be far from the conclusion that the plaintiff in error would have us reach. In the first place, the main purpose of such constitutional provisions is 'to prevent all such previous restraints upon publications as had been practised by other governments,' and they do not prevent the subsequent punishment of such as may be deemed contrary to the public welfare. Com. v. Blanding, 3 Pick. 304, 313, 314, 15 Am. Dec. 214; Respublica v. Oswald, 1 Dall. 319, 325, 1 L. ed. 155, 158, 1 Am. Dec. 246. The preliminary freedom extends as well to the false as to the true; the subsequent punishment may extend as well to the true as to the false. This was the law of criminal libel apart from statute in most cases, if not in all. Com. v. Blanding, ubi supra; 4 B1. Com. 150.\n In the next place, the rule applied to criminal libels applies yet more clearly to contempts. A publication likely to reach the eyes of a jury, declaring a witness in a pending cause a perjurer, would be none the less a contempt that it was true. It would tend to obstruct the administration of justice, because even a correct conclusion is not to be reached or helped in that way, if our system of trials is to be maintained. The theory of our system is that the conclusions to be reached in a case will be induced only by evidence and argument in open court, and not by any outside influence, whether of private talk or public print.\n What is true with reference to a jury is true also with reference to a court. Cases like the present are more likely to arise, no doubt, when there is a jury, and the publication may affect their judgment. Judges generally perhaps are less apprehensive that publications impugning their own \n\n[205 U.S. 454, 463]\n\u00a0\n reasoning or motives will interfere with their administration of the law. But if a court regards, as it may, a publication concerning a matter of law pending before it, as tending toward such an interference, it may punish it as in the instance put. When a case is finished courts are subject to the same criticism as other people; but the propriety and necessity of preventing interference with the course of justice by premature statement, argument, or intimidation hardly can be denied. Ex parte Terry, \n128 U.S. 289\n, 32 L. ed. 405, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 77; Telegram Newspaper Co. v. Com. 172 Mass. 294, 44 L.R.A. 159, 70 Am. St. Rep. 280, 52 N. E. 445; State v. Hart, 24 W. Va. 416, 49 Am. Rep. 257; Myers v. State, 46 Ohio St. 473, 491, 15 Am. St. Rep. 638, 22 N. E. 43; Hunt v. Clarke, 58 L. J. Q. B. N. S. 490, 492; King v. Parke \n\n[205 U.S. 454, 1903]\n\u00a0\n 2 K. B. 432. It is objected that the judges were sitting in their own case. But the grounds upon which contempts are punished are impersonal. United States v. Shipp, \n203 \nU.S. 563, 574\n, 51 S. L. ed. 319, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 165. No doubt judges naturally would be slower to punish when the contempt carried with it a personal dishonoring charge, but a man cannot expect to secure immunity from punishment by the proper tribunal, by adding to illegal conduct a personal attack. It only remains to add that the plaintiff in error had his day in court and opportunity to be heard. We have scrutinized the case, but cannot say that it shows an infraction of rights under the Constitution of the United States, or discloses more than the formal appeal to that instrument in the answer to found the jurisdiction of this court.\n Writ of error dismissed.\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan, dissenting:\n I cannot agree that this writ of error should be dismissed.\n By the 1st Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, it is provided that 'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, or of the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for redress.' In the civil Rights Cases, \n109 \nU.S. 1, 20\n, 27 S. L. ed. 835, 843, 3 Sup. Ct. Rep. 18, it was adjudged that \n\n[205 U.S. 454, 464]\n\u00a0\n the 13th Amendment, although in form prohibitory, had a reflex character, in that it established and decreed universal civil and political freedom throughout the United States. In United States v. Cruikshank, \n92 \nU.S. 542, 552\n, 23 S. L. ed. 588, 591, we held that the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances-one of the rights recognized in and protected by the 1st Amendment against hostile legislation by Congress-was an attribute of 'national citizenship.' So the 1st Amendment, although in form prohibitory, is to be regarded as having a reflex character, and as affirmatively recognizing freedom of speech and freedom of the press as rights belonging to citizens of the United States; that is, those rights are to be deemed attributes of national citizenship or citizenship of the United States. No one, I take it, will hesitate to say that a judgment of a Federal court, prior to the adoption of the 14th Amendment, impairing or abridging freedom of speech or of the press, would have been in violation of the rights of 'citizens of the United States' as guaranteed by the 1st Amendment; this, for the reason that the rights of free speech and a free press were, as already said, attributes of national citizenship before the 14th Amendment was made a part of the Constitution.\n Now, the 14th Amendment declares, in express words, that 'no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.' As the 1st Amendment guaranteed the rights of free speech and of a free press against hostile action by the United States, it would seem clear that, when the 14th Amendment prohibited the states from impairing or abridging the privileges of citizens of the United States, it necessarily prohibited the states from impairing or abridging the constitutional rights of such citizens to free speech and a free press. But the court announces that it leaves undecided the specific question whether there is to be found in the 14th Amendment a prohibition as to the rights of free \n\n[205 U.S. 454, 465]\n\u00a0\n speech and a free press similar to that in the 1st. It yet proceeds to say that the main purpose of such constitutional provisions was to prevent all such 'previous restraints' upon publications as had been practised by other governments, but not to prevent the subsequent punishment of such as may be deemed contrary to the public welfare. I cannot assent to that view, if it be meant that the legislature may impair or abridge the rights of a free press and of free speech whenever it thinks that the public welfare requires that to be done. The public welfare cannot override constitutional privileges, and if the rights of free speech and of a free press are, in their essence, attributes of national citizenship, as I think they are, then neither Congress nor any state, since the adoption of the 14th Amendment, can, by legislative enactments or by judicial action, impair or abridge them. In my judgment the action of the court below was in violation of the rights of free speech and a free press as guaranteed by the Constitution.\n I go further and hold that the privileges of free speech and of a free press, belonging to every citizen of the United States, constitute essential parts of every man's liberty, and are protected against violation by that clause of the 14th Amendment forbidding a state to deprive any person of his liberty without due process of law. It is, I think, impossible to conceive of liberty, as secured by the Constitution against hostile action, whether by the nation or by the states, which does not embrace the right to enjoy free speech and the right to have a free press.\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer, dissenting:\n While not concurring in the views expressed by Mr. Justice Harlan, I also dissent from the opinion and judgment of the court. The plaintiff in error made a distinct claim that he was denied that which he asserted to be a right guaranteed by the Federal Constitution. His claim cannot be regarded as a frivolous one, nor can the proceedings for contempt be \n\n[205 U.S. 454, 466]\n\u00a0\n entirely disassociated from the general proceedings of the case in which the contempt is charged to have been committed. I think, therefore, that this court has jurisdiction and ought to inquire and determine the alleged rights of the plaintiff in error. As, however, the court decides that it does not have jurisdiction, and has dismissed the writ of error, it would not be fit for me to express any opinion on the merits of the case. \n\n\n\n","119":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPEARCY v. STRANAHAN(1907)\nNo. 205\nArgued: Decided: April 8, 1907\n\n\n\n Mr. James C. Lenney for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[205 U.S. 257, 261]\n\u00a0\n Attorney General Bonaparte, Solicitor General Hoyt, and Otis J. Carlton for defendant in error. \n\n[205 U.S. 257, 262]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n Plaintiff brought his action in the circuit court of the United States for the southern district of New York against the then collector of the port of New York to recover the value of certain cigars seized by him, which had been brought to that port from the Isle of Pines, where they had been produced and manufactured. This seizure was made under the Dingley act, so called (act July 24, 1897, 30 Stat. at L. 151, chap. 11, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1626), and the regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury thereunder. The Dingley act provided for the imposition of duties 'on articles imported from foreign countries,' and in plaintiff's complaint it was asserted that the Isle of Pines was 'in possession of and part of the United States,' and hence domestic territory. The government demurred, the demurrer was sustained, the \n\n[205 U.S. 257, 263]\n\u00a0\n complaint dismissed, and the case brought here on a writ of error.\n Whether the Isle of Pines was a part of the United States is a conclusion of law not admitted by the demurrer. It was certainly not such before the treaty of peace with Spain [30 Stat. at L. 1754], and, if it became so, it was by virtue of that treaty. The court takes judicial cognizance whether or not a given territory is within the boundaries of the United States, and is bound to take the fact as it really exists, however it may be averred to be. Jones v. United States, \n137 U.S. 202\n, 34 L. ed. 691, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 80; Lincoln v. United States, \n197 U.S. 417\n, 49 L. ed. 816, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 455; Taylor v. Barclay, 2 Sim. 213.\n August 12, 1898, a protocol of agreement for a basis for the establishment of peace was entered into between the United States and Spain, which provided:\n'Article 1. Spain will relinquish all claim of sovereignty over and title to Cuba. 'Article 2. Spain will cede to the United States the island of Porto Rico and other islands now under Spanish sovereignty in the West Indies, and also an island in the Ladrones, to be selected by the United States.' 30 Stat. at L. 1742\n\n\n\n This was followed by the treaty of peace, ratified April 11, 1899, containing the following articles:\n'Article 1. Spain relinquishes all claim of sovereignty over and title to Cuba.\n\n'And as the island is, upon its evacuation by Spain, to be occupied by the United States, the United States will, so long as such occupation shall last, assume and discharge the obligations that may, under international law, result from the fact of its occupation, for the protection of life and property.\n\n'Article 2. Spain cedes to the United States the island of Porto Rico and other islands now under Spanish sovereignty in the West Indies, and the island of Guam in the Marianas or Ladrones.' 30 Stat. at L. 1754, 1755.\n\n In Neely v. Henkel, \n180 U.S. 109\n, 45 L. ed. 448, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 302 (Jan. 14, 1901), the question was whether Cuba was a foreign country or foreign territory within the act of Congress of June 6, 1900 (31 Stat. at L. 656, chap. 793, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3591), \n\n[205 U.S. 257, 264]\n\u00a0\n providing for the extradition from the United States of persons committing crimes within any foreign country or foreign territory or any part thereof, occupied or under the control of the United States. And it was held that Cuba was within this description. Mr. Justice Harlan, delivering the opinion of the court, said:\n'The facts above detailed make it clear that, within the meaning of the act of June 6, 1900, Cuba is foreign territory. It cannot be regarded, in any constitutional, legal, or international sense, a part of the territory of the United States.\n\n'While by the act of April 25, 1898 [30 Stat. at L. 364, chap. 189], declaring war between this country and Spain, the President was directed and empowered to use our entire land and naval forces, as well as the militia of the several states to such extent as was necessary, to carry such act into effect, that authorization was not for the purpose of making Cuba an integral part of the United States, but only for the purpose of compelling the relinquishment by Spain of its authority and government in that island, and the withdrawal of its forces from Cuba and Cuban waters. The legislative and executive branches of the government, by the joint resolution of April 20, 1898 [30 Stat at L. 738, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2790], expressly disclaimed any purpose to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction, or control over Cuba 'except for the pacification thereof,' and asserted the determination of the United States, that object being accomplished, to leave the government and control of Cuba to its own people. All that has been done in relation to Cuba has had that end in view, and, so far as the court is informed by the public history of the relations of this country with that island, nothing has been done inconsistent with the declared object of the war with Spain.\n\n'Cuba is none the less foreign territory, within the meaning of the act of Congress, because it is under a military governor appointed by and representing the President in the work of assisting the inhabitants of that island to establish a government of their own, under which, as a free and independent people, they may control their own affairs without interference \n\n[205 U.S. 257, 265]\n\u00a0\n by other nations. The occupancy of the island by troops of the United States was the necessary result of the war. That result could not have been avoided by the United States consistently with the principles of international law or with its obligations to the people of Cuba.\n\n'It is true that, as between Spain and the United States,-indeed, as between the United States and all foreign nations,-Cuba, upon the cessation of hostilities with Spain, and after the treaty of Paris, was to be treated as if it were conquered territory. But, as between the United States and Cuba, that island is territory held in trust for the inhabitants of Cuba, to whom it rightfully belongs and to whose exclusive control it will be surrendered when a stable government shall have been established by their voluntary action.'\n\n If, then, the Isle of Pines was not embraced in article 2 of the treaty, but was included within the term 'Cuba' in article 1, and therefore sovereignty and title were merely relinquished, it was 'foreign country' within the Dingley act.\n This inquiry involves the interpretation which the political departments have put upon the treaty. For, in the language of Mr. Justice Gray, in Jones v. United States, 'who is the sovereign, de jure or de facto, of a territory, is not a judicial but a political question, the determination of which by the legislative and executive departments of any government conclusively binds the judges as well as all other officers, citizens, and subjects of that government.'\n By the joint resolution of April 20, 1898 (30 Stat. at L. 738, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2790), entitled 'Joint Resolution for the Recognition of the Independence of the People of Cuba, Demanding That the Government of Spain Relinquish Its Authority and Government in the Island of Cuba, and to Withdraw Its Land and Naval Forces from Cuba and Cuban Waters, and Directing the President of the United States to Use the Land and Naval Forces of the United States to Carry These Resolutions into Effect,' the United States disclaimed any disposition or intention to exercise sovereignty or control over Cuba, except in the pacification thereof, and \n\n[205 U.S. 257, 266]\n\u00a0\n asserted its determination, when that was accomplished, to leave the control of the island to its people. What was the signification of the word 'Cuba' at that time?\n The record of the official acts of the Spanish government from 1774 to 1898 demonstrates that the Isle of Pines was included in the political division known as 'Cuba.' The first official census of Cuba, in 1774; the 'Statistical Plan of the Ever Faithful Isle of Cuba for the Year 1827;' the establishment by the governor general, in 1828, of a colony on the island; the census of 1841; the budgets of receipts and expenses; the census for 1861, 1877, 1887, and so on, all show that the Isle of Pines was, governmentally speaking, included in the specific designation 'Cuba' at the time the treaty was made and ratified, and the documents establish that it formed a municipal district of the province of Habana.\n In short, all the world knew that it was an integral part of Cuba, and in view of the language of the joint resolution of April 20, 1898, it seems clear that the Isle of Pines was not supposed to be one of the 'other islands' ceded by article 2. Those were islands not constituting an integral part of Cuba, such as Vieques, Culebra, and Mona islands, adjacent to Porto Rico.\n Has the treaty been otherwise interpreted by the political departments of this government? The documents to which we have had access, with the assistance of the presentation of the facts condensed therefrom in the brief for the United States, enable us to sufficiently indicate the situation in that regard, and we think it proper to do this, notwithstanding the determination of the case turns at last on a short point requiring no elaboration.\n The Spanish evacuated Havana January 1, 1899, and the government of Cuba was transferred to a military governor as the representative of the President of the United States. The President ordered, August 17, 1899, a census to be taken as a first step toward assisting 'the people of Cuba' to establish 'an effective system of self-government.' In accomplishing \n\n[205 U.S. 257, 267]\n\u00a0\n this the island was divided into 1,607 enumeration districts. Three enumerators took the census of the Isle of Pines, which was described as a municipal district of the judicial district of Bejucal, in the province of Havana. The report on the census, as published by the War Department in 1900, stated: 'The government of Cuba has jurisdiction not only over the island of that name, but also over the Isle of Pines, lying directly to the south of it, and more than a thousand islets and reefs scattered along its northern and southern coasts. . . . The Isle of Pines, with an area of 840 square miles, is a municipal district of the province of Habana. . . . The total population of Cuba, including the Isle of Pines and the neighboring keys, was, on October 16, 1899, 1,572,797.'\n The population tables give the population of the Isle of Pines as a municipal district of Havana province, and so of the statistics as to rural population; sex, nativity, and color; age and sex; birthplace; conjugal condition; school attendance; foreign whites; number and size of families; dwellings of families,-these and like items are given as to the Isle of Pines as under the province of Habana.\n In August, 1899, the military governor of Cuba appointed a mayor and first assistant mayor of the Isle of Pines.\n On June 16, 1900, an election was held throughout the island, at which the people of Cuba in all their municipalities elected their municipal officers, participated in by the inhabitants of the Isle of Pines, as is stated in the report of the Committee on Foreign Relations, Senate Document No. 205, Fifty-ninth Congress, though this was denied in a minority report.\n A constitutional convention was called and the inhabitants of the Isle of Pines participated in the election of delegates thereto, September 15, 1900.\n The convention concluded its work by October 1, 1901, and December 31, 1901, an election was held to choose governors of provinces, provincial councilors, members of the house of representatives, and presidential and senatorial electors, under \n\n[205 U.S. 257, 268]\n\u00a0\n an order of General Wood of October 14, 1901, No. 218, approved by the War Department, which divided the province of Habana into four circuits, the third being composed of several ayuntamientos, of which the Isle of Pines was one.\n February 24, 1902, the electors met, chose senators, and elected Senor Palma, President, and Senor Romero, Vice President.\n The government was transferred to Cuba, May 20, 1902, and in making the transfer, and declaring the occupation of Cuba by the United States and the military government of the island to be ended, the military governor wrote to 'The President and Congress of Cuba,' among other things: 'It is understood by the United States that the present government of the Isle of Pines will continue as a de facto government, pending the settlement of the title to said island by treaty, pursuant to the Cuban Constitution and the act of Congress of the United States approved March 2, 1902 \n\n[205 U.S. 257, 1]\n\u00a0\n.' [31 Stat. at L. 897, chap. 803.] On the same day President Palma replied:\n'It is understood that the Isle of Pines is to continue de facto under the jurisdiction of the government of the Republic of Cuba, subject to such treaty as may be entered into between the government of the United States and that of the Cuban Republic, as provided for in the Cuban Constitution and in the act passed by the Congress of the United States, and approved on the 2d of March, 1901.' 31 Stat. at L. 897, chap. 803.\n\n At that date the Isle of Pines was actually being governed by the Cubans through municipal officers elected by its inhabitants, and a governor of the province of Habana, councilors, etc., in whose choice they had participated. And see Neely v. Henkel, \n180 \nU.S. 109, 117\n, 118 S., 45 L. ed. 448, 454, 455, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 302.\n February 16, 1903, the Senate of the United States, by resolution, requested the President 'to inform the Senate as to the present status of the Isle of Pines, and what government is exercising authority and control in said island.'\n In reply the President submitted a report from the Secretary of War, which stated: \n\n[205 U.S. 257, 269]\n\u00a0\n 'The nature of the de facto government under which the Isle of Pines was thus left pending the determination of the title thereof by treaty is shown in the following indorsement upon a copy of the said resolution by the late military governor of Cuba:\n [Here follows the indorsement, dated February 20, 1903, of which the following is a part:]\n\"At the date of transfer of the Island of Cuba to its duly elected officials the Isle of Pines constituted a municipality included within the municipalities of the province of Habana and located in the judicial district of Bejucal. The government of the island is vested in its municipal officers, subject to the general control of the civil governor of the province of Habana, who is vested, under the Constitution of Cuba, with certain authority in the control of municipal affairs. Under the military government of Cuba the Isle of Pines was governed by municipal officials, subject to the general authority of the civil governor, who received his authority from the governor general. The Isle of Pines, as it had existed under the military government, was transferred as a de facto government to the Cuban Republic, pending the final settlement of the status of the island by treaty between the United States and Cuba. The action taken by the military government was in accordance with telegraphic orders from the honorable the Secretary of War. The government of the island to-day is in the hands of its municipal officers, duly elected by the people under the general control of the civil governor of the province of Habana and the Republic of Cuba. As I understand it, the government of the Isle of Pines is vested in the Republic of Cuba, pending such final action as may be taken by the United States and Cuba looking to the ultimate disposition of the island. No special action was taken to protect the interests of the citizens of the United States who have purchased property and have settled in the Isle of Pines, for the reason that no such action was necessary. All Americans in the island are living under exactly the same conditions as other foreigners, \n\n[205 U.S. 257, 270]\n\u00a0\n and if they comply with the laws in force it is safe to say that they will not have any difficulty or need special protection. At the time these people purchased property they understood distinctly that the question of ownership of the Isle of Pines was one pending settlement, and in locating there they took the risks incident to the situation.\"\n\n We are justified in assuming that the Isle of Pines was always treated by the President's representatives in Cuba as an integral part of Cuba. This was indeed to be expected in view of the fact that it was such at the time of the execution of the treaty and its ratification, and that the treaty did not provide otherwise in terms, to say nothing of general principles of international law applicable to such coasts and shores as those of Florida, the Bahamas, and Cuba. Hall, 4th ed. 129, 130; Louisiana v. Mississippi, \n202 U.S. 153\n, 50 L. ed. 913, 932, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 408, 571; The Anna, 5 C. Rob. 273.\n In August, 1902, the Treasury Department decided that duties should be assessed on goods coming from the Isle of Pines at the same rates as on similar merchandise imported from other places.\n On July 2, 1903, a treaty with Cuba was signed, relinquishing any claim by the United States to the Isle of Pines under the treaty of peace, but this failed of ratification, and on March 2, 1904, another treaty was signed, which relinquished all claim of title under that treaty.\n November 27, 1905, the Secretary of State wrote an American resident of the Isle of Pines:\n'The treaty now pending before the Senate, if approved by that body, will relinquish all claim of the United States to the Isle of Pines. In my judgment the United States has no substantial claim to the Isle of Pines. The treaty merely accords to Cuba what is hers in accordance with international law and justice.\n\n'At the time of the treaty of peace which ended the war between the United States and Spain, the Isle of Pines was, and had been for several centuries, a part of Cuba. I have no \n\n[205 U.S. 257, 271]\n\u00a0\n doubt whatever that it continues to be a part of Cuba, and that it has not and never has been territory of the United States. This is the view with which President Roosevelt authorized the pending treaty, and Mr. Hay signed it, and I expect to urge its confirmation.'\n\n There are some letters of an Assistant Secretary of War, or written by his direction, and other matters, referred to, which we do not regard as seriously affecting the conclusion that the Executive has consistently acted on the determination that the United States had no substantial claim to the Isle of Pines under the treaty.\n The only significant legislative action is found in the proviso of the act of March 2, 1901, the Army appropriation act (31 Stat. at L. 895, chap. 803, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2799), commonly called the Platt amendment (897), which reads:\n'Provided, further, that in fulfilment of the declaration contained in the joint resolution approved April twentieth, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, entitled 'For the Recognition of the Independence of the People of Cuba, Demanding that the Government of Spain Relinquish Its Authority and Government in the Island of Cuba, and to Withdraw Its Land and Naval Forces from Cuba and Cuban Waters, and Directing the President of the United States to Use the Land and Naval Forces of the United States to Carry These Resolutions into Effect,' the President is hereby authorized to 'leave the government and control of the island of Cuba to its people' so soon as a government shall have been established in said island under a constitution which, either as a part thereof or in an ordinance appended thereto, shall define the future relations of the United States with Cuba, substantially as follows:'\n\n Then follow eight clauses, of which the sixth is:\n'6. That the Isle of Pines shall be omitted from the proposed constitutional boundaries of Cuba, the title thereto being left to future adjustment by treaty.'\n\n It appears that certain American citizens, asserting interests in the Isle of Pines, had contended that it belonged to the \n\n[205 U.S. 257, 272]\n\u00a0\n United States under the treaty, and the sixth clause of the Platt amendment, while not asserting an absolute claim of title on our part, gave opportunity for an examination of the question of ownership and its settlement through a treaty with Cuba. The Republic of Cuba has been governing the isle since May 20, 1902,-the present situation need not be discussed,-and has made various improvements in administration at the suggestion of our government, but Congress has taken no action to the contrary of Cuba's title as superior to ours.\n It may be conceded that the action of both the political departments has not been sufficiently definite to furnish a conclusive interpretation of the treaty of peace as an original question, and as yet no agreement has been reached under the Platt amendment. The Isle of Pines continues, at least de facto, under the jurisdiction of the government of the Republic of Cuba, and that settles the question before us, because, as the United States have never taken possession of the Isle of Pines as having been ceded by the treaty of peace, and as it has been and is being governed by the Republic of Cuba, it has remained 'foreign country' within the meaning of the Dingley act, according to the ruling in De Lima v. Bidwell, \n182 U.S. 1\n, 45 L. ed. 1041, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 743, and cases cited; United States v. Rice, 4 Wheat. 246, 4 L. ed. 562. There has been no change of nationality for revenue purposes, but, on the contrary, the Cuban government has been recognized as rightfully exercising sovereignty over the Isle of Pines as a de facto government until otherwise provided. It must be treated as foreign, for this government has never taken, nor aimed to take, that possession in fact and in law which is essential to render it domestic.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McKenna concurred in the judgment.\n Mr. Justice White and Mr. Justice Holmes concurred specially.\n Mr. Justice Moody took no part. \n\n[205 U.S. 257, 273]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice White, concurring:\n My reasons for agreeing to the conclusion announced by the court are separately stated to prevent all implication of an expression of opinion on my part as to a subject which, in my judgment, the case does not require, and which, as it is given me to see it, may not be made without a plain violation of my duty.\n The question which the case raises, by way of a suit to recover duties paid on goods brought from the Isle of Pines, is whether that island, by the treaty with Spain, became a part of the United States, or was simply left or made a part of the island of Cuba, over which the sovereignty of Spain was relinquished.\n I accept the doctrine which the opinion of the court announces, following Jones v. United States, \n137 U.S. 202\n, 34 L. ed. 691, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 80, that 'who is the sovereign de jure or de facto of a territory is not a judicial but a political question, the determination of which by the legislative and executive departments of any government conclusively binds the judges as well as all other officers, citizens, and subjects of that government.' That the legislative and executive departments have conclusively settled the present status of the Isle of Pines as de facto a part of Cuba, and have left open for future determination the de jure claim, if any, of the United States to the island, as the court now declares, is to me beyond possible contention. Thus, by the amendment to the act of 1891, which was enacted to determine the de facto position of the island and to furnish a rule for the guidance of the executive authority in dealing in the future with the island, it was expressly provided 'that the Isle of Pines shall be omitted from the proposed constitutional boundaries of Cuba, the title thereto being left to future adjustment by treaty.' So, also, when the island of Cuba was turned over to the Cuban government by the military authority of the United States, that government was expressly notified by such authority, under the direction of the President, that \n\n[205 U.S. 257, 274]\n\u00a0\n whilst the de facto position of the Isle of Pines as a part of Cuba was not disturbed, it must be understood that its de jure relation was reserved for future determination by treaty between Cuba and the United States. And this notification and relation was in terms accepted by the President of the Republic of Cuba. If the opinion now announced stopped with these conclusive expressions I should, of course, have nothing to say. But it does not do so. Although declaring that the de facto position of the Isle of Pines as resulting from legislative and executive action is binding upon courts, and although referring to the conclusive settlement of that de facto status, and the reservation by the legislative and executive departments of the determination of the de jure status for future action, the opinion asserts that it is open and proper for the court to express an opinion upon the de jure status, that is, to decide upon the effect of the treaty. In doing so it is declared that all the world knew that the Isle of Pines was an integral part of Cuba, this being but a prelude to an expression of opinion as to the rightful construction of the treaty. To my mind any and all expression of opinion concerning the effect of the treaty and the de jure relation of the Isle of Pines is wholly unnecessary, and cannot be indulged in without disregarding the very principle upon which the decision is placed; that is, the conclusive effect of executive and legislative action. In other words, to me it seems that the opinion whilst recognizing the force of the executive and legislative action, necessarily disregards it. This follows, because the views which are expressed on the subject of the meaning of the treaty amount substantially to declaring that the past action of the executive and legislative departments of the government on the subject have been wrong, and that any future attempt by those departments to proceed upon the hypothesis that the de jure status of the island is unsettled will be a violation of the treaty as now unnecessarily interpreted.\n Mr. Justice Holmes concurs. \n\n\n\n","120":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPENNSYLVANIA COAL & COKE CO. v.

S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3597). which provides, among other things, that 'whenever the executive authority of any state or territory demands any person as a fugitive from justice, of the executive authority of any state or territory to which such person has fled, and produces a copy of an indictment found or an affidavit made before a magistrate of any state or territory, charging the person demanded with having committed treason, felony, or other crime, certified as authentic by the governor or chief magistrate of the state or territory from whence the person so charged has fled, it shall be the duty of the executive authority of the state or territory to which such person has fled to cause him to be arrested and secured, and to cause notice of the arrest to be given to the executive authority making such demand, or to the agent of such authority appointed to receive the fugitive, and to cause the fugitive to be delivered to such agent when he shall appear.'\n It appears from the record that the governor of Wisconsin \n\n[207 U.S. 100, 105]\n\u00a0\n made his requisition upon the governor of Illinois, stating that John McNichols (the present plaintiff in error) was charged by affidavit with the crime of larceny from the person of one Thomas Hansen,-a crime under the laws of Wisconsin,-committed in the county of Kenosha, Wisconsin, and that he had fled from the justice of that state and taken refuge in Illinois, and requiring that McNichols be apprehended and delivered to the appointed agent of Wisconsin, who was authorized to receive and convey the accused to Wisconsin, there to be dealt with according to law. Accompanying the requisition were duly certifled copies of three documents: 1. An official application to the governor of Wisconsin, by the district attorney for Kenosha county for a requisition upon the governor of Illinois for McNichols as a fugitive from the justice of Wisconsin, it being stated in such application cation that McNichols was there charged by affidavit before a justice of the peace with the crime of larceny from the person, committed in that county on the 30th day of September, 1905. 2. A verified complaint or affidavit before a Wisconsin justice of the peace, alleging that McNichols did, on the 30th day of September, A. D. 1905, at the city of Kenosha feloniously steal, take, and carry away from the person of Thomas Hansen, against his will, $200, lawful money of the United States, etc. 3. A warrant of arrest issued by such justice of the peace, based on the above affidavit, for the apprehension of McNichols.\n The governor of Illinois, in conformity with the demand of the governor of Wisconsin, issued his warrant for the arrest and delivery of McNichols to the agent designated by the governor of the latter state. That warrant recited-and its recitals are important: 'The executive authority of the state of Wisconsin demands of me the apprehension and delivery of John McNichols, represented to be a fugitive from justice, and has, moreover, produced and laid before me the copy of a complaint and affidavit made by and before a properly empowered officer in and of the said state, in accordance with the laws thereof, charging John McNichols, the person so \n\n[207 U.S. 100, 106]\n\u00a0\n demanded, with having committed against the laws of the said state of Wisconsin the crime of larceny from the person, which appears by the said copy of a complaint and affidavit certified as authentic by the governor of the said state, now on file in the office of the secretary of state of Illinois, and being satisfied that said John McNichols is a fugitive from justice and has fled from the state of Wisconsin.' etc.\n Having been arrested under the authority of that warrant, and being in the custody of the sheriff of Cook county, Illinois, McNichols presented his petition to the supreme court of that state,-whose jurisdiction in the premises is not disputed,-praying to be discharged from custody. That petition states that, prior to the issuing of the above extradition warrant, he was arrested upon a warrant issued by a justice of the peace in Chicago, based upon the supposed criminal offense, and that he presented his petition to the criminal court of Cook county for a writ of habeas corpus setting forth that he was not a fugitive from justice; that pending that proceeding the above extradition warrant was issued and brought to the attention of the criminal court, and thereupon that court, because of the gravity of the case, suspended proceedings in order to give the accused an opportunity to apply to the supreme court of Illinois for a writ of habeas corpus.\n The present petition for habeas corpus presented to the supreme court of Illinois contained this paragraph: 'Your petitioner further shows that he has heard Thomas Hansen testify in a certain habeas corpus proceeding heretofore pending regarding this same matter [no doubt, the above proceeding in the Cook criminal court], the said Thomas Hansen stating in his testimony that he was the same person mentioned in said complaint, and the said Thomas Hansen then and there testifying that the said supposed crime occurred on September 30, 1905, at the hour of 2 P. M., about a block and a half from the Northwestern depot in Kenosha, Wisconsin; and your petitioner states that he was not in the state of Wisconsin on September 30, 1905, and did not commit the said offense, and \n\n[207 U.S. 100, 107]\n\u00a0\n in further proof thereof your petitioner herewith presents and attaches to this petition the affidavits of John F. Graff, William Oakley, Simon F. Bower, John A. Dennison, and Hugh Campbell, the same being marked respectively exhibits C, D, E, F, and G.' In one of the affidavits here referred to the affiant stated 'that upon the 30th day of September, A. D. 1905, the said John McNichols, to this affiant's personal knowledge, was in the city of Chicago at about the hour of 1 o'clock P. M., and that this affiant remained in the company of the said McNichols until 2: 15 P. M., and again met the said McNichols about 3 o'clock, P. M., said day; this affiant further says that it would have been impossible for the said McNichols to have been in the city of Kenosha, state of Wisconsin, on the said 30th day of September, A. D. 1905. In the remaining five affidavits the respective affiants, using precisely the same words, stated 'that upon the 30th day of September, A. D. 1905, said John McNichols, to this affiant's personal knowledge, was in the city of Chicago, the whole of the afternoon of the said day, this affiant and the said John McNichols during the said afternoon being in attendance at a baseball game in the said city of Chicago, between the Chicago and Boston teams, which said game was played at the West Side Ball Park.'\n The record shows that the case was heard in the supreme court of Illinois upon 'the allegations and proofs' of the parties, and it was adjudged that the custody of the sheriff who held the accused should not be disturbed. But no bill of exceptions was taken embodying any evidence before the supreme court of Illinois. So that we do not know what were the 'proofs' adduced by the parties. The sheriff stood upon his answer to the petition for the writ of habeas corpus. That answer, it will be recalled, embodied the extradition warrant issued by the governor of Illinois.\n Did the supreme court of Illinois err when adjudging, as in effect it did, that the accused did not appear to be held in custody in violation of the Constitution and laws of the United States? \n\n[207 U.S. 100, 108]\n\u00a0\n Some of the questions discussed at the bar have been concluded by decisions in former cases involving the meaning and scope of the above constitutional and statutory provisions. We will not extend this opinion by giving a full analysis of those cases. It is sufficient to say that the following principles are to be deduced from Robb v. Connolly, \n111 \nU.S. 624, 639\n, 28 S. L. ed. 542, 547, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 544; Ex parte Reggel, \n114 \nU.S. 642, 652\n, 653 S., 29 L. ed. 250, 253, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1148; Roberts v. Reilly, \n116 \nU.S. 80, 95\n, 29 S.

Rep. 122:\n\n 1. \nA person charged with crime against the laws of a state, and who flees from justice, that is, after committing the crime leaves the state, in whatever way or for whatever reason, and is found in another state, may, under the authority of the Constitution and laws of the United States, be brought back to the state in which he stands charged with the crime, to be there dealt with according to law.\n\n 2. \nWhen the executive authority of the state whose laws have been thus violated makes such a demand upon the executive of the state in which the alleged fugitive is found as is indicated by the above section (5278) of the Revised Statutes,-producing at the time of such demand a copy of the indictment, or an affidavit certified as authentic and made before a magistrate, charging the person demanded with a crime against the laws of the demanding state,-it becomes, under the Constitution and laws of the United States, the duty of the executive of the state where the fugitive is found to cause him to be arrested, surrendered, and delivered to the appointed agent of the demanding state, to be taken to that state.\n\n 3. \nNevertheless, the executive upon whom such demand is made, not being authorized by the Constitution and laws of the United States to cause the arrest of one charged with crime in another state unless he is a fugitive from justice, may decline to issue an extradition warrant, unless it is made to appear to him, by competent proof, that the accused is substantially charged with crime against the laws of the demanding \n\n[207 U.S. 100, 109]\n\u00a0\n state, and is, in fact, a fugitive from the justice of that state.\n\n 4. \nWhether the alleged criminal is or not such fugitive from justice may, so far as the Constitution and laws of the United States are concerned, be determined by the executive upon whom the demand is made in such way as he deems satisfactory, and he is not obliged to demand proof apart from proper requisition papers from the demanding state, that the accused is a fugitive from justice.\n\n 5. \nIf it be determined that the alleged criminal is a fugitive from justice,-whether such determination be based upon the requisition and accompanying papers in proper form, or after an original, independent inquiry into the facts,-and if a warrant of arrest is issued after such determination, the warrant will be regarded as making a prima facie case in favor of the demanding state, and as requiring the removal of the alleged criminal to the state in which he stands charged with crime, unless, in some sppropriate proceeding, it is made to appear that he is not a fugitive from the justice of the demanding state.\n\n 6. \nA proceeding by habeas corpus in a court of competent jurisdiction is appropriate for determining whether the accused is subject, in virtue of the warrant of arrest, to be taken as a fugitive from the justice of the state in which he is found to the state whose laws he is charged with violating.\n\n 7. \nOne arrested and held as a fugitive from justice is entitled, of right, upon habeas corpus, to question the lawfulness of his arrest and imprisonment, showing by competent evidence, as a ground for his release, that he was not, within the meaning of the Constitution and laws of the United States, a fugitive from the justice of the demanding state, and thereby overcoming the presumption to the contrary arising from the face of an extradition warrant.\n Turning now to the record of this case, we find that the accused is in custody under an extradition warrant which appears upon its face to be warranted by the Constitution and laws of the United States. But we fail to find evidence sufficient to \n\n[207 U.S. 100, 110]\n\u00a0\n overcome the prima facie case thus made by that warrant. It is said that the plaintiff in error was not in the state of Wisconsin on the day when the alleged larceny from the person of Hansen was committed; therefore, it is contended, he could not have committed the crime charged, and thereafter become a fugitive from the justice of that state. If the authorities of Wisconsin were bound by the date named in the requisition papers, which we do not concede (1 Pomeroy's Archbold, Crim. Pr. & Pl. 363 ), still the record presents no such case as is contended for by the accused. It was incumbent upon him, by competent proof, to rebut the presumption arising on the face of the extradition warrant and requisition papers that he was a fugitive from justice for a crime committed in Wisconsin on September 30th, 1905. As already stated, no bill of exceptions embracing the evidence was taken and we cannot, therefore, say that the proofs established the fact that the accused was not a fugitive as charged, as stated in the warrant of arrest.\n It is argued, however, that the affidavits accompanying the petition for habeas corpus show that the accused was not in Wisconsin when the crime in question was alleged to have been committed. The record does not justify us in assuming that those affidavits were in fact offered as evidence, or were used with the consent of the state as evidence, or were treated as evidence by the supreme court of Illinois. It is true that the counsel for the sheriff uses some language in his brief which is construed as admitting that the affidavits were used, without objection, as evidence. But such an apparent admission cannot control or affect our decision; for whether the supreme court of Illinois erred in its final judgment must be determined by the record before us.\n But if it be assumed that the affidavits were accepted in the court below as evidence, the result must still be the same; for the affidavits do not satisfactorily establish the fact that the accused was absent from Wisconsin when the alleged crime in question was committed. The charge, as set forth in the requisition papers, was that he committed the crime of larceny \n\n[207 U.S. 100, 111]\n\u00a0\n from the person of Hansen on the 30th day of September, 1905,-no particular hour of that day being mentioned,-while the affidavits import nothing more than that McNichols was at Chicago at 1 o'clock and during the whole of the afternoon of that day. The affidavits give no account of the wherabouts of McNichols during the forenoon of the day specified in the papers accompanying the requisition by the governor of Wisconsin. We know, because everyone knows, without the testimony of witnesses, that Kenosha, the place of the alleged crime, is only a short distance-within not more than one hour and a half's travel, by rail-from Chicago. It was entirely possible for the accused to have passed the whole or a larger part of the forenoon of September 30th in that city, and yet have been in Chicago at 1 o'clock and during the whole afternoon of the same day. So that the affidavits relied on by no means prove the absence of the accused from Wisconsin during the whole of the 30th day of September.\n Here, it is suggested that the crime, if committed at all, was committed at 2 o'clock of September 30th, while the affidavits show that McNichols was at Chicago at 1 o'clock and during the entire afternoon of that day. So far as the record discloses this suggestion finds no support in anything said or done at the hearing by those who opposed the discharge of the accused. The requisition papers do not state that the alleged crime was committed at 2 o'clock or at any other specified hour of the day named. The whole foundation for the suggestion was an allegation in the petition for the writ, in this case, to the effect that the accused had heard Thomas Hansen testify in another habeas corpus proceeding that the crime was committed at 2 o'clock on the day named. But the record does not show that Hansen or any other person so testified in the present case. Indeed, it does not appear that anyone testified orally before the court,-not even McNichols. Upon the record before us it must be taken that McNichols was charged with committing the crime in question on the 30th day of September, and that he could have been at \n\n[207 U.S. 100, 112]\n\u00a0\n Kenosha during the forenoon of that day, although he may have been, as stated in the affidavits, in Chicago during the whole of the afternoon of the same day. So that the accused entirely failed to overcome the prima facie case made by the official documents before the court of his having become a fugitive from the justice of Wisconsin, after committing a crime against its laws on the 30th day of September, 1905\n\n\n When a person is held in custody as a fugitive from justice under an extradition warrant, in proper form, and showing upon its face all that is required by law to be shown as a prerequisite to its being issued, he should not be discharged from custody unless it is made clearly and satisfactorily to appear that he is not a fugitive from justice within the meaning of the Constitution and laws of the United States. We may repeat the thought expressed in Appleyard's Case, above cited, that a faithful, vigorous enforcement of the constitutional and statutory provisions relating to fugitives from justice is vital to the harmony and welfare of the states, and that 'while a state should take care, within the limits of the law, that the rights of its people are protected against illegal action, the judicial authorities of the Union should equally take care that the provisions of the Constitution be not so narrowly interpreted as to enable offenders against the laws of a state to find a permanent asylum in the territory of another state.'\n No error appearing in the record, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois must be affirmed.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","122":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPEOPLE OF STATE OF NEW YORK EX REL. HATCH v. REARDON(1907)\nNo. 310\nArgued: Decided: January 7, 1907\n\n\n\n\n[204 U.S. 152, 153]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John G. Milburn, John F. Dillon, and John G. Johnson for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n\n Messrs. Julius M. Mayer, \n\n[204 U.S. 152, 156]\n\u00a0\n E. Crosby Kindleberger, Horace McGuire, and James C. Graham for defendant in error.  \n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a writ of error to revise an order dismissing a writ of \n\n[204 U.S. 152, 157]\n\u00a0\n habeas corpus and remanding the relator to the custody of the defendant in error. The order was made by a single justice and affirmed successively by the appellate division of the supreme court (110 App. Div. 821, 97 N. Y. Supp. 535), and by the court of appeals (184 N. Y. 431, 77 N. E. 970). The facts are these: The relator, Hatch, a resident of Connecticut, sold in New York to one Maury, also a resident of Connecticut, but doing business in New York, 100 shares of the stock of the Southern Railway Company, a Virginia corporation, and 100 shares of the stock of the Chicago, Milwaukee, & St. Paul Railroad Company, a Wisconsin corporation, and on the same day and in the same place received payment and delivered the certificates, assigned in blank. He made no memorandum of the sale and affixed to no document any stamp, and did not otherwise pay the tax on transfers of stock imposed by the New York Laws of 1905, chap. 241. He was arrested on complaint, and thereupon petitioned for this writ, alleging that the law was void under the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.\n The statute in question levies a tax of 2 cents on each hundred dollars of face value of stock, for every sale or agreement to sell the same, etc.; to be paid by affixing and canceling stamps for the requisite amount to the books of the company, the stock certificate, or a memorandum required in certain cases. Failure to pay the tax is made a misdemeanor punishable by fine, imprisonment, or both. There is also a civil penalty attached. The petition for the writ sets up only the 14th Amendment, as we have mentioned, but both sides have argued the case under the commerce clause of the Constitution (art. 1,  8) as well, and we shall say a few words on that aspect of the question.\n It is true that a very similar stamp act of the United States, the act of June 13, 1898, chap. 448,  25, Schedule A, 30 Stat. at L. 448, 458, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2300, was upheld in Thomas v. United States, \n192 U.S. 363\n, 48 L. ed. 481, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 305. But it is argued that different considerations apply to the states, and the tax is said to be bad under the 14th Amend- \n\n[204 U.S. 152, 158]\n\u00a0\n ment for serveral reasons. In the first place it is said to be an arbitrary discrimination. This objection to a tax must be approached with the greatest caution. The general expressions of the Amendment must not be allowed to upset familiar and long-established methods and processes by a formal elaboration of rules which its words do not import. See Michigan C. R. Co. v. Powers, \n201 \nU.S. 245, 293\n, 50 S. L. ed. 744, 761, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 459. Stamp acts necessarily are confined to certain classes of transactions, and to classes which, considered economically or from the legal or other possible points of view, are not very different from other classes that escape. You cannot have a stamp act without something that can be stamped conveniently. And it is easy to contend that justice and equality cannot be measured by the convenience of the taxing power. Yet the economists do not condemn stamp acts, and neither does the Constitution.\n The objection did not take this very broad form, to be sure. But it was said that there was no basis for the separation of sales of stock from sales of other kinds of personal property; for instance, especially, bonds of the same or other companies. But bonds in most cases pass by delivery, and a stamp tax hardly could be enforced. See further, Nicol v. Ames, \n173 \nU.S. 509, 522\n, 523 S., 43 L. ed. 786, 794, 795, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 522.

Rep. 168, practical grounds were recognized as sufficient to warrant a prohibition, which did not apply to sales of other property, of sales of stock on margin, although this same argument was pressed with great force. A fortiori do they warrant a tax on sales which is not intended to discriminate against or to discourage them, but simply to collect a revenue for the benefit of the whole community in a convenient way.\n It is urged further that a tax on sales is really a tax on property, and that therefore the act, as applied to the shares of a foreign corporation owned by nonresidents, is a taking of property without due process of law. Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky, \n199 U.S. 194\n, 50 L. ed. 150, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 36. This argument presses the expressions in Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419, 444, 6 L. ed. 678, 687; Fairbank v. United States, \n181 U.S. 283\n, 45 L. ed. 862, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 648, and intervening cases, \n\n[204 U.S. 152, 159]\n\u00a0\n to new applications, and farther than they properly can be made to go. Whether we are to distinguish or to identify taxes on sales and taxes on goods depends on the scope of the constitutional provision concerned. Compare Foppiano v. Speed, \n199 \nU.S. 501, 520\n, 50 S. L. ed. 288, 292, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 138. A tax on foreign bills of lading may be held equivalent to a tax on exports as against article 1,  9; a license tax on importers of foreign goods may be held an unauthorized interference with commerce; and yet it would be consistent to sustain a tax on sales within the state as against the 14th Amendment, so far as that alone is concerned. Whatever the right of parties engaged in commerce among the states, a sale depends in part on the law of the state where it takes place for its validity and, in the courts of that state, at least, for the mode of proof. No one would contest the power to enact a statute of frauds for such transactions. Therefore the state may make parties pay for the help of its laws, as against this objection. A statute requiring a memorandum in writing is quite as clearly a regulation of the business as a tax. It is unnecessary to consider other answers to this point.\n Yet another ground on which the owners of stock are said to be deprived of their property without due process of law is the adoption of the face value of the shares as the basis of the tax. One of the stocks was worth $30.75 a share of the face value of $100, the other $172. The inequality of the tax, so far as actual values are concerned, is manifest. But, here again equality in this sense has to yield to practical considerations and usage. There must be a fixed and indisputable mode of ascertaining a stamp tax. In another sense, moreover, there is equality. When the taxes on two sales are equal, the same number of shares is sold in each case; that is to say, the same privilege is used to the same extent. Valuation is not the only thing to be considered. As was pointed out by the court of appeals, the familiar stamp tax of 2 cents on checks, irrespective of amount, the poll tax of a fixed sum, irrespective of income or earning capacity, and many others, illustrate the \n\n[204 U.S. 152, 160]\n\u00a0\n necessity and practice of sometimes substituting count for weight. See Bell's Gap R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n134 U.S. 232\n, 33 L. ed. 892, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 533; Merchants' & M. Nat. Bank v. Pennsylvania, \n167 U.S. 461\n, 42 L. ed. 236, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 829. Without going farther into a discussion which, perhaps, could have been spared in view of the decision in Thomas v. United States, \n192 U.S. 363\n, 48 L. ed. 481, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 305, and the constitutional restrictions upon Congress, we are of opinion that the New York statute is valid, so far as the 14th Amendment is concerned.\n The other ground of attack is that the act is an interference with commerce among the several states. Cases were imagined, which, it was said, would fall within the statute, and yet would be cases of such commerce; and it was argued that if the act embraced any such cases it was void as to them, and, if void as to them, void altogether, on a principle often stated. United States v. Ju Toy, \n198 \nU.S. 253, 262\n, 49 S. L. ed. 1040, 1043, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 644. That the act is void as to transactions in commerce between the states, if it applies to them, is thought to be shown by the decisions concerning ordinances requiring a license fee from drummers, so called, and the like. Robbins v. Taxing District, \n120 U.S. 489\n, 30 L. ed. 694, 1 Inters. Com. Rep. 45, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 592; Stockard v. Morgan, \n185 U.S. 27\n, 46 L. ed. 785, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 576; Rearick v. Pennsylvania, \n203 U.S. 507\n, 51 L. ed. 295, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 159.\n But there is a point beyond which this court does not consider arguments of this sort for the purpose of invalidating the tax laws of a state on constitutional grounds. This limit has been fixed in many cases. It is that unless the party setting up the unconstitutionality of the state law belongs to the class for whose sake the constitutional protection is given, or the class primarily protected, this court does not listen to his objections, and will not go into imaginary cases, notwithstanding the seeming logic of the position that it must do so, because if, for any reason, or as against any class embraced, the law is unconstitutional, it is void as to all. Albany County v. Stanley, \n105 \nU.S. 305, 311\n, 26 S. L. ed. 1044, 1049; Clark v. Kansas City, \n176 \nU.S. 114, 118\n, 44 S. L. ed. 392, 396, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 284; Lampasas v. Bell, \n180 \nU.S. 276, 283\n, 284 S., 45 L. ed. 527, 530, 531, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 368; Cronin v. Adams, \n192 \nU.S. 108, 114\n, 48 S. L. ed. 365, 368, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 219. If the law is valid when confined to the \n\n[204 U.S. 152, 161]\n\u00a0\n class of the party before the court, it may be more or less of a speculation to inquire what exceptions the state court may read into general words, or how far it may sustain an act that partially fails. With regard to taxes, especially, perhaps it might be assumed that the legislature meant them to be valid to whatever extent they could be sustained, or some other peculiar principle might be applied. See, e. g., People's Nat. Bank v. Marye, \n191 \nU.S. 272, 283\n, 48 S. L. ed. 180, 186, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 68.\n Whatever the reason, the decisions are clear, and it was because of them that it was inquired so carefully in the drummer cases whether the party concerned was himself engaged in commerce between the states. Stockard v. Morgan, \n185 \nU.S. 27, 30\n, 35 S., 36, 46 L. ed. 785, 789, 793, 794, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 576; Caldwell v. North Carolina, \n187 U.S. 622\n, 47 L. ed. 336, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 229; Rearick v. Pennsylvania, supra. Therefore we begin with the same inquiry in this case, and it is plain that we can get no farther. There is not a shadow of a ground for calling the transaction described such commerce. The communications between the parties were not between different states, as in Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Texas, \n105 U.S. 460\n, 26 L. ed. 1067, and the bargain did not contemplate or induce the transport of property from one state to another, as in the drummer cases. Rearick v. Pennsylvania. The bargain was not affected in any way, legally or practically, by the fact that the parties happened to have come from another state before they made it. It does not appear that the petitioner came into New York to sell his stock, as it was put on his behalf. It appears only that he sold after coming into the state. But we are far from implying that it would have made any difference if he had come to New York with the supposed intent before any bargain was made.\n It is said that the property sold was not within the state. The immediate object of sale was the certificate of stock present in New York. That document was more than evidence, it was a constituent of title. No doubt, in a more remote sense, the object was the membership or share which the certificate conferred or made attainable. More remotely still it was an \n\n[204 U.S. 152, 162]\n\u00a0\n interest in the property of the corporation, which might be in other states than either the corporation or the certificate of stock. But we perceive no relevancy in the analysis. The facts that the property sold is outside of the state, and the seller and buyer foreigners, are not enough to make a sale commerce with foreign nations or among the several states, and that is all that there is here. On the general question there should be compared with the drummer cases the decisions on the other side of the line. Nathan v. Louisiana, 8 How. 73, 12 L. ed. 992; Woodruff v. Parham, 8 Wall. 123, 19 L. ed. 382; Brown v. Houston, \n114 U.S. 622\n, 29 L. ed. 257, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1091; Emert v. Missouri, \n156 U.S. 296\n, 39 L. ed. 430, 5 Inters. Com. Rep. 68, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 367. A tax is not an unconstitutional regulation in every case where an obsolute prohibition of sales would be one. American Steel & Wire Co. v. Speed, \n192 U.S. 500\n, 48 L. ed. 538, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 365. We think it unnecessary to explain at greater length the reasons for our opinion that the petitioner has suffered no unconstitutional wrong.\n Order affirmed. \n\n\n\n","123":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPEROVICH v. U S(1907)\nNo. 405\nArgued: Decided: March 11, 1907\n\n\n\n No counsel for plaintiff in error. \n\n[205 U.S. 86, 87]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General Cooley and Solicitor General Hoyt for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[205 U.S. 86, 88]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n On July 17, 1905, Vuko Perovich, now plaintiff in error, was indicted in the United States district court of Alaska, \n\n[205 U.S. 86, 89]\n\u00a0\n third division, for the murder of Jacob Jaconi. The trial, on August 5, 1905, resulted in a verdict of 'guilty of murder in the first degree, and that he suffer death.' Motions for a new trial and arrest of judgment having been overruled, he was, on September 15, 1905, sentenced to be hanged. To review The record was filed in this court on September 24, 1906, and on application the case was advanced for hearing on January 21, 1907. No counsel appeared for plaintiff in error and no brief was or has been filed in his behalf. The case was submitted by the government on its brief. Although unaided by counsel for plaintiff in error, we have carefully examined the record and considered the assignments of error.\n The testimony in the case was circumstantial. No witness saw the killing. Indeed, the first and principal question is whether there was a homicide. Jaconi was a fisherman, living alone in a log cabin covered by a tent, about midway between Fairbanks and Chena, a distance of about 4 miles from each place. On October 28, 1904, the last time he was seen alive, he was at Fairbanks between 1 and 2 o'clock in the afternoon, and had in his possession several nuggests, a Yukon gold ring, a gold chain, watch charm, and some money, part of which he peposited in a bank. In the early morning of October 29 the dogs of the deceased were heard barking, and two shots from a gun were heard in the direction of his cabin. On that day about noon one who had been the partner of Jaconi arrived at his camp and found the cabin in which the deceased had lived partially destroyed by fire and the fire still burning. In the rear where the bunk had been he saw the back part of a head, a leg bone, and the trunk of a man. The head was sunken on the chest. While the cabin was not totally destroyed, it was burned more towards the back where the bunk had been, and the ground in the vicinity of the bunk was saturated with oil. It appeared that Jaconi had in his cabin about one and one-half gollons of olive oil. On that day or the next several witnesses were at the cabin and saw \n\n[205 U.S. 86, 90]\n\u00a0\n the skull and the other parts of the skeleton, still smoking, and the bones so burned that they crumbled to pieces when touched. Some two weeks before the fire the defendant had said to a witness that he was broke, but knew where he could get some money if he had a partner to go with him, as there was a man who lived about 5 miles from Chena who had $500, a watch and chain, a ring and a gun. On October 15 he was at the cabin of Jaconi about daylight. At that time he said to the former partner of Jaconi, when asked what he wanted, that he was traveling and looking for a job. On October 20 defendant and a witness went to Chena and on their way stopped at the cabin of Jaconi. After leaving, defendant told witness that he had been there several times before, and that the deceased had a roll of money, and that he would lick him with an ax some day and throw him in the water, or that he would make a fire and burn everything up. On October 28, the day on which Jaconi was last seen, the defendant was at Fairbanks, and said he was going to the cabin of one of his countrymen to see if he could find anything in it. On October 29, between half past 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon, he arrived at a camp about 20 miles from Chena. He had a rifle and a canvas bag in his possession, a Yukon ring and a gold watch and chain. He made different and contradictory statements about the watch. On November 5 he was arrested, having in his possession $5 and a gold watch. He said that he traded a nugget chain with two men for a sack of clothes and the watch. Later a sack of clothes was found where he had left it. He said that he and his partner had made the chain, and that he had bought his partner's interest in it. His partner testified that they owned the nugget chain, and that it had never been out of his possession after it was made. Several of these articles and others found in possession of the defendant were identified as the property of Jaconi. Other circumstances of a similar nature were also shown in evidence.\n It is assigned for error that the court overruled a motion \n\n[205 U.S. 86, 91]\n\u00a0\n to instruct the jury to bring in a verdict of not guilty for the reason that the corpus delicti had not been proved. This motion was made after the plaintiff had rested, and, upon its being overruled, the defendant proceeded to offer testimony. The motion was not thereafter renewed. Without resting upon the proposition that introducing testimony after such a motion has been overruled is a waiver of any exception to the action of the court (Union P. R. Co. v. Daniels [Union P. R. Co. v. Snyder] \n152 U.S. 684\n, 38 L. ed. 597, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 756; Runkle v. Burnham, \n153 U.S. 216\n, 38 L. ed. 694, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 837; Hansen v. Boyd, \n161 U.S. 397\n, 40 L. ed. 746, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 571), we are of the opinion that neither at that time nor at the close of all the testimony would the court have been justified in withdrawing the case from the jury. While it is true there was no witness to the homicide and the identification of the body found in the cabin was not perfect, owing to its condition, caused by fire, yet, taking all the circumstances together, there was clearly enough to warrant the jury in finding that the partially burned body was that of Jaconi and that he had been killed by the defendant. Upon this question the case of Com. v. Williams, 171 Mass. 461, 50 N. E. 1035, is closely in point and instructive. While the particular facts are not identical, the character and scope of the testimony are substantially the same.\n Again, it is alleged that there was error in overruling a motion made by defendant to strike out all the testimony given by a deputy marshal of conversations between him and the defendant. As these conversations were not induced by duress, intimidation, or other improper influences, but were perfectly voluntary, there is no reason why they should not have been received.\n Other matters referred to in the assignment of errors require but slight notice. One is that the court erred in refusing to appoint an interpreter when the defendant was testifying. This is a matter largely resting in the discretion of the trial court, and it does not appear from the answers made by the witness that there was any abuse of such discretion.\n Error is also alleged in refusing an instruction as to the \n\n[205 U.S. 86, 92]\n\u00a0\n evidence necessary to establish the corpus delicti. It is enough, in answer to this objection, to refer to the summary of the testimony we have already given, and to note the fact that the court instructed that the evidence must be such as to satisfy the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\n The defense asked one or two instructions, such as this: 'The fact that Jacob Jaconi has not been seen since the 28th day of October, 1904, does not create a presumption of his death.' Singlish out a single matter and emphasizing it by special instruction as ofter tends to mislead as to guide a jury. Doubtless the isolated fact that Jaconi had not been seen would not of itself establish the fact of his death. It is only a circumstance which, taken in connection with the other facts in the case, tends to prove the death. It is merely one link in a long chain, and the court is seldom called upon by special instructions to single out any single link in a chain, and affirm either its strength or weakness. Grand Trunk R. Co. v. Ives, \n144 \nU.S. 408, 433\n, 36 S. L. ed. 485, 494, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 679; Rio Grande Western R. Co. v. Leak, \n163 \nU.S. 280, 288\n, 41 S. L. ed. 160, 162, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1020\n\n\n Objection is made to the instruction in reference to reasonable doubt. This instruction is taken from the charge of Chief Justice Shaw to the jury in Com. v. Webster, 5 Cush. 295, 320, 52 Am. Dec. 711, and that case has been cited with approval by this court. Miles v. United States, \n103 \nU.S. 304, 312\n, 26 S. L. ed. 481, 484.\n These are all the questions which we deem it necessary to notice, and while we should have been glad to have had the assistance of counsel for plaintiff in error, yet we are satisfied from our examination of the record that the defendant was properly convicted, and the judgment is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","124":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPETERSON v. CHICAGO, R I & P R CO(1907)\nNo. 225\nArgued: Decided: April 8, 1907\n\n\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Day:\n This case comes here upon a certificate from the circuit court of the United States for the northern district of Texas, raising the question of the jurisdiction of that court over an action brought by plaintiffs in error, Augusta A. Peterson and Ida Peterson, the latter a minor, suing by her mother and next friend, and both being citizens of Texas, against the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railroad Company, an Illinois corporation.\n The plaintiffs in error, wife and daughter of one John Peterson, an employee of the Pacific company, sought recovery for the alleged negligent killing of said John Peterson while engaged as an engineer in its employ at Chickasha, in the Indian territory, on October 19, 1903. It is charged in the petition that the Pacific company was then engaged in carrying on its business in the state of Texas in the name and through the Chicago, Rock Island, & Gulf Railroad, a corporation of the state of Texas, which latter corporation, it was alleged, was \n\n[205 U.S. 364, 365]\n\u00a0\n an auxiliary corporation and agent of the defendant, and was then and there dominated and controlled by it, its lines of railroad being operated by the Pacific company as a part of the Rock Island system.\n It was charged that S. B. Hovey, vice president and general manager of the Gulf company, residing in Tarrant county, Texas, was also the general manager and local agent of the Pacific company in that state. It was also alleged that F. E. Merrell was the local agent in Tarrant county, Texas, of the Pacific company, and that M. E. Sebree was the local agent for it in said county and state.\n Service of citation was made on the defendants by serving the parties above named as its agents in Tarrant county, Texas, in pursuance of the statute of the state. The defendant moved to quash the service on the ground that none of the parties were such agents, and filed in support of its motion the affidavits of each,-Hovey, Merrell, and Sebree,-denying such agency. Thereafter plaintiffs made application for additional process in pursuance of a later statute of the state of Texas, to be hereinafter noticed, and charged that A. L. Thomas, who resides in Tarrant county, Texas, was a train conductor engaged in handling trains over the tracks of the Gulf railroad in the state of Texas and over those of the Pacific railroad beyond the limits of the state, and that he was engaged in running and handling passenger trains on the tracks of both said companies on both sides of the state line, and is an agent and representative of the defendant company, residing in Tarrant county, Texas. It was further charged that V. N. Turpin, who resides in Fort Worth, Tarrant county, Texas, was a ticket agent engaged in the selling of tickets and the making of contracts for transportation and for and in behalf of the Pacific company from the city of Fort Worth, Texas, over the lines of the Gulf company, in the state of Texas, and over the line of the defendant company beyond the line of said state, and was an agent and representative of the defendant company in said state and county. \n\n[205 U.S. 364, 366]\n\u00a0\n These persons, Thomas and Turpin, were accordingly served under the application for new process as the agents and representatives of the defendant company in the said county and state.\n The defendant company filed a supplemental motion to quash this service upon the grounds that these persons were not the agents or representatives of the defendant company, filing their affidavits in support of said motion. In the return of the writ served on Hovey it was also set forth that he was general manager of the Pacific company, residing in Tarrant county, Texas. The motion and supplemental motion to quash the service was heard by the court, the motion sustained, and the cause dismissed for want of jurisdiction, the court holding that the defendant had not been properly served with process.\n From the stipulated facts, documentary evidence, and testimony embodied in the bill of exceptions, the following facts, pertinent to the determination of the issues, may be gathered:\n The Pacific company and the Gulf company are both of the 'Rock Island system' of railroads. The second annual report of the 'Rock Island company' (June 30, 1904) shows that it is the owner of the entire capital stock, except directors' shares, of the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railroad Company, a corporation of Iowa; that company owns 695,574.75 shares of the capital stock of the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railway Company, a corporation of the states of Illinois and Iowa, and 286,349 shares of the common capital stock of the St. Louis & San Francisco Railroad Company, a corporation of the state of Missouri, and the report adds:\n'Each of the two latter companies operates independently its lines of railway and each is interested through the ownership, directly or indirectly, of at least the majority of the capital stock in certain subsidiary companies, each of which operates its property independently. The lines of the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railway Company, including lines \n\n[205 U.S. 364, 367]\n\u00a0\n formerly of the Choctaw, Oklahoma, & Gulf Railroad Company, the Burlington, Cedar Rapids, & Northern Railway Company, and the Rock Island, & Peoria Railway Company, together namely, the Chicago, Rock Island, & Gulf namely, th eChicago, Rock Island, & Gulf Reilway Company, and the Chicago, Rock Island, & El Paso Railway Company, comprise what is known as the 'Rock Island system.'\n\n'As the Rock Island company is the owner of the entire capital stock, except directors' shares, of the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railroad Company, the income of both the companies is included in the following statement.'\n\n This report purports to be made by order of the board of directors, was dated October 17, 1904, and was signed by Robert Mather, president. Appended to this report, as a part of it, under the head of 'Statements and Exhibits, Rock Island System Lines,' was the following statement, to wit:\n'On page 23 of said report, under the heading of 'Rock Island System- State of Mileage Operated:'\n\n The Chicago, Rock Island, & Gulf Railway Company:\n Terral, I. T. (Red River), to Dallas, Texas 126.67 Bridgeport, Texas, to Graham, Texas 53.29 Texhoma, O. T., to Bravo, Texas-New Mexico state line 91.75 Texola, O. T. (Texas state line), to Amarillo, Texas 112.97 ___ Total, Chicago, Rock Island, & Gulf Railway Company 386.68\"\n\n Plaintiff also introduced in evidence a railroad folder, dated July 10, 1904, on which was printed in large letters, 'Rock Island System Time- table,' in which appears the names of the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railway Company, Chicago, Rock Island, & El Paso Railway Company, and the Chicago, Rock Island, & Gulf Railway Company, with a list of the names and residences of the passenger and freight agents, and a schedule of the passenger trains on said linnes. \n\n[205 U.S. 364, 368]\n\u00a0\n On the inside of the cover of the folder is a map showing the lines of the said railroad company, so connected as to belong to one system. Below the map is printed:\n'The Rock Island System of America.\n\n'The Rock Island system covers a territory which is 1,000 miles long by 1,000 miles wide, supports a population of more than 21,000,000 people, and is capable of supporting at least four times that many. The area of this territory is as great as the combined area of France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Austria-Hungary, Denmark, the Netherelands, Turkey, Switzerland, and Greece, and its productive capacity is greater.\n\n'Here are produced more than half the wheat, more than half the corn, and nearly half the cotton, silver, and gold produced in the United States.'\n\n The origin of the Gulf company is thus stated in the annual report of the Rock Island road, June 30, 1904:\n'Consolidation of Texas Lines.\n\n'The legislature of the state of Texas, by an act passed March 27th, 1903, authorized the sale of the railroads and properties of the Chicago, Rock Island, & Texas Railway Company, extending from the Red river to Fort Worth, Texas, with a branch from Bridgeport, Texas, to Graham, Texas; the Chicago, Rock Island, & Mexico Railway Company, extending from the Texas- Oklahoma line, near Texhoma, to the Texas-New Mexico line at Bravo; and the Choctaw-Oklahoma & Texas Railroad Company, extending the Texas- Oklahoma line near Texola, Texas, to Amarillo, Texas, to the Chicago, Rock Island, & Gulf Railway Company, which had constructed a line of railroad from Dallas, Texas, to Fort Worth, Texas, where it connected with the line first named above.\n\n'In accordance with the authority granted, the properties referred to were, by appropriate corporate action, deeded to the Chicago, Rock Island , & Gulf Railway Company on December 1, 1903. \n\n[205 U.S. 364, 369]\n\u00a0\n 'This consolidation permits the properties in question to be operated by one management instead of four separate sets of officials, as heretofore, resulting in economy of operation and greater efficiency in service.\n\n'In stating the assets and liabilities of the companies forming the system, the holdings of the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railway Company in the bonds and capital stock of auxiliary lines, together with loans between system companies, have been eliminated from the liabilities, and a like reduection made in the value of the assets; the figures as stated, therefore, represent the value of the assets and the real liability without duplication.'\n\n Plaintiffs also introduced in evidence the twenty-fourth annual report of the Pacific company for the year ending June 30, 1904, in which it is set forth:\n'They have included therein operations and affairs of the operated lines and auxiliary companies forming the 'Rock Island system.'\n\n'In order to make exhibits comparative the figures for the last preceding year have been restated to meet changed conditions due to the including in this report the operation of the auxiliary companies.\n\n'These lines, thus forming the Rock Island system, are the following:\n\n Mileage Operated. The Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railway 6,760.74 The Chicago, Rock Island, & El Paso Railway 111.50 The Chicago, Rock Island, & Gulf Railway 386.92\n\n'On page 9 of said report, under the head of 'Property' and 'Franchises,' occur the following:\n\n'During the year expenditures were made for construction of extensions and completion of system lines as follows:\n\n Yarnall, Texas, to Amarillo, Texas 108,615 64 Jacksboro, Texas, to Graham, Texas 32,138 96 \n\n[205 U.S. 364, 370]\n\u00a0\n Red River to Fort Worth, Texas 28,013 04 Texhoma (Texas state line) to Bravo, Texas 9,646 03 Texola (Texas state line) to Yarnall, Texas 2,328 30\n'In addition to the expenditures during the year as above, there has been transferred to property account sundry amounts expended prior to July 1st, 1903, for construction of new lines and shops, and purchase of equipment, which have been heretofore stated in the system assets as 'Advances for Construction and Equipment,' the property represented by such amounts having been deeded to the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railway Company or the Chicago, Rock Island, & Gulf Railway Company, $23, 169.83.\n\n'There has also been transferred to this account the expenditures made prior to July 1st, 1903, for the purchase of shares of capital stock of the Burlington, Cedar Rapids, & Northern Railway Company and the Rock Island & Peoria Railway Company, also cost of stock of the Choctaw, Oklahoma, & Gulf Railroad Company in excess of its par value and the value of bonds of the Chicago, Rock Island, & Texas Railway Company, owned by the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railway Company, the value of said property appearing upon balance sheets shown in prior year's report as 'Stocks and Bonds of Constituent Companies,' $16,446,009.73.\n\n'On page 11 of said report, under the heading 'New Lines Open for Operation,' the following statements are made, viz.:\n\n'Additions have been made to the operated system-mileage since the last report as follows:\n\n'By the Chicago, Rock Island, & Gulf Railway Company, Fort Worth, Texas, to Dallas, Texas, 33.26 miles, opened for operation in December, 1903\n\n\n\n'Yarnall, Texas, to end of track west of Amarillo, Texas, 18.40 miles, opened for operation in November, 1903.\n\n'Corrections in measurements, Red Rives to Fort Worth, Texas, .83 miles.\n\n'Operated system mileage was decreased 18.22 miles between Yarnall, Texas, and Amarillo, Texas. \n\n[205 U.S. 364, 371]\n\u00a0\n 'Fort Worth, Texas, to Dallas, Texas.-This line was completed and the line opened for operation by the Chicago, Rock Island, & Gulf Railway Company, December 1st, 1903. It is 33.26 miles in length, connecting with the line of the former the Chicago, Rock Island, & Texas Railway Company at Fort Worth, and extending to Dallas, where, by an agreement with the Gulf, Colorado, & Santa F e Railway Company, it has the joint use of the latter company's terminal facilities.\n\n'The opening of this line gives the Gulf company direct entrance into Dallas, enabling it to compete for the traffic of that important commercial center.\n\n'On page 12 of said report is the following statement, viz.:\n\n System Mileage Under Construction.\n By the Chicago, Rock Island, & Gulf Railway Company:\n Amarillo, Texas, to Texas-New Mexico boundary 69.87\n'Amarillo, Texas, to Tucumcari, New Mexico. The grading for a considerable portion of this line has been done from Amarillo westward.\n\n'It was deemed advisable, however, to suspend active construction until such time as the business outlook would warrant the expenditure necessary to complete.'\n\n Upon the hearing counsel made an agreed statement of facts, as follows:\n'The Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railway Company is a consolidated corporation, chartered under the laws of Illinois and Iowa. It has been an existing railroad corporation for over twenty years. In June of the year 1892, and for some years prior to that time, the said railway company owned and operated a line of railway from the city of Chicago, in a southwesterly direction through the states of Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, and Kansas to Minco, Indian territory. During the year 1892 this company extended its line from Minco, Indian territory, in a southerly direction to the north boundary line of Texas in Montague county. \n\n[205 U.S. 364, 372]\n\u00a0\n 'The Chicago, Rock Island, & Texas Railway Company was a corporation organized under the laws of Texas on the 15th day of July, 1892. It had an authorized capital stock of $3,000,000 in shares of $100 each, of which 754 shares were subscribed for at the time of its organization. Below is a list of the names of the stockholders and the number of shares of capital stock of this company subscribed for by each, at its original organization.\n\n [The list shows that of the 754 shares subscribed, 745 were held by one of the attorneys of the Pacific company, and of the other nine shares, three were held by other employees of that road.]\n'Under the charter of the Chicago, Rock Island, & Texas Railway Company, it was authorized to construct a line of road from the north boundary line of Texas at a point in Montague county in a southerly direction through Montague, Wise, and Parker counties; the charter, being afterward amended, authorized the construction into Tarrant county. This charter authorized the issuance of first-mortgage bonds amounting to $15, 000 per mile for construction and not exceeding $5,000 per mile for equipment,\n\n'When the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railway Company constructed its line to a point near the north bank of the Red river, north of Montague county, construction work stopped for a period of time. The Chicago, Rock Island, & Texas Railway Company began the construction of its line at the north line of the state in Montague county some time after the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railway Company stopped work at a point north of Red river. After construction work began on the Chicago, Rock Island, & Texas Railway Company south of Red river, the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railway Company constructed its line from the point where work had stopped north of Red river, to a connection with the Chicago, Rock Island, & Texas Railway Company at the state line. The Texas com- \n\n[205 U.S. 364, 373]\n\u00a0\n pany finished the construction of its line into Forth Worth in the latter part of 1893. Some of the same contractors who constructed the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railway from Minco south to Red river also took contracts for work on the Texas line.\n\n'On the 2d day of January, 1893, after the Chicago, Rock Island, & Texas Railway Company had constructed and was operating its line as far south as Bowie, Texas, it entered into an agreement with the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railway Company, a true copy of which is hereto attached and marked 'Exhibit A' for identification. This agreement went into effect immediately after it was executed, and was acted upon and observed by said companies until the 14th day of April, 1903, when the same was canceled under authority of the board of directors of each company by a written agreement, a true copy of which is hereto attached, marked 'Exhibit B' for identification.\n\n [Exhibits A and B are not printed, as they are the contract and cancelation thereof, both made before the present case arose.]\n'After the Chicago, Rock Island, & Texas Railway Company had constructed its line, it issued first-mortgage bonds to the extent of $15, 000 per mile thereon, and these bonds were purchased by the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railway Company, for which it paid the Texas line 100 cents on the dollar. The Chicago, Rock Island, & Texas line cost a large sum of money in excess of the amounts for which it issued bonds, which additional cost was paid by application of money subscribed by the stockholders and by borrowing from the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railway Company, which money so borrowed has long since been returned with interest.\n\n'At the time the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railway Company constructed its line to Red River there was no town or city at that particular point, but there were towns and cities south, east, and west of there in the state of Texas, \n\n[205 U.S. 364, 374]\n\u00a0\n and a railroad line, being a part of the Missouri, Kansas, & Texas Railway of Texas, 9 miles south of that point.\n\n'When the Chicago, Rock Island, & Texas Railway Company was first organized its general offices were located at Bowie, Montague county, Texas, and remained there for some time, until the charter was amended removing them to Fort Worth. The first general officers elected by the Chicago, Rock Island, & Texas Railway Company, and their residences, were as follows: M. A. Low, Topeka, Kansas, president; J. C. McCabe, Bowie, Texas, general freight agent, and H. F. Weber, Bowie, Texas, vice president, superintendent, secretary, and treasurer. All these men, prior to the time they were elected officials of the Chicago, Rock Island, & Texas Railway Company had been employed in some capacity by the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railway Company. In 1893 S. B. Hovey was elected vice president of the Texas company and remained the vice president and superintendent of the Chicago, Rock Island, & Texas Railway Company from that date until it was sold out under an act of the legislature in 1903. Mr. M. E. Sebree, who was served with citation in this case, was, for a number of years and until the date of its sale, trainmaster of the Chicago, Rock Island, & Texas Railway Company and assistant trainmaster of the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railway Company, with jurisdiction on that line up to Chickasha, Indian territory. Prior to the time he was employed by the Chicago, Rock Island, & Texas Railway Company he had been employed by the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railway Company as brakeman, conductor, etc. M. A. Low, of Topeka, Kansas, remained the President of the Chicago, Rock Island, & Texas Railway Company from its organization until the 8th day of November, 1900, during all of which time he was one of the general attorneys of the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railway Company.\n\n'The Chicago, Rock Island, & Texas Railway Company never issued or sold any equipment bonds, but before it was \n\n[205 U.S. 364, 375]\n\u00a0\n sold out under special act of the legislature to the Chicago, Rock Island , & Gulf Railway Company, it had purchased and was the owner of between one thousand and twelve hundred freight cars of various kinds. During the time it had no equipment of its own, it rented rolling stock from various railway companies, but principally from the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railway Company, and paid therefor prices prevailing between other lines of railway in the state of Texas.\n\n'After the Chicago, Rock Island, & Texas Railway Company constructed its line into Forth Worth from Bowie, and after the execution of the contract between it and the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railway Company, of date of January 2d, 1893, the most of the passenger and freight trains running over its line from Red River to Fort Worth and from Fort Worth to Red River were operated beyond its lines as the trains of the Chicago, Rock Island, & Racific Railway Company. The employees operating these trains were under the control of and paid by the Chicago, Rock Island, & Texas Railway Company while working on its line, and they were also under the control of and paid by the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railway Company while on its line. The equipment in the various trains went as far north as the business justified, some of the passenger equipment going as far as Chicago, and some to Kansas City, while the freight equipment stopped at points beginning at Chickasha, and from there north wherever the freight was destined. The passenger equipment coming south stopped at Fort Worth, and the freight equipment, where the freight was handled in car-load lots, went to destination, wherever that might be.\n\n'Whenever necessary the Texas company would operate a local train to handle freight between Fort Worth and Red River, but as a general rule the through service maintained took care of this business. It operated a local freight and passenger train between Bridgeport and Jacksboro and afterward to Graham from the time that branch was built until it was sold out, which was several years. On the through \n\n[205 U.S. 364, 376]\n\u00a0\n freight trains the run made by the crews was from Fort Worth to Chickasha and on the through passenger train the run made by the crews was from Fort Worth to Caldwell, Kansas, these crews being handled and paid as above set forth. Outside the Pullman cars, which were in each passenger train, nearly all the passenger equipment used by the Chicago, Rock Island, & Texas Railway Company belonged to the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railway Company, for which it paid rental, as provided for under the terms of the contract herein first referred to.\n\n'Defendant's witness will testify that the Texas company paid no part of the cost of operating the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railway, nor did the Pacific company pay any part of the cost of the operation of the Chicago, Rock Island, & Texas Railway, nor did either of them participate in the earnings of the other. The relationship between the companies is fully disclosed by the terms of the contract dated January 2d, 1893, which was observed up to the time of its cancelation.\n\n'The passenger conductors, brakemen, and train guards wear regular train uniforms and on the lapel of the coat are the words 'Rock Island,' and on the cap is the word 'Conductor,' 'Brakeman' or 'Porter.' Any member of these train crews, while working on the line of the Texas company, may be discharged by the proper officer of that company; and while working on the line of the Pacific company may be discharged by the proper officer of that company. Either company, of course, employs additional men when needed.\n\n'At the time the contract of January 2d, 1893, was canceled, the Chicago, Rock Island, & Texas Railway Company was operating about 140 miles of road, and the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific was operating about 3,300 miles. For a considerable time after the Chicago, Rock Island, & Texas Railway Company was built into Fort Worth it employed and maintained at its Fort Worth office a train despatcher, who gave orders for the \n\n[205 U.S. 364, 377]\n\u00a0\n movement of trains over its line, but as a matter of economy this was abolished, and the Texas company paid a part of the salary of the train despatcher located at Chickasha to give orders for the movement of trains over its rails.\n\n'On the 22d day of September, 1903, the Chicago, Rock Island, & Texas Railway Company, under authority of a special act of the legislature known as Senate Bill No. 161, was purchased and absorbed by the Chicago, Rock Island, & Gulf Railway Company, and since that time has ceased to exist as a railroad or do any business as such.\n\n'At the time the Gulf company purchased the Texas company it had constructed and was operating a line of road from Fort Worth in Tarrant county to Dallas in Dallas county. The Chicago, Rock Island, & Gulf Railway Company now owns and operates 386 miles of road, all of which is located inside of the state of Texas. It does not own any railroad outside the state of Texas. It owns at the present time about 1,600 cars, including ballast, refrigerator, and cattle cars, twenty locomotives, and eight cabooses, but does not own any passenger equipment other than the Pullman cars which are used in each of its passenger trains; it rents its passenger equipment from the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railway Company, and pays therefor current rental charged by connecting lines in Texas. The train crews on both the through passenger and freight trains are handled in the same way that they were when the line into Fort Worth was operated by the Chicago, Rock Island, & Texas Railway Company, but the Chicago, Rock Island, & Gulf Railway Company is now operating in many places local trains between local points in Texas.\n\n'The following is a list of stockholders and the amount of stock of the Chicago, Rock Island, & Gulf Railway Company owned by each.\n\n [The list is not printed, as the record discloses that, except directors' shares, the stock is held for the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railway Company.] \n\n[205 U.S. 364, 378]\n\u00a0\n 'The Chicago, Rock Island, & Gulf Railway Company is operating under a lease that part of the line of the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railway Company which begins at the north boundary line of the state of Texas, extending northward to the town of Terral, Indian territory, a distance of about one and one-sixth miles.\n'Blank passes, properly signed by different railroads, including the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific, Texas & Pacific, Houston & Texas Central, and other lines, are sometimes placed with S. B. Hovey, and when so placed he has the permission of such line to fill in the names of parties and countersign the pass, and when so countersigned such pass is recognized by the line over which it is issued. The local ticket agents of the Chicago, Rock Island, & Gulf Railway Company sell coupons tickets over the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railway Company's line and nearly all other lines in the United States, which tickets are duly honored by the respecive roads over which they read. The Chicago, Rock Island, & Gulf Railway Company operates only one passenger train each way daily between Fort Worth and Dallas, while it operates two trains each way from Fort Worth north. It operates also only a local freight service between Fort Worth and Dallas, but no through freight service. Proper officials of the Chicago, Rock Island, & Gulf Railway Company and of the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railway Company exchange reports with each other as to the amount of exchange business done.\n\n'No dividends were ever paid on the stock of the Chicago, Rock Island , & Texas Railway Company, and none have been paid on that of the Chicago, Rock Island, & Gulf Railway Company. The net earnings of the Chicago, Rock Island, & Texas Railway Company were put into betterments and improvements, and the same is the case with the Chicago, Rock Island, & Gulf.\n\n'In 1897 L. G. Hastings, then secretary of the Chicago, Rock Island, & Texas Railway Company, reported to the \n\n[205 U.S. 364, 379]\n\u00a0\n Interstate Commerce Commission that the Chicago, Rock Island, & Texas Railway Company was controlled by the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railway Company, through the ownership of a majority of its bonds. In 1899 he reported it as controlled by the Pacific company, through its ownership of a majority of its capital stock.\n\n'On the 2d day of August, 1904, M. E. Sebree, who resides in Fort Worth, Texas, was trainmaster of the Chicago, Rock Island, & Gulf Railway Company, and was also assistant trainmaster of the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railway Company between the north line of Texas and Chickasha, Indian territory. He is paid by the Gulf company for the work he does for it and by the Pacific company for the work he does for it. S. B. Hovey is vice president and superintendent of the Chicago, Rock Island, & Gulf Railway Company, and will testify that he is not connected with, nor does he perform any service for, any other railroad.\n\n'After making certain changes and addition, the Chicago, Rock Island , & Gulf Railway Company adopted the book of rules issued by the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railway Company for the control of the operation of its line, and such rules are now in force. The cars and engines belonging to the Chicago, Rock Island, & Gulf Railway Company, when in need of repairs, have the work done at its shops at Fort Worth and Dalhart, if the cars and engines are convenient to these two points; otherwise, the work is done at some other convenient place, either on or off the line of the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railway Company, wherever the cars or engines may be at the time the repairs are needed.\n\n'On the 2d day of August, 1904, the Chicago, Rock Island, & Gulf Railway Company had a different president and altogether different executive officers from any of the lines above listed as included in the Rock Island system. The Chicago, Rock Island, & Gulf Railway Company does not now and never has paid any part of the salary of any officer of the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railway Company, \n\n[205 U.S. 364, 380]\n\u00a0\n or of any of the lines named as constituting the Rock Island system.\n\n'Before the Chicago, Rock Island, & Gulf Railway Company purchased the Chicago, Rock Island, & Texas Railway Company, the Chicago, Rock Island, & Mexico Railway Company and the Choctaw, Oklahoma, & Texas Railroad Company, M. E. Sebree was trainmaster of the Chicago, Rock Island , & Texas Railway Company, and division trainmaster of the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railway Company, with jurisdiction to Chickasha, Indian territory. Since the purchase by the Gulf company of the abovenamed Texas lines Mr. Sebree's jurisdiction extends over what were the Chicago, Rock Island, & Mexico Railway Company and the Choctaw, Oklahoma, & Texas Railroad Company; otherwise there has been no change in his employment or jurisdiction for the past five to ten years.\n\n'The Chicago, Rock Island, & Gulf Railway Company pays a portion of the salary of a joint train despatcher located at Chickasha, Indian territory, under the same character of arrangement which existed between the Chicago, Rock Island, & Texas Railway Company and the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railway Company. This train despatcher, in giving orders for the handling of trains on the Chicago, Rock Island, & Gulf Railway Company, is subject to the control, direction, and supervision of the executive officers of the Chicago, Rock Island, & Gulf Railway Company as if exclusively employed by it.\n\n'The rails of the Chicago, Rock Island, & Gulf Railway Company on the line running from Fort Worth north connects at the state line with the rails of the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railway Company. The point of connection is somewhere near the middle of Red river on a bridge. At this particular point there is no town, station, or turnout, and the trains going in either direction do not stop at said point. It was not possible to build a town or station at the exact point of connection.' \n\n[205 U.S. 364, 381]\n\u00a0\n It was further stipulated as to Thomas, the conductor, and Turpin, the ticket agent, after they were served with process, as follows:\n\n A. L. Thomas 'was, at the date of said service, and is now, and has for many years been, a conductor running on and handling passenger trains for the defendant, the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railway Company, the Chicago, Rock Island, & Texas Railway Company, and later on the Chicago, Rock Island, & Gulf Railway Company, after its purchase of the Texas company, running and handling such trains between Fort Worth, Texas, and Caldwell, Kansas. That the run of said Thomas is now and has been from Fort Worth, Texas, to Caldwell, Kansas, as aforesaid, on both sides of the state line, and that Caldwell, Kansas, is the end of the first passenger division on said lines north of Fort Worth. And it is further agreed that V. N. Turpin, upon whom process was served herein as the ticket agent of the defendant company, was, at the date of the service of said process and has been for a long time, ticket agent of the Chicago, Rock Island, & Gulf Railway Company at Fort Worth, engaged in selling tickets for the said Chicago, Rock Island, & Gulf Railway Company, over its lines and also over the lines of the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railway Company and all of its connections. It is further agreed that the facts are that 'Thomas is carried on the Pacific company's pay roll and paid for services rendered while on that company's line north of the Texas state line; and is carried on the Gulf company's pay roll and paid by the Gulf company for services rendered on its line south of the Texas state line; and that Turpin is carried on the Gulf company's pay roll alone, and is not carried on the Pacific company's pay roll, and is not an agent of the Pacific company, unless the above-stated facts make him one.\"\n The annual report of the Pacific company shows that the board of directors of said company consists of thirteen members, with an executive committee of eight members. \n\n[205 U.S. 364, 382]\n\u00a0\n The report of the Rock Island company shows that the board of directors of said company consists of sixteen members and its financial committee of six members.\n Eleven members of the board of directors of the Pacific company are also members of the board of directors of the Rock Island company. Five members of the executive committee of the Pacific company are also members of the finance committee of the Rock Island company. The officers of the Rock Island company, with two exceptions, are also officers of the Pacific company, and a majority of the officers of either said companies are common to both of them.\n S. B. Hovey, upon whom service was made as aforesaid, was also produced as a witness, and testified that at the time of the service of citation upon him he was the vice president and superintendent of the Gulf railroad company, and resided at Fort Worth, Texas; that he held the same position in the Chicago, Rock Island, & Texas Company before it acquired the Gulf company, and before that time he had been for many years an employee of the Pacific company; that the train despatcher of the Pacific company, located on its lines at Chickasha, in the Indian territory, is also train despatcher of the Gulf company. He was a 'joint man,' as the trains were operated by the same crews across the Texas state line without stopping; that the movements of trains on the Gulf route are directed from Chickasha as are those on the line of the Pacific company after they cross the state line going northward. The daily reports of the cars on the Gulf line are made to the chief despatcher at Chickasha; that the business could not be handled in any other way.\n Settlements between the two companies are made on a mileage basis. Reports are made by the officers of the Gulf company to Mr. Winchel, who is president of the Gulf company and of the Pacific company. The Gulf company keeps a fund on deposit with the Pacific company at Chicago and receives interest thereon; that when the defendant company \n\n[205 U.S. 364, 383]\n\u00a0\n constructed its line of road across the Red river in 1892 the Texas company was organized, and the Pacific company furnished the money with which the road was constructed south from Red River to Fort Worth. Most of the directors of the Texas company were employees of the Pacific company. No dividends were paid on the stock of the Texas company, and when the Gulf company took over its property the directors surrendered their stock in the old company and got back their $5.00 each; that the transfer to the Gulf company of the Texas road, the El Paso road, and the Mexico road was for the purpose of consolidating these roads and getting under one management the management of the system. The employees who run over both the Pacific and Gulf lines while in Texas are employed and discharged by the latter company; north of the Texas line they are employed and discharged by the Pacific company; the operation of trains was then as it had been before the Rock Island & Texas road ceased to exist; that the Pacific company did not pay any part of the salaries of the heads of the departments of the Gulf company,-none for the general office. It, the Pacific company, pays the train men according to the number of miles run on its rails. The Gulf company pays the expenses of the men while on the rails of that company according to the number of miles run; that the Rock Island & Gulf Company had separate cars, servants, and agents of its own; that the Gulf company lines booked trains daily between Fort Worth and its northern terminus and back, which trains do not run on the lines of the Pacific road. He also testified that the lines mentioned on the Rock Island folder as constituents of the Rock Island system, namely, the Chicago, Rock Island, & Mexico; the Chicago, Rock Island, & El Paso; the Choctaw, Oklahoma, & Gulf; the Chicago, Rock Island, & Texas; and the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific, were not operated as one road, but were operated separately; that the revenues were divided, just as revenues earned by the Chicago, Rock Island, & Gulf and T. & P. would be divided; that they were \n\n[205 U.S. 364, 384]\n\u00a0\n divided on a mileage basis; that no reports were made by the Gulf company to the head of the traffic department of the Pacific company; that reports were made by the Gulf company to the president of the Gulf company, who was also president of the Pacific company; that no representative of the Pacific company was sent to examine the books of the Gulf company further than just as a representative of any other connecting line would occasionally check up business with the Gulf company; that the books of the latter company had never been audited from the Chicago office; that there was no contract between the Gulf company and the Pacific company, except a traffic agreement as to the division of rates, made by the general freight agent of each line, of the same character of contract which exists between the Gulf company and other line with which it interchanges business; that the Gulf company owned about 1,500 or 1,600 freight and cattle cars and about twenty engines, which were marked C. R. I. and G.; the train despatcher has no power to furnish cars on the Gulf road if I instruct him not to do so; that since he had been vice president of the Gulf company he had had no connection whatever with the Pacific company and no duties to perform with any other railroad than the Gulf company; that for traffic hauled over the two lines the Gulf company received the amount agreed upon by the general freight agents in the same manner that the Gulf company and the T. and P. divided the revenues; that neither road pays any part for moving freight over the other line, nor pays any part of the loss sustained while in the hands of the other company by damage to freight; that the Gulf company has on deposit with the Pacific company several hundred thousand dollars, for which it receives 6 per cent interest per annum. When needed it is checked out.\n A copy of the folder of the 'Rock Island system's' lines was sent up with the record. A copy of the map shown on the folder is printed on the freight window of the office of the agent of the Gulf company and calendars with that map \n\n[205 U.S. 364, 385]\n\u00a0\n printed on them are distributed for the purpose of advertising the system lines.\n Messrs. D. T. Bomar, S. W. Stewart, J. A. Templeton, and Sam J. Hunter for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n[205 U.S. 364, 386]\n\u00a0\n Mr. M. A. Low for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n\n\n[205 U.S. 364, 388]\n\u00a0\n This case presents a question of jurisdiction to be determined as one of fact. It may be divided into two propositions: First. Was the Pacific company doing business in the state of Texas? Secondly. If so, were the alleged agents served with process in the state of Texas duly authorized as such, and competent to be thus served, in such wise as to give jurisdiction of the Pacific company?\n The statutes which concern service on corporations in the state of Texas are as follows (Sayles' Texas Civil Statutes): \n\n[205 U.S. 364, 389]\n\u00a0\n Art. 1194,  25. Foreign private or public corporations, etc.-Foreign private or public corporations, joint stock companies, or associations, not incorporated by the laws of this state, and doing business within this state, may be sued in any court within the state having jurisdiction over the subjectmatter, in any county where the cause of action or a part thereof accrued, or in any county where such company may have an agency or representative, or in the county in which the principal office of such company may be situated; or, when the defendant corporation has no agent or representative in the state, then in the county where the plaintiffs or either of them reside.'\n'Art. 1223. Foreign corporations, how served.-In any suit against a foreign private or public corporation, joint stock company, or association, or acting corporation or association, citation or other process may be served on the president, vice president, secretary, or treasurer, or general manager, or upon any local agent within this state, of such corporation, joint stock company, or association, or acting corporation or association.'\n\n By the act of March 13, 1905 (General Laws of Texas, 1905, p. 30), an additional method of serving foreign corporations was provided as follows:\n'Sec. 2. That service may be had on foreign corporations having agents in this state in addition to the means now provided by law by serving citation upon any train conductor who is engaged in handling trains for two or more railway corporations, whether said railway corporations are foreign or domestic corporations, if said conductor handles trains over foreign or domestic corporations' tracks across the state line of Texas, and on the track of a domestic railway corporation within the state of Texas, or upon any agent who has an office in Texas, and who sells tickets or makes contracts for the transportation of passengers or property over any line of railway or part thereof, or steamship or steamboat of any such foreign corporation or company. \n\n[205 U.S. 364, 390]\n\u00a0\n 'Sec. 3. For the purpose of obtaining service of citation on foreign railway corporations, conductors who are engaged in handling trains and agents engaged in the sale of tickets or the making of contracts for the transportation of property as described in  2 of this act, are hereby designated as agents of said foreign corporations or companies, upon whom citation may be served.'\n\n It is settled by the decisions of this court that foreign corporations can be served with process within the state only when doing business therein, and such service must be upon an agent who represents the corporation in its business. St. Clair v. Cox, \n106 U.S. 350\n, 27 L. ed. 222, 1 Sup. Ct. Rep. 354; Goldey v. Morning News, \n156 \nU.S. 518, 521\n, 522 S., 39 L. ed. 517, 519, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 559; Conley v. Mathieson Alkali Works, \n190 U.S. 406\n, 47 L. ed. 1113, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 728.\n It is contended upon the part of the plaintiffs in error that the Pacific company was doing business in the state of Texas, because of a partnership arrangement with the Gulf company, or because the latter company was the agent of the Pacific company, or, as is sometimes said, the representative of the Pacific company in the state of Texas. As to the question of partnership, we do not think this record presents a question of that sort. The suit is not for a partnership liability. It is an action upon a single cause of action for the tort of the Pacific company. Service is not had by serving one partner. The real contention is that the service reaches the Pacific company because of the agency or representative character of the Gulf company.\n Is it true that the Gulf company was the agent of the Pacific company or its mere creature in such a sense that to serve it is equivalent to serving the controlling company? It is a fact that both companies had common agents and employees to a certain extent, but the record shows that such employees were paid in proportion to the business done for each company. And that while in the service of the companies respectively they were under the exclusive management and control of the company in whose service they were engaged, with no \n\n[205 U.S. 364, 391]\n\u00a0\n power to discharge or employ the one company for the other; and that, although the service was in a sense common, it was kept distinct and separate in the control and payment of the employees while in the separate service of the respective companies.\n It is true that the Pacific company practically owns the controlling stock in the Gulf company, and that both companies constitute elements of the Rock Island system. But the holding of the majority interest in the stock does not mean the control of the active officers and agents of the local company doing business in Texas. That fact gave the Pacific company the power to control the road by the election of the directors of the Gulf company, who could, in turn, elect officers or remove them from the places already held; but this power does not make it the company transacting the local business.\n This record discloses that the officers and agents of the Gulf company control its management. The fact that the Pacific company owns the controlling amount of the stock of the Gulf company and has thus the power to change the management does not give it present control of the corporate property and business. Pullman's Palace Car Co. v. Missouri P. R. Co. \n115 \nU.S. 587, 597\n, 29 S. L. ed. 499, 502, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 194.\n In Conley v. Mathieson Alkali Works, supra, suit was brought upon a contract with the Mathieson Alkali Works. The defendant had designated no agent upon whom summons could be served, and service was made upon two members of the board of directors resident of the city of New York. Upon motion made to set aside the service of summons a reference was directed to ascertain whether the defendant corporation was doing business in the state of New York. The master reported, among other things, that the defendant had operated a plant at Niagara Falls, but had conveyed all its property to another corporation organized under the laws of Virginia. That the consideration expressed for the conveyance was $1 and other valuable consideration, but the substantial consideration was the entire capital stock of the \n\n[205 U.S. 364, 392]\n\u00a0\n grantee, the Castner Electrolytic Alkali Company. That the business of the defendant since said transfer was carried on in Providence, where it had its principal place of business. The master found that the company at the time of attempted service was not doing business in New York. Of the effect of the transfer of the entire stock of the new company to the defendant the master found: 'The fact that it held the entire capital stock of the Castner Electrolytic Alkali Company, and that the operations of that company were carried on under the same management as before December 31, 1900, is not material. The new corporation was a separate legal entity, and, whatever may have been the motives leading to its creation, it can only be regarded as such for the purposes of legal proceedings. It was that corporation alone which transacted any business in this state, notwithstanding it may have been for all practical purposes merely the instrument of the defendant corporation. People v. American Bell Teleph. Co. 117 N. Y. 241, 22 N. E. 1057; United States v. American Bell Teleph. Co. 29 Fed. 17.'\n Upon exceptions the master's report and conclusions were affirmed and the service set aside. That judgment was affirmed in this court. In the course of the opinion, Mr. Justice McKenna, speaking for the court, coming to deal with the effect of the transfer to the Castner Company, said: 'The defendant was competent to convey its property to the Castner Electrolytic Alkali Company and afterwards make the locality of its own business Providence and Saltville. Whether the transfer to the latter company was fraudulent we certainly cannot decide from this record, and the by-law which provided for a monthly meeting in New York could not of itself keep the corporation in New York. The testimony is positive that no business of the corporation was done in New York city after the transfer of the Niagara Falls plant; and that all of the business of the corporation was conducted at Providence, except that of a purely manufacturing character, which was conducted at Saltville. \n\n[205 U.S. 364, 393]\n\u00a0\n So, in the case at bar, notwithstanding the ownership of the stock in the Gulf company by the Pacific company, the former company transacts the business in Texas, and is a separate legal entity, authorized under the laws of Texas and legitimately carrying on business there.\n There is no evidence that the Pacific company may not lawfully hold the stock of the Gulf company, and under the statute of Illinois it seems to be authorized so to do. 3 Starr & C. Anno Stat. (Ill.) p. 3229. It is true that the Pacific company loaned the money to build the road of the Texas company, predecessor of the Gulf company. But, as was well observed by Judge (afterwards Justice) Jackson in United States v. American Bell Teleph. Co. supra: 'For one person to supply means for another to do business on is not the doing of that business by the former.'\n The conduct and control of the business in Texas was intrusted to the Gulf company. As the largest stockholder the Pacific company had an interest in that business, but a separate corporation had been legally created in Texas, with authority to make contracts and control its own affairs and carry on its own business. This separate corporation had its own officers, a large amount of its own property, was responsible for its contracts and to persons with whom it dealt.\n Nor do we think that the persons served with process are agents of the Pacific company doing the business of the company in Texas. Section 2 of the act of March 13, 1905 (Laws of Texas, 1905, p. 30), is very broad, and would seem to comprehend conductors who handle trains for two or more corporations over foreign or domestic roads across the state lines of Texas and on the track of a domestic railroad within the state of Texas, or upon any agent who has an office in Texas and who sells tickets or makes contracts for the transportation of passengers or property over any line of railroad or part thereof of any such foreign corporation or company; and such companies and agents, by  3 of the act, are made agents of the foreign corporation or company, upon whom the cita- \n\n[205 U.S. 364, 394]\n\u00a0\n tion may be served. But it is essential to the validity of such service that the corporation shall be doing business within the state, and that the service be upon an agent representing the corporation with respect to such business. Goldey v. Morning News, and Conley v. Mathieson Alkali Works, ubi supra.\n The conductors, one of whom was served, when he crossed the Texas line, this record shows, became the servant and agent of the Gulf company. The ticket agent sold tickets for the Gulf company, in whose employment he was. He would also sell tickets good upon its line and over the lines of the Pacific company, but he transacted this business as the agent of the Gulf company. As to Hovey, the record fails to show that he was agent of the Pacific company; on the contrary, it shows that he had no connection with the company, and that his duties were confined to the affairs of the Gulf company. The same is true of Merrell, and as to Sebree, the record shows that for the services rendered as trainmaster he was paid by each company for the service performed by it and had no charge as agent of the business of the Pacific company in the state of Texas.\n We reach the conclusion that the Pacific company was not doing business in the state of Texas, and that the attempted service was not upon agents of that company transacting its business in that state in such a sense as to give jurisdiction by service of citation upon them. The judgment of the Circuit Court is affirmed.\n Dissenting: The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice Moody. \n\n\n\n","125":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPOLK v. MUTUAL RESERVE FUND LIFE ASS'N OF NEW YORK(1907)\nNo. 45\nArgued: November 11, 1907Decided: December 2, 1907\n\n\n\n In this case the circuit court of appeals for the second circuit certified certain questions of law upon which it desired instruction. Such part of the statement accompanying the questions as we find material and the questions themselves follow:\n The above-named appellants filed their bill in equity in the United States circuit court for the southern district of New York, praying for the appointment of a receiver of both defendants, the winding up of both defendants, an accounting to ascertain the interest of complainants and all other policy holders of Mutual Reserve Fund Life Association in the assets of Mutual Reserve Life Insurance Company, and the marshaling \n\n[207 U.S. 310, 311]\n\u00a0\n and distribution of said assets. A final decree was entered by the circuit court sustaining a demurrer of the defendant to the amended bill of complaint and dismissing the bill. From that decree the complainants have appealed to this court.\n The amended bill of complaint alleges the existence of the following facts:\n The complainants became members and policy holders of the said association respectively on various dates from 1886 to 1900. The policy of each complainant is made a part of the bill and also the application for insurance of two of the complainants. The material provisions of the policies and applications are hereto annexed as exhibits 1 and 2. Said association became a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the state of New York. It was originally organized in 1881, under the corporate name of Mutual Reserve Fund Life Association of New York, under chapter 267, Laws of 1875, entitled 'An Act for the Incorporation of Societies and Clubs for Certain Lawful Purposes.' The original certificate of incorporation stated the objects and business of the company to be 'the mutual benefit of ourselves and all others who may become members of the society, by providing benefits for families and others dependent upon such members by means of voluntary contributions to meet exigencies occurring from time to time, and to provide a fund for the common and exclusive benefit of all members.' In 1883 the association reincorporated under chapter 175, Laws of 1883, entitled 'An Act to Provide for the Incorporation and Regulation of Co-operative or Assessment Life and Casualty Insurance Associations and Societies.' Its amended charter or certificate of incorporation, filed in 1883, after reciting the desire of the corporation to reincorporate under said act of 1883, provided:\n'First. We do hereby express our intention to form an organization for the transaction of life insurance upon the co-operative or assessment plan.\n\n ... * *\n'Fourth. The mode and manner in which the corporate \n\n[207 U.S. 310, 312]\n\u00a0\n powers granted are to be exercised are by issuing certificate of membership, policy, or other evidence of interest to, and promise or agreement with, its members, whereby, upon the decease of member, money or other benefit, charity, relief, or aid is to be paid, provided, or rendered by said corporation or association to the legal representative of such member, or to the beneficiary designated by such member, which money, benefit, charity, relief, or aid are derived from voluntary donations, or from admission fees, dues, and assessments, or some of them, collected or to be collected from the members thereof or members of a class therein, and interest and accretions thereon, or rebates from amounts payable to beneficiaries or heirs, and wherein the paying, providing, or rendering of such money or other benefit, charity, relief, or aid is conditioned upon the same being realized in the manner aforesaid; and wherein the money or other benefit, charity, relief, or aid so realized is applied to the uses and purposes of said corporation or association, and the expenses of the management and prosecution of its said business.'\n\n The existence and corporate powers of the association under the name of Mutual Reserve Fund Life Association of New York continued from that time unchanged until April 17th, 1902. On that date a declaration and amended charter of the said association was filed under and pursuant to the provisions of chapter 722, Laws of 1901, which act was an amendment of  52 of chapter 690, Laws of 1892, known as the insurance law of the state of New York. This amended charter of 1902 was adopted and filed pursuant to a resolution of the board of directors of the said association, adopted by more than a majority of said board. The declaration and amended charter was duly certified by the attorney general of the state to be in accordance with the requirements of law, and the state superintendent of insurance issued his certificate of the filing of such declaration and amended charter, and consented to the transaction of the business of insurance by the said Mutual Reserve Fund Life Insurance Company as \n\n[207 U.S. 310, 313]\n\u00a0\n in said amended charter provided. The material provisions of said declaration and amended charter are as follows:\n'This is to certify that the Mutual Reserve Fund Life Association, a corporation originally organized under and by virtue of chapter 267 of the laws of 1875, and reincorporated and transacting business under chapter 175 of the Laws of 1883 of the state of New York, and the laws amendatory thereof and supplementary thereto, has duly accepted the provisions of the act of the legislature of the state of New York, being chapter 690 of the Laws of 1892, known as 'the insurance law,' and the amendments thereto, and in conformity with the same has duly adopted the following amended charter:\n\n'Article 1.\n\n'The name of the corporation shall be 'Mutual Reserve Life Insurance Company.'\n\n ... * *\n'Article 3.\n\n'The business of the company shall be insurance upon the lives or the health of persons and all and every insurance appertaining thereto, the making of endowments, and the granting, purchasing, and dispensing of annuities, such kind of insurance being authorized under subd. 1 of  70 of 'the insurance law.'\n\n'Article 4.\n\n ... * *\n'Sec. 4. The present by-laws of the corporation, which form part of its contracts with its members, shall continue to be the by-laws of the company unless or until the same shall be revised or amended in the manner therein provided.\n\n ... * *\n'Article 6.\n\n'Sec. 1. The company shall have no capital stock, but shall be a mutual company.\n\n ... * *\n'Article 8.\n\n'The company shall be entitled to have and enjoy all the \n\n[207 U.S. 310, 314]\n\u00a0\n rights, privileges, and provisions of existing laws which might be included in the charter and enjoyed by it, if it were originally incorporated under 'the insurance law' of this state.'\n\n The consent of the policy holders to this amendment of the defendant's charter was not obtained, and no meeting of policy holders was called for that purpose. The complainants had no notice of said amendment until June 2d, 1902, on which date complainants received the following notice:\n Note Change of Name.\n Make checks and money orders payable to Mutual Reserve Life Insurance Company.\n On April 17, 1902, Mutual Reserve Fund Life Association reincorporated as a mutual level premium company, under the title of Mutual Reserve Life Insurance Company. Attention is called to this change of name and to the accompanying report of the recent examination of the corporation by the superintendent of insurance of the state of New York, which shows a surplus over liabilities of $466, 885.48.\n This reincorporation, while insuring the stability of the company, makes no change in your policy.\n Charles W. Camp, Secretary.\n The bill suggests no irregularity or defect in the procedure by which the amendment of the charter in 1902 was affected, other than that the consent of the policy holders was not obtained.\n It is further alleged that said company was organized about the 17th of April, 1902, by the then officers and directors of the respondent Mutual Reserve Fund Life Association, without authority from and without the knowledge or consent of complainants or the other members and policy holders of said association, and without corporate action by said members and policy holders, and that complainants and the other members of the association were not advised of the organization of the company until on or about June 2, 1902, when they received a printed slip notifying them that the said association \n\n[207 U.S. 310, 315]\n\u00a0\n had reincorporated under the name 'Mutual Reserve Life Insurance Company.'\n The amended bill then alleges that at the time of the organization of said company the association was, and for a considerable time had been, insolvent, its liabilities being in excess of the value of its assets by a large amount, and that the insolvency of the association was known to the officers and directors thereof, and that the officers and directors, headed by Frederick A. Burnham, president of the association, well knowing the insolvency of the association, devised the scheme for the incorporation of the respondent Mutual Reserve Life Insurance Company, and procured legislation intended to authorize the same, with the object and for the purpose of secretly and fraudulently 'depriving complainants and the other members and policy holders of respondent association of their membership rights and privileges, and of abridging the same, and that by their said course in the premises said officers and directors sought and intended to defraud the complainants and the members and policy holders of said association generally, and sought and intended to deprive them of their rights as members and policy holders, or cause a forfeiture of the same.'\n Complainants in their amended bill allege 'that said law, chapter 722 of the Laws of New York of 1901, if its effect and meaning be such as to authorize the pretended reorganization and reincorporation of the respondent association by the officers and directors thereof without due notice to and without the knowledge and consent of complainants or any of the members and policy holders of respondent association . . . is in contravention and violation of  10, article 1, of the Constitution of the United States, which prohibits any state from enacting a law 'impairing the obligation of contracts,' and complainants invoke and rely upon said provision of the Constitution of the United States, and say that under said provision of the Constitution of the United States said law is unconstitutional, invalid, and void.' And complainants fur- \n\n[207 U.S. 310, 316]\n\u00a0\n ther allege that said law of the state of New York, if given the construction, meaning, and effect aforesaid, is in contravention and violation of those provisions of the Constitution of the United States and of the state of New York which provide that 'no person shall be deprived of his property without due process of law,' in this,-that they deprive the complainants and the other members and policy holders of respondent association of their vested rights and privileges and of their property rights under their contracts and agreements with respondent association without due process of law, and complainants, as citizens and residents of the state of Tennessee and nonresidents of the state of New York, invoke the provisions of article 14 of the Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and, upon advice of counsel, allege and charge that said law of the state of New York, if given the force, meaning, and effect aforesaid, is in violation of those clauses of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which provide that 'no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States, nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.'\n The circuit court of appeals desires instruction upon the following:\n Questions.\n'1. Does the amended bill of complaint disclose that any contract obligations between complainants and the defendant Mutual Reserve Fund Life Association were impaired by the incorporation of the Mutual Reserve Life Insurance Company in 1902, pursuant to the provisions of chapter 722, Laws 1901, of the state of New York, and the transfer to said company of the assets, properties, and membership of the Mutual Reserve Fund Life Association?\n\n'2. Does the amended bill of complaint disclose and show that chapter 722, Laws of 1901, of the state of New York, was \n\n[207 U.S. 310, 317]\n\u00a0\n in violation of article 1,  10, of the Constitution of the United States, as impairing the obligations of a contract between the defendant Mutual Reserve Fund Life Association and complainants, in so far as it authorized the reincorporation of said association as the Mutual Reserve Life Insurance Company?\n\n'3. Does the amended bill of complainant disclose that chapter 722, Laws of 1901, of the state of New York, is in violation of the provisions of article 14 of the Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, in this,-that the reincorporation of the Mututal Reserve Fund Life Association as the Mutual Reserve Life Insurance Company, and the changes in the charter powers and franchises of the corporation, have the effect of depriving complainants of their property without due process of law, and of their vested contract rights and privileges, and of their property rights under their contracts and agreements with respondent association?\n\n'4. Does the amended bill of complaint disclose that chapter 722, Laws of 1901, of the state of New York, was in violation of those provisions of article 14 of the Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, which provides that no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of the citizens of the United States, nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws?'\n\n Messrs. William Hepburn Russell, D. L. Snodgrass, Caruthers Ewing, R. F. Jackson, William Beverly Winslow, and Daniel M. Miers, for Polk et al.\n\n\n[207 U.S. 310, 320]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Frank H. Platt and Sewell T. Tyng for the Mutual Reserve Fund Life Asso. et al.\n\n Mr. Justice Moody delivered the opinion of the court:\n The Mutual Reserve Fund Life Association of New York (hereinafter called the 'association') was originally incorporated under chapter 267 of the Laws of New York of 1875. The certificate \n\n[207 U.S. 310, 321]\n\u00a0\n of incorporation stated the purposes of the association to be to provide 'benefits for families and others dependent . . . by means of voluntary contributions . . . and to provide a fund for the common and exclusive benefit of all members.' In 1883 the association reincorporated under chapter 175, Laws of 1883, and while this charter was in existence the complainants became members and policy holders. That law provided for the incorporation and regulation of co-operative and assessment life and casualty insurance associations, and the charter of the association stated the business to be conducted as 'the transaction of life insurance upon the co-operative or assessment plan.' The law, as will presently be shown, was subject to alteration or repeal. In 1892 an act known as the insurance law (chapter 38 of the General Laws) was passed, repealing previous laws upon the subject of insurance, and expressed to be 'applicable to all corporations authorized by law to make insurances.' Section 52 of this act, as amended by chapter 722 of the Laws of 1901, is as follows:\n'Sec. 52. Reorganizations of Existing Corporations and Amendment of Certificates.-Any domestic corporation existing or doing business at the time this chapter takes effect may, by a vote of a majority of its directors or trustees, accept provisions of this chapter and amend its charter to conform with the same, upon obtaining the consent of the superintendent of insurance thereto in writing; and thereafter it shall be deemed to have been incorporated under this chapter, and every such corporation, in reincorporating under this provision, may, for that purpose, so adopt, in whole or in part, a new charter, in conformity herewith, and include therein any or all provisions of its existing charter, and any or all changes from its existing charter, to cover and enjoy any or all the privileges and provisions of existing laws which might be so included and enjoyed if it were originally incorporated thereunder; and it shall, upon such adoption of and after obtaining the consent, as in this section before provided, to such charter, and filing the same and the record of adoption and consent in the office of the super- \n\n[207 U.S. 310, 322]\n\u00a0\n intendent of insurance, perpetually enjoy the same as and be such corporation, and which is declared to be a continuation of such corporation which existed prior to such reincorporation; and the offices therein, which shall be continued, shall be filled by the respective incumbents for the periods for which they were elected, and all others shall be filled in the same manner by such amended charter provided. Every domestic insurance corporation may amend its charter or certificate of incorporation by inserting therein any statement or matter which might have been originally inserted therein; and the same proceedings shall be taken upon the presentation of such amended charter or certificate to the superintendent of insurance, as are required by this chapter to be taken with respect to an original charter or certificate; and if approved by the superintendent of insurance and his certificate of authority to do business thereunder is granted, the corporation shall thereafter be deemed to possess the same powers and be subject to the same liabilities as if such amended charter or certificate had been its original charter or certificate of incorporation, but without prejudice to any pending action or proceeding or any rights previously accrued. This section shall apply to insurance corporation organized under or subject to article 6 of the insurance law as well as to insurance corporations organized under special charters or articles 2 and 10 of the insurance law; all contracts, policies, and certificates issued by such corporations prior to accepting the provisions of this chapter shall be valued as one-year term insurance at the ages attained, excepting when such contracts, policies, or certificates shall provide for a limited number of specified premiums or for specified surrender values, in which case they shall be valued as provided in article 2,  84, of the insurance law.'\n\n Following strictly the provisions of this section, the association accepted the provisions of the insurance law, amended its charter, and became entitled to all the privileges of the law as if it had been originally incorporated thereunder. In the amendments to the charter the name of the association was \n\n[207 U.S. 310, 323]\n\u00a0\n changed to 'Mutual Reserve Life Insurance Company' (hereinafter called the 'company'), and the business of the company was stated to be 'insurance upon the lives or the health of persons, and all and every insurance appertaining thereto, the making of endowments, and the granting, purchasing, and dispensing of annuities.' The effect of this was to broaden the business from that of merely co-operative and assessment life insurance to life insurance of every kind. It is conceded that what was done was within the authority conferred by the statute, and the subject for our consideration is whether any of the rights secured to the complainants by the Constitution of the United States have been impaired.\n The first question certified is whether the incorporation of the company and the transfer to it of the assets, property, and membership of the association impaired any contract obligations between the association and the complainants. This question possibly implies that by the reincorporation an entirely new corporation was created, to which the property of the old corporation was transferred. But the question must be interpreted with the aid of the statement of facts which accompanies it. An examination of the facts and of the statute shows that there was simply a reorganization of an existing corporation, and not the creation of a new one. The title of the section is, 'Reorganizations of existing corporations and amendment of certificates.' It authorizes an existing corporation by vote of its directors to accept the provisions of the chapter and amend its charter. It provides expressly that the corporation, with its added powers and revised charter, shall be a 'continuation of such corporation which existed prior to such reincorporation.' This, perhaps, makes superfluous the saving of 'pending action or proceeding or any rights previously accrued' which the section cautiously insures. The declaration filed by the directors, and certified by the attorney general to be in conformity with law, recites that the association 'has duly accepted the provisions' of the insurance law, and 'duly adopted the following amended charter.' The corporation \n\n[207 U.S. 310, 324]\n\u00a0\n was not changed to a stock, but continued as a mutual, company. The change of name cannot control the significance of these facts. We answer this and the other questions upon the assumption, therefore, that the old corporation was still in existence, under a new name, and with added powers, but with unchanged membership, and bound to perform all its existing obligations. Upon this view it is impossible to say that any of the contract obligations of the association to the complainants have been impaired by the reorganization. This was the view apparently accepted by the company, who, in its notice to its members, said: 'This reincorporation, while insuring the stability of the company, makes no change in your policy.' It is contended, however, that the last clause of the section, which is applicable to associations for insurance under the co-operative or assessment plan, affects the contracts of the old members by converting them into one-year-term insurances at the ages attained. But, as we understand this clause, it has no effect upon the contracts of insurance, but is designed for a totally different purpose. It simply prescribes a standard by which the liabilities on the assessment contracts must be appraised. The superintendent of insurance is charged with the duty of deciding whether the assets of insurance companies bear such a relation to their liabilities that it is safe to allow them to continue in business. A very large part of the liabilities of any insurance company is upon outstanding contracts of insurance, not due and therefore not capable of exact measurement. Such liabilities can only be estimated or 'valued.' Section 84 of the insurance law provides for the method of estimating or valuing the liability on ordinary life policies, but that method seems inapplicable to assessment policies. In any event, the legislature determined that, when an assessment company was allowed to engage in other kinds of life insurance, its outstanding policies should be appraised as liabilities as if they were 'one-year-term insurance at the ages attained.' This does not make them such in fact, or authorize the company, in its dealings with the policy holder, to \n\n[207 U.S. 310, 325]\n\u00a0\n treat them as such. The statutory appraisement of the policies for book- keeping purposes no more affects the rights of the members under their contracts than the account of stock of a merchant would affect the rights of his creditors. The first question must be answered in the negative.\n The second question certified is whether the law of 1901, so far as it authorized the reincorporation of the association, was in violation of the clause of the Constitution forbidding a state from passing a law impairing the obligation of contracts. A similar question was before the court in Wright v. Minnesota Mut. L. Ins. Co. \n193 U.S. 657\n, 48 L. ed. 832, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 549, where it was held that a law of Minnesota, authorizing an assessment insurance company to change its business to that of insurance upon a regular premium basis, was not in violation of this provision of the Constitution. The reasoning of the court in that case need not be repeated. It is conclusive upon this question, unless the case at bar can be distinguished from it. The complainants seek to distinguish the case in several respects, which must be noticed. First, it is said that in the Wright Case the power of amendment of the articles of association was reserved in the articles of association, while no such reservation exists here. But the Constitution of New York, in force since 1846, contains this provision: 'Corporations may be formed under general laws; but shall not be created by special act, except for municipal purposes, and in cases where, in the judgment of the legislature, the objects of the corporation cannot be attained under general laws. All general laws and special acts passed pursuant to this section may be altered from time to time or repealed.' [Art. 8,  1.] A constitutional provision of the state of Michigan in substantially the same words was held to authorize important changes in the articles of association of an insurance company incorporated under a general law. Looker v. Maynard, \n179 U.S. 46\n, 45 L. ed. 79, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 21. There it was said, page 52: 'The effect of such a provision, whether contained in an original act of incorporation, or in a constitution or general law, subject to which a charter is accepted, is, at the least, to reserve to the legislature the power \n\n[207 U.S. 310, 326]\n\u00a0\n to make any alteration or amendment of a charter subject to it, which will not defeat or substantially impair the object of the grant, or any right vested under the grant, and which the legislature may deem necessary to carry into effect the purpose of the grant, or to protect the rights of the public or of the corporation, its stockholders or creditors, or to promote the due administration of its affairs.' This case shows that it is immaterial whether the power to alter the charter is reserved in the original act of incorporation, or in the articles of association under a general law, or in a constitution in force when the incorporation under a general law is made, as in the case at bar. Second. It is said that in the Wright Case the change was made by the majority of the members of the association, while in the case at bar it was made by a majority of the directors without the consent of the members. But in each case the change was made in conformity with the provisions of the law authorizing it, and, if the legislature has the constitutional power to authorize the change by the vote of a majority of the members, it has the power to authorize the change by a vote of a majority of the directors. The rights of a protesting member are no more impaired in one case than in the other. Next, it is said that distinctions may be based upon the allegations in this case that the association was insolvent, and that, knowing this, its officers devised the scheme of reincorporation and procured legislation authorizing it, with the intent to defraud the members. That the corporation was solvent was emphasized by the court in the Wright Case, but nothing in the decision of the constitutional question turned upon that. It would introduce a new uncertainty into the law if the constitutionality of statutes were to be judged by the motives and purposes of those who persuaded the legislature to enact them. We are unable to conceive of any possible bearing that these allegations, if accepted as true, could have on the constitutional questions certified to us, or to regard them as creating any real and substantial distinction between the case before us and the Wright Case. On the authority of that case, \n\n[207 U.S. 310, 327]\n\u00a0\n therefore, the second question must be answered in the negative.\n The other two questions certified inquire whether the law under which the reincorporation was made, or the reincorporation and changes in power made under its provisions, are in violation of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. These questions do not require separate or detailed consideration. As applied to the facts of this case, they are practically dealt with in the discussion which has preceded. It is not suggested that any rights secured to the complainants by the 14th Amendment were violated in any other manner than by the reincorporation of the association without the consent of its members, the change in and addition to its powers, and the consequent effect upon the contract rights of the complainants and upon their relation to the corporation. But it has been shown that the contract rights of the complainants have not been affected by the reincorporation, and the same reasoning that leads to the conclusion that the changes in the charter powers, made under the reserved powers of the state, do not violate the contract clause of the Constitution, is apt to show that they do not violate the 14th Amendment. In fact, the only suggestion of a violation of the 14th Amendment made to us is that the reincorporation, under the circumstances of this case, deprived the complainants of their vested rights and privileges and property rights under their contracts, without due process of law. Since the incorporation has deprived the complainants of no vested rights, privileges, or property, the contention fails.\n The whole argument of the complainants upon these constitutional questions, though enveloped in many words and presented in divers forms, rests upon a single proposition. That proposition is that they, having become members of an association insuring lives upon the co-operative and assessment plan, and being therefore, in a sense, both insurers and insured, have a vested right that the association shall not, without their consent, engage in other kinds of insurance, which may and \n\n[207 U.S. 310, 328]\n\u00a0\n probably will indirectly affect, for better or worse, their relations to it. The trouble with this proposition is that it was made and denied in the Wright Case.\n We have confined our consideration strictly to the constitutional questions certified. It may be that the complainants' rights under their contracts have not been observed by the company or that they have otherwise been unlawfully injured. These questions are not before us.\n The questions are severally answered in the negative. \n\n\n\n","126":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nQUINLAN v. GREEN COUNTY(1907)\nNo. 213\nArgued: Decided: April 8, 1907\n\n\n\n Plaintiff in error brought an action in the circuit court of \n\n[205 U.S. 410, 411]\n\u00a0\n the United States for the western district of Kentucky upon certain bonds and coupons purporting to have been issued by the defendant in error, one of the counties of the state of Kentucky. The following was the form of the bond:\n United States of America,\n County of Green, State of Kentucky.\n $500.00\n For the Cumberland & Ohio Railroad.\n Twenty years after date, the county of Green in the state of Kentucky, will pay to the holder of this bond the sum of $500 with interest thereon at the rate of 6 per cent per annum, payable semianually upon presentation of the proper coupons hereto attached, the principal and interest being payable at the Bank of America, in the city of New York.\n In testimony whereof, the judge of said county of Green has hereunto set his hand and affixed the seal of said county, on the 1st day of April, A. D., 1871, and caused the same to be attested by the county clerk, who has also signed the coupons hereto attached.\n (Green county seal.)\n T. R. Barnett, Judge.\n D. T. Towles, Clerk.\n The case was tried without a jury, and the court, after finding facts, rendered judgment for the defendant. The case then went to the court of appeals for the sixth circuit, and that court has certified here two questions of law upon which it desires instructions, with a statement of facts upon which the questions arise. In addition to the statement of facts we take into account the material parts of the charter of the Cumber land & Ohio Railroad Company,  15 of which contains the following provisions:\n'Sec. 15. That any city, town, or county through which said proposed road shall pass is hereby authorized to subscribe stock in said railroad company in any amount any such city, town, or county may desire; and the county court of any such \n\n[205 U.S. 410, 412]\n\u00a0\n county is authorized to issue the bonds of their respective counties in such amount as the county court may direct; and the chairman and board of trustees, or mayor and aldermen of any town, and the mayor and aldermen or council of any city, are hereby authorized to issue the bonds of their respective towns or cities in like manner. All said bonds shall be payable to bearer, with coupons attached, bearing any rate of interest not exceeding 6 per cent per annum, payable semiannually in the city of New York, payable at such times as they may designate, not exceeding thirty years from date; but before any such subscriptions on the part of any city, town, or county shall be valid or binding on the same the mayor and aldermen, or chairman and board of trustees of any town, the mayor and aldermen or council of any city, and the county court of any county, having jurisdiction, shall submit the question of any such subscription to the qualified voters of such city, town, or county in which the proposed subscription is made, at such time or times as said chairman and board of trustees, or mayor and aldermen of any town, mayor and aldermen or council of any city, or the county court of any county, as aforesaid, may, by order, direct; and should a majority of the qualified voters voting at any such election vote in favor of subscribing said stock in said railroad company, it shall be the duty of such county court, trustees, or other authorities aforesaid, to make the subscription in the name of their respective cities, towns, or counties, as the case may be, and proceed to have issued the bonds to the amount of such subscription as hereinbefore directed;\n\n ... * *\n'That, if preferred, the application herein authorized to be made to the county court may be made to the presiding judge of the county court; and all the powers herein given to the county court are hereby vested in the presiding judge of the county court. At all meetings of the stockholders for the purpose of electing officers, or any other purpose, the said town, cities, and counties may, by proxies duly authorized by the \n\n[205 U.S. 410, 413]\n\u00a0\n authorities thereof, cast a vote for each share so subscribed by said town, city, or county.' The charter gives to the Cumberland & Ohio Railroad 'all the powers and privileges conferred upon the Louisville & Nashville Railroad Company by the laws of Kentucky for constructing and operating their said proposed railroad.' The charter of the Louisville & Nashville Railroad Company provides 'that said railroad company may receive subscriptions of stock to their company by individuals, towns, cities, counties, or other corporations, whether payable in money or other things, with such terms and time of payment, conditions annexed, and kind of payment that may be set forth in the subscription.' The commissioners of the Cumberland & Ohio Railroad requested the county court to submit to the qualified voters of the county the question whether the county should subscribe to $250,000 of the capital stock of the company, payable in bonds of the county, whereupon the judge of the county court on the 17th of June, 1869, ordered an election in the following terms:\n\n'Whereas the commissioners of the Cumberland & Ohio Railroad Company, by virtue of the authority delegated to them by the charter of said company, have requested the county court of Green county, to order an election in said county of Green, and to submit to the qualified voters of said county the question whether said county court shall subscribe for and on behalf of said county $250,000 to the capital stock of the Cumberland & Ohio Railroad Company, and payable in the bonds of said county, having twenty years to run, and bearing 6 per cent interest from date, and upon condition that said company shall locate and construct said railroad through said county of Green, and within 1 mile of the town of Greensburg, in said county, and shall expend the amount so subscribed within the limits of Green county; and also upon the further condition that said bonds shall not be issued or said county pay any part of the principal or interest on said amount subscribed to said Cumber- \n\n[205 U.S. 410, 414]\n\u00a0\n land & Ohio Railroad Company, until said county of Green is fully and completely exonerated from the payment of the capital stock voted by said county, and authorized to be subscribed by said Green county court to the Elizabethtown & Tennessee Railroad, or any part of the interest thereon. It is therefore ordered by the court that an election, by the qualified voters of Green county, at the voting places in said county, be held and conducted by the several officers, as prescribed by law, for holding elections, on the 3d day of July, 1869, to vote on the question as to whether or not the said county court shall, for and on behalf of said county, subscribe $250,000 to the capital stock of said Cumberland & Ohio Railroad, conditioned and to be paid as above stated.'\n\n The election was duly held July 3, 1869, and the vote was in the affirmative. During the year before this vote the voters of the county had voted in favor of a proposition to subscribe to the stock of the Elizabethtown & Tennessee Railroad, and thereupon the county judge had ordered the clerk of his court to make a subscription to the stock of the Elizabethtown & Tennessee Railroad Company, 'on the terms specified in the order submitting the question to a bote.' This was the subscription from which Green county desired to be exonerated before the Cumberland & Ohio Railroad bonds should be issued, or any part of their principal or interest paid. On June 3, 1870, the county judge entered an order reciting the election at which the qualified voters had approved the subscription to the capital stock of the Cumberland & Ohio Railroad, and concluding: 'Now, therefore, I, Thomas R. Barnett, the presiding judge of the Green county court, by virtue of the authority in me vested by law, and to carry out the wishes of said voters, do hereby subscribe for $250,000 of the capital stock of said Cumberland & Ohio Railroad Company for and on behalf of said county of Green, which subscription is to be paid in the bonds of said county as prescribed in said order of submission, and \n\n[205 U.S. 410, 415]\n\u00a0\n this subscription is made with the conditions set out in the order of this court ordering said election, and now of record in the office of this county.'\n At the April term, 1871, the supreme court of the state rendered a decision in the case of Mercer County Court v. Kentucky River Nav. Co. 8 Bush, 300. It is argued that this decision shows that the subscription to the stock of the Elizabethtown & Tennessee Railroad was void. However that may be, at a time which does not distinctly appear, but later than that decision, the judge of the county court issued and delivered to the Cumberland & Ohio Railroad Company bonds of Green county to a small amount. On August 15, 1872, the judge, in a formal order, reciting that application had been made for the issue of the balance of the bonds, directed that, 'the court being sufficiently advised,' they be signed and issued. Thereupon certificates of 2,500 shares of that stock of the par value of $100 per share were delivered to Green county, which has since held and owned them. It was conceded at the argument that the county had made payment of interest on the bonds thus issued to the Cumberland & Ohio Railroad. No formal or express exoneration of said county from the payment of the subscription to the stock of the Elizabethtown & Tennessee Railroad was ever made or attempted, but nothing further has, up to this date, ever been done in respect to it, and neither bonds by the county nor stock by the said last-named railroad company have ever been issued or delivered in execution of said orders or under the terms of said subscription. The proceeds of $150,000 of the bonds were expended within Green county in the partial construction of 5 miles of the road to Greensburg. This 5 miles was completed by a lessee at its own expense. Nothing alse has been done within the county.\n The plaintiff is the bona fide holder for value of the bonds and coupons in suit but had notice that the railroad had not been laid further than Greensburg, and therefore did not extend 'through' the county. \n\n[205 U.S. 410, 416]\n\u00a0\n The questions certified by the circuit court of appeals are:\n'1st. Do the facts found by the circuit court conclude or estop the county from denying liability to the plaintiff upon the bonds and coupons in suit, by reason of noncompliance with the terms and conditions imposed by the favorable vote of the county authorizing a subscription to the stock of the Cumberland & Ohio Railroad Company and the issuance of bonds in payment therefor? Or, if this question should be deemed too broad, then,\n\n'2d. Assuming the facts to be as found, was a bona fide purchaser, before maturity, of these bonds and coupons for value, entitled to assume in his purchase that Green county had, before their issuance, been 'fully and completely exonerated from the payment of the capital stock subscribed for by the county court of said county for and in behalf of said county to the Elizabethtown & Tennessee Railroad Company?\"\n\n\n Mr. Justice Moody, after making the foregoing statement of facts, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The first question certified is thought by a majority of the court to contain more than a single question or proposition of law, and for that reason it is not answered.\n The second question deals with the exoneration from subscription to the stock of the Elizabethtown & Tennessee Railroad Company which was made by the vote of the county a condition to the issue of the bonds, and we confine our consideration to that question and the facts relevant to it.\n There is no doubt of the power of the defendant to issue the bonds. The legislature of Kentucky gave it in plain terms, upon the condition that its exercise receive the approval of the qualified voters. That approval was given upon the condition imposed by the vote that the bonds should not be issued before the county had been exonerated from a subscription to the stock of another railroad company. The law gave the county the right to impose conditions. This particular condition is a condition precedent to the lawful issue of the bonds although it must not be understood that this statement applies to the other so-called conditions expressed in the vote.\n Messrs. Edmund F. Trabue, George Durelle, John J. McHenry, John C. Doolan, and Attilla Cox, Jr., for Quinlan.\n\n\n[205 U.S. 410, 417]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Ernest Macpherson and John W. Lewis for Green county.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Moody:\n\n\n[205 U.S. 410, 419]\n\u00a0\n Of them nothing is intended to be said. If there had been a recital in the bonds which imported that the condition had been performed, that would have been conclusive in favor of a bona fide holder. Provident Life & T. Co. v. Mercer County, \n170 U.S. 593\n, 42 L. ed. 1156, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 788; Gunnison County v. E. H. Rollins & Sons, \n173 U.S. 255\n, 43 L. ed. 689, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 390. But there was no such recital in the body of these bonds, and the words of the heading, 'For the Cumberland & Ohio Railroad,' cannot be interpreted as such without going beyong the decided cases, which themselves have gone far. In the absence of a recital it is open to the defendant to show that the condition which it had a right to impose and did impose by the vote of its electors had not been complied with. Citizens' Sav. & L. Asso. v. Perry County, \n156 U.S. 692\n, 39 L. ed. 585, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 547. In other words, in the absence of a recital, the performance of the condition is not conclusively presumed.\n But, by the terms of the law, it was the duty of the judge of the county court, in whom the powers of the court were vested, to issue the bonds. After a favorable vote has been had in an election called by the court, the law provides that 'it shall be the duty of said county court . . . to make the subscription in the name of their . . . counties . . . and proceed to have issued the bonds to the amount of such subscription, as hereinbefore directed.' This clearly placed upon the judge the duty and responsibility of ascertaining and determining whether the condition of the issue of the bonds had been complied with. Coloma v. Eaves, \n92 U.S. 484\n, 23 L. ed. 579.\n If he had issued the bonds and they had contained in them recitals which fairly imported a compliance with the condition upon the happening of which their issue was authorized, they would have gone into the hands of innocent holders with a conclusive presumption that the condition had been performed. This principle has been announced by repeated decisions of this court and needs no other citations to support it than those already made. Without such recital the presumption is, as has been shown, not conclusive. The further question arises, \n\n[205 U.S. 410, 420]\n\u00a0\n therefore, whether there is any presumption at all of the performance of the condition from the facts of subscription and issue. In the first case dealing with this question (Knox County v. Aspinwall, 21 How. 539, 16 L. ed. 208), it was said that a purchaser of such bonds had the right to assume that the condition of their issue had been complied with, merely from the facts of the subscription and issue. But in this case there was a recital, and subsequent cases have limited the adjudication to the precise point necessarily decided. Citizens' Sav. & L. Asso. v. Perry County, ubi supra. In Marshall County v. Schenck, 5 Wall. 772, 18 L. ed. 556, it was said obiter by Mr. Justice Clifford, speaking of bonds of the kind under consideration, 'the bona fide holder has a right to presume they were issued under the circumstances which gave the requisite authority.' The same dictum was in substance repeated by the same justice in Lexington v. Butler, 14 Wall. 282-296, 20 L. ed. 809-812.\n In Pendleton County v. Amy, 13 Wall. 297, 20 L. ed. 579, it appeared that the county of Pendleton had issued bonds in aid of a railroad company. An act of the legislature gave the county the authority to issue the bonds, provided a majority of the real estate owners of the county should so vote. One of the pleas of the defendant in an action on the bonds was that they had never been authorized by the vote prescribed in the act which gave the power to issue them. This plea was demurred to, and the court passed upon the question thus raised. Mr. Justice Strong, in delivering the opinion of the court, said:\n'If the right to subscribe be made dependent upon the result of a popular vote, the officers of the county must first determine whether the vote had been taken as directed by law, and what the vote was. When, therefore, they make a subscription, and issue county bonds in payment, it may fairly be presumed, in favor of an innocent purchaser of the bonds, that the condition which the law attached to the exercise of the power has been fulfilled. To issue the bonds without the fulfilment of the precedent conditions would be a misdemeanor, and it is to be presumed that public officers act rightly. We do \n\n[205 U.S. 410, 421]\n\u00a0\n not say this is a conclusive presumption in all cases, but it has more than once been decided that a county may be estopped against asserting that the conditions attached to a grant of power were not fulfilled.'\n\n In this case there was no recital in the bond. It appeared by the pleadings that the bonds had been exchanged for the stock of the railroad company which was retained, and the decision was based upon the ground that the retention of the stock created an estoppel.\n In the case of Coloma v. Eaves, supra, the opinion of the court lends some countenance to the broad principle stated in Knox County v. Aspinwall, but Mr. Justice Bradley, in a concurring opinion, said:\n'I dissent from the opinion of the court in this case, so far as it may be construed to reaffirm the first point asserted in the case of Knox County v. Aspinwall, to wit, that the mere execution of a bond by officers charged with the duty of ascertaining whether a condition precedent has been performed is conclusive proof of its performance. If, when the law requires a vote of taxpayers before bonds can be issued, the supervisor of a township, or the judge of probate of a county, or other officer or magistrate, is the officer designated to ascertain whether such vote has been given, and is also the proper officer to execute, and who does execute, the bonds, and if the bonds themselves contain a statement or recital that such vote has been given, then the bona fide purchaser of the bonds need go back no further. He has a right to rely on the statement as a determination of the question. But a mere execution and issue of the bonds without such recital is not, in my judgment, conclusive. It may be prima facie sufficient, but the contrary may be shown. This seems to me to be the true distinction to be taken on this subject; and I do not think that the contrary has ever been decided by this court.'\n\n These cases left it uncertain whether the court would give to the facts of subscription to stock and issue of bonds in payment therefor by officers charged with the duty of ascertaining \n\n[205 U.S. 410, 422]\n\u00a0\n whether conditions precedent had been complied with, the same conclusive effect as to the validity of the bonds which would exist when to those facts was added a recital in the bonds themselves. But the tendency, observable in the earlier cases, to deny to bonds in the hands of an innocent holder any other defense than a want of power of the maker was arrested by the cases of Buchanan v. Litchfield, \n102 U.S. 278\n, 26 L. ed. 138, and Citizens' Sav. & L. Asso. v. Perry County, ub. sup., which held that the mere facts of the subscription to stock and issue of bonds containing no recital left it open to the obligor to show that a condition precedent had not been fulfilled. But these cases in no way conflict with the view expressed by Mr. Justice Strong in Pendleton County v. Amy, and by Mr. Justice Bradley in Coloma v. Eaves, that a presumption arises from the mere fact of subscription and issue, though not a conclusive one. Independent of authority such a presumption exists and is but an instance of the broader presumption that officers charged with the performance of a public duty perform it correctly. In the case at bar the judge of the county court was charged with the duty of issuing the bonds upon the performance of the condition precedent. That condition was that the county should be 'fully and completely exonerated from the payment of the capital stock voted by said county, and authorized to be subscribed by said Green county court to the Elizabethtown & Tennessee Railroad.' The performance of that condition did not necessarily require any formal release or the execution of any paper whatever. It was completely fulfilled if, from any circumstance, it should appear that the county had been effectively relieved from any liability on account of the vote in aid of the Elizabethtown & Tennessee Railroad. It would be impossible for any purchaser of the bonds to ascertain whether this condition had been complied with, except by an inquiry, which would naturally be made of the judge himself. The judge determined that it had been complied with, and the fact that for thirty-eight years no one has made any claim against the county on account of its sup- \n\n[205 U.S. 410, 423]\n\u00a0\n posed liability to subscribe to the stock of the Elizabethtown & Tennessee Railroad shows conclusively that he was right.\n Construing the second question to inquire, not whether there is conclusive presumption, but whether, on the facts found, there is any presumption at all that the county had been exonerated from its former subscription to another railroad, we answer it 'Yes.' \n\n\n\n","127":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRAYMOND v.

The case is one of several argued together, the facts in regard to which are substantially the same. It was brought to enjoin the appellants from taking any further proceedings towards the collection of certain taxes assessed against the appellee upon an assessment alleged to be in violation of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and which, if enforced, would result in the taking of appellee's property without due process of law, and in denying to it the equal protection of the laws. \n\n[207 U.S. 20, 21]\n\u00a0\n The case was brought in the circuit court of the United States at Chicago, and an opinion was delivered by that court at the time of the judgment for appellee. 114 Fed. 557. An earlier opinion upon a previous motion in certain traction company cases, relating to one phase of the matter in controversy, which was pending at the time in the southern district of Illinois, is to be found in 112 Fed. 607. The questions arise by reason of the provisions of the Constitution of the state of Illinois and certain sections of its tax statutes or revenue laws. The material part of article 9,  1, of the Constitution of Illinois, 1870, is as follows:\n'The general assembly shall provide such revenue as may be needful by levying a tax by valuation so that every person and corporation shall pay a tax in proportion to the value of his, her, or its property,-such value to be ascertained by some person or persons to be elected or appointed in such manner as the general assembly shall direct, and not otherwise; but the general assembly shall have power to tax . . . insurance, telegraph, and express interests or business, vendors of patents and persons or corporations owning or using franchises and privileges in such manner as it shall from time to time direct by general law, uniform as to the class upon which it operates.' Const. 1870, art. 9,  1.\n\n The following are the statutes in question:\n'Real property shall be valued as follows: First, each tract or lot of real property shall be valued at its fair cash value, estimated at the price it would bring at a fair voluntary sale.' Hurd's Rev. Stat. 1899, chap. 120, 4.\n\n'Personal property shall be valued as follows: First, all personal property, except as herein otherwise directed, shall be valued at its fair cash value. . . . Fourth, the capital stock of all companies or associations now or hereafter created under the laws of this state, except those required to be assessed by the local assessors and hereinafter provided, shall be so valued by the state board of equalization as to ascertain and determine respectively the fair cash value of such capital stock, including the franchise, over and above the assessed value of \n\n[207 U.S. 20, 22]\n\u00a0\n the tangible property of such company or association, 'arriving at such valuation from the best information obtainable, taking into consideration, among other things, the market value of their shares of stock, and the total amount of their indebtedness.\" Hurd's Rev. Stat. 1899, chap. 120,  3.\n\n The state board of equalization is the body that makes the original assessments upon the capital stock, etc., of corporations like the ones in question here, and there is no appeal from its valuation or decision.\n The following are some of the averments of the bill of complaint filed by the appellee in this suit: The defendants were, respectively, the town collector of the town of North Chicago and the county treasurer of Cook county, the city of Chicago being within in the limits of that county. In November or December of the year 1900 a valid assessment was made by the state board of equalization, assessing the full value of the capital stock of the appellee, including franchises, at the sum of three millions of dollars over and above the value of the tangible property of the appellee, and, in accordance with the provisions of the revenue law then in force, it decided, ascertained, and set down the sum of $600,000, one fifth of the above-mentioned $3,000,000, as the assessed value of the appellee's property, designated as 'capital stock, including the franchise,' for all purposes of taxation. This assessment was never vacated, annulled, or set aside, but was duly certified to the proper officer, and the state, county, city, and all other kinds of taxes levied for the year 1900, for and against property situated in the said town of North Chicago, were duly extended against such assessed value of $600,000, and the taxes were also extended against said assessment made upon the tangible property of the appellee for the year 1900, and a warrant was duly issued to the town collector \n\n[207 U.S. 20, 23]\n\u00a0\n of the town of North Chicago, directing him to collect the taxes so extended. On or about the 28th day of January, 1901, appellee paid to the collector of the town of North Chicago the sum of $52,902, in full satisfaction of all the taxes assessed against the appellee, and no part of the money so paid by appellee in satisfaction of the taxes has ever been returned or tendered back to the company, but, on the contrary, the money has been paid over by the collector, less his commission, either directly or through the county treasurer of the county, to the various taxing and public bodies entitled to receive the same, and has been used or is still retained by said bodies, respectively.\n On the 10th day of November, 1900, proceedings by taxpayers were instituted against the state board of equalization to compel that board to make an assessment for that same year against the appellee upon its capital stock and franchises. This application was made while the state board of equalization was in session, but before any final action had been taken by the board to determine and fix the proper assessment to be made on the capital stock of the appellee. It was alleged in the petition that the state board of equalization intended to adjourn its session without making any assessment upon the capital stock, including the franchises, of the appellee, and on twenty-two other corporations doing business in the city of Chicago, and that it intended illegally to neglect and refuse to discharge the statutory duty obligatory upon it in that regard. Neither the appellee nor the other corporations mentioned in the petition were made parties to the proceedings, nor did they ever become parties thereto. The defendants therein, members of the state board of equalization, denied that they had refused or intended to refuse to discharge their duties as members of the board. Thereafter the board assessed the capital stock of the respondent, including the franchise, as already stated, and on the 3d of December, 1900, adjourned sine die.\n Before this adjournment, and on the 16th of November, 1900, the mandamus proceedings had been continued, and no \n\n[207 U.S. 20, 24]\n\u00a0\n action was thereafter taken therein until about the 12th day of March, 1901. About the 1st of May, 1901, the proceedings came on for trial and terminated in a judgment directing that a writ should issue against the members of the state board of equalization, requiring the board to convene and forthwith value and assess the capital stock of the appellee, 'so as to ascertain and determine respectively, as to each of said corporations, the fair cash value of its capital stock, including its franchises, over and above the assessed value of the tangible property of such company for the year 1900.'\n An appeal was taken to the supreme court from that judgment, but no evidence was introduced on the trial of the case in support of the merits of the assessment theretofore made upon the capital stock, including franchises, of the appellee, and no argument was made either in the trial court or in the supreme court, upon appeal, in support of the merits of the assessment, the defense being rested almost wholly on objections to jurisdiction, and other legal grounds, touching the power of the court to grant the relief prayed for. (A method of assessing the capital stock had been adopted by the board, which omitted the indebtedness of the corporations as a factor in the valuation of such stock, and it was this error which led to the original assessments upon those corporations, and that caused the mandamus proceedings.)\n The amount of the assessment against the appellee for the year 1900 appeared upon the trial of the mandamus proceedings, and it was found by the trial court that the assessment was so low as to show that it was in fact a fraudulent assessment, and therefore in law no assessment at all, and upon appeal the supreme court held that the finding of the court below was justified, and that, under such circumstances, where there was in law no assessment, the court might compel the board to fulfil its duty by assessing the property of the taxpayer thus fraudulently undervalued. See State Board v. People, 191 Ill. 528, 58 L.R.A. 513, 61 N. E. 339. The state court held that under the provisions of the statute of Illinois the state board of \n\n[207 U.S. 20, 25]\n\u00a0\n equalization, acting as the original assessor of the capital stock and franchises of corporations, might make an assessment of omitted capital stock and franchises of corporations under the section of the statute referred to. See  276, 277 of the revenue act, Hurd's Stat. 1899, page 441.\n The judgment of the circuit court granting the writ of mandamus was thereupon affirmed by the supreme court, and the writ was issued on the 22d of November, 1901, against the board. The writ, as issued under the direction of the supreme court, after reciting that the previous assessment was in fact no assessment in law, and was unreasonable, arbitrary, and fraudulent, and was not the expression or the result of the honest judgment and discretion of the state board of equalization and the members thereof, and amounted to a wrongful, wilful, and arbitrary failure, omission, and refusal to assess the capital stock of the appellee at its fair cash value over and above tangible property of the appellee, and was a fraud in law and upon the relators and the people, directed the members of the board to assemble and to forthwith proceed to value and assess the capital stock, including the franchises, chises, of the appellee as of the 1st day of April, 1900, in the manner provided by law, 'and that you, the said state board of equalization and the members thereof, do value the capital stock of said corporations and each of them so as to ascertain and determine, respectively, as to each of them, the fair cash value of its capital stock, including the franchise, over and above the equalized assessed value of the tangible property of such corporation on the 1st day of April a. d. 1900, and that in arriving at said valuations and assessments of capital stock, including the franchises of the corporations herein named, the said state board and the members thereof, from the best information obtainable by it and them, shall ascertain and take into consideration, among other things, as to each said corporation, as the same was on April 1, 1900, the market value, or, if no market value, then the fair cash value, of its shares of stock and the total amount of all indebtedness, except the indebted- \n\n[207 U.S. 20, 26]\n\u00a0\n ness for current expenses, excluding from such expenses the amount for purchase or improvement of property and the assessed or equalized value of tangible property owned by said corporations, respectively, on April 1, 1900.'\n Pursuant to what the defendants believed to be the command of the writ, and without any independent judgment of their own, the members of the board proceeded to make an assessment upon the aggregate of the value of the capital stock, including franchises, of the appellee, and including its indebtedness, deducting therefrom the assessed equalized valuation of the real estate and tangible personal property belonging to the appellee, and then assessing for taxation one fifth thereof. At this time and for years previous thereto all property, real and personal, corporate or individual, throughout the state, as well as in Cook county, had been assessed as not to exceed 65 or 70 per cent of its fair cash value, and one fifth of that per cent was the amount upon which the tax was laid. This assessment, however, was not so made, but one fifth of the full value was assessed, and the roll thus made up was delivered to the proper officer, and an extension of the taxes made, and a warrant delivered to the town collector for collection. The total tax of the appellee on the second assessment amounted to about the sum of $1,000,000 more than the tax paid under the first assessment. It is the duty of the collector and the county treasurer to enforce the collection of these taxes, together with a penalty by reason of the delay in payment, and to that end levy the amount by distress and sale of the goods and chattels of the appellee, and which cannot be prevented or defended by the appellee otherwise than by payment or by a bill in chancery. The appellee's personal property consists chiefly of its cars and other personal property actually used in its business of transporting passengers, and levy of said tax will greatly embarrass it in its business and also injure the public using its cars. After collecting the taxes it is the duty of the collector, and he is required by law, to pay over and distribute them in the proportions designated in the \n\n[207 U.S. 20, 27]\n\u00a0\n tax book to the city treasurer of the city of Chicago, the county treasurer of Cook county, the treasurer of the sanitary district, and the other officers and authorities entitled to receive the same. In order to recover back the amount thus paid to the collector appellee will be obliged to bring separate suits against each one of the bodies receiving its proportionate share of said tax, necessitating a multiplicity of suits. Repayment of the amount which should be paid for the uses and purposes of the state of Illinois could not be enforced by and legal proceeding whatever, nor could repayment be obtained from anyone which would cover the costs, including the commissions deducted for the recovery of the taxes; and if proceedings to collect the taxes were not enjoined great and irreparable injury would result to the appellee, for which there was no complete or adequate remedy at law. It was then alleged that to pay the enormous sum of over a million of dollars, claimed as the tax for 1900, would render it impossible for the company to pay its rentals or preserve its leasehold interests, and would necessarily result in its insolvency. It was also averred that there were hundreds of corporations subject to be assessed by such board in the same manner that the appellee was assessed under the writ of mandamus issued in respect to the taxes assessed against it, and that not one of such corporations was, as a matter or fact, so assessed, but a discriminating, crushing tax burden was placed upon appellee and the other corporations mentioned in the writ, contrary to the provisions of the Constitution of the United States, and in violation of the Constitution of the state of Illinois.\n Within a month of the time when the assessment of 1900 was made under the command of the writ the same board of equalization made an assessment upon the property of the appellee for the year 1901, using the best judgment of its members, and at that time it equalized the assessment with other property assessed throughout the state, and the difference between the two assessments is most material. The facts are stated in the opinion or the circuit judge, as follows: \n\n[207 U.S. 20, 28]\n\u00a0\n 'A comparison between these records of the the state board is significant. In the case of the Chicago Union Traction Company the assessment for the year 1901-capital stock and tangible property aggregated-falls from a little over fourteen millions of dollars (the reassessment for 1900) to about eight millions, two hundred and fifty thousand dollars,-a loss of about 40 per cent.\n'In the case of the Chicago Consolidated Traction Company, the depreciation is from a little over three millions, seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars to about two millions of dollars, or about 47 per cent.\n\n'In the case of the People's Gas Company, the depreciation is from over twelve millions and a half to about eight millions and a half, or about 32 per cent.\n\n'In the case of the Chicago City Railway, the depreciation is from a little over six millions to a little over four millions and a quarter, or about 30 per cent.\n\n'In the case of the Chicago Telephone Company, the depreciation is from a little less than two millions, six hundred thousand dollars to a little over one million, seven hundred thousand dollars, or about 34 1\/2 per cent.\n\n'In the case of the Chicago Edison Company, the depreciation is from a little over two millions, four hundred thousand dollars, to a little over one million, three hundred thousand dollars, or about 46 per cent.\n\n'In the case of the South Chicago City Railway, the depreciation is from nearly five hundred seventy thousand dollars to a little less than three hundred thousand dollars, or about 47 per cent.\n\n'These assessments, so widely divergent, were upon the same properties, by the same board, entered almost on the same day. The dates of which they spoke of were, it is true, a year apart; the one being of the 1st of April, 1900, the other of the 1st of April, 1901. But the tide of stock quotations, and the tide of current values, were higher on the latter day than the former. If between these two assessments a considerable disparity \n\n[207 U.S. 20, 29]\n\u00a0\n should exist, the increase ought to be found in the assessment for 1901, and not in that for 1900.' [114 Fed. 559.]\n\n Other averments were made in the bill, designed to raise other questions than the ones discussed in the following opinion, and for that reason are not set forth.\n The defendants put in their answer and joined issue in regard to many of the material averments contained in the bill. The case was referred to a matter and testimony was taken and a report made by the master to the court, in which he found all the material averments of the bill had been proved. The court approved the findings of the master, but before granting the injunction it ordered that the appellee should pay to the city an amount which the court found was fairly and equitably due from the appellee as its proportion of the taxes for 1900. The sum was arrived at by the court by a computation which, in its judgment, produced a fair and proper result. The amount directed to be paid by the court before the injunction should issue was the sum of $134,350.03, which sum the appellee paid, and the injunction issued as directed. The appellants duly excepted to the findings of the master that the amount of taxes equitably due from the appellee was as just stated, and the appellants insisted that the finding of the master of the amount of tax to be paid should have been the sum of $961,154.15 for general taxes, and $58,057.63 for interest thereon, making a total of $1,019,211,78 as due from the appellee for the taxes of 1900, as evidenced by the collector's warrant in the hands of the defendants in this suit.\n It was also averred that the assessment was grossly excessive and the property greatly overvalued.\n [Messrs. David K. Tone, James Hamilton Lewis, Harry A. Lewis, William F. Struckmann, Frank L. Shepard, William H. Stead, and George B. Gillespie for appellants.\n\n\n[207 U.S. 20, 33]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William W. Gurley, Arthur Dyrenforth, and Howard M. Carter for appellee.\n\n\n[207 U.S. 20, 35]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, after making the foregoing statement of facts, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The claim that action of the state board of equalization in making the assessment under consideration was the action of the state, and if carried out would violate the provisions of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, by taking property of the appellee without due process of law, and by failing to give it the equal protection of the laws, constitutes a Federal question beyond all controversy. How that question should be decided is another matter, which we will proceed at once to discuss.\n The state board of equalization is one of the instrumentalities provided by the state for the purpose of raising the public revenue by way of taxation. In regard to corporations of the class of which the appellee and the other corporations involved here are members, it is the duty of that board to make an original assessment upon them. From the decision of the board in making such assessment no appeal is provided for, and each decision is therefore conclusive, except as proceedings for relief may thereafter be taken in the courts. As to the assessments of local assessing bodies, the board is one of review, but its decisions are equally conclusive, as in the case of original assessments. Acting under the constitution and laws of the state, the board therefore represents the state, and its action is the action of the state. The provisions of the 14th \n\n[207 U.S. 20, 36]\n\u00a0\n Amendment are not confined to the action of the state through its legislature, or through the executive or judicial authority. Those provisions relate to and cover all the instrumentalities by which the state acts, and so it has been held that whoever, by virtue of public position under a state government, deprives another of any right protected by that amendment against deprivation by the state, violates the constitutional inhibition; and as he acts in the name of the state and for the state, and is clothed with the state's powers, his act is that of the state. Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Chicago, \n166 U.S. 226\n, 41 L. ed. 979, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 581. Following the above case, the Federal courts throughout the country have frequently reviewed the action of taxing bodies when, under the facts, such action was in effect the action of the state, and therefore reviewable by the Federal courts by virtue of the provisions of the Amendment in question. See Nashville, C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Taylor, 86 Fed. 168; Louisville Trust Co. v. Stone, 46 C. C. A. 299, 107 Fed. 305. In the last case, which related to enjoining the collection of alleged illegal taxes by reason of discrimination, the court said: 'It may be conceded that, if the allegations of the bill are made out, there exists, in respect to the property of complainant and others similarly situated, a systematic, intentional, and illegal undervaluation of other property by the taxing officers of the state, which necessarily affects an unjust discrimination against the property of which the plaintiff is the owner, and a bill in equity will lie to restrain such illegal discrimination, and that in such cases Federal jurisdiction will arise because of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the 14th Amendment.'\n The same principle has been recognized in Reagan v. Farmers' Loan & T. Co. \n154 \nU.S. 362, 390\n, 38 S. l. ed. 1014, 1021, 4 Inters. Com. Rep. 560, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1047; A. Backus, Jr. & Sons v. Fort Street Union Depot Co. \n169 \nU.S. 557, 565\n, 42 S. L. ed. 853, 857, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 445; Fargo v. Hart, \n193 \nU.S. 490, 502\n, 48 S. L. ed. 761, 766, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 498.\n The case before us is one which the facts make exceptional. It is made entirely clear that the board of equalization did not equalize the assessments in the cases of these corporations, the effect of which was that they were levied upon a different principle or followed a different method from that adopted in \n\n[207 U.S. 20, 37]\n\u00a0\n the case of other like corporations whose property the board had assessed for the same year. It was not the mere action of individuals, but, under the facts herein detailed, it was the action of the state, through the board. There is here no contention of illegality simply because of assessing the franchises of these corporations at a different rate from tangible property in the state, which the state might do (Coulter v. Louisville & N. R. Co. \n196 U.S. 599\n, 49 L. ed. 615, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 342), but it is asserted that the board assessed the franchises and other property of these companies at a different rate and by a different method from that which had been employed by the board for other corporations of the same class for that year. The result is an enormous disparity and discrimination between the various assessments upon the corporations. The most important function of the board, that of equalizing assessments, in order to carry out the provisions of the Constitution of the state in levying a tax by valuation, 'so that every person shall pay a tax in proportion to the value of his, her, or its property,' was, in this instance, omitted and ignored, while the board was making an assessment which it had jurisdiction to make under the laws of the state. This action resulted in an illegal discrimination which, under these facts, was the action of the state through the board. Barney v. New York, \n193 U.S. 430\n, 48 L. ed. 737, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 502, holds that where the act complained of was forbidden by the state legislature, it could not be said to be the act of the state. Such is not the case here.\n We are also of opinion that the case is one over which equity has jurisdiction. In Cummings v. Merchants' Nat. Bank, \n101 U.S. 153\n, 25 L. ed. 903, this court held that the case was one properly brought in equity. It was to restrain the collection of a tax. While the court held that the position of the bank as trustee entitled it to maintain an action in equity and also under the statute of Ohio, it was further held (page 157): 'Independently of this statute, however, we are of opinion that when a rule or system of valuation is adopted by those whose duty it is to make the assessment, which is designed to operate unequally and to violate a fundamental principle of the Constitution, and when \n\n[207 U.S. 20, 38]\n\u00a0\n this rule is applied not solely to one individual, but to a large class of individuals or corporations, that equity may properly interfere to restrain the operation of this unconstitutional exercise of power.' We have in the case at bar similar facts. A system of valuation was adopted and applied to a large class of corporations, differing wholly from that applied to other corporations of the same class, and resulting in a discrimination against the appellee of the most serious and material nature. It is not a question of mere difference of opinion as to the valuation of property, but it is a question of difference of method in the manner of assessing property of the same kind. Although the law itself may be valid and provide for a proper valuation, yet if, through mistake on the part of the state, through its board of equalization, and while acting as a quasi-judicial body, the board erred in the method to be pursued in relation to the corporations now before us, the mistake is one which may be corrected in equity.\n In all these cases, however, where there is jurisdiction to tax at all, equity will not grant an injunction to restrain the collection, even of an illegal tax, without the payment on the part of the taxpayer of the amount of a tax fairly and equitably due. People's Nat. Bank v. Marye, \n191 U.S. 272\n, 48 L. ed. 180, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 68, and cases eited. Acting upon this principle, the circuit court refused to issue the injunction until the appellee paid the amount which the court found to be a fair and just amount due from the appellee for the tax of the year 1900, based upon a tax at the same rate as that levied upon other property and on corporations of the same class within the state. The sum to be paid by the appellee herein, as decided by the circuit judge, was $134,350.03. That sum was paid instead of $1,019,211.78, called for by the warrant in the hands of the collector.\n Finally, it is objected that the appellee had a complete and adequate remedy at law by paying the amount of the warrant, and then suing the collector to recover the same back as money paid under duress, although upon a void warrant. Undoubtedly, if there be a complete and adequate remedy at law in such \n\n[207 U.S. 20, 39]\n\u00a0\n a case as this, the remedy in equity will not be recognized. Assuming the tax to be void, equity will not restrain, by injunction, its collection, unless there be some other ground for equitable interposition. Shelton v. Platt, \n139 U.S. 591\n, 35 L. ed. 273, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 646; Allen v. Pullman's Palace Car Co. \n139 U.S. 658\n, 35 L. ed. 303, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 682; Racific Exp. Co. v. Seibert, \n142 U.S. 339\n, 35 L. ed. 1035, 3 Inters. Com. Rep. 810, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 250.\n In the cases in 139 U. S., supra, it was recognized that no ground appeared for the interposition of a court of equity, because of the existence of a statute in the state of Tennessee providing for paying the amount of the alleged illegal tax to the officer holding the warrant, and granting to the taxpayer a right to commence an action to recover back the tax thus paid, the statute providing that the officer should pay the amount received into the state treasury, where it was to remain until the question was decided, and, if it was decided in favor of the taxpayer, provision was made for the repayment of the amount by the state. The other averments, beside that of the illegality of the tax, made in these two cases, were held not to constitute a ground for the interposition of a court of equity by restraining the collection of the tax. In the case in 142 U. S., supra, the court held that there was no ground to warrant the interposition of a court of equity. The case was decided upon the ground that the averment of illegality of the tax was not sustained. There is no statute of a similar kind in Illinois which has been called to our attention, but some of the cases in that state hold that such a suit may be maintained against the collector when the money was paid under protest.\n In the case at bar it is averred that it is the duty of the collector, having received the money on his warrant, to pay the sum so received in the proportions designated in his tax books to the city treasurer of the city of Chicago, the county treasurer of the county of Cook, the treasurer of the sanitary district, and other officers and authorities entitled to receive the same, and if the plaintiff instituted suit to recover back the taxes so paid to the town or county collector he would be obliged to bring separate suits against each one of the several taxing bodies receiving its proportionate share of the tax, \n\n[207 U.S. 20, 40]\n\u00a0\n thereby necessitating a multiplicity of suits, and the proportion of the tax which would go to the state of Illinois could not be collected back by any legal proceeding whatsoever; and if repayment could be compelled from the city of Chicago and other taxing bodies, such repayment would not cover the cost, including commissions deducted for the collection of the tax, and in that way it was averred that the appellee would be subjected to great and irreparable injury, for which there was not a complete or adequate remedy at law. There was also the allegation, already referred to in the foregoing statement, that, if compelled to pay this enormous tax, it would be rendered insolvent. We think all these allegations combined take the case out of the class where relief is prayed for, founded simply upon the unconstitutionality of the law under which the tax is levied, or upon the illegality, for any other reason, of the tax itself, and bring the case within the jurisdiction of a court of equity. And, in addition, there is the allegation that a levy upon the property of the appellee would interfere with the operation of the street car system in the city of Chicago, operated by the appellee, and would greatly embarrass and injure the public who have to use the cars.\n Upon the whole, we think it is apparent that no adequate remedy at law exists in this case, and that the judgment enjoining the collection of the balance of the tax levied against the appellee, above that which has been paid under the direction of the circuit court, must be affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes, dissenting:\n Notwithstanding my unfeigned deference to the judgment of my brethren, I cannot but think that the circuit court was wrong in taking jurisdiction of this case. We all agree, I suppose, that it is only in most exceptional cases that a state can be said to deprive a person of his property without due process of law merely because of the decision of a court, without more. The discussion in Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Chicago, \n166 U.S. 226\n, 41 L. ed. 979, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 581, concerned a judgment assumed to be authorized by a \n\n[207 U.S. 20, 41]\n\u00a0\n statute of the state, and in that case the judgment of the state court was affirmed, so that no very extensive conclusions can be drawn from it. So far as I know this is the first instance in which a circuit court has been held authorized to take jurisdiction on the ground that the decision of a state tribunal was contrary to the 14th Amendment.\n It seems to me that the appellee should not be heard until it has exhausted its local remedies; that the action of the state board of equalization should not be held to be the action of the state until, at least, it has been sanctioned directly, in a proceeding which the appellee is entitled to bring, by the final tribunal of the state,-the supreme court. I am unable to grasp the principle on which the state is said to deprive the appellee of its property without due process of law because a subordinate board, subject to the control of the supreme court of the state, is said to have violated the express requirement of the state in its Constitution,-because, in other words, the board has disobeyed the authentic command of the state by failing to make its valuations in such a way that every person shall pay a tax in proportion to the value of his property. I should have thought that the action of the state was to be found in its Constitution, and that no fault could be found with that until the authorized interpreter of that Constitution, the supreme court, had said that it sanctioned the alleged wrong. Barney v. New York, \n193 U.S. 430\n, 48 L. ed. 737, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 502.\n At I think that the circuit court ought to be ordered to dismiss this case, I shall not discuss the merits. But I cannot forbear adding that, so far as the appellee is complaining that it has been compelled to pay the full amount of the tax due from it, and is founding its complaint on the fact that other parties are escaping their liabilities, whether through mistake or still uncorrected fraud, it seems to me to show no sufficient ground for relief, unless exceptional reasons exist, not adverted to in the judgment of the court.\n Mr. Justice Moody concurs in the dissent. \n\n\n\n","129":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nROCHESTER R.

CITY OF ROCHESTER(1907)\nNo. 156\nArgued: Decided: March 25, 1907\n\n\n\n\n[205 U.S. 236, 237]\n\u00a0\n The defendant in error brought an action against the plaintiff in error, a street surface railroad corporation, hereinafter called the Rochester Railroad, to recover $18,274.02, the expense of making new pavements of two streets within the space between the tracks, the rails of the tracks, and 2 feet in width outside the tracks of the railroad. The action was brought under  98 of chapter 39 of the General Laws of New York, which was enacted in 1890, and is as follows:\n Every street surface railroad corporation, so long as it shall continue to use any of its tracks in any street, avenue, or public place, in any city or village, shall have and keep in permanent repair that portion of such street, avenue, or public place between its tracks, the rails of its tracks, and 2 feet in width outside of its tracks, under the supervision of the proper local authorities, and whenever required by them to do so, and in such manner as they may prescribe. In case of the neglect of any such corporation to make pavements or repairs after the expiration of thirty days' notice to do so the local authorities may make the same at the expense of such corporation.\n The Rochester Railroad was incorporated on February 25, 1890, under a law of New York enacted May 6, 1884. New York laws 1884, chap. 252. That law authorized the \n\n[205 U.S. 236, 238]\n\u00a0\n formation of street surface railroad corporations and provided that they should 'have all the powers and privileges granted, and be subject to all the liabilities imposed, by this act.' Among the liabilities was that imposed by  9 of the act, which is as follows:\n'Every such corporation incorporated under, or constructing, extending, or operating a railroad constructed or extended under, the provisions of this act, within the incorporated cities and villages of this state, shall also, whenever and as required, and under the supervision of the proper local authorities, have and keep in permanent repair the portion of every street and avenue between its tracks, the rails of its tracks, and a space of 2 feet in width outside and adjoining the outside rails of its track or tracks, so long as it shall continue to use such tracks, so constructed, under the provisions of this act. In case of the neglect of such corporations to make such pavement or repairs the local authorities may make the same at the expense of such corporation after the expiration of thirty days' notice to do so.'\n\n Section 18 of the act provides that 'all acts and parts of acts, whether general or special, inconsistent with this act, are hereby repealed, but nothing in this act shall . . . interfere with or repeal or invalidate any rights heretofore acquired under the laws of this state by any horse railroad company, or affect or repeal any right of any existing street surface railroad company to construct, extend, operate, and maintain its road in accordance with the terms and provisions of its charter and the acts amendatory thereof.'\n The Rochester Railroad Company was incorporated for the purpose of acquiring the property of the Rochester City & Brighton Railroad Company, hereinafter called the Brighton Railroad. The Brighton Railroad was incorporated March 5, 1868, under a general law of the state of New York. Laws of 1850, chap. 140. That law contained no provision respecting the repairs of streets, and, differences having arisen between the Brighton Railroad and the city, as to the extent of the \n\n[205 U.S. 236, 239]\n\u00a0\n burden of such repairs properly to be borne by the railroad, they joined in an application to the legislature for the enactment of a law which should regulate that and other subjects. Such a law was enacted February 27, 1869, and its 5th section was as follows:\n'Said company shall put, keep, and maintain the surface of the streets inside the rails of its tracks in good and thorough repair, under the direction of the committee on streets and bridges of the common council of said city of Rochester; but, whenever any of said streets are, by ordinance or otherwise, permanently improved, said company shall not be required to make any part or portion of such improvement, or bear any part of the expense thereof, but it shall make its rails in such street or streets conform to the grade thereof.' [Laws of 1869, chap. 34.]\n\n On the 25th day of February, 1890, the Brighton Railroad duly executed and delivered a lease of its property, franchises, rights, and privileges, for the unexpired term of its charter, to the Rochester Railroad, which accepted the lease and took possession of the property. Subsequently, in the same year, the Rochester Railroad acquired the entire capital stock of the Brighton Railroad. The acquisition of stock was in pursuance of the authority contained in chapter 254 of the Laws of New York of 1867, which, as amended by chapter 503 of the Laws of 1879, is as follows:\n'Any railroad corporation created by the laws of this state, or its successors, being the lessee of the road of any other railroad corporation, may take a surrender or transfer of the capital stock of the stockholders, or any of them, in the corporation whose road is held under lease, and issue in exchange therefor the like additional amount of its own capital stock at par, or on such other terms and conditions as may be agreed upon between the two corporations; and whenever the greater part of the capital stock of any such corporation shall have been so surrendered or transferred, the directors of the corporation taking such surrender or transfer shall thereafter, on a resolution electing so to do, to be entered \n\n[205 U.S. 236, 240]\n\u00a0\n on their minutes, because ex officio the directors of the corporation whose road is so held under lease, and shall manage and conduct the affairs thereof, as provided by law; and whenever the whole of the said capital stock shall have been so surrendered or transferred, and a certificate thereof filed in the office of the secretary of state, under the common seal of the corporation to whom such surrender or transfer shall have been made, the estate, property, rights, privileges, and franchises or the said corporation whose stock shall have been so surrendered or transferred shall thereupon vest in and be held and enjoyed by the said corporation to whom such surrender or transfer shall have been made, as fully and entirely, and without change or diminution, as the same were before held and enjoyed, and be managed and controlled by the board of directors of the said corporation to whom such surrender or transfer of the said stock shall have been made, and in the corporate name of such corporation. The rights of any stockholder not so surrendering or transferring his stock shall not be in any way affected hereby, nor shall existing liabilities or the rights of creditors of the corporation, where stock shall have been so surrendered or transferred, be in any way affected or impaired by this act.'\n\n Subsequently the Rochester Railroad duly obtained permission to convert the road into an electric trolley road, expended large sums of money in doing so, and, in the acquisition of the stock of the Brighton Railroad and the conversion of its road into an electric road, relied upon the provisions of the act of 1869 as a contract exempting it, with respect to the streets covered by the tracks of the Brighton Railroad, from other street repairs than those therein described. The city acquiesced in this view until October, 1898, when, upon the suit of an owner of adjoining property, the court of appeals held that, under  9 of the act of 1884, and  98 of chapter 39 of the General Laws, which were regarded as substantially the same, the Rochester Railroad was bound to bear the expense of a new pavement on* \n\n[205 U.S. 236, 241]\n\u00a0\n the location acquired from the Brighton Railroad. Conway v. Rochester, 157 N. Y. 33, 51 N. E. 395. Subsequently, the city repaved two streets which were within the location acquired and operated by the Brighton Railroad, prior to the passage of the act of 1884, and, in obedience to the decision in the Conway Case, assessed against the Rochester Railroad its share of the expense of pavement, and brought this action to recover the amount of the assessment. It was set up in defense of the action that, by the act of 1869, the state of New York had entered into an inviolable contract with the Brighton Railroad, exempting it from the expense of pavement, that the contract had passed with the property of the Brighton Railroad to the Rochester Railroad, and that the assessment was in violation of the Constitution of the United States. The contentions of the Rochester Railroad were denied by the court of appeals of New York (182 N. Y. 116, 70 L.R.A. 773, 74 N. E. 953), which held, first, that the statute mentioned did not constitute a contract between the state and the railroad company, and, second, that if it did, the exemption granted by the statute was personal to the Brighton Railroad, and did not pass to the Rochester Railroad. The case was remanded to the supreme court and a judgment entered pursuant to the remittitur from the court of appeals, and by writ of error that judgment is brought here for review.\n Messers. Charles J. Bissell, William C. Trull, and Joseph S. Clark for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[205 U.S. 236, 243]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William W. Webb and Benjamin B. Cunningham for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Moody:\n\n\n[205 U.S. 236, 245]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Moody, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n By the judgment of the highest court of the state of New York, the city of Rochester was allowed to recover from the Rochester Railroad, a street surface railroad corporation, the cost of laying new pavements on the parts of two streets which lay between the tracks, the rails of the tracks, and 2 feet outside of the tracks of the railroad. This recovery was had under a statute of New York which required such railroads to keep that part of the street over which their tracks ran in permanent repair. The requirement of permanent repair includes the duty of laying new pavements. Conway v. Rochester, 157 N. Y. 33, 51 N. E. 395.\n The Rochester Railroad, not denying its liability in ordinary cases to bear the expense of paving, asserts that, with respect to the two streets in question, it was exempted from that burden by contract with the state of New York, made with its predecessor in title, the Brighton Railroad, and transferred to it with the title to the property of that railroad. The contract relied upon is found in a law enacted in 1869, for the benefit of the Brighton Railroad, which relieved that road from the burden of pavement of any part of the streets in which its tracks were situated. The Rochester Railroad claims that the law of New York, so far as that law imposes upon it the cost of the pavement of the streets in question, was in violation of that provision of the Constitution of the United States which forbids a state to pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts.\n The Brighton Railroad was incorporated in 1862, under the general law of 1850, which contained no provision with respect to the railroad's share of street repairs. Until the enactment of the law of 1884, under which the Rochester Railroad was subsequently incorporated, there was no general law regulating the apportionment between street railroads and municipalities of the expense of such repairs, and the \n\n[205 U.S. 236, 246]\n\u00a0\n question was determined in individual cases either by agreement or a special law. Differences having arisen between the Brighton Railroad and the city of Rochester as to the share of the expense of street repair which ought to be borne by the railroad, they joined in a request for legislation which would settle this and other disagreements. In response to that request the law of 1869 was enacted. The 5th section of the law, after providing that the railroad should put and keep the surface and street inside of the rails of its tracks in repair, enacts that: 'Whenever any of said streets are, by ordinance or otherwise, permanently improved, said company shall not be required to make any part or portion of such improvement, or bear any part of the expense thereof.'\n This law, obviously, as held by the court of appeals, exempted the railroad from the expense of new pavements, which is the expense sought to be recovered in this action. This was the effect conceded to the statute by the city for the whole time during which the railroad property was owned and operated by the Brighton Railroad, and even after it parted with the property, and until the decision in Conway v. Rochester, supra, in 1898. Whether this statute was a contract between the state of New York and the Brighton Railroad, inviolable by the Federal Constitution, and if so, whether its benefits have been waived or it has been lawfully modified or repealed by virtue of the powers reserved by the Constitution or laws of New York, are questions which have been much argued at the bar. We do not deem it necessary in this case to decide those questions, and therefore put out of view many facts found in the record which were deemed by both parties to be relevant to them. We assume, for the purpose of our decision, that there was a contract exempting the Brighton Railroad from the expense of street pavements, and that the contract could not constitutionally be impaired by the state of New York, and that its benefits have not been waived.\n It becomes, therefore, necessary to inquire whether the \n\n[205 U.S. 236, 247]\n\u00a0\n contract has been transferred with the property of the Brighton Railroad to th Rochester Railroad, the plaintiff in error.\n The Rochester Railroad was incorporated for the purpose of acquiring the property of the Brighton Railroad, which was accomplished by a lease of the property, franchises, rights, and privileges of the Brighton Railroad, followed by the purchase of its capital stock. This was done under the authority of a statute which provided that a railroad corporation, being the lessee of the property of another railroad corporation, might acquire the whold of the capital stock of the latter, and in such a case its 'estate, property, rights, privileges, and franchises should vest in and be held and enjoyed by' the purchasing corporation. It is contended that the effect of the transfer under this law is to vest in the Rochester Railroad the exemption from the expense of street pavement which the Brighton Railroad enjoyed through the contract with the state of New York. This contention presents the question to be decided.\n This court has frequently had occasion to decide whether an immunity from the exercise of governmental power which has been granted by contract to one has, by legislative authority, been vested in or transferred to another, and in the decisions certain general principles, which control in the determination of the case at bar, have been established. Although the obligations of such a contract are protected by the Federal Constitution from impairment by the state, the contract itself is not property, which, as such, can be transferred by the owner to another, because, being personal to him with whom it was made, it is incapable of assignment. The person with whom the contract is made by the state may continue to enjoy its benefits unmolested as long as he chooses, but there his rights end, and he cannot, by any form of conveyance, transmit the contract or its benefits to a successor. Morgan v. Louisiana, \n93 U.S. 217\n, 23 L. ed. 860; Wilson v. Gaines, \n103 U.S. 417\n, 26 L. ed. 401; Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Palmes, \n109 U.S. 244\n, 27 L. ed. 922, 3 Sup. Ct. Rep. 193; Picard v. East Tennessee, V. & G. R. Co. \n130 U.S. 637\n, 32 L. ed. 1051, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 640; St. \n\n[205 U.S. 236, 248]\n\u00a0\n Louis & S. F. R. Co. v. Gill, \n156 U.S. 649\n, 39 L. ed. 567, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 484; Norfolk & W. R. Co. v. Pendleton, \n156 U.S. 667\n, 39 L. ed. 574, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 413. But the state, by virtue of the same power which created the original contract of exemption, may, either by the same law or by subsequent laws, authorize or direct the transfer of the exemption to a successor in title. In that case the exemption is taken, not by reason of the inherent right of the original holder to assign it, but by the action of the state in authorizing or directing its transfer. As in determining whether a contract of exemption from a governmental power was granted, so in determining whether its transfer to another was authorized or directed, every doubt is resolved in favor of the continuance of the governmental power, and clear and unmistakable evidence of the intent to part with it is required.\n Keeping these fundamental principles steadily in mind, we proceed to inquire whether the state of New York has authorized or directed the transfer from the Brighton Railroad to the Rochester Railroad of the contract of exemption. A legislative authorization of the transfer of 'the property and franchises' (Morgan v. Louisiana, and Picard v. East Tennessee, V. & G. R. Co. ubi supra); of 'the property' (Wilson v. Gaines and Louisville & N. R. Ct. v. Palmes, ubi supra); of 'the charter and works' (Memphis & L. R. R. Co. v. Railroad Comrs. (Memphis & L. R. R. Co. v. Berry), \n112 U.S. 609\n, 28 L. ed. 837, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 299); or of 'the rights of franchise and property' (Norfolk & W. R. Co. v. Pendleton, ubi supra),-is not sufficient to include an exemption from the taxing or other opwer of the state, and it cannot be contended that the word 'estate' has any larger meaning. It is, however, argued that the word 'privileges' is sufficiently broad to embrace within its meaning such an exemption, and that, when it is added to the other words, the legislative intent to transfer the exemption is clearly manifested, and that the words of the law under consideration, 'the estate, property, rights, privileges, and franchises,' indicate the purpose to vest in the purchasing corporation every asset of the selling corporation which is of conceivable value. There is authority \n\n[205 U.S. 236, 249]\n\u00a0\n sustaining this position, which cannot be set aside without examination.\n In the case of Humphrey v. Pegues, 16 Wall. 244, 21 L. ed. 326, it appeared that the charter of the Northeastern Railroad Company, granted by the state of South Carolina, originally contained no exemption from taxation, but that, by amendment to the charter, some years later, the real estate and stock of the company were exempted from all taxation during the continuance of its charter. Subsequently the legislature granted the charter of the Cheraw & Darlington Railroad Company, and provided that 'all the powers, rights, and privileges granted by the charter of the Northeastern Railroad Company are hereby granted to the Cheraw & Darlington Railroad Company.' The state of South Carolina attempted to tax the stock and property of the Cheraw & Darlington Railroad Company, and the validity of that taxation was the question in the case. The court held that the powers, rights, and privileges granted to the Cheraw & Darlington Railroad Company were those contained in the amendment of the charter, as well as those contained in the original charter, and said, by Mr. Justice Hunt: 'All the 'privileges,' as well as powers and rights, of the prior company, were granted to the latter. A more important or more comprehensive privilege than a perpetual immunity from taxation can scarcely be imagined. It contains the essential idea of a peculiar benefit or advantage, of a special exemption from a burden falling upon others.' Upon this reasoning it was held that the stock and real estate of the Cheraw & Darlington Railroad Company were exempt from taxation. See Gunter v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. \n200 U.S. 273\n, 50 L. ed. 477, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 252.\n In Chesapeake & O. R. Co. v. Virginia, \n94 U.S. 718\n, 24 L. ed. 310, it was said that an act conferring upon a railroad corporation 'the benefits of the charter' of another corporation which had an immunity from taxation, and 'the rights, privileges, franchises, and property' of another corporation, which, when formed, would have the 'rights, privileges, and franchises \n\n[205 U.S. 236, 250]\n\u00a0\n and property' of the corporation holding the immunity, was sufficient to transfer the immunity from taxation. But this expression of opinion was unnecessary to the decision of the case, which merely decided that where a railroad corporation acquired the property of another railroad corporation, to which was attached an immunity from taxation, that immunity did not extend beyond the property thus acquired. In Southwestern R. Co. v. Georgia, \n92 U.S. 576\n, note, 23 L. ed. 762, where a statute allowed the Muscogee Railroad to unite with the Southwestern Railroad into one company, under the charter of the latter, and it was provided that 'all the rights, privileges, and property [of the Muscogee Railroad Company] shall be part and parcel of the Southwestern Railroad,' it was held that the immunity from taxation enjoyed by the Muscogee Railroad passed with its property to the Southwestern Railroad.\n In Tennessee v. Whitworth, \n117 U.S. 139\n, 29 L. ed. 833, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 649, it was held that a statute conferring upon a railroad corporation 'all the rights, powers, and privileges' of another railroad corporation, and 'all the powers and privileges' of a third railroad corporation, included the immunities from taxation enjoyed respectively by the latter corporations, the ground of the decision being that an exemption from taxation is, in the common acceptation of the term, a privilege.\n If the authority of these four cases, supported by some dicta which need not be cited, remained unimpaired, it would justify the opinion that a legislative transfer of the 'privileges' of corporation includes an exemption from the taxing or other governmental power granted by a contract with the state. But other and later cases have essentially modified the rule which may be deduced from them.\n In the case of the Chesapeake & O. R. Co. v. Miller, \n114 U.S. 176\n, 29 L. ed. 121, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 813, it was held that the foreclosure of a mortgage on railroad property under the provisions of a statute which authorized the purchaser under a foreclosure sale to become a corporation, and provided that it should \n\n[205 U.S. 236, 251]\n\u00a0\n succeed to all such franchises, rights, and privileges' as were possessed by the mortgagor company, did not vest in the purchasing corporation an immunity from taxation.\n In Picard v. East Tennessee, V. & G. R. Co. \n130 U.S. 637\n, 32 L. ed. 1051, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 640, Mr. Justice Field, in delivering the opinion of the court, said: 'The later, and, we think, the better, opinion, is that unless other provisions remove all doubt of the intention of the legislature to include the immunity in the term 'privileges,' it will not be so construed. It can have its full force by confining it to other grants to the corporation.\n In Wilmington & W. R. Co. v. Alsbrook, \n146 U.S. 279\n, 36 L. ed. 972, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 72, Mr. Chief Justice Fuller, in delivering the opinion of the court, said, on page 297, L. ed. page 979, Sup. Ct. Rep. page 77: 'We do not deny that exemption from taxation may be construed as included in the word 'privileges,' if there are other provisions removing all doubt of the intention of the legislature in that respect.'\n In Keokuk & W. R. Co. v. Missouri, \n152 U.S. 301\n, 38 L. ed. 450, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 592, Mr. Justice Brown, in delivering the opinion of the court, said: 'Whether, under the name 'franchises and privileges,' an immunity from taxation would pass to the new company, may admit of some doubt, in view of the decisions of this court, which, upon this point, are not easy to be reconciled.'\n These conflicting views were before the court in Phoenix F. & M. Ins. Co. v. Tennessee, \n161 U.S. 174\n, 40 L. ed. 660, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 471. The plaintiff in error in that case claimed to have an immunity from taxation by virtue of a provision in its charter granting it 'all the rights and privileges' of the De Soto Insurance Company, which had an immunity from taxation by virtue of a provision in its charter granting it 'all the rights, privileges, and immunities' of the Bluff City Insurance Company, whose charter contained an expressed immunity from taxation. Mr. Justice Peckham, in delivering the opinion of the court, stated the question for decision in these words: 'Is immunity from taxation granted to plaintiff in error under language which grants 'all the rights and privileges' \n\n[205 U.S. 236, 252]\n\u00a0\n of a company which has such immunity?' Much significance was given to the fact that the word 'immunity,' which clearly includes an exemption, was used in the charter of the De Soto company, and not used in the charter of the plaintiff in error, granted seven years later. But the decision was not rested on this circumstance, although the omission was thought to cast a grave doubt upon the plaintiff's claim. The opinion reviews all the cases, cites the foregoing quotations from the opinions of Mr. Justice Brown, Mr. Justice Field, and of the Chief Justice, and, after saying: 'There must be other language than the mere word 'privilege,' or other provisions in the statute removing all doubt as to the intention of the legislature before the exemption will be admitted,' concludes that: 'If this were an original question we should have no hesitation in holding that the plaintiff in error did not acquire the exemption from taxation claimed by it, and we think at the present time the weight of authority, as well as the better opinion, is in favor of the same conclusion which we should otherwise reach.'\n In Gulf & S. I. R. Co. v. Hewes, \n183 U.S. 66\n, 46 L. ed. 86, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 26, Mr. Justice Brown, in delivering the opinion of the court, said, citing this case as authority: 'The better opinion is that a subrogation to the 'rights and privileges' of a former corporation does not include an immunity from taxation.'\n We think it is now the rule, notwithstanding earlier decisions and dicta to the contrary, that a statute authorizing or directing the grant or transfer of the 'privileges' of a corporation which enjoys immunity from taxation or regulation should not be interpreted as including that immunity. We, therefore, conclude that the words 'the estate, property, rights, privileges, and franchises' did not embrace within their meaning the immunity from the burden of paving enjoyed by the Brighton Railroad Company. Nor is there anything in this, or any other statute, which tends to show that the legislature used the words with any larger meaning than they would have standing alone. The meaning is not \n\n[205 U.S. 236, 253]\n\u00a0\n enlarged, as faintly suggested, by the expression in the statute that they are to be held by the successor 'fully and entirely, and without change and diminution,'-words of unnecessary emphasis, without which all included in 'estate, property, rights, rivileges, and franchises' would pass, and with which nothing more could pass. On the contrary, it appears, as clearly as it did in the Phoenix Fire Insurance Company Case, that the legislature intended to use the words 'rights, franchises, and privileges' in the restricted sense. The law under which this transfer was made was enacted in 1867 and amended in 1879. In 1869 an act was passed authorizing the merger and consolidation of railroad corporations (chap. 917, Laws of 1869), which provided that, upon the consolidation, 'all and singular the rights, privileges, exemptions, and franchises should be transferred to the new corporation.' In 1876 an act was passed (chap. 446, Laws of 1876) which authorized the purchasers of the rights, privileges, and franchises of railroad corporations (except street railroad corporations) under a foreclosure sale to become a corporation, and thereupon have 'all the franchises, rights, powers, privileges, and immunities' of the corporation whose property was sold. The omission in the statute under consideration of the words 'exemptions' or 'immunities,' either of which would be apt to transfer the immunity claimed, is significant, in view of the fact that each of these words was employed by the legislature about the same time in other statutes dealing with the transfer of corporate property, and raises a doubt of the intention of the legislature, which, in cases of the interpretation of a statute claimed to devest the state of a governmental power, is equivalent to a denial.\n The conclusion that the exemption of the Brighton Railroad did not accompany the transfer of its property to the Rochester Railroad is reached by another and entirely independent course of reasoning, based upon a consideration of the law under which the Rochester Railroad was incorporated. That was the general incorporation law of 1884. Every corporation \n\n[205 U.S. 236, 254]\n\u00a0\n incorporated under it was made 'subject to all the liabilities imposed by the act' ( 1), and directed to keep the street surface about and between its tracks 'in permanent repair' ( 9), which, as held by the state court, includes the duty of laying such pavement as is in controversy here. We follow the construction by that court of  9 so far as it holds that that section applies to all tracks, whether constructed under this law or any other law, owned and operated by a corporation incorporated under it. Whether the section applies, or constitutionally can apply, to a corporation not deriving its powers from the act of 1884, in respect of tracks not constructed under its provisions, it is not necessary for us to consider. There may have been a saving of the rights of such corporations under  18. That question would be presented if the Brighton Railroad, instead of a successor in title, were claiming an exemption. Here a corporation deriving its right to exist under the act of 1884 is asserting an exemption from a duty imposed upon it by the law which created it. The authorities are numerous and conclusive that no corporation can receive, by transfer from another, an exemption from taxation or governmental regulation which is inconsistent with its own charter or with the Constitution or laws of the state then applicable; and this is true, even though, under legislative authority, the exemption is transferred by words which clearly include it.

Altgelt, \n200 U.S. 304\n, 50 L. ed. 491, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 261.\n The principle governing these decisions, so plain that it needs no reasoning to support it, is that those who seek and \n\n[205 U.S. 236, 255]\n\u00a0\n obtain the benefit of a charter of incorporation must take the benefit under the conditions and with the burdens prescribed by the laws then in force, whether written in the Constitution, in general laws, or in the charter itself. The Rochester Railroad, therefore, having accepted its charter under a law which imposed upon it the duty of laying pavements, is bound to perform that duty, even in respect of tracks which, while owned by a predecessor in title, would have been exempt.\n The foregoing considerations would be conclusive of the case were it not that the plaintiff in error takes another position, which, if tenable, would avoid the result reached by either course of reasoning. It is insisted that this is not a case of transfer of an exemption; that the rules governing transfer are not applicable here; that the Brighton Railroad has not ceased to exist as a corporation; that it has been merely joined by merger with the Rochester Railroad, which controls it by stock holdings, and operates it by virtue of its franchises; and that, therefore, the Rochester Railroad may claim and enjoy the exemption of the Brighton Railroad in its behalf in respect of its property. In support of this view counsel cite Tomlinson v. Branch, 15 Wall. 460, 21 L. ed. 189; Central R. & Bkg. Co. v. Georgia, \n92 U.S. 665\n, 23 L. ed. 757; Tennessee v. Whitworth, ubi supra. These cases hold that where corporations are united in such manner that one continues to exist as a corporation, owning and operating its property, by virtue of its own charter, the corporation thus continuing to exist still holds its immunities and exemptions in respect of the property to which they apply. But the cases have no application here. It may well be that a proceeding for condemnation of property, begun by the Brighton Railroad, would not abate by reason of its consolidation with the Rochester Railroad, as held in [Re New York Elev. R. Co.] 43 N. Y. S. R. 651, 17 N. Y. Supp. 778, Affirmed in 133 N. Y. 690, 31 N. E. 627. An examination, however, of the statute under which the union of the two corporations was made, and the transactions by which the union was accomplished, shows that the Brighton \n\n[205 U.S. 236, 256]\n\u00a0\n Railroad has ceased to exist as a corporation. The Rochester Railroad first took a lease of the Brighton Railroad, apparently for the purpose of bringing itself within the provisions of the act of 1879. Then all the stock of the latter corporation was acquired by exchange of shares of stock of the former corporation. Then a certificate of the transfer of stock was filed with the secretary of state. Thereupon, by operation of the law, the 'estate, property, rights, privileges, and franchises' of the Brighton Railroad vested in the Rochester Railroad, to be thereafter controlled by the Rochester Railroad in its own corporate name. The law does not expressly dissolve the selling corporation, but it leaves it without stock, officers, property, or franchises. A corporation without shareholders, without officers to manage its business, without property with which to do business, and without the right lawfully to do business, is dissolved by the operation of the law which brings this condition into existence.

TODD(1907)\nNo. 269\nArgued: Decided: May 27, 1907\n\n\n\n Mr. Frederick L. Cornwell for appellant.\n Mr. N. B. K. Pettingill for appellee.\n\n\n[206 U.S. 358, 361]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n Robert H. Todd obtained a judgment in the United States provisional court of Porto Rico, in the year 1900, for the sum of $2,946.05, against Pedro and Juan Agostini, and execution to enforce the same was rereturned nulla bona. Thereupon Todd, in 1901, filed a bill in equity in the United States court for the district of Porto Rico against the judgment debtors ( the two Agostinis) and one Ana Merle for the purpose of enforcing the judgment upon certain real property of which Ana Merle stood upon the public records as the owner. The ground was that the property had been paid for with the money of the Agostinis and was hence liable to be applied to their debts. Without further detail it is only necessary to say that the court decreed that a certain parcel of land described in the bill had been purchased by Ana Merle with funds belonging to Pedro Agostini, and said Agostini 'was the owner of the equitable and beneficial title of the same.' And it was ordered that, to pay the indebtedness to Todd, the property, with the improvements thereon, be sold at public sale by a commissioner appointed for that purpose. Whilst this suit was pending, before decree, the piece of real estate embraced by the decree was sold by Merle to Higinio Romeu, the plaintiff in error. The present bill was filed on behalf of Romeu against Todd to enjoin the sale of this piece of property. The bill alleged the bringing of the Todd suit, the purchase by Romeu pending such suit, the \n\n[206 U.S. 358, 362]\n\u00a0\n decree rendered therein as above stated, and the fact that the decree was about to be executed. It was averred that the purchase by Romeu had been made for an adequate consideration, with the utmost good faith and without knowledge of the pendency of the Todd suit; that the property, since it was bought by Romeu, had been largely improved by him, and tha, as no cautionary notice concerning the Todd suit, as authorized and required by the law of Porto Rico, had been put upon the records, the property acquired by Romeu under the circumstances alleged was not subject, in Romeu's hands, to the Todd decree. A temporary restraining order was allowed. The bill was demurred to on two grounds,-first, that it stated no cause of action, and second, that, admitting all its averments to be true, as the property was bought whilst the equity cause was pending, the purchaser took subject to the lis pendens. The demurrer was sustained, and, Romeu electing not to plead further, a final decree was made dismissing the bill.\n The court below, in its opinion, assumed that, under the local law, a third party in good faith purchasing from or dealing with the registered owner of real estate, without notice in fact of the existence of a pending suit concerning the title to property, was not to be treated by operation of law as constructively notified of the pendency of the suit unless the cautionary notice which the law of Porto Rico required to be put upon the record was given. But, whilst so declaring, it was nevertheless decided that the local rule of real property referred to was not controlling in this case. This ruling was based upon the conception that the constructive notice resulting from a suit in equity in the United States court for Porto Rico was to be imputed, irrespective of the positive requirements of the local law. The court said:\n'As this is a proceeding on the equity side of the court it is governed by the principles of equity followed by the Federal courts, as distinguished from suits at law, where local statutes are adopted. As local laws have no binding force upon the United States courts in matters of procedure in equity and \n\n[206 U.S. 358, 363]\n\u00a0\n maritime law, the laws of Porto Rico relating to filing of notice of lis pendens have therefore no application in this case, and the sufficiency of this bill must be determined by the rules and principles followed in like proceedings in the courts of the United States. Stewart v. Wheeling & L. E. R. Co. 52 Ohio St. 151, 29 L.R.A. 438, 41 N. E. 247.'\n\n Proceeding then to apply what is deemed to be the conclusive force of decisions of this court, it was held that the pendency of an equity cause in a court of the United States affecting real property constituted constructive notice as to third parties, and was therefore operative against those dealing with the owner as to such property, in good faith, any rule of state law to the contrary.\n In the argument at bar on behalf of the appellee the correctness of the ground upon which the court based its decision is insisted on as follows:\n'The main contention of appellant, however, seems to be that even courts of equity of the United States in a state are bound by the statutory provisions for recording a lis pendens when such provision has been enacted in such state. But in this contention counsel fail to distinguish between cases of law and cases in equity . . .'\n\n Nevertheless, in substance, it is contended that, even if the court below was wrong in its reasoning, it was right in its conclusion. This rests on the proposition that the court mistakenly assumed that the local law provided for a notice of the pendency of suit of the character of the Todd case, and protected an innocent purchaser where a notice was not given.\n That issue arises, therefore, and as it underlies the question whether the court should have applied the local law, we come first to ascertain the local law concerning notice and its effect.\n It appears certain that by the ancient Spanish law the sale or the dismemberment by mortgage of the ownership of real property which was involved in a pending litigation was forbidden. Law 13, title 7, Part. 3; see also Resolution of November 29, 1770, referred to in commentaries upon the Spanish \n\n[206 U.S. 358, 364]\n\u00a0\n mortgage legislation by D. Leon Galindo y De Vera, 1903 ed., vol. 2, p. 594. The result was that acts done invi olation of the prohibitory law were void, even as to innocent third parties. But, as pointed out by the author just referred to, the prohibition in question was omitted from the Spanish Civil Code, and therefore the right to deal with real property involved in a pending litigation was no longer prohibited. And when the comprehensive system known as the mortgage law came to be adopted, the power of the record owner of real property involved in litigation, to mortgage or contract concerning the same, was not left to the implication resulting from the disappearance of the ancient prohibitions, but was expressly recognized by articles 71 and 107 of the mortgage laws. D. Leon Galindo y De Vera, in his commentaries, considering the provisions of the mortgage law concerning the power of the owner of real property to deal with it pendente lite, and of the right of the plaintiff in a suit affecting such property to obtain a cautionary notice, and his duty to record the same in order to affect third parties, points out that these provisions were the natural result of three considerations: respect for the rights of property, regard for the rights of one seeking redress in the courts against such owner, and solicitude for the public interest. Because of the first the owner was not deprived of his right to dispose of his real property merely because a suit relating to the same had been brought against him, but was left free to make contracts concerning the property, if anyone could be found willing to do so, and thus assume the risk of the pending litigation. On account of the second consideration a means was provided for giving a notice by which one who brought suit would be able to secure the results of an ultimate decision in his favor. Because of the third, those dealing in good faith, in reliance on public records, were protected from the risks of pending suits unless the cautionary notice was made and recorded according to the statute.\n That the essence of the statute was the protection of innocent third parties dealing with the recorded owner when no \n\n[206 U.S. 358, 365]\n\u00a0\n cautionary notice had been given is obvious. Answering the contrary contention, D. Leon Galindo y De Vera says (p. 192):\n'That is not so; if the mortgagor has on the record the ownership of the properties in litigation and those who claim the properties have not made the cautionary notice on the register, and the writing establishing the mortgage does not show that the properties are in litigation, the debtor can freely mortgage them, and the mortgage will have effect, even when the decision of the case is in favor of the plaintiffs, declaring that the ownership of the properties mortgaged belengs to them.'\n\n See articles 71 and 107 of the 'Mortgage Law for Cuba, Porto Rico, and the Philippine Islands,' War Department translation, 1899, and see also title 2 of the same law, concerning the method of recording instruments and the effect of such record, and title 3, relating to cautionary notices.\n Granting that the general result of the local law is as we have just stated it, the contention yet is that the character of the Todd suit and the nature of the relief sought therein caused it to be not within the scope of the mortgage law and the provisions thereof for giving a cautionary notice. This is based upon article 42 of the mortgage law, reading:\n'Art. 42. Cautionary notices of their respective interests in the corresponding public registries may be demanded by:\n\n'1. The person who enters suit for the ownership of the real property, or for the creation, declaration, modification, or extinction of any property right. . . .'\n\n And article 91 of the general regulations for the execution of the mortgage law, War Department translation, 1899, as follows:\n'The person who brings the action for ownership, referred to in case No. 1 of article 42 of the law, may, at the same time or subsequently, request that a cautionary notice thereof be made, offering to indemnify any damages which may be caused the defendant thereby, should he win the suit.'\n\n Now, it is said when the issues in the Todd suit are clearly apprehended, they were not within the purview of the articles \n\n[206 U.S. 358, 366]\n\u00a0\n in question, since that suit did not seek to devest Ana Merle of the ownership of the property standing in her name on the public records, but simply to subject such property to the payment of the indebtedness due by the Agostinis to Todd. This, however, assumes that article 42 embraces only suits having for their object the entire divestiture of ownership,- that is, the divestiture of perfect ownership,-whilst the text of the article relied upon not only relates to suits so operating, but also to those which seek the modification 'or extinction of any property right.' But even if the proposition relied upon might find some color of support in a narrow and technical construction of the provisions of the mortgage law referred to, its unsoundness is, we think, demonstrated by a consideration of other provisions of the law, especially articles 2 and 23 of that law, the first reading as follows:\n'In the registries mentioned in the preceding article shall be recorded:\n\n'1. Instruments transferring or declaring ownership of realty, or of property rights thereto.\n\n'2. Instruments by which rights of use and occupancy, emphyteusis, mortgage, annuity (censo), servitudes, and any others by which estates are created, acknowledged, modified, or extinguished.'\n\n The second (art. 23) reads as follows:\n'The instruments mentioned in articles 2 and 5, which are not duly recorded or entered in the registry, cannot prejudice third persons.'\n\n Mark the constructive power of the provision of the second paragraph of article 2, requiring the registry, in order that they may affect third parties, of all acts 'by which estates are created, acknowledged, modified, or extinguished' when applied to the words of article 42, providing for the registry of a cautionary notice, not only of all suits for the 'ownership of the real property,' but likewise of suits brought 'for the creation, deciaration, modification, or extinction of any property right.'\n Besides, when the purpose of the mortgage law is borne in \n\n[206 U.S. 358, 367]\n\u00a0\n mind, it is apparent that the interpretation relied upon would frustrate the very ends which the adoption of the law was intended to subserve.\n But, passing this view, it is, we think, clear, that the proposition rests upon a misconception of the true import of the bill in the Todd case. The property stood upon the records, not in the name of the Agostinis, but in the name of Merle. The bill alleged that the Agostinis, and not Merle, owned the property, because it had been bought and paid for by the former. The purpose, therefore, of the suit was to change the recorded title by in effect obtaining a decree placing the property in the name of the real owner. In the very nature of things, under the civil law, the cause of action thus asserted was not merely revocatory (the Actio Pauliana of the Roman law), but was an action to unmask a simulation. It was therefore essentially revendicatory. Bonnafon v. Wiltz, 10 La. Ann. 657; and see the copious list of authorities illustrating the subject, compiled in Hennen's La. Dig. vol. 2, p. 1031, is clearly the case, since the fructus, the this conclusion. It held Pedro Agostini to be the 'owner of the equitable and beneficial title' to the property. It therefore devested the registered owner, Merle, of every essential element of ownership. This is clearly the case, since the fructus the usus, and the abusus could not be in one who was stripped of all beneficial interest. This becomes more clearly manifest when it is borne in mind that the civil law prevailing in Porto Rico is oblivious concerning a technical or formal distinction between legal and equitable title. As beyond peradventure, then, the suit and the decree took from the recorded owner the ownership upon which necessarily the innocent third party must have relied, we think it clearly follows that the cautionary notice rqu ired by the provisions of the mortgage law was essential to affect the innocent third person.\n The remaining question, then, is, Was the local statutory rule of real property, requiring the giving and recording of a cautionary notice of the pending suit in order to affect innocent third parties dealing with the recorded owner, applicable to a \n\n[206 U.S. 358, 368]\n\u00a0\n suit brought on the equity side of the United States district court for Porto Rico? Let us assume, for the sake of argument, that the lower court correctly reasoned that an innocent third party would be affected by the constructive notice resulting from the pendency of an equity cause in a circuit court of the United States sitting within a state. Again, let us further assume, for the sake of argument, that it was correctly held that the rule just stated would govern, although there had been no compliance with a statutory rule of property prevailing in such state, requiring the recording of a notice of the pendency of suits affecting real property, in order to make the same operative against innocent third parties. Neither of these concessions, we think, is here controlling. The district court of the United States for Porto Rico is in no sense a constitutional court of the United States, and its authority emanates wholly from Congress under the sanction of the power possessed by that body to govern territory occupying the relation to the United States which Porto Rico does. Now by  8 of the act commonly known as the Foraker act (31 Stat. at L. 79, chap. 191) it is provided as follows:\n'Sec. 8. That the laws and ordinances of Porto Rico now in force shall continue in full force and effect, except as altered, amended, or modified hereinafter, or as altered or modified by military orders and decrees in force when this act shall take effect, and so far as the same are not inconsistent or in conflict with the statutory laws of the United States not locally inapplicable, or the provisions hereof, until altered, amended, or repealed by the legislative authority hereinafter provided for Porto Rico or by act of Congress of the United States. . . .'\n\n The provision just quoted, it may be added, is qualified by a proviso repealing enumerated provisions of the local laws concerning marriage, divorce, and other subjects.\n Now, as a general proposition, it is clear that, as a result of the relation which Porto Rico occupies to the United States, all the local law of that island has its ultimate sanction in the \n\n[206 U.S. 358, 369]\n\u00a0\n lawful exercise by Congress of its legislative authority. So also, as Congress has provided that the local law 'not inconsistent or in conflict with the statutory laws of the United States' shall remain in force 'until altered, amended, or repealed by the legislative authority hereinafter provided for Porto Rico or by act of Congress of the United States,' it must follow that the local law of real property prevailing in the island is controlling until changed, as provided by Congress. This being true, we cannot assent to the conclusion that the court of the United States created by Congress had the authority to disregard the local law which Congress, by express legislation, directed to be continued in force. But it is said that the act ( 34) in providing for the district court of the United States for Porto Rico declared, among other things, that the court shall have, 'in addition to the ordinary jurisdiction of district courts of the United States, jurisdiction of all cases cognizant in the circuit courts of the United States, and shall proceed therein in the same manner as a circuit court.' From this it is argued that the constructive notice resulting from the equity cause in the district court for Porto Rico must, in the nature of things, be operative against innocent purchasers without reference to the local law prevailing for cautionary notices and registry, if such result would flow from an equity cause pending in a constitutional court of the United States sitting within one of the states. But the propsi tion begs the question, since it puts out of review the express provision of the act of Congress sanctioning and enforcing the local law, except in so far as Congress had deemed fit to abrogate the same. Considering the manifest intent of Congress, we cannot close our eyes to the fact that that body, in providing a government for Porto Rico, evidently intended to preserve to the people of that island the system of local law to which they had been accustomed; nor can we, consistently with this enlightened purpose, assent to the conclusion that the mere provision of the act by which a court was created to enforce the local law empowered the court so created to set at naught the local law \n\n[206 U.S. 358, 370]\n\u00a0\n by disregarding fundamental rules of real property governing in the island, thereby creating confusion and uncertainty, and hence tending to the destruction of the rights of innocent third parties. Especially is this conclusion rendered necessary when a consideration, previously adverted to, is again called to mind; that is, that all the local law of Porto Rico is within the legislative control of Congress. The considerations which we have thus expounded are illustrated in various other aspects by previous rulings concerning the construction and import of the Foraker act. Crowley v.

CITY OF NEW YORK(1907)\n\nArgued: March 21, 1907Decided: May 27, 1907\n\n\n\n George W. Sauer, the intestate of the plaintiffs in error (hereafter called the plaintiff), became, on July 1, 1886, the owner in fee simple of a parcel of land on the corner of One Hundred and Fifty-fifth street and Eighth avenue, in the city of New York. There was then upon the land a building used as a place of public resort. The city of New York was and is the owner of the fee of One Hundred and Fifty-fifth street and Eighth avenue, which it holds in trust for the public for highways.\n Before the passage of the act hereinafter referred to One Hundred and Fifty-fifth street had been graded from Eighth \n\n[206 U.S. 536, 537]\n\u00a0\n avenue in a westerly direction, until it reached a high, and, for street sues, impassable, bluff, on the summit of which ran St. Nicholas place, a public highway. The street, as laid out on the records, ascends the bluff, and continues westerly to the Hudson river. It extends easterly to the Harlem river at a point where the river is bridged by McComb's Dam bridge.\n In 1887 the legislature of the state of New York enacted a law which authorized the city of New York, for the purpose of improving and regulating the use of One Hundred and Fifty-fifth street, to construct over said street from St. Nicholas place to McComb's Dam bridge an elevated iron viaduct for the public travel, with the proviso that no railways should be permitted upon it. There was no provision for damages to the owners of land abutting on the street. Subsequently the viaduct was constructed, resting upon iron columns placed in the roadway. The surface of the viaduct consisted of asphalt and paving blocks laid on iron beams. Opposite the plaintiff's land it is 63 feet wide and about 50 feet above the surface of the original street, which, except as interfered with by the viaduct, remains unobstructed for public travel. At the junction of the street with Eighth avenue it is widened into a quadrangular platform, 80 by 160 feet in extent. Near the plaintiff's land the viaduct may be reached by a stairway. By the construction and maintenance of the viaduct the plaintiff's access to his land and the free and uninterrupted use of light and air have been impaired, and the value of his property has been decreased by reason of the dust, dirt, and noise occasioned by the structure. This action was brought to enjoin the defendant from maintaining the viaduct, or, in the alternative, for the recovery of damages caused by it. There was judgment for the defendant by the supreme court, affirmed by the appellate division and the court of appeals. 180 N. Y. 27, 70 L.R.A. 717, 72 N. E. 579. After the last decision the case was remitted to the supreme court, where there was final judgment for the defendant, and it is now here on writ of error under the claim that-- \n\n[206 U.S. 536, 538]\n\u00a0\n First.

Anderson and Chandler P. Anderson for certain property owners similarly situated.\n\n\n\n[206 U.S. 536, 541]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Moody, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The acts of the defendant for which the plaintiff sought a remedy in the courts of New York may be simply stated. The plaintiff owned land with buildings thereon situated at the junction of One Hundred and Fifty-fifth street and Eighth avenue, two public highways, in which the fee was vested in the city upon the trust that they should be forever kept open as public streets. As One Hundred and Fifty-fifth street was graded at the time the plaintiff acquired his title, it was isolated to a considerable extent from the street system of the city. Its west end ran into a high and practically impassable bluff, which rendered further progress in that direction impossible. The east end ran to the bank of the Harlem river at a grade which rendered access to McComb's Dam bridge, which crossed the river at that point, impossible. Under legislative authority the city constructed, solely for public travel, a viaduct over One Hundred and Fifty-fifth street, beginning at \n\n[206 U.S. 536, 542]\n\u00a0\n the bridge and thence running with gradual ascent to the top of the bluff. This viaduct enabled travelers to use One Hundred and Fifty-fifth street, in connection with other streets of the city, from which it had previously been disconnected. The viaduct rested upon columns planted in the street, and they, and the viaduct itself, to a material extent, impaired the plaintiff's access to his land and the free admission to it of light and air. The plaintiff, in his complaint, alleged that this structure was unlawful, because the law under which it was constructed did not provide for compensation for the injury to his private property in the easements of access, light, and air appurtenant to his estate. The court of appeals denied the plaintiff the relief which he sought, upon the ground that, under the law of New York, he had no easements of access, light, or air, as against any improvement of the street for the purpose of adapting it to public travel. In other words, the court in effect decided that the property alleged to have been injured did not exist. The reasons upon which the decision of that court proceeded will appear by quotations from the opinion of the court, delivered by Judge Haight. Judge Haight said:\n'The fee of the street having been acquired accordig to the provisions of the statute, we must assume that full compensation was made to the owners of the lands through which the streets and avenues were laid out, and that thereafter the owners of lands abutting thereon hold their titles subject to all of the legitimate and proper uses to which the streets and public highways may be devoted. As such owners they are subject to the right of the public to grade and improve the streets, and they are presumed to have been compensated for any future improvement or change in the surface or grade rendered necessary for the convenience of public travel, especially in cities where the growth of population increases the use of the highways. The rule may be different as to peculiar and extraordinary changes made for some ulterior purposes other than the improvement of the street, as, for instance, \n\n[206 U.S. 536, 543]\n\u00a0\n where the natural surface has been changed by artificial means, such as the construction of a railroad embankment, or a bridge over a railroad, making elevated approaches necessary. But as to changes from the natural contour of the surface, rendered necessary in order to adapt the street to the free and easy passage of the public, they may be lawfully made without additional compensation to abutting owners, and for that purpose bridges may be constructed over streams and viaducts over ravines, with approaches thereto from intersecting streets. . . . In the case under consideration, as we have seen, One Hundred and Fifty-fifth street continued west to Bradhurst avenue. There it met a steep bluff 70 feet high, on the top of which was St. Nicholas place. The title of the street up the bluff had been acquired and recorded, but it had never been opened and worked as a street. The bluff was the natural contour of the surface, and, for the purpose of facilitating easy and safe travel of the public from St. Nicholas place to other portions of the city, the legislature authorized the construction of the viaduct in question. It is devoted to ordinary traffic by teams, vehicles, and pedestrians. It is prohibited for railroad purposes. It is one of the uses to which public highways are primarily opened and devoted. It was constructed under legislative authority, in the exercise of governmental powers, for a public purpose. It is not, therefore, a nuisance, and the plaintiff is not entitled to have its maintenance enjoined or to recover in this action the consequential damages sustained.'\n\n The plaintiff now contends that the judgment afterwards rendered by the supreme court of New York, in conformity with the opinion of the court of appeals, denied rights secured to him by the Federal Constitution. This contention presents the only question for our determination, and the correctness of the principles of local land law applied by the state courts is not open to inquiry here, unless it has some bearing upon that question. But it may not be inappropriate to say that the decision of the court of appeals seems to be in full accord \n\n[206 U.S. 536, 544]\n\u00a0\n with the decisions of all other courts in which the same question has arisen. The state courts have uniformly held that the erection over a street of an elevated viaduct, intended for general public travel, and not devoted to the exclusive use of a private transportation corporation, is a legitimate street improvement, equivalent to a change of grade; and that, as in the case of a change of grade, an owner of land abutting on the street is not entitled to damages for the impairment of access to his land and the lessening of the circulation of light and air over it.

Richmond, \n172 U.S. 82\n-95, 43 L. ed. 374-379, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 106);wi llets Mfg. Co. v. Mercer County, 62 N. J. L. 95, 40 Atl. 782; Brand v. multnomah County, 38 Or. 79, 50 L.R.A. 389, 84 Am.

Crocker, 184 Mass. 588, 100 Am. St. Rep. 577, 69 N. E. 327; (Semble) DeLucca v. North Little Rock, 142 Fed. 597.\n The case of Willis v. Winona is singularly like the case at bar in its essential facts. There, as here, a viaduct was constructed, connecting by a gradual ascent the level of a public street with the level of a public bridge across the Mississippi. An owner of land abutting on the street over which the viaduct was elevated was denied compensation for his injuries, Mr. Justice Mitchell saying:\n'The bridge is just as much a public highway as is Main street, with which it connects; and, whether we consider the approach as a part of the former or of the latter, it is merely a part of the highway. The city having, as it was authorized to do, established a new highway across the Mississippi river, it was necessary to connect it, for purposes of travel, with Main and the other streets of the city. This it has done, in the only way it could have been done, by what, in effect, amounts merely to raising the grade of the center of Main street in front of plaintiff's lot. It can make no difference in prin- \n\n[206 U.S. 536, 545]\n\u00a0\n ciple whether this was done by filling up the street solidly, or, as in this case, by supporting the way on stone or iron columns. Neither is it important if the city raise the grade of only a part of the street, leaving the remainder at a lower grade. . . .\n\n'The doctrine of the courts everywhere, both in England and in this country (unless Ohio and Kentucky are exceptions), is that so long as there is no application of the street to purposes other than those of a highway, any establishment or change of grade made lawfully, and not negligently performed, does not impose an additional servitude upon the street, and hence is not within the constitutional inhibition against taking private property without compensation, and is not the basis for an action for damages, unless there be an express statute to that effect. That this is the rule, and that the facts of this case fall within it, is too well established by the decisions of this court to require the citation of authorities from other jurisdictions. . . .\n\n'The New York elevated railway cases cited by plaintiff are not authority in his favor, for they recognize and affirm the very doctrine that we have laid down (Story v. New York Elev. R. Co. 90 N. Y. 122, 43 Am. Rep. 146), but hold that the construction and maintenance on the street of an elevated railroad operated by steam, and which was not open to the public for purposes of travel and traffic, was a perversion of the street from street uses, and imposed upon it an additional servitude, which entitled abutting owners to damages.'\n\n The cases cited usually recognized the authority of the New York elevated cases, hereinafter to be discussed, and approved the distinction from them made by Mr. Justice Mitchell.\n But, as has been said, we are not concerned primarily with the correctness of the rule adopted by the court of appeals of New York and its conformity with authority. This court does not hold the relation to the controversy between these parties which the court of appeals of New York had. It was \n\n[206 U.S. 536, 546]\n\u00a0\n the duty of that court to ascertain, declare, and apply the law of New York, and its determination of that law is conclusive upon this court. This court is not made, by the laws passed in pursuance of the Constitution, a court of appeal from the highest courts of the states, except to a very limited extent, and for a precisely defined purpose. The limitation upon the power of this court in the review of the decisions of the courts of the states, though elementary and fundamental, is not infrequently overlooked at the Bar, and unless it is kept steail y in mind much confusion of thought and argument result. It seems worth while to refer to the provisions of the Constitution and laws which mark and define the relation of this court to the courts of the state. Article 3,  2 of the Constitution ordains, among other things, that 'the judicial power shall extend to all cases in law and equity arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority,' and that the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court shall be exercised under such regulations as Congress shall make.\n It was from this provision of the Constitution that Marshall in Cohen v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 5 L. ed. 257, derived the power of this court to review the judgments of the courts of the states, and, in defining the appellate jurisdiction, the Chief Justice expressly limited it to questions concerning the Constitution, laws, and treaties of the United States, commonly called Federal questions, and excluded altogether the thought that, under the congressional regulation, the jurisdiction included any power to correct any supposed errors of the state courts in the determination of the state law. Such was the expressed limitation of the original judiciary act, in its present form found in  709 of the Revised Statutes, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 575, which has been observed by this court in so many cases that the citation of them would be an idle parade. It is enough to refer to Murdock v. Memphis, 20 Wall. 590, 22 Wall. 429, where, after great consideration, it was held that under the judiciary act, as amended to its present form, this court was limited to the consideration of \n\n[206 U.S. 536, 547]\n\u00a0\n the Federal questions named in the Constitution. This court, whose highest function it is to confine all other authorities within the limits prescribed for them by the fundamental law, ought certainly to be zealous to restrain itself within the limits of its own jurisdiction, and not be insensibly tempted beyond them by the thought that an unjustified or harsh rule of law may have been applied by the state courts in the determination of a question committed exclusively to their care.\n In the case at bar, therefore, we have to consider solely whether the judgment under review has denied to the plaintiff any right secured to him by the Federal Constitution. He complains:\n First. That he was denied the due process of law secured to him by the 14th Amendment, in that his property was taken without compensation; and\n Second. That the law which authorized the construction of the viaduct, as interpreted by the court of appeals of New York, impaired the obligation of the contract with the city of New York, which is implied from the laying out of the street, in violation of article 1,  10, paragraph 1, of the Constitution. The contentions may profitably be considered separately.\n Has the plaintiff been deprived of his property without due process of law? The viaduct did not invade the plaintiff's land. It was entirely outside that land. But it is said that appurtenant to the land there were easements of access, light, and air, and that the construction and operation of the viaduct impaired these easements to such an extent as to constitute a taking of them. The only question which need here be decided is whether the plaintiff had, as appurtenant to his land, easements of the kind described; in other words, whether the property which the plaintiff alleged was taken existed at all. The court below has decided that the plaintiff had no such easements; in other words, that there was no property taken. It is clear that, under the law of New York, an owner of land abutting on the street has easements of access, light \n\n[206 U.S. 536, 548]\n\u00a0\n and air as against the erection of an elevated roadway by or for a private corporation for its own exclusive purposes, but that he has no such easements as against the public use of the streets, or any structures which may be erected upon the street to subserve and promote that pubic use. The same law which declares the easements defines, qualifies, and limits them. Surely such questions must be for the final determination of the state court. It has authority to declare that the abutting landowner has no easement of any kind over the abutting street; it may determine that he has a limited easement; or it may determine that he has an absolute and unqualified easement. The right of an owner of land abutting on public highways has been a fruitful source of litigation in the courts of all the states, and the decisions have been conflicting, and often in the same state irreconcilable in principle. The courts have modified or overruled their own decisions, and each state has in the end fixed and limited, by legislation or judicial decision, the rights of abutting owners in accordance with its own view of the law and public policy. As has already been pointed out, this court has neither the right nor the duty to reconcile these conflicting decisions nor to reduce the law of the various states to a uniform rule which it shall announce and impose. Upon the ground, then, that under the law of New York, as determined by its highest court, the plaintiff never owned the easements which he claimed, and that therefore there was no property taken, we hold that no violation of the 14th Amendment is shown.\n The remaining question in the case is whether the judgment under review impaired the obligation of a contract. It appears from the cases to be cited that the courts of New York have expressed the rights of owners of land abutting upon public streets to and over those streets in terms of contract rather than in terms of title. In the city of New York the city owns the fee of the public streets (whether laid out under the civil law of the Dutch r egime, or as the result of conveyances between the city and the owners of land, or by \n\n[206 U.S. 536, 549]\n\u00a0\n condemnation proceedings under the statutory law of the state) upon a trust that they shall forever be kept open as public streets, which is regarded as a covenant running with the abutting land. Accepting, for the purposes of this discussion, the view that the plaintiff's rights have their origin in a contract, then it must be that the terms of the trust and the extent of the resulting covenant are for the courts of New York finally to decide and limit, providing that in doing so they deny no Federal right of the owner. The plaintiff asserts that the case of Story v. New York Elev. R. Co. 90 N. Y. 122, 43 Am. Rep. 146, decided in 1882, four years before he acquired title to the property, interpreted the contract between the city of New York and the owners of land abutting upon its streets as assuring the owner easements of access, light, and air, which could not lawfully be impaired by the erection on the street of an elevated structure designed for public travel; that he is entitled to the benefit of his contract as thus interpreted, and that the judgment of the court denying him its benefits impaired its obligation. If the facts upon which this claim is based are accurately stated, then the case comes within the authority of Muhlker v. New York & H. R. Co. \n197 U.S. 544\n, 49 L. ed. 872, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 522, which holds that, when the court of appeals has once interpreted the contract existing between the landowner and the city, that interpretation becomes a part of the contract, upon which one acquiring land may rely, and that any subsequent change of it to his injury impairs the obligation of the contract. It will be observed that it is an essential part of the plaintiff's case that he should show that his contract had been interpreted in the manner he states. It therefore becomes necessary to examine the Story Case, wherein, he asserts, such an interpretation was made. In order to ascertain precisely what that case decided we may consider other decisions of the court of appeals, though they are later in time than the acquisition of the plaintiff's title.\n The plaintiff in the Story Case held the title to land injuriously affected by the construction f an elevated railroad, \n\n[206 U.S. 536, 550]\n\u00a0\n as a successor to a grantee from the city. In the deed of the city the land was bounded on the street and contained a covenant that it should 'forever thereafter continue and be for the free and common passage of, and as public streets and ways for, the inhabitants of the said city, and all others passing and returning through or by the same, in like manner as the other streets of the same city now are, or lawfully ought to be.' It was held that by virtue of this covenant, which ran with the land, the plaintiff was entitled to easements in the street of access, and of free and uninterrupted passage of light and air; that the easements were property within the meaning of the Constitution of the state, and could not lawfully be taken from their owner without compensation, and that the erection of the elevated structure was a taking. The decision rested upon the view that the erection of an elevated structure for railroad purposes was not a legitimate street use. 'There is no change,' said Judge Danforth ( p. 156), 'in the street surface intended; but the elevation of a structure useless for general street purposes, and as foreign thereto as the house in Vesey street (Corning v. Lowerre, 6 Johns. Ch. 439) or the freight depot (Barney v. Keokuk, \n94 U.S. 324\n, 24 L. ed. 224).'\n'The question here presented,' said Judge Tracy (p. 174, Am. Rep. p. 156), 'is not whether the legislature has the power to regulate and control the public uses of the public streets of the city, but whether it has the power to grant to a railroad corporation authority to take possession of such streets and appropriate them to uses inconsistent with and destructive of their continued use as open public streets of the city.'\n\n In the case of Lahr v. Metropolitan Elev. R. Co. 104 N. Y. 268, 10 N. E. 528, decided in 1887, the plaintiff held title by mesne conveyances from the owner, from whom the land for the street had been acquired by condemnation under a statute which provided that the land thus taken should be held 'in trust, nevertheless that the same be appropriated and kept open for and as a part of a public street . . . forever, in like manner as the other public streets . . . in the said city \n\n[206 U.S. 536, 551]\n\u00a0\n are, and of right ought to be.' It was contended that the principle of the Story Case should be confined to those who, like Story, held title under a grant from the city with a covenant that the street should be kept open. But the court held that there was no legal difference between the two cases, and that from the condemnation statute a covenant running with the land was implied for the benefit of its owners, and that the plaintiff was entitled to recover damages for the injury to his easements of access, light, and air. But, as in the Story Case, the extent of the decision was carefully limited. 'The logical effect of the decision in the Story Case,' said Chief Judge Ruger (p. 292, N. E. p. 533), 'is to so construe the Constitution as to operate as a restriction upon the legislative power over the public streets opened under the act of 1813, and confine its exercise to such legislation as shall authorize their use for street purposes alone. Whenever any other use is attempted to be authorized, it exceeds its constitutional authority. Statutes relating to public streets which attempt to authorize their use for additional street uses are obviously within the power of the legislature to enact.'\n In the case of Kane v. New York Elev. R. Co. 125 N. Y. 164, 11 L.R.A. 640, 26 N. E. 278, decided in 1891, it appeared that the street there in question was laid out during the Dutch r egime, when the town had absolute title to the fee of the streets, with no easement over them in favor of the abutting land. But it was held by the court that by virtue of certain legislation, not necessary here to be stated, New York city owns the fee in all of its streets upon a trust, both for the public and the abutting land, that they shall forever be kept open as public streets, nd that as to an abutting owner this trust cannot be violated without compensation. But in the opinion the limits of the principle were again carefully guarded. It was said by Judge Andrews (p. 175, L.R.A. p. 642, N. E. p. 278 ): 'Under the decisions made there seems to be no longer any doubt in this state that streets in a city laid out and opened under charter provisions may, under legislative and municipal authority, be used for any public use consistent \n\n[206 U.S. 536, 552]\n\u00a0\n with their preservation as public streets, and this, although the use may be new, and may seem to impose an additional burden, and may subject lot owners to injury. The mere disturbance of their rights of light, air, and access by the imposition of a new street use must be borne, and gives no right of action.' And again (p. 185, L.R.A. p. 645, N. E. p. 282): 'We conclude this part of the case with the remark that neither the Story nor the Lahr Case imposes any limitation upon the legislative power over streets for street uses. They simply hold that the trust upon which streets are held cannot be subverted by devoting them to other and inconsistent uses.'\n It would be difficult for words to show more clearly than those quoted from the opinions that such a case as that now before us was not within the scope of the decisions or of the reasons upon which they were founded. The difference between a structure erected for the exclusive use of a railroad and one erected for the general use of the public was sharply defined. It was only the former which the court had in view. That the structure was elevated, and for that reason affected access, light, and air, was an important element in the decisions, but it was not the only essential element. The structures in these cases were held to violate the landowners' rights, not only because they were elevated and thereby obstructed access, light, and air, but also because they were designed for the exclusive and permanent use of private corporations. The limitation of the scope of the decision to such structures, erected for such purposes, appears not only in the decisions themselves, but quite clearly from subsequent decisions of the court of appeals. In the case of Fobes v. Rome, W. & O. R. Co. 121 N. Y. 505, 8 L.R.A. 453, 24 N. E. 919, Judge Peckham, now Mr. Justice Peckham, made the following statement of the effect of the Story Case. Certain portions of it are italicized here for the purpose of emphasizing the point now under consideration:\n'It was not intended in the Story Case to overrule or change the law in regard to steam surface railroads. The case em- \n\n[206 U.S. 536, 553]\n\u00a0\n bodied the application of what was regarded as well-established principles of law to a new combination of facts, such facts amounting, as was determined, to an absolute and permanent obstruction in a portion of the public street, and in a total and exclusive use of such portion by the defendant, and such permanent obstruction and total and exclusive use, it was further held, amounted to a taking of some portion of the plaintiff's easement in the street for the purpose of furnishing light, air, and access to his adjoining lot. This absolute and permanent obstruction of the street, and this total and exclusive use of a portion thereof by the defendant were accomplished by the erection of a structure for the elevated railroad of defendant; which structure is fully described in the case as reported.\n\n'The structure, by the mere fact of its existence in the street, permanently and at every moment of the day took away from the plaintiff some portion of the light and air which otherwise would have reached him, and, in a degree very appreciable, interfered with and took away from him his facility of access to his lot; such interference not being intermittent and caused by the temporary use of the street by the passage of the vehicles of the defendant while it was operating its road through the street, but caused by the iron posts and by the superstructure imposed thereon, and existing forev ery moment of the day and night. Such a permanent, total, exclusive, and absolute appropriation of a portion of the street as this structure amounted to was held to be illegal and wholly beyond any legitimate or lawful use of a public street. The taking of the property of the plaintiff in that case was held to follow upon the permanent and exclusive nature of the appropriation by the defendant of the public street, or of some portion thereof.'\n\n The distinction between the erection of an elevated structure for the exclusive use of a private corporation and the same structure for the use of public travel is clearly illustrated in the contrast in the decisions of Reining v. New York, L. & W. R. Co. 128 N. Y. 157, 14 L.R.A. 133, 28 N. E. 640, and Talbot v. New York & H. R. Co. 151 N. Y. 155, 45 N. E. 382. In the first case \n\n[206 U.S. 536, 554]\n\u00a0\n it was held that the abutting landowner had the right to compensation for the construction of a viaduct in the street for the practically exclusive occupation of a railroad. In the second case it was held that the abutting owner had no right of compensation for the erection of a public bridge with inclined approaches and a guard wall, to carry travel over a railroad, although the structure impaired the access to his land. We are not concerned with the question whether the distinction between an elevated structure for the exclusive use of a corporation and the same structure for the purposes of public travel is, so far as an abutting landowner is concerned, a just or harsh one, provided it is a clear distinction based upon real differences. We think that before the plaintiff had acquired his title the law of New York had plainly drawn this distinction. The highest court of the state had held that the contract of the owner of land abutting on streets entitled him to the right of unimpaired access and uninterrupted circulation of light and air as against an elevated structure erected for the exclusive use of a private corporation; had, with scrupulous care, refrained from holding that he had the same right as against an elevated structure of the same kind erected for the purpose of public travel; and had pointed out plainly the essential distinction between the two cases. This distinction, as we have already seen, has been made or approved by the courts of other states wherever the occasion to consider it arose, and it is a real and substantial distinction which arises out of the trust upon which the public owns the public highways.\n The trust upon which streets are held is that they shall be devoted to the uses of public travel. When they, or a substantial part of them, are turned over to the exclusive use of a single person or corporation, we see no reason why a state court may not hold that it is a perversion of their legitimate uses, a violation of the trust, and the imposition of a new servitude. But the same court may consistently hold that with the acquisition of the fee, and in accordance with the trust, \n\n[206 U.S. 536, 555]\n\u00a0\n the city obtained the right to use the surface, the soil below, and the space above the surface, in any manner which is plainly designed to promote the ease, facility, and safety of all those who may desire to travel upon the streets; and that the rights attached to the adjoining land, or held by contract by its owner, are subordinate to such uses, whether they were foreseen or not when the street was laid out. In earlier and simpler times the surface of the streets was enough to accommodate all travel. But under the more complex conditions of modern urban life, with its high and populous buildings, and its rapid interurban transportation, the requirements of public travel are largely increased. Sometimes the increased demands may be met by subways and sometimes by viaducts. The construction of either solely for public travel may well be held by a state court to be a reasonable adaptation of the streets to the uses for which they were primarily designed. What we might hold on these questions where we had full jurisdicio n of the subject, it is not necessary here even to consider.\n In basing its judgment on the broad, plain, and approved distinction between the abandonment of the street to private uses and its further devotion to public uses, the court below overruled none of its decisions, but, on the contrary, acted upon the principles which they clearly declared. The plaintiff, therefore, has not shown that in his case the state court has changed, to his injury, the interpretation of his contract with the city, which it had previously made, and upon which he had the right to rely. The case at bar is not within the authority of the Muhlker Case. When Muhlker acquired his title the elevated railroad cases had declared the law of New York, and it was here held that he had the right to rely upon his contract as in them it had been interpreted. The structure complained of was in the Muhlker Case, as in the elevated railroad case, one devoted to the exclusive use of a private corporation. This court, in order to obtain jurisdiction and to declare that a Federal right was violated, was obliged to hold, and did hold, that the two cases were identical, and that \n\n[206 U.S. 536, 556]\n\u00a0\n in deciding the Muhlker Case the court of appeals had in effect overruled the elevated railroad cases, and this view was supported by the court of appeals itself in Lewis v. New York & H. R. Co. 162 N. Y. 202, 56 N. E. 540, where a plaintiff in like situation with Muhlker had obtained damages for exactly the same structure. The theory upon which the Muhlker Case stands and upon which it was put in the opinion of the court, is that, in deciding against Muhlker, the state court had overruled its own decisions, and changed the interpretation of the contract upon which he had the right to rely. But the fundamental fact upon which the decision in the Muhlker Case rested, present there, is absent in the case at bar. Here there was no overruling of decisions and no change in the interpretation of the contract. There was, therefore, no impairment of the obligation of a contract, and the decision was merely on a question of local law with the soundness of which we have no concern.\n The judgment is affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna, dissenting:\n I am unable to agree with the opinion and judgment of the court. I think this case cannot be distinguished in principle from Muhlker v. New York & H. R. Co. \n197 U.S. 544\n, 49 L. ed. 872, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 522; Birrell v. New York & H. R. Co. \n198 U.S. 390\n, 49 L. ed. 1096, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 667. On the authority of those cases the judgment in this case should be reversed. Those cases were determined by Story v. New York Elev. R. Co. 90 N. Y. 122, 43 Am. Rep. 146, and Lahr v. Metropolitan Elev. R. Co. 104 N. Y. 268, 10 N. E. 528, known as the elevated railroad cases. The structures there described are what are known as elevated railroads, and may be presumed to be familiar, and a structure of substantially similar character was the subject of the controversy in Muhlker v. New York & H. R. Co. and Birrell v. New York & H. R. Co. Its characteristic was elevation above the surface of the street, and this was the point of the decisions. Let me quote from the Story Case: 'But what,' said the court, \n\n[206 U.S. 536, 557]\n\u00a0\n 'is the extent of this casement? What rights or privileges are secured thereby? Generally, it may be said, it is to have the street kept open, so that from it access may be had to the lot, and light and air furnished across the open way. The street occupies the surface, and to its uses the rights of the adjacent lots are subordinate, but above the surface there can be no lawful obstruction to the access of light and air, to the detriment of the abutting owner.' And again, it was said that the agreement-grant from the city-was, 'that if the grantee would buy the lot abutting on the street he might have the use of light and air over the open space [italics mine] designated as a street.' And yet again (and the passage was quoted in the Muhlker Case, page 566, L. ed. p. 876, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 526): 'Bfo re any interest passed to the city the owner of the land had from it the benefit of air and light. The public purpose of a street requires of the soil the surface only.' The Lahr Case repeated the principle. And it was said in the Muhlker Case, in effect, that the disregard of the distinction between the surface of a street and the space above the surface would leave 'remaining no vital element of the elevated railroad cases.'\n It may be said there was a qualification made in those cases and recognized in the Muhlker Case, that it was not alone the elevation of a structure above the surface, but the elevation of one 'useless for general street purposes.' I may accept the limitation. The structure in the case at bar comes within the characterization. It is useless for general street purposes. It obstructs the frontage of abutting lots and affords no access to or from them in any proper sense. There is a descent by stairs from it to the street below, but for pedestrians only-necessarily not for vehicles. But there is a like descent by stairs from elevated railroads to streets below, but this did not save the roads from liability for abutting property.\n It must be borne in mind that this case is not disposed of by making a contrast between the passage of a railroad and the traffic on a street. The contrast is catching and only seems important. In New York a railroad is a street use and can be \n\n[206 U.S. 536, 558]\n\u00a0\n imposed on the surface of a street without liability for consequential damages, and this even if it be a steam railroad. Fobes v. Rome, W. & O. R. Co. 121 N. Y. 505, 8 L.R.A. 453, 24 N. E. 919. The distinction, therefore, was necessary to be made between the surface and the open space over the surface. And we have seen that this distinction was noted in the cases and determined their judgment. In other words, the use of a street by a railroad was decided to be a proper street use, and, therefore, whether put upon the surface or above the surface, retained that character. In either place it was a proper street use and damages could only have been consequent to the elevation of the road above the surface, to which, to quote again the Story Case, the 'public purpose of a street' attached only.\n The elevated railroad cases get significance from the arguments of counsel. Such arguments, of course, are not necessarily a test of the decision. But they may be. The opinion may respond accurately to them. We find from the report of the Story Case that the argument of Mr. Evarts for the plaintiff was that 'a permanent structure above the street surface, and an encroachment thereby and by its use upon the appurtenant easement of the open frontage held by the abutting proprietors, was not covered by the original condemnation for the public easement, which was limited to a maintenance of such open streets and perpetual frontage. People v. Kerr, 27 N. Y. 188; Craig v. Rochester City & B. R. Co. 39 N. Y. 404.'\n Mr. Choate, also for the property owners, submitted the following: 'The abutting owners on the streets have an interest in the nature of property for all time in the streets above their surface, and in having them kept open and unobstructed forever, of which they cannot be deprived without being compensated.' The contentions express the invocation of the property owner of the court, and the court responded to and sustained it. Is not that response rejected in the case at bar? The structure in the case towers as high as a house of five stories and is planted on columns, the size and strength and number of which can easily be imagined. Does it need any \n\n[206 U.S. 536, 559]\n\u00a0\n comment to describe its effect? The plaintiffs have really no access to it from their land or from any building that may be put upon their land, because they may not bridge the intervening gap. They have no other access to it but that which I have described. The public has no access from it to plaintiffs' property but that which I have described.\n The buildings that stood upon the land when the structure wasbu ilt were practically under its shadow. \n1\n Any buildings that may be erected will be equally so. 'To get above it,' plaintiffs' counsel asserts, 'the abutter must build up five stories,' and it is only from such elevation that he may contemplate the traffic that passes his premises. And even then, counsel also asserts, light can only reach the abutter 'through a slit 10 feet wide between his eaves and the edge of the structure.' And to this measure his right to an unobstructed frontage, his right to unobstructed light and air, has been reduced. Is it possible that the law can see no legal detriment in this, no impairment of the abutter's grant from the city, no right to compensation?\n\n\n[206 U.S. 536, 560]\n\u00a0\n I do not assent to them. My purpose is only to express the view that the legal opinion which I hold has justification in the serious practical consequences that the plaintiffs in error have sustained by the violation of a right which this court said, in the Muhlker Case, citing Barnett v. Johnson, 15 N. J. Eq. 481, was founded in the 'common practice and sense of the world.'\n From my standpoint, what the courts of states other than New York have decided is of no consequence to the pending controversy, and I take no time therefore to dispute the pertinence of their citation to justify the structure of which plaintiffs complain.\n I am authorized to say that Mr. Justice Day concurs in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n When the original plaintiff, George Sauer, became the owner of the property, there were standing upon it certain frame buildings which had been used as a pleasure resort. In 1890 he enlarged and improved the buildings at great expense and occupied them at the time of the erection of the structure in controversy. These buildings were destroyed in 1897 by fire, and the land is now vacant. And it may be noted that Sauer having died pending this writ of error, his administratrix and heirs have been substituted as parties plaintiff.\n I am not insensible of the strength of the reasoning by which this court sustains that conclusion, but certainly all lawyers would not assent to it. Indeed, one must be a lawyer to assent to it. At times there seems to be a legal result which takes no account of the obviously practical result. At times there seems to come an antithesis between legal sense and common sense.\n I say this in no reproach of the law and its judgments. I say it in no reproach to the opinion of the court. I recognize it proceeds upon distinctions which are intelligible, although \n\n\n\n\n","132":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSCHLEMMER v. BUFFALO, R & P R CO(1907)\nNo. 41\nArgued: Decided: March 4, 1907\n\n\n\n\n[205 U.S. 1, 2]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Luther M. Walter (by special leave), Frederic D. McKenney, Edward A. Moseley, and A. J. Truitt for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[205 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Marlin E. Olmsted, C. H. McCauley, and A. C. Stamm for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[205 U.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an action for the death of the plaintiff's intestate, Adam M. Schlemmer, while trying to couple a shovel car to a caboose. A nonsuit was directed at the trial and the direction was sustained by the supreme court of the state. The shovel car was part of a train on its way through Pennsylvania from a point in New York, and was not equipped with an automatic coupler in accordance with the act of March 2, 1893, chap. 196,  2, 27 Stat. at L. 531, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3174. Instead of such a coupler it had an iron drawbar fastened underneath the car by a pin and projecting about a foot beyond the car. This drawbar weighed about 80 pounds and its free and played up and down. On this end was an eye, and the coupling had to be done by lifting the free end possibly a foot, so that it should enter a slot in an automatic coupler on the caboose and allow a pin to drop through the eye. Owing to the absence of buffers on the shovel car and to its being so high that it would pass over those on the caboose, the car and caboose would crush anyone between them if they came together and the coupling failed to be made. Schlemmer was ordered to make the coupling as the train was slowly approaching the caboose. To do so he had to get between the cars, keeping below the level of the bottom of the \n\n[205 U.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n shovel car. It was dusk, and in endeavoring to obey the order and to guide the drawbar he rose a very little too high, and, as he failed to hit the slot, the top of his head was crushed.\n The plaintiff, in her declaration, alleged that the defendant was transporting the shovel car from state to state, and that the coupler was not such as was required by existing laws. At the trial special attention was called to the United States statute as part of the plaintiff's case. The court having directed a nonsuit with leave to the plaintiff to move to take it off, a motion was made on the ground, among others, 'that under the United States statute, specially pleaded in this case, the decedent was not deemed to have assumed the risk, owing to the fact that the car was not equipped with an automatic coupler.' The question thus raised was dealt with by the court in overruling the motion. Exceptions were allowed and an appeal taken. Among the errors assigned was one 'in holding that the shovel car was not a car used in interstate commerce or any other kind of traffic,'-the words of the court below. The supreme court affirmed the judgment in words that we shall quote. We are of opinion that the plaintiff's rights were saved and that we have jurisdiction of the case, subject to certain matters that we shall discuss.\n On the merits there are two lesser questions to be disposed of before we come to the main one. A doubt is suggested whether the shovel car was in course of transportation between points in different states, and also an argument is made that it was not a car within the contemplation of  2. On the former matter there seems to have been no dispute below. The trial court states the fact as shown by the evidence, and testimony that the car was coming from Limestone, New York, is set forth, which although based on the report of others, was evidence, at least, unless objected to as hearsay. Damon v. Carrol, 163 Mass. 404, 408, 409, 40 N. E. 185. It was the testimony of the defendant's special agent employed to investigate the matter.\n The latter question is pretty nearly answered by Johnson v. \n\n[205 U.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n Southern P. Co. \n196 \nU.S. 1, 16\n, 49 S. L. ed. 363, 368, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 158, 161. As there observed: 'Tested by context, subject-matter, and object, 'any car' meant all kinds of cars running on the rails, including locomotives. . . . The object was to protect the lives and limbs of railroad employees by rendering it unnecessary for a man operating the couplers to go between the ends of the cars.' These considerations apply to shovel cars as well as to locomotives, and show that the words 'used in moving interstate traffic' should not be taken in a narrow sense. The later act of March 2, 1903, chap. 976, 32 Stat. at L. 943, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1905, p. 603, enacting that the provision shall be held to apply to all cars and similar vehicles, may be used as an argument on either side; but, in our opinion, indicates the intent of the original act. \n196 U.S. 21\n, 49 L. ed. 371, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 158. There was an error on this point in the decision below.\n A faint suggestion was made that the proviso in  6 of the act, that nothing in it shall apply to trains composed of four-wheel cars, was not negatived by the plaintiff. The fair inference from the evidence is that this was an unusually large car of the ordinary pattern. But, further, if the defendant wished to rely upon this proviso, the burden was upon it to bring itself within the exception. The word 'provided' is used in our legislation for many other purposes beside that of expressing a condition. The only condition expressed by this clause is that four-wheeled cars shall be excepted from the requirements of the act. In substance stance it merely creates an exception, which has been said to be the general purpose of such clauses. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Baird, \n194 \nU.S. 25, 36\n, 37 S., 48 L. ed. 860, 865, 866, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 563. 'The general rule of law is, that a proviso carves special exceptions only out of the body of the act; and those who set up any such exception must establish it,' etc. Ryan v. Carter, \n93 \nU.S. 78, 83\n, 23 S. L. ed. 807, 809; United States v. Dickson, 15 Pet. 141, 165, 10 L. ed. 689, 698. The rule applied to construction is applied equally to the burden of proof in a case like this. United States v. Cook, 17 Wall. 168, 21 L. ed. 538; Com. v. Hart, 11 Cush. 130, 134.\n We come now to the main question. The opinion of the supreme court was as follows: 'Whether the act of Congress \n\n[205 U.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n has any applicability at all in actions for negligence in the courts of Pennsylvania is a question that does not arise in this case, and we therefore express no opinion upon it. The learned judge below sustained the nonsuit on the ground of the deceased's contributory negligence, and the judgment is affirmed on his opinion on that subject.' [207 Pa. 202, 56 Atl. 419.] It is said that the existence of contributory negligence is not a Federal question, and that, as the decision went off on that ground, there is nothing open to revision here.\n We certainly do not mean to qualify or limit the rule that, for this court to entertain jurisdiction of a writ of error to a state court, it must appear affirmatively that the state court could not have reached its judgment without tacitly, if not expressly, deciding the Federal matter. Bachtel v. Wilson (Jan. 7, 1907) \n204 U.S. 36\n, 51 L. ed. 357, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 243. But, on the other hand, if the question is duly raised and the judgment necessarily, or, by what appears, in fact involves such a decision, then this court will take jurisdiction, although the opinion below says nothing about it. Kaukauna Water Power Co. v. Green Bay & M. Canal Co. \n142 U.S. 254\n, 35 L. ed. 1004, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 173. And if it is evident that a ruling purporting to deal only with local law has for its premise or necessary concomitant a cognizable mistake, that may be sufficient to warrant a review. Terre Haute & I. R. Co. v. Indiana, \n194 U.S. 579\n, 48 L. ed. 1124, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 767. The application of this rather vague principle will appear as we proceed.\n It is enacted by  8 of the act that any employee injured by any car in use contrary to the provisions of the act shall not be deemed to have assumed the risk thereby occasioned, although continuing in the employment of the carrier after the unlawful use had been brought to his knowledge. An early, if not the earliest, application of the phrase 'assumption of risk' was the establishment of the exception to the liability of a master for the negligence of his servant when the person injured was a fellow servant of the negligent man. Whether an actual assumption by contract was supposed on grounds of economic theory, or the assumption was imputed because of a \n\n[205 U.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n conception of justice and convenience, does not matter for the present purpose. Both reasons are suggested in the well-known case of Farwell v. Boston & W. R. Corp. 4 Met. 49, 57, 58, 38 Am. Dec. 339. But, at the present time, the motion is not confined to risks of such negligence. It is extended, as in this statute it plainly is extended, to dangerous conditions, as of machinery, premises, and the like, which the injured party understood and appreciated when he submitted his person to them. In this class of cases the risk is said to be assumed because a person who freely and voluntarily encounters it has only himself to thank if harm comes, on a general principle of our law. Probably the modification of this general principle by some judicial decisions and by statutes like  8 is due to an opinion that men who work with their hands have not always the freedom and equality of position assumed by the doctrine of laissez faire to exist.\n Assumption of risk in this broad sense obviously shades into negligence as commonly understood. Negligence consists in conduct which common experience or the special knowledge of the actor shows to be so likely to produce the result complained of, under the circumstances known to the actor, that he is held answerable for that result, although it was not certain, intended, or foreseen. He is held to assume the risk upon the same ground. Choctaw, O. & G. R. Co. v. McDade, \n191 \nU.S. 64, 68\n, 48 S. L. ed. 96, 100, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 24. Apart from the notion of contract, rather shadowy as applied to this broad form of the latter conception, the practical difference of the two ideas is in the degree of their proximity to the particular harm. The preliminary conduct of getting into the dangerous employment or relation is said to be accompanied by assumption of the risk. The act more immediately leading to a specific accident is called negligent. But the difference between the two is one of degree rather than of kind; and when a statute exonerates a servant from the former, if at the same time it leaves the defense of contributory negligence still open to the master (a matter upon which we express no opinion), then, unless great care be taken, the \n\n[205 U.S. 1, 13]\n\u00a0\n servant's rights will be sacrified by simply charging him with assumption of the risk under another name. Especially is this true in Pennsylvania, where some cases, at least, seem to have treated assumption of risk and negligence as convertible terms. Patterson v. Pittsburg & C. R. Co. 76 Pa. 389, 18 Am. Rep. 412. We cannot help thinking that this has happened in the present case, as well as that the ruling upon Schlemmer's negligence was so involved with and dependent upon erroneous views of the statute that if the judgment stood the statute would suffer a wound.\n To recur for a moment to the facts: The only ground, if any, on which Schlemmer could be charged with negligence, is that when he was between the tracks he was twice warned by the yard conductor to keep his head down. It is true that he had a stick, which the rules of the company required to be used in coupling, but it could not have been used in this case, or at least the contrary could not be and was not assumed for the purpose of directing a nonsuit. It was necessary for him to get between the rails and under the shovel car as he did, and his orders contemplated that he should do so. But the opinion of the trial judge, to which, as has been seen, the supreme court refers, did not put the decision on the fact of warning alone. On the contrary, it began with a statement that an employee takes the risk even of unusual dangers if he has notice of them and voluntarily exposes himself to them. Then it went on to say that the deceased attempted to make the coupling with a full knowledge of the danger, and to imply that the defendant was guilty of no negligence in using the arrangement which it used. It then decided in terms that the shovel car was not a car within the meaning of  2. Only after these preliminaries did it say that, were the law otherwise, the deceased was guilty of contributory negligence; leaving it somewhat uncertain what the negligence was.\n It seems to us not extravagant to say that the final ruling was so implicated with the earlier errors that on that ground alone the judgment should not be allowed to stand. We are \n\n[205 U.S. 1, 14]\n\u00a0\n clearly of opinion that Schlemmer's rights were in no way impaired by his getting between the rails and attempting to couple the cars. So far he was saved by the provision that he did not assume the risk. The negligence, if any, came later. We doubt if this was the opinion of the court below. But suppose the nonsuit has been put clearly and in terms on Schlemmer's raising his head too high after he had been warned. Still we could not avoid dealing with the case, because it still would be our duty to see that his privilege against being held to have assumed the risk of the situation should not be impaired by holding the same thing under another name. If a man not intent on suicide, but desiring to live, is said to be chargeable with negligence as matter of law when he miscalculates the height of the car behind him by an inch, while his duty requires him, is his crouching position, to direct a heavy drawbar moving about him into a small slot in front, and this in the dusk, at nearly nine of an August evening, it is utterly impossible for us to interpret this ruling as not, however unconsciously, introducing the notion that to some extent the man had taken the risk of the danger by being in the place at all. But whatever may have been the meaning of the local courts, we are of opinion that the possibility of such a minute miscalculation, under such circumstances, whatever it may be called, was so inevitably and clearly attached to the risk which Schlemmer did not assume, that to enforce the statute requires that the judgment should be reversed.\n Judgment reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer, dissenting:\n I dissent from the opinion and judgment in this case and for these reasons:\n This was an action in the common pleas court of Jefferson county, Pennsylvania, to recover damages on account of the death of the husband of plaintiff. On the trial the court ordered \n\n[205 U.S. 1, 15]\n\u00a0\n a nonsuit on the ground of contributory negligence on the part of the decedent, with leave to the plaintiff to move to take the same off. This motion was made and overruled; judgment for the defendant was entered, which was affirmed by the supreme court of the state. The decedent was killed while attempting to couple a steam shovel to a caboose. The steam shovel was being moved in interstate transportation, and was not equipped with the safety coupler required by act of Congress of March 2, 1893. 27 Stat. at L. 531, chap. 196, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3176. The 8th section of that act provides:\n'That any employee of any such common carrier who may be injured by any locomotive, car, or train in use contrary to the provision of this act shall not be deemed thereby to have assumed the risk thereby occasioned, although continuing in the employment of such carrier after the unlawful use of such locomotive, car, or train had been brought to his knowledge.'\n\n Thus, while removing from the employee the burden of any assumption of risk, does not relieve him from liability for contributory negligence. For the rule is well settled that while, in cases of this nature, a violation of the statutory obligation of the employer is negligence per se, and actionable if injuries are sustained by servants in consequence thereof, there is no setting aside of the ordinary rules relating to contributory negligence, which is available as a defense, notwithstanding the statute, unless that statute is so worded as to leave no doubt that this defense is also to be excluded.

Co. 4 Penn. (Del.) 80, 53 Atl. 90. The Interstate Commerce Commission held this to be the rule in reference to this particular statute. 14 Ann. Rep. 1900, p. 84. Indeed, it is not contended by the majority that the defense of contributory negligence has been taken away.\n That there is a vital difference between assumption of risk and contributory negligence is clear. As said by this court in Choctaw, O. & G. R. Co. v. McDade, \n191 \nU.S. 64, 68\n, 48 S. L. ed. 96, 100, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 24, 25: 'The question of assumption of risk is quite apart from that of contributory negligence.' See also Union P. R. Co. v. O'Brien, \n161 \nU.S. 451, 456\n, 40 S. L. ed. 766, 770, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 618. This proposition, however, is so familiar and elementary that citation of authorities is superfluous.\n In the motion for a nonsuit the second proposition was that 'the evidence upon behalf of plaintiff proves conclusively that the accident happened because the deceased failed to keep his head at least as low as to have assumed the risks of his employment, omission was the fault of the deceased exclusively, and that deceased was guilty of contributory negligence and there can be no recovery in this case.'\n In ordering the nonsuit the trial court said:\n'True, under said act he was not considered to have assumed the risks of the employment, but by this is certainly meant no more than such risks as he was exposed to thereby, and resulted in injury free from his own negligent act. It would hardly be argued that defendant would be liable, under such circumstances, were the employee to voluntarily inflict an injury upon himself by means of the use of the improperly equipped car. And yet it is but a step from contributory negligence to such an act.\n\n ... * *\n'It seems very clear to us that, whatever view we may take of this case, we are led to the legal conclusion that decedent was guilty of negligence that contributed to his death, and that the plaintiff, however deserving she may be, or however much we regret the unfortunate accident, cannot recover.' \n\n[205 U.S. 1, 17]\n\u00a0\n The supreme court affirmed the judgment in the following per curiam opinion:\n\n'Whether the act of Congress . . . in regard to the use of automatic couplings on cars employed in interstate commerce has any applicability at all in actions for negligence in the courts of Pennsylvania is a question that does not arise in this case, and we therefore express no opinion upon it. The learned judge below sustained the nonsuit on the ground of the deceased's contributory negligence, and the judgment is affirmed on his opinion on that subject.' [207 Pa. 202, 56 Atl. 419.]\n\n That contributory negligence is a non-Federal question is not doubted, and that when a state court decides a case upon grounds which are non- Federal and sufficient to sustain the decision this court has no jurisdiction is conceded.\n While sometimes negligence is a mixed question of law and fact, yet, in the present case, whether the decedent, in attempting to make the coupling after the warning given by the conductor, lifted his head unnecessarily and negligently, is solely a question of fact, and, in cases coming on error from the judgment of a state court, the findings of that court on questions of fact have always been held conclusive on us. See Chrisman v. Miller, \n197 \nU.S. 313, 319\n, 49 S. L. ed. 770, 772, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 468, and the many cases cited in the opinion.\n It would seem from this brief statement that the case ought to be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Escape from this conclusion can only be accomplished in one of these ways: By investigation of the testimony and holding that there was no proof of contributory negligence. If the case came from one of the lower Federal courts we might properly consider whether there was sufficient evidence of contributory negligence; but, as shown above, a very different rule obtains in respect to cases coming from a state court. We said this very term, in Bachtel v. Wilson, \n204 U.S. 36\n, 40, ante, 243, 245, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 243, 245, in reference to a case coming from a state court to this: 'Before we can pronounce its judgment in conflict with the Federal Constitution it must be made to appear that its decision was one necessarily in conflict \n\n[205 U.S. 1, 18]\n\u00a0\n therewith, and not that possibly or even probably it was.' Before, then, we can disturb this judgment of the supreme court of Pennsylvania, it must ( paraphrasing the language just quoted a little) be made to appear that its decision of the question of contributory negligence was one necessarily in disregard of the testimony and not that possibly or even probably it was.\n It cannot be said that there was no evidence of negligence on the part of the decedent. The plaintiff's testimony (and the defendant offered none) showed that deceased was an experienced brakeman; that the link and pin coupling was in constant use on other than passenger coaches; that before the deceased went under the car the pin had already been set; that, as he was going under the car, he was twice notified to be careful and keep his head down, and yet, without any necessity therefor being shown, he lifted his head and it was crushed between the two cars; that all he had to do was to guide the free end of the drawbar into the slot, and while the drawbar weighed 75 to 80 pounds, it was fastened at one end, and the lifting and guiding was only of the other and loose end; that the drawheads were of the standard height and the body of the shovel car higher than that of the caboose. Immediately thereafter the coupling was made by another brakeman without difficulty. If an iron is dangerously hot, and one konws that it is hot and is warned not to touch it, and does touch it without any necessity therefor being shown, and is thereby burned, it is trifling to say that there is no evidence of negligence.\n A second alternative is that this court finds that the supreme court of Pennsylvania recognizes no difference between assumption of risk and contributory negligence. But that is not to be imputed in view of the rulings in the lower court, affirmed by the supreme court, to say nothing of the recognized standing and ability of that court.\n Or we may hold that the Pennsylvania courts intentionally, wrongfully, and without any evidence thereof, found that there \n\n[205 U.S. 1, 19]\n\u00a0\n was contributory negligence in order to avoid the binding force of the Federal law. During the course of the argument, in response to an interrogation, counsel for plaintiff in error bluntly charged that upon those courts. Of course this court always speaks in respectful terms of the decisions it reviews, but the implication of the most courteous language may be as certain as a direct charge.\n It is intimated that the Pennsylvania courts confuse assumption of risk and contributory negligence,-in other words, are unmindful of the difference between them,-and Patterson v. Pittsburg & C. R. Co. 76 Pa. 389, 18 Am. Rep. 412, is cited as authority. That case was decided more than thirty years ago, and might, therefore, fairly be considered not an expression of the present views of those courts. But, on examination of the case, in which a judgment in favor of the railroad was reversed by the supreme court, we find this language, which is supposed to indicate the confusion (pp. 393, 394, Am. Rep. p. 415):\n'In this discussion, however, we are not to forget that the servant is required to exercise ordinary prudence. If the instrumentality by which he is required to perform his service is so obviously and immediately dangerous that a man of common prudence would refuse to use it, the master cannot be held liable for the resulting damage. In such case the law adjudges the servant guilty of concurrent negligence, and will refuse him that aid to which he otherwise would be entitled. But where the servant, in obedience to the requirement of the master, incurs the risk of machinery which, though dangerous, is not so much so as to threaten immediate injury, or where it is reasonably probable that it may be safely used by extraordinary caution or skill, the rule is different. In such case the master is liable for a resulting accident.'\n\n Curiously enough, in Narramore v. Cleveland, C. C. & St. L. R. Co. 48 L.R.A. 68, 77, 37 C. C. A. 499, 505, 96 Fed. 298, 304, a recent decision of the court of appeals of the sixth circuit, in the opinion announced by Circuit Judge Taft is language not altogether dissimilar:\n'Assumption of risk and contributory negligence approximate \n\n[205 U.S. 1, 20]\n\u00a0\n where the danger is so obvious and imminent that no ordinarily prudent man would assume the risk of injury therefrom. But where the danger, though present and appreciated, is one which many men are in the habit of assuming, and which prudent men who must earn a living are willing to assume for extra compensation, one who assumes the risk cannot be said to be guilty of contributory negligence if, having in view the risk of danger assumed, he uses care reasonably commensurate with the risk to avoid injurious consequences. One who does not use such care, and who, by reason thereof, suffers injury, is guilty of contributory negligence, and cannot recover, because he, and not the master, causes the injury, or because they jointly cause it.'\n\n For these reasons I dissent from the opinion and judgment, and am authorized to to say that Mr. Justice Peckham, Mr. Justice McKenna, and Mr. Justice Day concur in this dissent. \n\n\n\n","133":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSEABOARD AIR LINE RY. v. SEEGERS(1907)\nNo. 15\nArgued: October 16, 1907Decided: November 4, 1907\n\n\n\n Messrs. W. F. Stevenson, Edward McIver, and Stevenson & Matheson for plaintiff in error.\n No counsel appeared for defendant in error.[ Seaboard Air Line Ry v. Seegers \n207 U.S. 73\n (1907) ]\n\n\n[207 U.S. 73, 75]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n The question in this case is the constitutionality of  2 of an act of the state of South Carolina, approved February 23, 1903 (24 Stat. at L. 81), which reads:\n'Sec. 2. That every claim for loss of or damage to property while in the possession of such common carrier shall be adjusted and paid within forty days, in case of shipments wholly within this state, and within ninety days, in case of shipments from without this state, after the filing of such claim with the agent of such carrier at the point of destination of such shipment: Provided, That no such claim shall be filed until after the arrival of the shipment or of some part thereof at the point of destination, or until after the lapse of a reasonable time for the arrival thereof. In every case such common carrier shall be liable for the amount of such loss or damage, together with interest thereon from the date of the filing of the claim therefor \n\n[207 U.S. 73, 76]\n\u00a0\n until the payment thereof. Failure to adjust and pay such claim within the periods respectively herein prescribed shall subject each common carrier so failing to a penalty of $50 for each and every such failure, to be recovered by any consignee or consignees aggrieved, in any court of competent jurisdiction: Provided, That unless such consignee or consignees recover in such action the full amount claimed, no penalty shall be recovered, but only the actual amount of the loss or damage, with interest as aforesaid: Provided, further, That no common carrier shall be liable under this act for property which never came into its possession, if it complies with the provisions of  1710, vol. 1, of the Code of Laws of South Carolina, 1902.'\n\n The difference between the value of the goods shipped and the freight charges, $1.75, and the amount of the penalty, $50, naturally excites attention. The supreme court of the state held the section constitutional,- a decision conclusive so far as the state Constitution is concerned,-and therefore we are limited to a consideration of its alleged conflict with the Constitution of the United States. The shipment was wholly intrastate, being from Columbia, South Carolina, to McBee, South Carolina, and undoubtedly subject to the control of the state. It is, of course, unnecessary to consider the validity of the statute when applied to a shipment from without the state.\n It is contended that the equal protection of the laws, guaranteed by the 1st section of the 14th Amendment, is denied. The power of classification is conceded, but this will not uphold one that is purely arbitrary. There must be some substantial foundation and basis therefor. It is asserted that this is merely legislation to compel carriers to pay their debts within a given time, by an unreasonable penalty for any delay, while no one else is so punished, and that there is no excuse for such distinction. We have had before us several cases involving classification statutes, and while the principles upon which classifications may rightfully be made are clear and easily stated, yet the application of those principles to the different \n\n[207 U.S. 73, 77]\n\u00a0\n cases is often attended with much difficulty. See, among others, on the general principles of classification, Barbier v. Connolly, \n113 U.S. 27\n, 28 L. ed. 923, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 357; Bell's Gap R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n134 U.S. 232\n, 33 L. ed. 892, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 533, and of cases making application of those principles: Gulf, C. & S. F. R. Co. v. Ellis, \n165 U.S. 150\n, 41 L. ed. 666, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 255; Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. v. Matthews, \n174 U.S. 96\n, 43 L. ed. 909, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 609, and cases cited in the opinion; Erb v. Morasch, \n177 U.S. 584\n, 44 L. ed. 897, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 819; Fidelity Mut. Life Asso. v. Mettler, \n185 U.S. 308\n, 46 L. ed. 922, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 662; Farmers' & M. Ins. Co. v. Dobney, \n189 U.S. 301\n, 47 L. ed. 821, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 565; Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. v. May, \n194 U.S. 267\n, 48 L. ed. 971, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 638.\n We are of the opinion that this case comes within the limits of constitutionality. It is not an act imposing a penalty for the nonpayment of debts. As the supreme court of South Carolina said in Best v. Seaboard Air Line R. Co. 72 S. C. 479, 484, 52 S. E. 223, 225:\n'The object of the statute was not to penalize the carrier for merely refusing to pay a claim within the time required, whether just or unjust, but the design was to bring about a reasonably prompt settlement of all proper claims, the penalty, in case of a recovery in a court, operating as a deterrent of the carrier in refusing to settle just claims, and as compensation of the claimant for the trouble and expense of the suit which the carrier's unreasonable delay and refusal made necessary.'\n\n This ruling of the supreme court finds support, if any be needed, in the preamble of the statute, which reads: 'An Act to Regulate the Manner in Which Common Carriers Doing Business in This State Shall Adjust Freight Charges and Claims for Loss of or Damage to Freight.'\n It is not an act leveled against corporations alone, but includes all common carriers. The classification is based solely upon the nature of the business, that being of a public character. It is true that no penalty is cast upon the shipper, yet there is some guaranty against excessive claims in that, as held by the supreme court of the state in Best v. Seaboard Air Line R. Co. supra, there can be no award of a penalty unless there be a recovery of the full amount claimed. \n\n[207 U.S. 73, 78]\n\u00a0\n Further, the matter to be adjusted is one peculiarly within the knowledge of the carrier. It receives the goods and has them in its custody until the carriage is completed. It knows what it received and what it delivered. It knows what injury was done during the shipment, and how it was done. The consignee may not know what was in fact delivered at the time of the shipment, and the shipper may not know what was delivered to the consignee at the close of the transportation. The carrier can determine the amount of the loss more accurately and promptly and with less delay and expense than anyone else, and for the adjustment of loss or damage to shipments within the state forty days cannot be said to be an unreasonably short length of time. It may be stated as a general rule that an act which puts in one class all engaged in business of a special and public character, requires of them the performance of a duty which they can do better and more quickly than others, and imposes a not exorbitant penalty for a failure to perform that duty within a reasonable time, cannot be adjudged unconstitutional as a purely arbitrary classification.\n While in this case the penalty may be large as compared with the value of the shipment, yet it must be remembered that small shipments are the ones which especially need the protection of penal statutes like this. If a large amount is in controversy, the claimant can afford to litigate. But he cannot well do so when there is but the trifle of a dollar or two in dispute, and yet justice requires that his claim be adjusted and paid with reasonable promptness. Further, it must be remembered that the purpose of this legislation is not primarily to enforce the collection of debts, but to compel the performance of duties which the carrier assumes when it enters upon the discharge of its public functions. We know there are limits beyond which penalties may not go even in cases where classification is legitimate; but we are not prepared to hold that the amount of penalty imposed is so great, or the length of time within which the adjustment and payment are to be \n\n[207 U.S. 73, 79]\n\u00a0\n made is so short, that the act imposing the penalty and fixing the time is beyond the power of the state.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of South Carolina is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice Peckham dissents. \n\n\n\n","134":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSECURITY WAREHOUSING CO. v. HAND(1907)\nNo. 229\nArgued: Decided: May 27, 1907\n\n\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Peckham:\n The above-named appellants have appealed from a judgment of the circuit court of appeals of the seventh circuit, affirming a decree of the United States district court for the eastern district of Wisconsin, dismissing certain petitions of the appellants for want of equity. 74 C. C. A. 186, 143 Fed. 32.\n Certain creditors filed a petition in bankruptcy October 5, 1903, against the Racine Knitting Company, a company en- \n\n[206 U.S. 415, 416]\n\u00a0\n gaged in manufacturing hose and other knit goods, with factories at Racine and Stevens Point, Wisconsin. The company was, on the 26th of October, 1903, duly adjudged a bankrupt, and the appellees were appointed receivers and were later elected trustees. The appellees asserted the right to certain merchandise covered by receipts issued by the appellants, the security company, which company thereupon filed in the bankruptcy court an intervening petition asserting its exclusive possession and control of the merchandise in question and the issuing of its receipts therefor to the knitting company, and their negotiation by it prior to its bankruptcy, and that those receipts were given to the other appellants in good faith in due course of business as security for loans. The intervening petitionr alleged that the appellees were claiming title to the merchandise, and were obstructing the petitioner in its possession, and the prayer was for an order that the appellees be restrained from interfering with the petitioner in its custody and control of the property. The other appellants then intervened and also set up the same facts, and prayed that the appellees might be restrained from interfering with the security company in delivering the merchandise to the petitioners, and from asserting any right or title to the property as against them. Issues were joined and the matters were referred to the referee, who reported his findings of fact. From these findings it appeared that the Security Warehousing Company was a corporation of the state of New York, duly licensed to do business in the state of Wisconsin, and that it was engaged in the business of 'field warehousing,' so called; that it owned no warehouse of its own and occupied no public warehouse at any place. The warehousing company leased certain premises from the knitting company in Racine, in the state of Wisconsin, and also certain premises at a place called Stevens Point, in the same state. These two places were occupied by the knitting company with their goods to be sold, and the goods were placed on the premises really occupied by the knitting company, \n\n[206 U.S. 415, 417]\n\u00a0\n although in form leased by it to the warehousing company, and the so- called warehouse receipts were given to the knitting company by the warehousing company, acknowledging the receipt of the property at such places. There was no change of possession in fact, and scarcely any in form. These receipts were in turn pledged by the knitting company to various banks, and moneys obtained upon the security of such receipts from them. The general character of business of this form is stated in Union Trust Co. v. Wilson, \n198 U.S. 530\n, 49 L. ed. 1154, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 766, but the particular facts in this case, given in detail as findings by the referee, and adopted by the district court and circuit court of appeals, may be found in 143 Fed. supra. Reference is made to that report for the findings of the referee. The report shows a radically different state of facts from the Wilson Case.\n Mr. Henry S. Robbins for appellants.\n\n\n[206 U.S. 415, 419]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John B. Simmons for appellees.\n\n\n[206 U.S. 415, 420]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n A careful reading of the findings of the referee and of the evidence upon which they were based satisfies us that they ought to be approved. The findings show that the receipts of the warehousing company were not entitled to the status of negotiable instruments, the transfer of which operates as a delivery of the property mentioned in them. Upon that question the case is sufficiently stated in the opinion of the court below, wherein it was said that the 'receipts themselves would put the holders on notice of the facts.'\n If the receipts were not negotiable instruments, it is contended that the transactions showed a valid pledge of the property to some of the appellants, and hence they are entitled to its possession until they are paid the debts due them from the bankrupt. Whether there was a sufficient change of \n\n[206 U.S. 415, 421]\n\u00a0\n possession of the thing pledged to render the same valid under the law of Wisconsin, we think was correctly answered in the negative by the courts below. Geilfuss v. Corrigan, 95 Wis. 651, 665, 669, 37 L.R.A. 166, 60 Am. St. Rep. 143, 70 N. W. 306. The general law of pledge requires possession, and it cannot exist without it. Casey v. Cavaroc, \n96 U.S. 467\n, 24 L. ed. 779. There was scarcely a semblance of an attempt at such change of possession from the hands of the knitting company to the hands of the warehousing company. Actual possession of the property in question was exercised by and existed with the knitting company substantially the same after the issuing of the receipts as before. It is a trifling wih words to call the various transactions between the knitting company and the warehousing company a transfer of possession from the former to the latter. There was really no delivery, and no change of possession, continuous or otherwise. The alleged change was a mere pretense, a sham. Upon the subject of change of possession the opinion of the circuit court of appeals contains the following statement of fact: 'In the present case the main office of the security company was in New York; the nearest district office was in Chicago; from there the receipts were issued; and in Wisconsin the security company had no office and no warehouses, unless the inclosures within the buildings of the knitting company at Racine and Stevens Point be counted such. The receipts themselves would put the holders thereof on notice of these facts. And at Racine and Stevens Point the security company gave no evidences to the public of its presence. No signs were displayed to the passer-by. No business was sought from the public. The only property within the inclosures was the knitting company's. The knitting company did not want storage room, but collaterals, which the security company agreed to furnish for a commission upon the amount thereof plus all expenses. The security company's only agents on the scene were the agents of the knitting company, who cared for and shipped out its goods. That this was the only business contemplated is disclosed by the agreement that the knitting \n\n[206 U.S. 415, 422]\n\u00a0\n company should be restored to full possession of the premises at any time it returned the outstanding receipts. This, in our judgment, was not warehousing within the law of Wisconsin.'\n Also: 'So far from the security company's maintaining an open, exclusive, unequivocal possession during the two years this arrangement was carried on, it seems to us that the security company might as well have been eliminated, and the knitting company have employed its own stockkeepers and shipping clerks as custodians for intending lenders, directly, instead of indirectly through the security company. In that view this becomes one of the cases 'in which the exclusive power of the so- called bailee' (Union Trust Co. v. Wilson, \n198 \nU.S. 530, 537\n, 49 S. L. ed. 1154, 1156, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 766) tapers away to nothingness (Drury v. Moors, 171 Mass. 252, 50 N. E. 618; Tradesmen's Nat. Bank v. Kent Mfg. Co. 186 Pa. 556, 65 Am. St. Rep. 876, 40 Atl. 1018).\n The actual transactions in the case at bar differ radically from the facts as stated in Union Trust Co. v. Wilson, supra. The court there held that there was sufficient proof to show a change of possession, and that the transaction was valid within the law of the state of Illinois. Assuming the law of Wisconsin to be the same on the subject of possession by the pledgee of the property pledged, the facts in this case are so different from the Wilson Case as to prevent that case from forming a foundation for holding there was a sufficient change of possession here to make the pledge a valid one.\n We are satisfied with the decision of the courts below upon the merits.\n There is, however, an important matter which has been raised by the appellants aside from the merits. That is, whether a trustee in bankruptcy can question the validity of these receipts, or the sufficiency of the alleged transfer of the property belonging to the bankrupt knitting company, to constitute a pledge of such property. The right is denied by the appellants, and it is contended that the transfers were valid between the parties; that the trustee in bankruptcy takes only the title and right of the bankrupt, and therefore he cannot assert a right not possessed by the knitting company. \n\n[206 U.S. 415, 423]\n\u00a0\n It is no new doctrine that the assignee or trustee in bankruptcy stands in the shoes of the bankrupt, and that the property in his hands, unless otherwise provided in the bankrupt act, is subject to all of the equities impressed upon it in the hands of the bankrupt. This has been the rule under former acts and is ow the rule. Hewit v. Berlin Mach. Works, \n194 U.S. 296\n, 48 L. ed. 986, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 690; Thompson v. Fairbanks, \n196 \nU.S. 516, 526\n, 49 S. L. ed. 577, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 306; Humphrey v. Tatman, \n198 U.S. 91\n, 49 L. ed. 956, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 567; York Mfg. Co. v. Cassell, \n201 \nU.S. 344, 352\n, 50 S. L. ed. 782, 785, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 481.\n In the Hewit Case there was a sale of property to the bankrupt upon condition that the title should not pass until the property was paid for. Such a conditional sale was good in New York state, where the contract was made, and it was held good as against the trustee in bankruptcy, because it was good against the bankrupt. It was further held that the property was not, under the facts and the law of New York, such as might have been levied upon and sold under judicial process against the bankrupt, nor could she have transferred it, within the meaning of  70 of the bankrupt act. It was a clear case for the application plication of the doctrine that the trustee stands in the shoes of the bankrupt, and there was nothing in the act which made any inconsistent provision.\n In Thompson v. Fairbanks the question arose as to the validity of a chattel mortgage (which had been duly filed) upon after-acquired property as against the trustee in bankruptcy of the mortgagor. The mortgagee took possession of the mortgaged property before the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, and the question raised was whether there was a violation of any provision of the bankruptcy act. It was held that the validity of such a mortgage was a local, and not a Federal, question, and that in such case this court would follow the decisions of the state court; and as in Vermont such a mortgage was good, and the taking possession of the property related back to the date of the mortgage, even as against an assignee in insolvency, it was good as against the trustee in bankruptcy. It was said: 'Under the present bankrupt act, \n\n[206 U.S. 415, 424]\n\u00a0\n the trustee takes the property of the bankrupt, in cases unaffected by fraud, in the same plight and condition that the bankrupt himself held it, and subject to all the equities impressed upon it in the hands of the bankrupt, except in cases where there has been a conveyance or encumbrance of the property which is void as against the trustee by some positive provision of the act.' As there was no provision therein making such a mortgage void, the mortgagee was permitted to enforce his mortgage as a valid instrument, and to retain possession of the property. There was no fraud in fact and no transfer of any property in fraud of creditors, and the property was not, at the time of the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, or at the time of the adjudication, liable to levy and sale under judicial process against the bankrupt. It had already been taken possession of by the mortgagee under a valid mortgage, and was not subject to any other liability of the mortgagor.\n Humphrey v. Tatman reiterates the principle that whether such a mortgage as is referred to in the Fairbanks Case is good or bad depends upon the state law.\n In York Mfg. Co. v. Cassell, the same question arose as in the Hewit Case. There was a sale of property to one who thereafter became bankrupt, with a condition that no title to the property should pass until it was paid for. Such a conditional sale was good under the Ohio law, where the instrument was executed, except as to those creditors who, between the time of the execution of the instrument and the filing thereof, had obtained some specific lien upon the property. There were no such creditors, and hence there was no one who could question the validity of the instrument at the time the trustee's title would have accrued, unless it was the trustee in bankruptcy. He made the claim that the adjudication in bankruptcy was equivalent to a judgment or an attachment or other specific lien on the property, so as to prevent the vendor from asserting its title and its legal right to remove the property on account of the nonpayment of the purchase price. We held that, as he conditional sale was valid \n\n[206 U.S. 415, 425]\n\u00a0\n by the law of Ohio, except as to a certain class of creditors, if there were no such creditors there was no one who could question the validity of the instrument; that the adjudication in bankruptcy did not give the trustee the right to do so, because in that case the adjudication did not operate as the equivalent of a judgment or attachment or other specific lien on the property. The trustee represented no one who had that right as there were no creditors who had liens on the property when the title of the trustee to the property of the bankrupt accrued. Section 70 of the bankrupt act had no application. There was no property within either the fourth or fifth subdivision of that section. The fact that if there had been a creditor of the bankrupt of the class mentioned who had obtained a specific lien on the property prior to the adjudication in bankruptcy, the trustee could in that case have enforced the same, did not make any difference, because no such thing had been done when the adjudication in bankruptcy was made. This court had theretofore approved the remark in Re New York Economical Printing Co. 49 C. C. A. 133, 110 Fed. 514, 518, that the present bankrupt act contemplates that a lien good as against the bankrupt and all of his creditors at the time of the filing of the petition in bankruptcy should remain undisturbed. Hewit Case, supra. Upon these facts it was reiterated that the trustee takes the property as the bankrupt held it.\n The case at bar bears no resemblance in its facts to the cases just cited. There was no valid disposition of the property in the case before us, or any valid lien. The so-called warehouse receipts issued by the warehousing company to the knitting company, upon the facts of this case, gave no lien under the law in Wisconsin, in which state they were issued. In such case this court follows the state court. Etheridge v. Sperry, \n139 U.S. 266\n, 35 L.ed. 171, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 563; Dooley v. Pease, \n180 U.S. 126\n, 45 L. ed. 457, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 308.\n By  70a, the trustee in bankruptcy is vested, by operation of law, with the title of the bankrupt to all property transferred by him in fraud of his creditors, and to all property which, prior to the filing of the petition, might have been \n\n[206 U.S. 415, 426]\n\u00a0\n levied upon and sold by judicial process against him; and, by subdivision ( e) of the same section, the trustee in bankruptcy may avoid any transfer by the bankrupt of his property which any creditor of the bankrupt might avoid, and may recover the property so transferred, or its value. Here are special provisions placing the title to the property transferred by fraud or otherwise, as mentioned, in the trustee in bankruptcy, and giving him the power to avoid the same.\n The title to this property was in the knitting company. There had been no valid pledge of it, because the possession had been, at all times, in the knitting company, and it could have been levied upon and sold under judicial process against the knitting company at the time of the adjudication in bankruptcy. The security company had, of course, full knowledge that the knitting company in fact, at least, shared in the possession of the property. It was itself an actor, or it acquiesced in the arrangement under which it had, at most, but a partial possession, and even that was subject to the control of the knitting company.\n The method taken to store the property was, as found by the district court, a mere device or subterfuge to enable the bankrupt to hypothecate the receipts, and thuse raise money upon secret liens on property in the possession of the pledgeor and under its control; and such scheme, the court said, ought not to receive judicial sanction. Such a scheme, under the facts, and as carried out in this case, and with regard to Wisconsin law, was a fraud in fact, and neither the receipts nor the so-called pledge could be asserted against any of the creditors. to hypothecate the receipts, and thus raise in a case arising in Wisconin , relative to a chattel mortgage, which gave power to the mortgagor to make sales from the mortgaged property for his own use and benefit, that such a mortgage was fraudulent in fact, so it could not be asserted even against general creditors; citing Wisconsin cases. Re Antigo Screen Door Co. 59 C. C. A. 248, 123 Fed. 249, 254. \n\n[206 U.S. 415, 427]\n\u00a0\n A further question was ruled upon in the above-cited case. It was in respect to a second mortgage upon chattels, which had not been properly filed, but the mortgagee had taken possession of the mortgaged property prior to the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, although long subsequent to the giving of the mortgage, and it was held that the mortgagee might hold the property as against the trustee in bankruptcy representing general creditors. There was no fraud in fact alleged. It was said by Judge Jenkins, in delivering the opinion of the court: 'When the statute (Rev. Stat. Wis. 1898,  2313) declares that a chattel mortgage shall be invalid against any other person than the parties thereto, unless possession be delivered and retained, or the mortgage be filed,-there being no actual fraud and no collusive delay in the filing or the taking of possession,-we think the statute must be construed to mean that the omission to file or to take possession renders the mortgage invalid only as to the creditor who, by execution or attachment, has acquired a lien upon the property.' The case illustrates the distinction taken between fraud in fact and the mere failure to file a mortgage otherwise valid against the world.\n Under the circumstances of this case we are satisfied there was no valid pledge and no equitable lien in favor of the interveners which would take precedence of the title of the trustee by virtue of the special provisions of the bankrupt act.\n The decree is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","135":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSERRA v. MORTIGA(1907)\nNo. 202\nArgued: Decided: February 25, 1907\n\n\n\n Messrs. Aldis B. Browne, Alexander Britton, and Maurice Kelly for plaintiffs in error. \n\n[204 U.S. 470, 471]\n\u00a0\n No appearance for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n Articles 433 and 434, found in chapter 1 of title 9 of the Penal Code of the Philippine Islands, define and punish the crime of adultery. The articles referred to are in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[204 U.S. 470, 472]\n\u00a0\n It is conceded at bar that, under the Philippine law, the offense of adultery, as defined by the articles in question, is classed as a private offense, and must be prosecuted, not on information by the public prosecutor, but by complaint on behalf of an injured party. In the court of first instance of Albay, eighth judicial district, Philippine Islands, Adriano Mortiga, the defendant in error, as the husband of Maria Obleno, filed a complaint charging her with adultery committed with Vicente Serra, the other plaintiff in error, who was also charged. The complaint is in the margin. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[204 U.S. 470, 473]\n\u00a0\n The defendants were arraigned, pleaded not guilty, were tried by the court without a jury, and were convicted. The court stated its reasons in a written opinion, analyzing the testimony, and pointing out that all the essential ingredients of the crime of adultery, as defined by the articles of the Penal Code already referred to, were shown to have been committed. The accused were sentenced to pay one half of the costs and to imprisonment for two years, four months, and one day. The record does not disclose that any objection was taken to the sufficiency of the complaint before the trial. Indeed, it does not appear that, by objection in any form, directly or indirectly, was any question raised in the trial court concerning the sufficiency of the complaint. An appeal was taken to the supreme court of the Philippine Islands. In that court error was assigned on the ground, first, that 'the complaint is null and void because it lacks the essential requisite provided by law;' and, second and third, because it did not appear from the proof that guilt had been established beyond a reasonable doubt. The conviction was affirmed. The assignment of error which was based on the contention that the conviction was erroneous because the complaint did not sufficiently state the essential ingredients of the offense charged was thus disposed of by the court in its opinion: 'The objections to the complaint, based upon an insufficient statement of the facts constituting the offense, cannot be considered here, because they were not presented in the court below. United States v. Sarabia, 3 Off. Gaz. No. 29.'\n The assignments based on the insufficiency of the proof to show guilt beyond a reasonable doubt were disposed of by an analysis of the evidence, which the court deemed led to the conclusion that all the statutory elements of the crime were proven beyond a reasonable doubt. An application for a rehearing, styled an exception, was made, in which it was insisted that it was the duty of the court to consider the assignment based on the insufficiency of the complaint, since not to do so would be a denial of due process of law. The rehear- \n\n[204 U.S. 470, 474]\n\u00a0\n ing was refused, and the sentence imposed below was increased to three years, six months, and twenty-nine days, on the ground that this was the minimum punishment provided for the offense.\n The errors assigned on this writ of error, and the propositions urged at bar to support them, are confined to the assertion that the refusal of the court below to consider the assignment of error concerning the insufficiency of the complaint amounted to a conviction of the accused without informing them of the nature and character of the offense with which they were charged, and was, besides, equivalent to a conviction without due process of law. It is settled that, by virtue of the Bill of Rights enacted by Congress for the Philippine Islands (32 Stat. at L. 691, 692, chap. 1369, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1905, p. 391), that guaranties equivalent to the due process and equal protection of the law clause of the 14th Amendment, the twice in jeopardy clause of the 5th Amendment, and the substantial guaranties of the 6th Amendment, exclusive of the right to trial by jury, were extended to the Philippine Islands. It is further settled that the guaranties which Congress has extended to the Philippine Islands are to be interpreted as meaning what the like provisions meant at the time when Congress made them applicable to the Philippine Islands. Kepner v. United States, \n195 U.S. 100\n, 49 L. ed. 114, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 797.\n For the purpose, therefore, of passing on the errors assigned, we must test the correctness of the action of the court below by substantially the same criteria which we would apply to a case arising in the United States and controlled by the Bill of Rights expressed in the Amendments to the Constitution of the United States. Turning to the text of the articles of the Philippine Penal Code upon which the prosecution was based, it will be seen that an essential ingredient of the crime of adultery, as therein defined, is knowledge on the part of the man charged of the fact that the woman with whom the adultery was committed was a married woman. Turning to the complaint upon which the prosecution was begun, it will be at once seen that it was deficient, because it did not specify the place where the \n\n[204 U.S. 470, 475]\n\u00a0\n crime was committed, nor does it expressly state that Vicente Serra, the accused man, knew that Maria Obleno, the woman accused, was, at the time of the guilty cohabitation, a married woman. It results that there were deficiencies in the complaint which, if raised in any form in the trial court before judgment, would have required the trial court to hold that the complaint was inadequate. But the question for decision is not whether the complaint, which was thus deficient, could have been sustained, in view of the constitutional guaranties, if a challenge as to its sufficiency had been presented in any form to the trial court before final judgment, but whether, when no such challenge was made in the trial court before judgment, a denial of the guaranties of the statutory Bill of Rights arose from the action of the appellate court in refusing to entertain an objection to the sufficiency of the complaint because no such ground was urged in the trial court. Thus reducing the case to the real issue enables us to put out of view a number of decisions of this court referred to in the margin,3 as well as many decided cases of state courts referred to in the brief of counsel, because they are irrelevant, since all the former, and, if not all, certainly all of the latter, concern the soundness of objections made in the trial court, by the accused, to the sufficiency of indictments or informations.\n In Ex parte Parks, \n93 U.S. 18\n, 23 L. ed. 787, the case was this: The petitioner, Parks, applied to this court for a writ of habeas corpus. He had been convicted and sentenced for the crime of forgery in a district court of the United States. The ground relied upon for release was that the indictment stated no offense. The writ was discharged. Speaking through Mr. Justice Bradley, it was said:\n'But the question whether it was or was not a crime within the statute was one which the district court was competent to decide. It was before the court and within its jurisdiction.\n\n ... * * \n\n[204 U.S. 470, 476]\n\u00a0\n 'Whether an act cahrged in an indictment is or is not a crime by the law which the court administers [in this case the statute law of the United States] is a question which has to be met at almost every stage of criminal proceedings; on motions to quash the indictment, on demurrers, on motions to arrest judgment, etc. The court may err, but it has jurisdiction of the question. If it errs, there is no remedy, after final judgment, unless a writ of error lies to some superior court, and no such writ lies in this case.'\n In United States v. Ball, \n163 U.S. 662\n, 41 L. ed. 300, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1192, an attempt was made to prosecute for the second time one Millard H. Ball, who had been acquitted upon a defective indictment, which had been held bad upon the proceedings in error prosecuted by others, who had been convicted and who had been jointly prosecuted with Ball. Reversing the court below, the plea of autrefois acquit, relied on by Ball, was held good. It was pointed out that the acquittal of Ball upon the defective indictment was not void, and, therefore, the acquittal on such an indictment was a bar. This case was approvingly cited in Kepner v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 100, 129\n, 49 S. L. ed. 114, 124, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 797. It being, then, settled that the conviction on a defective indictment is not void, but presents a mere question of error, to be reviewed according to law, the proposition to be decided is this: Did the court below err in holding that it would not consider whether the trial court erred because it had not decided the complaint to be bad, when no question concerning its sufficiency was, either directly or indirectly, made in that court? Thus to understand the proposition is to refute it. For it cannot be that the court below was wrong in refusing to consider whether the trial court erred in a matter which that court was not called upon to consider and did not decide. Undoubtedly, if a judgment of acquittal had resulted, it would have barred a further prosecution, despite the defective indictment. Kepner v. United States, supra.\n But it is said the peculiar powers of the supreme court in \n\n[204 U.S. 470, 477]\n\u00a0\n the Philippine Islands take this case out of the general rule, since in that court on appeal a trial de novo is had even in a criminal case. But, as pointed out in the Kepner Case, whilst that court on appeal has power to re-examine the law and facts, it does so on the record, and does not retry in the fullest sense. Indeed, when the power of the court below to review the facts is considered, that power, instead of sustaining, refutes the proposition relied on. Thus the proposition is that the court should have reversed the conviction because of the contention as to the insufficiency of the complaint, when no such question had been raised before final judgment in the trial court, and when, as a necessary consequence of the facts found by the court, the testimony offered at the trial without objection or question in any form established every essential ingredient of the crime. In other words, the contention is that reversal should have been ordered for an error not committed, and when the existence of injury was impossible to be conceived, in view of the opinion which the court formed on the facts, in the exercise of the authority vested in it on that subject.

OF PENNYSLVANIA(1907)\nNo. 161\nArgued: October 28, 1907Decided: December 2, 1907\n\n\n\n In a civil action brought by the county of Schuylkill, Pennsylvania, in 1901, against Shoener, the present plaintiff, for the amount of certain fees alleged to have been collected by him, as the clerk of a quarter sessions court, but withheld by him from the county treasurer, a judgment was rendered in favor of the county for $18,245. That judgment was affirmed upon appeal by the supreme court of Pennsylvania on May 4th, 1903. Schuylkill county v. Shoener, 205 Pa. 592, 55 Atl. 791.\n Shoener was then proceeded against by indictment under  65 of the Penal Code of Pennsylvania of 1860, which section is in these words: 'If any state, county, township, or municipal officer of this commonwealth, charged with the collection, safekeeping, transfer, or disbursement of public money, shall convert to his own use, in any way whatsoever, or shall use by way of investment in any kind of property or merchandise, any portion of the public money intrusted to him for \n\n[207 U.S. 188, 189]\n\u00a0\n collection, safeckeeping, transfer, or disbursement, or shall prove a defaulter, or fail to pay over the same when thereunto legally required by the state, county, or township treasurer, or other proper official or person authorized to demand and receive the same, every such act shall be deemed and adjudged to be an embezzlement of so much of said money as shall be thus taken, converted, invested, used, or unaccounted for, which is hereby declared a misdemeanor; and every such officer, and every person or persons whomsoever aiding or abetting, or being in any way accessory to said act, and being thereof convicted, shall be sentenced to an imprisonment, by separate or solitary confinement at labor, not exceeding five years, and to pay a fine equal to the amount of money embezzled.' Pa. Laws 1860, p. 385.\n This section was construed by the supreme court of Pennsylvania in com. v. Mentzer, 162 Pa. 646, 29 Atl. 720, the court holding that each of the acts enumerated in the statute was a distinct and separate offense, although they might be so entirely parts of the same transaction as to constitute but one offense; that whether particular acts were so combined as to make one offense depended upon the facts in each case, and raised a question of fact for the jury.\n The indictment was returned November 14th, 1903,-the date is important,-and contained thirteen counts, those other than the fourth, eighth, and twelfth counts in substance charging the accused with converting public funds to his own use, and the fourth, eighth, and twelfth counts charging him only with failing to pay over the public moneys that came into his hands, when thereunto legally required by the county. The accused was acquitted January 6th, 1904, on all the accounts except the fourth, eighth, and twelfth, and on those accounts he was convicted. On appeal to the superior court the conviction was sustained ( 25 Pa. Super. Ct. 526), but, on appeal from the court to the supreme court of Pennsylvania, the judgments of conviction in both the lower courts were reversed June 22d, 1905, and the accused was discharged from the recognizance \n\n[207 U.S. 188, 190]\n\u00a0\n which he had executed. Com v. Shoener, 212 Pa. 527, 61 Atl. 1093\n\n\n In the opinion of the supreme court it was stated that the only demand ever made on the accused was in a letter to him from the county comptroller, under date of December 30th, 1902. But that demand, the court said, was made at a time when the question of the right of the accused to retain the moneys he had retained was, by agreement of the county, pending and undecided in the civil court. The court, after observing that it was competent for the county to have entered into such an agreement, said: 'How could any demand have been made at that time that the defendant was bound to heed? . . . The failure to pay on demand, as contemplated by the statute under which he is indicted, is a failure to pay that which, at the time the demand is made, clearly belongs to the county making the demand, and does not apply to a case where demand is made to pay during the pendency of a dispute as to who is entitled to the money, and which dispute, by agreement of both parties to it, is pending determination in the courts. . . . In refusing to pay over at the time the alleged demand was made he did just what any other man similarly situated and with due regard to his rights would have done; and it is a perversion of the 65th section of the act of March 31, 1860, to attempt to apply it to a case like this. The only evidence of a demand to pay over was the [ comptroller's] letter. This was written and received by the appellant at a time when the county, by its own agreement, could not have enforced any civil liability against him, and in refusing to comply with the notice to pay he was standing on his right not to do so until it was determined that the county was entitled to receive the money. The learned trial judge charged the jury that the institution of the suit in the common pleas of the county was a legal demand for the payment of the money, and should be regarded as such a demand in the prosecution of the appellant on the counts charging him to pay over on demand. In the civil courts constructive \n\n[207 U.S. 188, 191]\n\u00a0\n demands may be and are recognized, but not so in a criminal court, in the prosecution for an offense having as one of its statutory ingredients a refusal to pay on demand. A demand there means actual demand. The only actual demand that the commonwealth pretends was made was the comptroller's letter. It was written after the institution of the civil suit, and after the distinct agreement by the county that the question of the defendant's liability should be judicially determined. Before being so determined there was no liability to be enforced against him civilly, and, therefore, no demand could be made upon him that he was bound to recognize. He has been acquitted on the counts charging him with a conversion of the public funds to his own use, and there was no evidence to sustain the conviction on the charge that he had failed to pay over after having been legally thereunto required on demand made. The 11th assignment . . . complains of the error of the court below in instructing the jury that there had been legal demand made upon the defendant to pay over the fees. This assignment should have been sustained. If there had been proper instructions as to a legal demand, the defendant would have been acquitted on the counts on which he was convicted. The remaining assignments need not be considered. The judgment of the superior court is reversed, as is that of the court below, and the defendant is discharged from his recognizance.'\n Subsequently, on June 30th, 1905, the county made another and formal demand upon Shoener to pay over $7,243.28, that being the balance of the fees or moneys then retained by him, and ascertained, on auditing of his accounts, to belong to the county. This demand was disregarded, and, on September 4th, 1905, the present new indictment was found, charging only one of the offenses specified in the statute, namely, that the accused had failed, on demand, to pay into the county treasury the above sum of $7,243. 28.\n The defendant pleaded, among other things, that the present indictment was for the same offense as that specified in the first indictment; that his acquittal on the first nine counts of the \n\n[207 U.S. 188, 192]\n\u00a0\n former indictment was an acquittal of the charge contained in the present indictment; and that after the reversal of the judgment of conviction on the fourth, eighth, and twelfth counts he could not be again prosecuted for the same offense.\n Referring to the opinion of the supreme court in the former prosecution, the trial court, in its charge to the jury, said: 'When that opinion was filed in the supreme court of Pennsylvania, and subsequently here, and the proceedings of the previous trial were reversed, there was no crime that this defendant was called upon to answer for, because the supreme court declared that the demand that had been made upon him was illegal, had no right to be made, and he was not bound to obey it, and therefore not bound to pay over the money when they called on him in December, 1902, because the county had no right to call on him then for this money, but they were bound to wait until after the supreme court as well as this court decided the question of whether or not he had any claim or right to that money. . . . Now, gentlemen of the jury, under this state of facts, I come to the conclusion that there was no crime to try when he was tried before; that the crime that is now tried in this indictment exists only since the actual demand was made, which the language of that supreme court opinion requires to be made before he is required to pay over.'\n The defendant was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for two and a half years.\n The judgment of conviction was affirmed, the supreme court saying: 'In support of his plea of autrefois acquit, the appellant relies upon our reversal of the former judgment against him. The jury, on the trial of the first indictment, found him guilty of having failed to pay over the license fees in his hands after demand had been made upon him to do so. Our reversal of the judgment on that verdict did not acquit him of the offense charged against him in the present indictment. All that we decided was that, as the county of Schuylkill could not, at the time the prosecution was instituted, \n\n[207 U.S. 188, 193]\n\u00a0\n have made a legal demand upon the appellant for the payment of the fees in his hands, the statutory offense of failing to pay over had not been committed. He was discharged from his recognizance simply because the prosecution against him had been instituted before the offense charged against him was or could have been committed under the admitted facts in the case. He was therefore never in jeopardy. If, after his conviction, the court below had arrested judgment on the verdict, he would have been in the same situation in which our reversal of it placed him, but he could not have pleaded the arrest of the judgment as a bar to a new indictment against him for an offense subsequently committed, for he never was in peril.' [216 Pa. 80, 64 Atl. 894.]\n The plaintiff insists that his trial and conviction on the present indictment would subject him to jeopardy a second time for the offense of having failed to pay over on proper demand, thereby depriving him of his liberty without due process of law, in violation of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.\n Messrs. E. B. Sherill, William Wilhelm, and Charles A. Douglas for plaintiff in error. \n\n[207 U.S. 188, 194]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Guy E. Farquhar, C. E. Berger, and lrvin A. Reed for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of the court:\n The contention that, by the judgment of the supreme court of Pennsylvania, the plaintiff in error has been deprived of a \n\n[207 U.S. 188, 195]\n\u00a0\n right secured to him by the Constitution of the United States, must be overruled. He has not been twice placed in jeopardy for the same offense. Upon the hearing of the case arising out of the first indictment, the supreme court of Pennsylvania, construing the statute under which the defendant was prosecuted, and looking at the undisputed facts appearing of record, adjudged that he had not then committed any criminal offense; that he had not failed to pay over moneys belonging to the county upon any demand, disregard of which subjected him to criminal liability; consequently, it was held that no valid judgment of conviction could have been rendered against him in the first prosecution for failing to pay over the moneys in question, or any part thereof, on the particular demand shown in the record of that prosecution. These were questions of local and general law which it was the province of the supreme court of Pennsylvania to determine conclusively for the parties. They presented no question of a Federal nature.\n Assuming then, that no valid judtgment could have been rendered against the accused upon the first indictment for disregarding the demand upon which that indictmetn was based, it necessarily follows, as held by the supreme court of Pennsylvania, that that prosecution did not put the accused in jeopardy in respect to the particular offense specified in the last indictment. That offense was never committed until the demand of June 30th, 1905, was disregarded. The defense of double jeopardy could not be sustained unless we should hold that the charge against Shoener in the first indictment could be sustained under the statute. But we cannot so adjudge without disregarding altogether the decision of the supreme court of f Pennsylvania, and without holding that an accused is put in peril by a prosecution which could no legally result in a conviction for crime. It is an established rule that one is not put in jeopardy if the indictment under which he is tried is so radically defective that it would not support a judgment of conviction, and that a judgment thereon would be arrested on motion. So, where the defense is that the accused was put \n\n[207 U.S. 188, 196]\n\u00a0\n in jeopardy for the same offense by his trial under a former indictment, if it appears from the record of that trial that the accused had not then or previously committed, and could not possibly have committed, any such crime as the one charged, and therefore that the court was without jurisdiction to have rendered any valid judgment against him,-and such is the case now before us,-then the accused was not, by such trial, put in jeopardy for the offense specified in the last or new indictment.\n As it was thus correctly decided that the accused was not, by the present indictment, put in jeopardy for the second time by the same offense, we need not go further or consider any question of a Federal nature, and the writ of error must be dismissed.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","137":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSHROPSHIRE, WOODLIFF & CO. v.

Lancaster, John P. Tillman, J. H. Beal, and Williams & Lancaster for Bush et al.\n\n Mr. Justice Moody delivered the opinion of the court:\n The appellees are trustees of the bankrupt estate of the Southern Car & Foundry Company. The appellants, before the commencement of the proceedings in bankruptcy, acquired by purchase and assignment a large number of claims for wages of workmen and servants, none exceeding $300 in amount, and all earned within three months before the date of the commencement of the proceedings in bankruptcy. The district court for the eastern district of Tennessee rendered a judgment disallowing priority to these claims, because, when filed, they were not 'due to workmen, clerks, or servants.'\n On appeal to the circuit court of appeals for the sixth circuit that court duly certified here for instructions the following question:\n'Is an assignee of a claim for wages earned within three months before the commencement of proceedings in bankruptcy against the bankrupt debtor entitled to priority of payment, under  64 (4) of the bankrupt act [ 30 Stat. at L. 563, chap. 541, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3447], when the assignment occurred prior to the commencement of such bankruptcy proceedings?'\n\n The question certified has never been passed upon by any \n\n[204 U.S. 186, 188]\n\u00a0\n circuit court of appeals, and in the district courts the decisions upon it are conflicting. Re Westlund, 99 Fed. 399; Re St. Louis Ice Mfg. & Storage Co. 147 Fed. 752; Re North Carolina Car Co. [semble], 127 Fed. 178, where the right of the assignee to priority was denied; Re Brown, 4 Ben. 142, Fed. Cas. No. 1,974 [act of 1867, 14 Stat. at L. 517, chap. 176]; Re Harmon, 128 Fed. 170, where, on facts slightly but not essentially different, the right of the assignee to priority was affirmed.\n The bankruptcy law (act July 1, 1898, 30 Stat. at L. pp. 544, 563, chap. 541, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3447), in  1, defines 'debt' as including 'any debt, demand, or claim, provable in bankruptcy.' Section 64, under which priority is claimed in this case, is, in the parts material to the determination of the question, as follows:\n'Sec. 64. Debts which have priority.-. . . b. The debts to have priority, except as herein provided, and to be paid in full, out of bankrupt estates and the order of payment, shall be . . . (4) wages due to workmen, clerks, or servants which have been earned within three months before the date of the commencement of proceedings, not to exceed three hundred dollars to each claimant; . . .'\n\n The precise inquiry is whether the right of prior payment thus conferred is attached to the person or to the claim of the wage-earner; if to the person, it is available only to him; if to the claim, it passes with the transfer to the assignee. In support of the proposition that the right is personal to the wage-earner, and enforceable only by him, it is argued that it is not wages earned within the prescribed time which are given priority, but wages 'due to workmen, clerks, or servants;' that when the claim is assigned to another it is no longer 'due to workmen, clerks, or servants,' but to the assignee; and therefore, when presented by him, lacks one of the characteristics which the law makes essential to priority. In this argument it is assumed that the wages must be 'due' to the earner at the time of the presentment of the claim for proof, or, at least, at the time of the commencement of the proceedings in bankruptcy. Without that assumption the argument fails to support the conclusion. \n\n[204 U.S. 186, 189]\n\u00a0\n But the statute lends no countenance to this assumption. It nowhere expressly or by fair implication says that the wages must be due to the earner at the time of the presentment of the claim, or of the beginning of the proceedings, and we find no warrant for supplying such a restriction. Regarding, then, the plain words of the statute, and no more, they seem to be merely descriptive of the nature of the debt to which priority is given. When one has incurred a debt for wages due to workmen, clerks, or servants, that debt, within the limits of time and amount prescribed by the act, is entitled to priority of payment. The priority is attached to the debt, and not to the person of the creditor; to the claim, and not to the claimant. The act does not enumerate classes of creditors and confer upon them the privilege of priority in payment, but, on the other hand, enumerates classes of debts as 'the debts to have priority.'\n In this case the Southern Car & Foundry Company had incurred certain debts for wages due to workmen, clerks, or servants, which were earned within three months before the date of the commencement of proceedings in bankruptcy. These debts were exactly within the description of those to which the bankruptcy act gives priority of payment, and they did not cease to be within that description by their assignment to another. The character of the debts was fixed when they were incurred, and could not be changed by an assignment. They were precisely of one of the classes of debts which the statute says are 'debts to have priority.'\n The question certified is answered in the affirmative, and it is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","138":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSMITH v.

The defendant in error is the treasurer of the state of South Carolina. The receiver brought in the supreme court of the state a petition for an injunction to restrain the treasurer from obeying the requirements of an act (presently to be stated) of the legislature of the state. The supreme court of the state dismissed the petition, and the case is here on writ of error. \n\n[206 U.S. 276, 277]\n\u00a0\n The state of South Carolina issued, in 1859, bonds due in twenty years in aid of the Blue Ridge Railroad Company.

That whereas, by the act of the legislature of 1896, the treasurer of this state is forbidden to pay, consolidate, or fund any coupon bond of the state after the expiration of twenty years from the date of maturity of such bonds, and certain bonds entered on the books of the state treasurer as 'Old bonds, not fundable, act of 1896, Blue Ridge Railroad Bonds, $37,000,' are still carried on the books of the state treasurer. Therefore, be it resolved: That the state treasurer be, and he is hereby, authorized and required to write said bonds off of the books in his office, and no longer carry said bonds on the books as a debt of the state.'\n\n Thereupon the receiver brought this petition, alleging that the act last stated, if valid, impaired the obligation of the contract made by the bonds, and that the act was not passed in conformity with the Constitution of the state, and was therefore void. The prayer of the petition was that the respondent \n\n[206 U.S. 276, 278]\n\u00a0\n be restrained by injunction 'from writing the said $37,000 of the state bonds off the books in his office, and no longer carrying said bonds on the books as a debt of the state.' The supreme court of the state decided against both these contentions, and they are brought here as Federal questions. But the conformity with the state Constitution of the proceedings in the enactment of the law is a question for the determination of the state court, and its judgment is final. Burt v. Smith, \n203 \nU.S. 129, 135\n, 51 S. L. ed. 121, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 37; Montana ex rel. Haire v. Rice, \n204 U.S. 291\n, 51 L. ed. 490, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 281. Nor did the law complained of impair the obligation of the state to pay the bonds therein mentioned, or the remedy to recover upon them. The obligation and the remedy remained precisely the same after the enactment of the lae as before. Neither one was in the slightest degree diminished or affected. The law merely directed a change of entries in the books of the state treasurer, and could by no possibility, in any respect whatever, deny, obstruct, impair, or affect the rights of the plaintiff in error. This was the view expressed by the court below, and the statute, thus interpreted, raises no Federal question.\n Writ of error dismissed. \n\n\n\n","139":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSMITHERS v. SMITH(1907)\nNo. 138\nArgued: Decided: February 25, 1907\n\n\n\n\n[204 U.S. 632, 633]\n\u00a0\n The plaintiff in error, a citizen of New York, brought in the circuit court for the northern district of Texas a petition to try the title to 1, 280 acres of land, against ten defendants, citizens either of Texas, Kentucky, or Illinois. Six of the defendants were warrantors of the plaintiff's title, and questions arising as to them are not material here. The petition alleged that upon January 15, 1902, 'the defendants Reagan, Smith, Greer, and Deven unlawfully entered upon said premises and dispossessed plaintiff thereof, and have since that date unlawfully withheld from the plaintiff the possession thereof, to his damage $2,000. 00;' that the plaintiff's title was derived by mesne conveyances from two patents of adjoining lots of land, known respectively as survey 27 and survey 91; that prior to plaintiff's acquisition of title the two surveys were circumscribed by a fence 2 miles long and 1 mile wide, making a single tract of land of those dimensions; that the value of the land was $ 5,000, and that the defendants have destroyed fences and other improvements and thereby damaged the plaintiff in the sum of $2,000; and prayed possession of the land, and damages.\n The answer of Reagan alleged that he was the owner of part of the land described in the petition by a title separate and independent from the other defendants; that his land is inclosed by a fence and in his possession; that he disclaims title to the remainder of the land claimed; that the allegation in the petition that he entered \n\n[204 U.S. 632, 634]\n\u00a0\n upon any other than his own land was untrue, 'and made with the intent to confer upon this court jurisdiction over him;' that the value of the land which he entered, is in possession of, and claims is less than $800, and asked that the suit abate as to him.\n Treating the foregoing answer as a plea in abatement, Reagan, without waiving it, further answered, disclaiming as to part of the land claimed in the petition and pleading the general issue as to the remainder.\n The answer of Greer was substantially the same, except that the value of the land upon which he entered and was possessed of was alleged to be less than $600. Greer further answered, alleging the pendency in the courts of the state of an action 'to try title to recover of S. A. Greer, a defendant in the case at bar, one T. Smith and others, the title and possession of the land described in the petition in the case at bar,' and praying that the cause await the determination of the cause in the state court. The answer of Smith contained the same allegation with regard to the pendency of the action in the state court as that of Greer, disclaimed as to part of the land described in the petition, and pleaded the general issue as to the remainder. Deven filed no answer.\n More than a year after the last of the foregoing pleadings were filed the plaintiff filed what was entitled 'First amended original petition.' In it Lee, also a resident of Texas, was named as an additional defendant. The amendment seems to be substantially like the original petition, except that it alleged that 'the defendants Reagan, Smith, Greer, Lee, and Deven together unlawfully entered upon said premises and dispossessed plaintiff thereof,' and that 'all of said defendants have jointly taken possession of plaintiff's said land;' that the plaintiff has acquired title to land by the statute of limitations, and that the action is one to fix and determine the boundaries, which are uncertain, and that 'the entire land is the subject-matter of this controversy as between the plaintiff and each and all of said defendants.'\n Subsequently Lee answered, alleging that he was the owner of part of the land described in plaintiff's petition by a title \n\n[204 U.S. 632, 635]\n\u00a0\n separate and independent from that of the other defendants, and with respect to that he pleads the general issue, and disclaims as to the remainder. The answer also alleged that the matter in controversy did not exceed the sum of $2,000, and that 'the claim of plaintiff as set forth in his petition as to the value of said land, improvements, rents, and damages, exceeding $2,000, has been fraudulently alleged with the intent and purpose to confer jurisdiction upon this honorable court, when in truth and in fact no such jurisdiction existed, because the matter in controversy is of less than $2,000 in value.'\n Subsequently Smith amended his answer and alleged that he was the owner and in possession of 443 acres of the land described in plaintiff's petition, which was of the value of $1,500, and disclaimed as to the remainder. He also alleged that the valuation placed by the plaintiff on the land, and the plaintiff's allegation that 'he and S. A. Greer jointly took possession of said lands,' was 'fraudulently claimed and alleged for the intent and purpose of conferring jurisdiction upon this honorable court, when in truth and in fact no such jurisdiction existed, because the whole matter in controversy is and was of less value than $2,000.' He further alleged that the controversy had been adjudicated in the state court. The pleas to the jurisdiction were, on motion of the defendants, tried by the judge, jury being waived, who found that 'the pleas of each of the said defendants Reagan, Lee, Smith, and Greer is fully proved and sustained, and that this court has no jurisdiction over the subject-matter in dispute,' and dismissed the action for want of jurisdiction. A writ of error was allowed 'solely upon the question of jurisdiction,' the judge, certifying that no other question was tried, transmitted the record containing a bill of exceptions to this court.\n The bill of exceptions shows that it was agreed that the plaintiff owned the two surveys, 91 and 27, containing 1,280 acres, of a value much exceeding $2,000; that Lee owned section 32, Reagan section 31, Smith section 28, and Greer \n\n[204 U.S. 632, 636]\n\u00a0\n section 90, all of which were adjoining sections and surrounded three sides of the plaintiff's land. The dispute concerned the situation of the boundaries. As the defendants claimed the boundaries, they owned 1,014 acres of what the plaintiff claimed to be his land, which, when he acquired it, was inclosed by a fence in one parcel of 1,280 acres. Of the 1,014 acres taken from the land claimed by plaintiff, Lee claimed 96, Reagan 288, Smith 443, and Greer 187. The evidence, which is reported in full in the bill of exceptions, shows the following facts: In 1892, before any of the defendants appeared claiming title, the 1,280 acres claimed by the plaintiff was inclosed as one parcel by a substantial fence, and was known as the Pendleton pasture. Subsequently the plaintiff acquired title to the inclosed land. Smith pulled down part and Reagan another part of the Pendleton pasture fence, and Smith and Greer each pastured their cattle throughout the Pendleton pasture.\n Messrs. David T. Bomar and Frank E. Dycus for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[204 U.S. 632, 638]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Theodore Mack, Sam J. Hunter, and Ray Hunter for defendants in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Moody: \n\n[204 U.S. 632, 639]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Moody, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The plaintiff in error brought an action in the circuit court for the recovery of certain land and damages for the detention thereof, basing jurisdiction upon a diversity of citizenship, which was undisputed. In such case it is essential to the jurisdiction of the circuit court that 'the matter in dispute exceeds, exclusive of interest and costs, the sum or value of \n\n[204 U.S. 632, 640]\n\u00a0\n $2,000.' Act of March 3, 1875, chap. 137,  1, 18 Stat. at L. 470; amended act of August 13, 1888, chap. 866,  1, 25 Stat. at L. 434, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 508. The action was dismissed by the authority given by  5 of the act of March 3, 1875, in which it is provided that 'if, in any suit commenced in a circuit court, . . . it shall appear to the satisfaction of said circuit court, at any time after such suit has been brought, . . . that such suit does not really and substantially involve a dispute or controversy properly within the jurisdiction of said circuit court, or that the parties to such suit have been improperly or collusively made or joined either as plaintiffs or defendants for the purpose of creating a case cognizable . . . under this act,' the court shall dismiss the suit. The propriety of the dismissal is brought here for review by virtue of  5 of the act of March 3 1891 [26 Stat. at L. 827, chap. 517, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 549], and is the only question for decision.\n The plaintiff was the owner in fee simple of a quadrangular lot of land 2 miles long and 1 mile wide, containing 1,280 acres, inclosed by a fence, and known as the Pendleton pasture. Its value largely exceeded $2, 000. He sought to recover possession of this land and damages from the defendants Reagan, Smith, Greer, Deven, and Lee, who, as he claimed, had disseised him of the land, and were unlawfully holding possession. In ascertaining the precise nature of the plaintiff's claim we take into account not only the original petition, but that pleading entitled 'First amended original petition,' although it is urged that it does not appear that the amendment was allowed by the court. It is not clear that the amendment adds anything material to the question presented here, to the original petition, but, however that may be, as it is certified to be a part of the record and was answered by one of the defendants, we assume that it was properly allowed, and was not a mere casual intruder among the papers in the case. The plaintiff alleged in substance in the original, and more specifically in the amended, petition that the defendants had jointly entered upon, taken, and held possession of, his land, which was of the value of $5,000, and \n\n[204 U.S. 632, 641]\n\u00a0\n inflicted damages of $2,000 upon him by the unlawful entry and possession, and sought to recover of all the defendants the whole parcel of land and all the damages claimed. Thus the plaintiff set forth a case within the jurisdiction of the court. Giving to the defendants' answers the broadest possible effect, they each, for the purpose of disputing the jurisdiction of the court, denied that they had jointly entered upon plaintiff's land, and, each disclaiming as to the remainder, alleged that, under a title separate and independent from the other defendants, he had entered upon and held possession of only a certain part of the plaintiff's land, which, together with the damages inflicted by the entry and possession, was of much less value than $2,000. The answers further alleged that the allegations of the value of the land, the extent of the damages, and the joint action of the defendants in entering, taking, and holding possession, were fraudulently made by the plaintiff with the intent and purpose of conferring jurisdiction upon the court, when in truth no such jurisdiction existed, because the matter in controversy was in reality less than the value of $2,000. Upon the motion of the defendants the judge, without a jury, passed upon the question of jurisdiction, and, after hearing evidence, found that the pleas of the defendants as to the jurisdiction were 'fully proved and sustained,' and that the court has no jurisdiction over the subject-matter in dispute, and dismissed the suit.\n The order of the court is subject to review in this court in respect of the rulings of law and findings of fact upon the evidence. Wetmore v. Rymer, \n169 U.S. 115\n, 42 L. ed. 682, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 293.\n The absence of any opinion in the court below, and of any finding of fact except by reference to the several answers of the defendants, which are said to be 'fully proved and sustained,' and of any more specific recital in the judgment than that the suit was dismissed for want of jurisdiction, renders it somewhat difficult to understand the facts and reasons which led to the dismissal. But, upon an examination of the whole record, it seems clear that the court found: \n\n[204 U.S. 632, 642]\n\u00a0\n (1) That the defendants did not jointly take and hold the plaintiff's land;\n\n\n (2)\n That each defendant, acting independently of the others, took and held only a part of plaintiff's land, and that each part thus taken and held by each defendant was of less value than $2,000; and\n\n\n (3)\n That the plaintiff, in his petition, had fraudulently stated the value of his land, the extent of his damages, and the joint character of defendants' action in entering and taking possession of his land, and had done this for the purpose of conferring jurisdiction upon the court.\n If the last finding of fact was warranted by the evidence there is no need of going further, because such a state of facts would demand a dismissal of the action. Ordinarily the plaintiff's claim with respect to the value of the property taken from him or the amount of damages incurred by him through the defendants' wrongful act measures, for jurisdictional purposes, the value of the matter in controversy (Smith v. Greenhow, \n109 U.S. 669\n, 27 L. ed. 1080, 3 Sup. Ct. Rep. 421; Barry v. Edmunds, \n116 U.S. 550\n, 29 L. ed. 729, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 501; Scott v. Donald, \n165 U.S. 58\n, 41 L. ed. 632, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 265; Wiley v. Sinkler, \n179 U.S. 58\n, 45 L. ed. 84, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 17), unless, upon inspection of the plaintiff's declaration, it appears that, as a matter of law, it is not possible for the plaintiff to recover the jurisdictional amount (Lee v. Watson, 1 Wall. 337, 17 L. ed. 557; Schacker v. Hartford F. Ins. Co. \n93 U.S. 241\n, 23 L. ed. 862; Vance v. W. A. Vandercook Co. \n170 U.S. 468\n, 42 L. ed. 1111, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 645; North American Transp. & Trading Co. v. Morrison, \n178 U.S. 262\n, 44 L. ed. 1061, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 869). The rule that the plaintiff's allegations of value govern in determining the jurisdiction, except where, upon the face of his own pleadings, it is not legally possible for him to recover the jurisdictional amount, controls even where the declaration shows that a perfect defense might be interposed to a sufficient amount of the claim to reduce it below the jurisdictional amount. Schunk v. Moline M. & S. Co. \n147 U.S. 500\n, 37 L. ed. 255, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 416. In the last case the plaintiff's petition prayed judgment on several promissory notes, of which some, amounting to $530, were due, and others, amounting to $1,664, were not due, the jurisdictional amount then, \n\n[204 U.S. 632, 643]\n\u00a0\n as now, being $2,000. In holding that the court had jurisdiction of the claim this court, by Mr. Justice Brewer, said:\n'Although there might be a perfect defense to the suit for at least the amount not yet due, yet the fact of a defense, and a good defense, too, would not affect the question as to what was the amount in dispute. Suppose an action were brought on a non-negotiable note for $2,500, the consideration for which was fully stated in the petition, and which was a sale of lottery tickets, or any other matter distinctly prohibited by statute,-can there be a doubt that the circuit court would have jurisdiction? There would be presented a claim to recover the $2,500; and whether that claim was sustainable or not, that would be the real sum in dispute. In short, the fact of a valid defense to a cause of action, although apparent on the face of the petition, does not diminish the amount that is claimed, nor determine what is the matter in dispute; for who can say in advance that that defense will be presented by the defendant, or, if presented, sustained by the court?'\n\n Nevertheless, however stringent and farreaching the rule may be that it is the plaintiff's statement of his case which governs in determining the jurisdiction, it does not exclude the power of the court to protect itself against fraud. This was pointed out in Smith v. Greenhow, ubi supra, where it was said that, if the court found as a fact that the damages were laid in the declaration colorably and beyond a reasonable expectation of recovery, for the purpose of creating jurisdiction, there would be authority for dismissing the case; and, following this statement of the law, it was held that where the judge of the circuit court, upon sufficient evidence, found that the damages had been claimed and magnified fraudulently beyond the jurisdictional amount, the action should be dismissed. Globe Ref. Co. v. Landa Cotton Oil Co. \n190 U.S. 540\n, 47 L. ed. 1171, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 754. It follows, therefore, as has been said, that if the third finding of the judge in the court below was warranted, his action in dismissing the case should be affirmed. But, after an examination of the evidence, we are of the opinion \n\n[204 U.S. 632, 644]\n\u00a0\n that nothing in it warranted any such finding. It appeared clearly that the Pendleton pasture, which the plaintiff sought to recover against all the defendants, was of a value much in excess of the jurisdictional amount. There was not a word of evidence reflecting upon the plaintiff's good faith in bringing the action, in joining the defendants, or in framing his petition. He doubtless preferred to try his controversy in the Federal courts, and, whatever the motive of his preference may have been, he had the right to act upon it. Blair v. Chicago, \n201 U.S. 400\n, 50 L. ed. 801, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 427; Chicago v. Mills (decided February 4, this term) \n204 U.S. 321\n, 51 L. ed. 504, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 286. Therefore the validity of the order of dismissal must be considered, after an elimination of the finding that the plaintiff's claim was fraudulently made.\n The plaintiff's claim, which we now assume to have been made in good faith, was that the defendants, acting together, took and held from him land of the value of $5,000, and at the same time inflicted damages upon him of $2,000. Upon any possible theory of law this claim states the plaintiff's side of a controversy which is unquestionably within the jurisdiction of the circuit court. When it is duly put in issue by the defendants' pleadings the record upon its face discloses a controversy between citizens of different states, in which 'the matter in dispute exceeds $2,000 in value,' and, therefore, one which is within the exact words of the act conferring jurisdiction upon that court. It is legally possible for the plaintiff to recover the full amount of all the land and the full amount of the damages claimed. We know of no case that holds that in such a situation the judge of the circuit court is authorized to interpose and try a sufficient part of the controversy between the parties to satisfy himself that the plaintiff ought to recover less than the jurisdictional amount, and to conclude, therefore, that the real controversy between the parties is concerning a subject of less than the jurisdictional value, and we think that, by sound principle, he is forbidden to do so. In exercising the authority to dismiss the action conferred by the act of 1875 \n\n[204 U.S. 632, 645]\n\u00a0\n the judge may proceed upon motion of the parties or upon his own motion, and, if he chooses, without trial by jury. Williams v. Nottawa, \n104 U.S. 209\n, 26 L. ed. 719; Wetmore v. Rymer, ubi supra. Such an authority obviously is not unlimited, and its limits ought to be ascertained and observed, lest, under the guise of determining jurisdiction, the merits of the controversy between the parties be summarily decided without the ordinary incidents of a trial, including the right to a jury. For it must not be forgotten that where, in good faith, one has brought into court a cause of action which, as stated by him, is clearly within its jurisdiction, he has the right to try its merits in the manner provided by the Constitution and law, and cannot be compelled to submit to a trial of another kind. This was clearly stated by Mr. Justice Matthews in Barry v. Edmunds, 116 U. S., at page 565, 29 L. ed., at page 734, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep., at page 509, who said: 'In no case is it permissible for the court to substitute itself for the jury, and compel a compliance on the part of the latter with its own view of the facts in evidence, as the standard and measure of that justice which the jury itself is the appointed constitutional tribunal to award.' In applying these general principles for the purpose of ascertaining the limits of the authority to dismiss summarily for lack of jurisdiction, the circumstance that, in this case, a jury was waived by the parties, is without significance, because, if the judge had authority to adopt this summary method, he could dispense with the jury whether the parties agreed to it or not.\n The error into which the judge in the court below has fallen is shown by an analysis of his findings. He did not find that the land which the plaintiff claimed to recover was not of a value in excess of $2,000, but that parts of that land which each defendant claimed that the plaintiff ought only to recover against him were each of less than the value of $2, 000. As the plaintiff alleged, and the defendants denied, that the defendants jointly took and held his whole lot of land, the judge, on the conceded value of the plaintiff's land, in order to have arrived at the conclusion that the case should be dismissed, \n\n[204 U.S. 632, 646]\n\u00a0\n must have found that the defendants had not jointly taken and held the whole of the plaintiff's land. In doing this we think he exceeded his authority under the statute, and, in determining the jurisdiction, in effect decided the controversy between the parties upon the merits. In deciding that the defendants had not acted jointly, as the plaintiff alleged and the defendants denied, he determined not a jurisdictional fact, but an essential element of the merits of the dispute upon which the parties were at issue.\n An assumption which underlay the action of the court below in dismissing the case evidently was that, if the defendants, as they asserted in their pleadings, had each, acting by virtue of a separate and independent title, taken and held a part only of the plaintiff's land, each part being less than the jurisdictional amount, although the whole was of more than the jurisdictional amount, there was no controversy within the jurisdiction of the circuit court. The correctness of this assumption of law has been argued before us by the parties. We do not deem it necessary to decide that question. There is certainly respectable authority which tends to show that in such a case the plaintiff, being the owner of a single lot of land, may maintain one action against all the defendants, and that the measure of jurisdiction is the value of the plaintiff's land, and not the value of the part held by each defendant. The appropriate rule, however, to be applied to the facts of this case, can be better determined in a trial on the merits, where instructions on their varied aspects may be given to the jury, subject to the review provided by law.\n Because the circuit court erred in dismissing the case for want of jurisdiction, its action must be reversed.\n The judgment of the court below is therefore reversed and the cause remanded to that court with directions to take such further proceedings therein as the law requires and in conformity with this opinion.\n Mr. Justice Brewer dissents. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] U.

William A. Wimbish, William Hepburn Russell, W. D. Ellis, and Ellis, Wimbish, & Ellis for appellees.\n\n\n[206 U.S. 428, 433]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an appeal from a decree of the circuit court of appeals affirming a decree of the circuit court for the southern district of Georgia, adjudging an advance in freight rates made by appellants, to be effective June 22, 1903, upon yellow pine lumber, of 2 cents per 100 pounds over rates previously in force, to be unjust and unreasonable, and enjoining \n\n[206 U.S. 428, 434]\n\u00a0\n the appellants, jointly and severally, from maintaining the same, 'in so far as they apply to shipments of lumber from points in Georgia to Ohio river destinations and points basing thereon.'\n The original bill was filed April 14, 1903, by appellees, to enjoin such advance in rates, and a temporary restraining order was issued and notice to appellants to show cause why an injunction should not issue. On May 8 the bill was amended. On May 12 the appellants filed a demurrer to the amended bill for want of jurisdiction in the court as a court of equity and as a court of the United States, and the Southeastern Freight Association filed an answer. Appellants also filed a response to the order to show cause. On May 16 the demurrer was overruled. The temporary injunction was, however, dissolved, but the following condition was expressed:\n'In case the respondents shall enforce the rates complained of, and the complainants shall make proper application to the Interstate Commerce Commission to redress their alleged grievances, the court will entertain a renewed application on the record as made, and such appropriate additions thereto as may be proposed by either party, for enoining the enforcement of such rates pending the investigation of the Commission, unless otherwise dissolved, and, on presentation to the court of the report of the Commission, such other action be taken as will be conformable to law and the principles of equity.' 138 Fed. 756.\n\n The appellants took the steps prescribed by the interstate commerce act to put the advanced rates into effect, and the appellees, on June 23, 1903, filed a petition before the Interstate Commerce Commission, charging that 'in promulgating said tariff of increased rates, and maintaining and enforcing the same,' the appellants were acting 'in concert with each other and with other lumber-carrying roads,' who, with them, were 'comembers of the Southeastern Freight Association.' The petition also charged that the advance was 'arbitrary, unreasonable, and unjust,' and prayed for an order commanding \n\n[206 U.S. 428, 435]\n\u00a0\n appellants, and each of them, to desist from enforcing the advance. All of the appellants except the Macon & Birmingham Railway Company filed a joint and several answer, in which they traversed the allegations of the petition and pleaded justification by the conditions affecting the roads and the traffic. They also alleged that the Georgia Saw Mill Association, to which appellees belonged, was a combination in restraint of trade and commerce, and that, therefore, appellees did not 'come before the Commission with clean hands.' A great deal of testimony was taken on the issues presented, and the Commission found and concluded that the advance in rates 'was not warranted by the testimony, and that the increased rates put in force June 22, 1903, were unreasonable and unjust.' The specific findings and conclusions of the Commission are reported in 10 Inters. Com. Rep. 548. After the petition was filed before the Interstate Commerce Commission, but before final action, appellees filed an amended bill and again moved the circuit court for an injunction. In the amended bill it was alleged that appellants, after the dissolution of the restraining order, filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission and gave public notice that on June 22, 1903, the advance in sales on lumber would be established and put in effect, and such advance became effective June 22, 1903. The appellants, in a joint and several answer, admitted the averments of the amended bill, but reserved the benefit of their demurrer to the original bill. The motion for an injunction was dismissed. 123 Fed. 789.\n The Commission made its order hereinbefore referred to on the 7th of February, 1905, and on March 7, 1905, the appellees presented a petition to the circuit court stating the substance of the findings of the Commission, and attaching a copy of its report and opinion.\n An order to show cause was issued. On June 3, 1905, appellants filed a joint and several answer, which was verified. The Southeastern Association answered separately. The appellees also filed a supplemental bill, the purpose of which \n\n[206 U.S. 428, 436]\n\u00a0\n was to obtain restitution of the excess of rates charged over those which it was alleged were reasonable. To this bill a demurrer was filed.\n It was stipulated by counsel of the respective parties that the testimony, including exhibits taken before the Interstate Commerce Commission, should be filed in the case, subject only to objections to its relevancy. In addition to such testimony other evidence was submitted to the circuit court, and that court rendered a decree July, 1905, that the advance in rates 'from lumber-shipping points within the state of Georgia to Cincinnati, Louisville, Evansville, Cairo, and points on the Ohio river or crossings was and is excessive, unreasonable, and unjust, and in violation of the provisions of the act of Congress known as the act to regulate commerce, and the amendments thereto, and that the rates and charges resulting from said advance are likewise excessive, unreasonable, and unjust, and in violation of the act to regulate commerce.' The appellants were enjoined, as we have already said, from enforcing the advance.\n The decree also directed an order of reference to the standing master of the pleadings and evidence in the cause, with instructions to ascertain the sum total of the increase in rates paid by each of the appellees and other members of the Georgia Saw Mill Association to either or all of the appellants since the rate went into effect. This was done, the decree recited, in pursuance of a stipulation made by the respondents (appellants) in open court that, in case the complainants (appellees) prevailed, decree of restitution might be made. 138 Fed. 753. The decree was affirmed by the circuit court of appeals without an opinion.\n On the merits, as distinguished from the questions which concern the jurisdiction and procedure in the circuit court, this case is, though variant in some detail of facts, similar in principle and depends upon the same legal considerations as Illinois C. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, just decided. [\n206 U.S. 441\n, 51 L. ed. --, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 700.] The advance here involved grew \n\n[206 U.S. 428, 437]\n\u00a0\n out of the same action by the railroads there considered, and is the advance there referred to as having been made west of the Mississippi. This case was argued and submitted with that and depends on the same ultimate contentions. We need not repeat the discussion of those contentions, nor trace out or dwell upon the many subsidiary considerations which the assignments of error and the elaborate briefs of counsel present.\n In the case at bar, however, there are assignments of error based on the objections to the jurisdiction of the circuit court. These might present serious questions in view of our decision in Texas & P. R. Co. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co. \n204 U.S. 426\n, 51 L. ed. 553, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 350, upon a different record than that before us. We are not required to say, however, that because an action at law for damages to recover unreasonable rates which have been exacted in accordance with the schedule of rates as filed, is forbidden by the interstate commerce act, a suit in equity is also forbidden to prevent a filing or enforcement of a schedule of unreasonable rates or a change to unjust or unreasonable rates. The circuit court granted no relief prejudicial to appellants on the original bill. It sent the parties to the Interstate Commerce Commission, where, upon sufficient pleadings, identical with those before the court, and upon testimony adduced upon the issues made, the decision was adverse to the appellants. This action of the Commission, with its findings and concluson s, was presented to the circuit court, and it was upon these, in effect, the decree of the court was rendered. There was no demurrer to that petition, and the testimony taken before the Commission was stipulated into the case, and the opinion of the court recites that, 'with equal meritorious purpose, counsel for the respective parties agreed that this would stand for and be the hearing for final decree in equity.'\n It was certainly competent for the appellees to proceed in the circuit court under  16 of the interstate commerce act (24 Stat. at L. 379, chap. 104, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3154) and to apply by petition to the circuit court, 'sitting in equity,' for the court to hear and determine \n\n[206 U.S. 428, 438]\n\u00a0\n the matter 'as a court of equity,' and issue an injunction 'or other proper process, mandatory or otherwise,' to enforce the order of the Commission. We think that, under the broad powers conferred upon the circuit court by  16 and the direction there given to the court to proceed with efficiency, but without the formality of equity proceedings, 'but in such manner as to do justice in the premises,' and in view of the stipulation of the parties, recited in the decree of the court, the appellants are precluded from making the objection that the court did not have jurisdiction to entertain the petition and grant the relief prayed for and decreed.\n But objection is made to the extent of the decree. Indeed, the objection may be said to go farther back, and is based on the bill itself, on the ground that 'pecuniary reparation was demanded' in it, and 'such payment necessarily involves a trial by jury, guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States.' And further, that each complainant is separately interested in any amount which may be recovered. The specific part of the decree which is objected to is as follows:\n'Third. That an order be taken referring to the standing master of this court, J. N. Talley, Esquire, the pleadings and evidence in this cause, with instructions to ascertain the sum total of the increase in rates paid by each of the complainants and other members of the Georgia Saw Mill Association to either or all of the defendant companies, since the rate went into effect, and to the end of the litigation, and report such amount to the court in order that, pursuant to the stipulation made by the respondents in open court, in case the complainants prevailed, decree of restitution may be made.'\n\n The errors assigned against this part of the decree are: (a) That there is nothing in the pleadings or the evidence to justify any reference . (b) The master should only have been ordered to ascertain the sum total of the advance paid by each of the appellees as is unreasonable and unjust . (c) That no members of the Georgia Saw Mill Association except the complainants (appellees) had themselves been made parties to the cause prior \n\n[206 U.S. 428, 439]\n\u00a0\n to the rendition of the decree of July 8, 1905, and, therefore, no reference should have been made to ascertain the amounts paid by such other members. (d) The master should not have been ordered to report any amount at all. (e) No stipulation was made by appellants that a decree of restitution should be made except 'in the event that complainants ( appellees) finally prevail, and whether they finally prevail cannot be known until the determination of this appeal.'\n In support of these contentions appellants rely on Texas & P. R. Co. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co. supra. In that case the Abilene Cotton Oil Company sued in one of the courts in Texas to recover the excess of what it alleged to be an unjust and unreasonable charge on shipments of car loads of cotton seed. The defense was that the rates were charged according to the schedule of rates filed under the interstate commerce act, and that the court had no jurisdiction to grant relief upon the basis that the established rate was unreasonable, when it had not been found to be so by the Interstate Commerce Commission. The defense prevailed in the trial court, but did no p revail in the court of civil appeals, where judgment was rendered in favor of the cotton oil company. The judgment was reversed by this court on the ground that the state courts had no jurisdiction to entertain a suit based on the unreasonableness of a rate as published in advance of the action of the Interstate Commerce Commission adjudging the rate unreasonable. And it was in effect held that reparation after such action for the excess above a reasonable rate must be by a proceeding before the Commission, 'because of a wrong endured during the period when the unreasonable schedule was enforced by the carrier and before its change and the establishment of a new one.' There is nothing in that case, however, which precludes the parties, after action by the Commission declaring rates unreasonable, from stipulating in the proceedings prosecuted under  16 that the court adjudge the amount of reparation. By the action of the Commission the foundation for reparation, as \n\n[206 U.S. 428, 440]\n\u00a0\n provided in the interstate commerce act, was established, and the inquiry submitted to the court was but of its amount, and had the natural and justifiable inducement to end all the controversies between the parties without carrying part of them to another tribunal. We do not understand that the assignment of errors questions the truth of the recital in the decree that the reference was made in pursuance of the stipulation in open court, and it is upon the stipulation we rest our decision. It is said, however, that it was stipulated that restitution should only be made in the event the appellees prevailed. Necessarily it was so dependent. So was every part of the relief prayed by the appellees. The decree was the first judgment that they should prevail, and properly provided for the satisfaction of all the relief dependent upon their success. Of course, what was granted by the decree was subject to review and change or defeat in the circuit court of appeals and in this court. But it equally was subject to affirmance, and was put in such form and made such provision as made it ready to be executed upon affirmance.\n The objection that the reference is too broad is not of substance. What the court may award upon the coming in of the report of the master we cannot know. Presumably it will make the reparation adequate for the injury, and award only the advance on the old rate, and to those who are parties to the cause.\n Decree affirmed.\n Mr. Justice Moody took no part in the decision of this case.\n Mr. Justice Brewer dissented. \n\n\n\n","141":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF GA. v. TENNESSEE COPPER CO.(1907)\n\nArgued: Decided: May 13, 1907\n\n\n\n\n[206 U.S. 230, 231]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Ligon Johnson and John C. Hart for complainant.\n\n\n\n[206 U.S. 230, 236]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. James G. Parks, Howard Cornick, John H. Frantz, James B. Wright, and Martin H. Vogel for defendants.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a bill in equity filed in this court by the state of Georgia, in pursuance of a resolution of the legislature and by direction of the governor of the state, to enjoin the defendant copper companies from discharging noxious gas from their works in Tennessee over the plaintiff's territory. It alleges that, in consequence of such discharge, a wholesale destruction of forests, orchards, and crops is going on, and other injuries are done and threatened in five counties of the state. It alleges also a vain application to the state of Tennessee for relief. A preliminary injunction was denied; but, as there was ground to fear that great and irreparable damage might be done, an early day was fixed for the final hearing, and the parties were given leave, if so minded, to try the case on affidavits. This has been done without objection, and, although the method would be unsatisfactory if our decision turned on any nice question of fact, in the view that we take we think it unlikely that either party has suffered harm. \n\n[206 U.S. 230, 237]\n\u00a0\n The case has been argued largely as if it were one between two private parties; but it is not. The very elements that would be relied upon in a suit between fellow-citizens as a ground for equitable relief are wanting here. The state owns very little of the territory alleged to be affected, and the damage to it capable of estimate in money, possibly, at least, is small. This is a suit by a state for an injury to it in its capacity of quasi-sovereign. In that capacity the state has an interest independent of and behind the titles of its citizens, in all the earth and air within its domain. It has the last word as to whether its mountains shall be stripped of their forests and its inhabitants shall breathe pure air. It might have to pay individuals before it could utter that word, but with it remains the final power. The alleged damage to the state as a private owner is merely a makeweight, and we may lay on one side the dispute as to whether the destruction of forests has led to the gullying of its roads.\n The caution with which demands of this sort, on the part of a state, for relief from injuries analogous to torts, must be examined, is dwelt upon in Missouri v. Illinois, \n200 \nU.S. 496, 520\n, 521 S., 50 L. ed. 572, 578, 579, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 268. But it is plain that some such demands must be recognized, if the grounds alleged are proved. When the states by their union made the forcible abatement of outside nuisances impossible to each, they did not thereby agree to submit to whatever might be done. They did not renounce the possibility of making reasonable demands on the ground of their still remaining quasi-sovereign interests; and the alternative to force is a suit in this court. Missouri v. Illinosi, \n180 \nU.S. 208, 241\n, 45 S. L. ed. 497, 512, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 331.\n Some peculiarities necessarily mark a suit of this kind. If the state has a case at all, it is somewhat more certainly entitled to specific relief than a private party might be. It is not lightly to be required to give up quasi-sovereign rights for pay; and, apart from the difficulty of valuing such rights in money, if that be its choice it may insist that an infraction of them shall be stopped. The states, by entering the Union, did not sink \n\n[206 U.S. 230, 238]\n\u00a0\n to the position of private owners, subject to one system of private law. This court has not quite the same freedom to balance the harm that will be done by an injunction against that of which the plaintiff complains, that it would have in deciding between two subjects of a single political power. Without excluding the considerations that equity always takes into account, we cannot give the weight that was given them in argument to a comparison between the damage threatened to the plaintiff and the calamity of a possible stop to the defendants' business, the question of health, the character of the forests as a first or second growth, the commercial possibility or impossibility of reducing the fumes to sulphuric acid, the special adaptation of the business to the place.\n It is a fair and reasonable demand on the part of a sovereign that the air over its territory should not be polluted on a great scale by sulphurous acid gas, that the forests on its mountains, be they better or worse, and whatever domestic destruction they have suffered, should not be further destroyed or threatened by the act of persons beyond its control, that the crops and orchards on its hills should not be endangered from the same source. If any such demand is to be enforced this must be notwithstanding the hesitation that we might feel if the suit were between private parties, and the doubt whether, for the injuries which they might be suffering to their property, they should not be left to an action at law.\n The proof requires but a few words. It is not denied that the defendants generate in their works near the Georgia line large quantities of sulphur dioxid which becomes sulphurous acid by its mixture with the air. It hardly is denied, and cannot be denied with success, that this gas often is carried by the wind great distances and over great tracts of Georgia land. On the evidence the pollution of the air and the magnitude of that pollution are not open to dispute. Without any attempt to go into details immaterial to the suit, it is proper to add that we are satisfied, by a preponderance of evidence, that the sulphurous fumes cause and threaten damage on so consider- \n\n[206 U.S. 230, 239]\n\u00a0\n able a scale to the forests and vegetable life, if not to health, within the plaintiff state, as to make out a case within the requirements of Missouri v. Illinois, \n200 U.S. 496\n, 50 L. ed. 572, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 268. Whether Georgia, by insisting upon this claim, is doing more harm than good to her own citizens, is for her to determine. The possible disaster to those outside the state must be accepted as a consequence of her standing upon her extreme rights.\n It is argued that the state has been guilty of laches. We deem it unnecessary to consider how far such a defense would be available in a suit of this sort, since, in our opinion, due diligence has been shown. The conditions have been different until recent years. After the evil had grown greater in 1904 the state brought a bill in this court. The defendants, however, already were abandoning the old method of roasting ore in open heaps and it was hoped that the change would stop the trouble. They were ready to agree not to return to that method, and, upon such an agreement being made, the bill was dismissed without prejudice. But the plaintiff now finds, or thinks that it finds, that the tall chimneys in present use cause the poisonous gases to be carried to greater distances than ever before, and that the evil has not been helped.\n If the state of Georgia adheres to its determination, there is no alternative to issuing an injunction, after allowing a reasonable time to the defendants to complete the structures that they now are building, and the efforts that they are making to stop the fumes. The plaintiff may submit a form of decree on the coming in of this court in October next.\n Injunction to issue.\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan, concurring:\n The state of Georgia is, in my opinion, entitled to the general relief sought by its bill, and, therefore, I concur in the result. With some things, however, contained in the opinion, or to be implied from its language, I do not concur. When the Constitution gave this court original jurisdiction in cases \n\n[206 U.S. 230, 240]\n\u00a0\n 'in which a state shall be a party,' it was not intended, I think, to authorize the court to apply in its behalf any principle or rule of equity that would not be applied, under the same facts, in suits wholly between private parties. If this were a suit between private parties, and if, under the evidence, a court of equity would not give the plaintiff an injunction, then it ought not to grant relief, under like circumstances, to the plaintiff, because it happens to be a state, possessing some powers of sovereignty. Georgia is entitled to the relief sought, not because it is a state, but because it is a party which has established its right to such relief by proof. The opinion, if I do not mistake its scope, proceeds largely upon the ground that this court, sitting in this case as a court of equity, owes some special duty to Georgia as a state, although it is a party, while, under the same facts, it would not owe any such duty to the plaintiff if an individual. \n\n\n\n","142":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF KAN. v. STATE OF COLO.(1907)\n\nArgued: Decided: May 13, 1907\n\n\n\n\n[206 U.S. 46, 47]\n\u00a0\n On May 20, 1901, pursuant to a resolution passed by the legislature of Kansas (Kan. Laws 1901, chap. 425), and upon leave obtained, the state of Kansas filed its bill in equity in this court against the state of Colorado. To this bill the defendant demurred. After argument on the demurrer this court held that the case ought not to be disposed of on the mere averments of the bill, and, therefore, overruled the demurrer without prejudice to any question defendant might present. Leave was also given to answer. \n185 U.S. 125\n, 46 L. ed. 838, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 552. In delivering the opinion of the court the Chief justice disclosed in the following words the general character of the controversy, and the conclusions arrived at (p. 145, L. ed. p. 846, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 559):\n'The gravamen of the bill is that the state of Colorado, acting directly herself as well as through private persons thereto licensed, is depriving and threatening to deprive the state of Kansas and its inhabitants of all the water heretofore accustomed to flow in the Arkansas river through its channel on the surface, and through a subterranean course across the state of Kansas; that this is threatened not only by the impounding and the use of the water at the river's source, but as it flows \n\n[206 U.S. 46, 48]\n\u00a0\n after reaching the river. Injury, it is averred, is being, and would be, thereby inflicted on the state of Kansas as an individual owner, and on all the inhabitants of the state, and especially on the inhabitants of that part of the state lying in the Arkansas valley. The injury is asserted to be threatened, and as being wrought, in respect of lands located on the banks of the river; lands lying on the line of a subterranean flow; and lands lying some distance from the river, either above or below ground, but dependent on the river for a supply of water. And it is insisted that Colorado, in doing this, is violating the fundamental principle that one must use his own so as not to destroy the legal rights of another.\n\n'The state of Kansas appeals to the rule of the common law that owners of lands on the banks of a river are entitled to the continual flow of the stream; and while she concedes that this rule has been modified in the Western states so that flowing water may be appropriated to mining purposes and for the reclamation of arid lands, and the doctrine of prior appropriation obtains, yet she says that that modification has not gone so far as to justify the destruction of the rights of other states and their inhabitants altogether; and that the acts of Congress of 1866 and subsequently, while recognizing the prior appropriation of water as in contravention of the common-law rule as to a continuous flow, have not attempted to recognize it as rightful to that extent. In other words, Kansas contends that Colorado cannot absolutely destroy her rights, and seeks some mode of accommodation as between them, while she further insists that she occupies, for reasons given, the position of a prior appropriator herself, if put to that contention as between her and Colorado.\n\n'Sitting, as it were, as an international as well as a domestic tribunal, we apply Federal law, state law, and international law, as the exigencies of the particular case may demand, and we are unwilling, in this case, to proceed on the mere technical admissions made by the demurrer. Nor do we regard it as necessary, whatever imperfections a close analysis of the pend- \n\n[206 U.S. 46, 49]\n\u00a0\n ing bill may disclose, to compel its amendment at this stage of the litigation. We think proof should be made as to whether Colorado is herself actually threatening to wholly exhaust the flow of the Arkansas river in Kansas; whether what is described in the bill as the 'underflow' is a subterranean stream flowing in a known and defined channel, and not merely water percolating through the strata below; whether certain persons, firms, and corporations in Colorado must be made parties hereto; what lands in Kansas are actually situated on the banks of the river, and what, either in Colorado or Kansas, are absolutely dependent on water therefrom; the extent of the watershed or the drainage area of the Arkansas river; the possibilities of the maintenance of a sustained flow through the control of flood waters,-in short, the circumstances, a variation in which might induce the court to either grant, modify, or deny the relief sought or any part thereof.'\n\n On August 17, 1903, Kansas filed an amended bill, naming as defendants Colorado and quite a number of corporations, who were charged to be engaged in depleting the flow of water in the Arkansas river. Colorado and several of the corporations answered. For reasons which will be apparent from the opinion the defenses of these corporations will not be considered apart from those of Colorado. On March 21, 1904, the United States, upon leave, filed its petition of intervention. The issue between these several parties having been perfected by replications, a commissioner was appointed to take evidence, and, after that had been taken and abstracts prepared, counsel for the respective parties were heard in argument, and upon the pleadings and testimony the case was submitted.\n In order that the issue between the three principal parties, Kansas, Colorado, and the United States, may be fully disclosed,-although by so doing we prolong considerably this opinion,-we quote abstracts of the pleadings and statements thereof made by the respective counsel. Counsel for Kansas say: \n\n[206 U.S. 46, 50]\n\u00a0\n 'The bill of complaint alleges that the state of Kansas was admitted into the Union on January 29, 1861, that the state of Colorado was admitted on August 1, 1876, and that the other defendants are corporations organized, chartered, and doing business in the state of Colorado; that the Arkansas river rises in the Rocky mountains, in the state of Colorado, and, flowing in a southeasterly direction for a distance of about 280 miles, crosses the boundary into the state of Kansas; that the river then flows in an easterly and southeasterly direction through the state of Kansas for a distance of about 300 miles, then through Oklahoma, Indian territory, and Arkansas, on its way to the sea. Through the state of Kansas the Arkansas valley is a level plain but a few feet above the normal level of the river, and is from 2 to 25 miles in width. Back to the foothills on either side there are bottom lands which are saturated and subirrigated by the underflow from the river, and are fertile and productive almost beyond comparison. The Arkansas river is a meandered stream through the state of Kansas, and under the laws and departmental rules and regulations of the United States it is a navigable river through the state of Kansas, and was, in fact, navigable and navigated from the city of Wichita south to its mouth; and that the complainant is the owner of the bed of the stream between the meandered lines in trust for the people of the state; that the complainant is the owner of two tracts of land bordering upon the river, one at Hutchinson and one at Dodge City, upon which state institutions are maintained,-one as a reform school and the other as a soldiers' home. That when the state of Kansas was admitted into the Union it became the owner, for school purposes, of sections 16 and 36 of each congressional township, of which the complainant still owns many thousand acres, much of which borders on the Arkansas river. That by act of Congress of March 3, 1863 [12 Stat. at L. 772, chap. 98], the complainant became the owner of each odd-numbered section of land in the Arkansas valley and has since conveyed the whole of this land for the purposes specified. That by the year 1868 \n\n[206 U.S. 46, 51]\n\u00a0\n the land in the Arkansas valley began to be taken by actual settlers, and by the year 1875 practically all the bottom lands in the east or lower half of the valley were entered and settled, and title obtained from the United States or the state of Kansas; and by the year 1882 the west or upper half of the valley was so entered and settled and like titles obtained. By the year 1873 a railroad was built through the entire length of the valley, and immediately after their settlement these bottom lands were extensively cultivated, large crops of agricultural products were raised, towns and cities sprang up, population rapidly increased, and by the year 1883 practically all the bottom lands of the Arkansas valley were in a state of successful and prosperous cultivation; that the waters of the Arkansas river furnished the foundation for this prosperity. These waters furnished a wholesome and ample supply for domestic purposes, for the watering of stock, for power for operating mills and factories, for saturating and subirrigating the bottom lands back to the uplands on either side of the river, so that crops thereon were not only bounteous but practically certain, and in the western portion of the valley these waters were appropriated and used for surface irrigation, to supplant the scanty rainfall in that region. That by reason of these uses of the waters of the Arkansas river, and the almost unvarying water level beneath these bottom lands being near the surface, the lands in the Arkansas valley in the state of Kansas were of great and permanent value to the owners and settlers thereon, and those upon the tax rolls of the state of Kansas yielded a large and increasing revenue to the complainant for state purposes.\n'That after the lands in the Arkansas valley had been settled and raised to a high state of cultivation, all the bottom lands in the valley being riparian lands and directly affected by the presence and flow of the river, and after parts of the flow of the river had been used for manufacturing and milling purposes, and after the riparian lands had been largely and extensively irrigated in the valley of the river in the western portion of \n\n[206 U.S. 46, 52]\n\u00a0\n Kansas, and after portions of the land so belonging to the complainant had been sold and conveyed, the state of Colorado and other defendants began systematically appropriating and diverting the waters of the Arkansas river, in the state of Colorado, between Ca non City and the Kansas state line, for the purpose of irrigating dry, barren, arid, nonriparian, and nonsaturated lands lying on either side of the river, and often many miles therefrom and by the year 1891 all the natural and cormal waters and a large portion of the flood waters of the Arkansas river were so appropriated and diverted and actually applied to these dry, barren, arid, nonriparian, and nonsaturated lands in the state of Colorado, said diversions increasing from year to year, as their means of diversion became more complete and perfect, so the average flow of the river was greatly and permanently diminished and the normal flow of the river, exclusive of floods, was wholly and permanently destroyed, the navigability of the river where navigable before has been ruined, the power for manufacturing purposes greatly diminished, the surfact of the underflow beneath the bottom lands has been lowered about 5 feet, and the water for the irrigation ditches in the western part of Kansas has been entirely cut off. The loss sustained by the complainant and its citizens has been great and incalculable. The benefits of river navigation are gone; the cheap water power has been replaced by the costly steam power; the productiveness and value of the bottom lands have been greatly diminished; the irrigation ditches are left dry and the lands uncultivated; and the revenues of the state of Kansas and its municipalities have been materially decreased. Against this loss and injury the complainant prays the assistance of this court.'\n\n In the brief of counsel for Colorado it is said:\n'The contention of the defendant, state of Colorado, as to the facts, may be concisely stated as follows: The Arkansas river, popularly so called, is substantially two rivers,-one a perennial stream rising in the mountains of Colorado and flowing down to the plains, and this Colorado Arkansas, when the \n\n[206 U.S. 46, 53]\n\u00a0\n river was permitted to run as it was accustomed to run, prior to the period of irrigation, poured into the sands of western Kansas, and at times of low water the river as a stream entirely disappeared. Its waters were to some extent evaporated, and, as to the residue, were absorbed and swallowed up in the sands. So that from the vicinity of the state line between Kansas and Colorado on eastwardly, as far, at least, as Great Bend, if not farther, at such times of low water there was no flowing Arkansas river. Farther east, however, a new river arose, even at such times of low water, and partly from springs, partly from the drainage of the water table of the country supplied by rainfall, and partly from the surface drainage of an extensive territory, this river gradually again became a perennial stream, so that south of Wichita, and from there on to the mouth of the river the Kansas Arkansas, as a new and separate stream, had a constant flow. Such, as the river was accustomed to flow, was the Arkansas of the period prior to irrigation. It was a 'broken river.' It is true that at all times in early years, and now, the Arkansas river at times of flood, or of what might be called high water, has a continuous flow from its source to its mouth; but a flow, even in times of flood or high water, which diminishes through the sandy waste east of the Colorado state line above described, so that oftentimes even a flood in Colorado would be completely lost before it had passed over this arid stretch of sandy channel, and high water would always be diminished in flow through the same stretch of country. This river is as if it were a current of water passing over a sieve; if the current be slow and the volume not excessive all of it sinks through the sieve and none passes on beyond; when the current is rapid and the volume is large, still a large amount sinks in the sieve, and the residue passes on beyond.\n\n'Now, the irrigators of Colorado have confined their actions to the Colorado Arkansas above described. They have taken the waters of the perennial stream before it reaches this sieve, through which it wasted; they have lifted that stream out of \n\n[206 U.S. 46, 54]\n\u00a0\n the sandy channel in which it had flowed, and applied it to beneficial uses upon the land; carried the body of it along at a higher level than where it was accustomed to run, and they finally restore it, practically undiminished in volume, so far as regards practical use, at points in the ancient channel farther east than the river at low water was accustomed to flow before the period of irrigation. The effect of the diversion of this water in Colorado, the carrying of it forward on a higher level, the return of waters, partly through seepage and partly through direct delivery at waste gates, and the effect of this process in extending eastward the perennial flow, will be fully discussed in the course of the argument to follow. It is sufficient in this preliminary statement to say that it is admitted by the complainant that in the course of a twelvemonth there is a vast amount of high and flood waters of the Arkansas that are never captured by man, that are of no use, but are rather of injury to Kansas riparian proprietors, and, so far as any beneficial use is concerned, are absolutely wasted and lost. Kansas does not claim that she has not abundance of water in times of flood or in times of high water; her complaint is based upon the alleged fact that she does not have what she was accustomed to have in periods of low water, whereas, in fact, as contended by the state of Colorado, the diversion of water in Colorado into ditches and reservoirs, continuing, as it does, throughout the year, in times of flood and in times of high water, has the effect, through seepage and return waters, to give perennial vitality to portions of this stream during what would otherwise be periods of depression or suspension of flow.'\n\n The substance of the petition in intervention is thus stated by counsel for the government:\n'The first paragraph of the said petition describes the Arkansas river from its source to its mouth, and alleges that it is not navigable in the states of Colorado and Kansas nor the territory of Oklahoma, but is navigable in the state of Arkansas and the Indian territory.\n\n'In the second paragraph it is alleged that the lands located \n\n[206 U.S. 46, 55]\n\u00a0\n within the watershed of the river west of the 99th degree of longitude are arid lands.\n\n'The third paragraph alleges that within said watershed there are 1, 000,000 acres of public lands that are uninhabitable and unsalable.\n\n'The fourth paragraph alleges that said lands can only be made habitable, productive, and salable by impounding and storing flood and other waters in said watershed to the end that the said waters may be used to reclaim said land.\n\n'The fifth paragraph alleges that there is not sufficient moisture from rainfall to render the soil capable of producing crops in paying quantities in the watershed so described, and that they can only be made to produce crops by irrigation; that the common-law doctrine of riparian rights is not applicable to conditions in the arid region and has been abolished by statute and by usage and custom; that there has been established in its stead in said region a doctrine to the effect that the waters of natural streams and the flood and other waters may be impounded, appropriated, diverted, and used for the purpose of reclaiming and irrigating the arid land, therein, and that the prior appropriation of such waters for such purpose gives a prior and superior right to the water of the stream.\n\n'The sixth paragraph alleges that legislation of Congress, decisions of courts, and acts of the executive department have sanctioned and approved the use of water for irrigation purposes in the arid region, and that he who is prior in time is prior in right, and that it is recognized that the common-law doctrine of riparian rights is not applicable to the public land owned by the United States in the arid region.\n\n'The seventh paragraph alleges that, in accordance with and in reliance upon the doctrine of the use of water for irrigation purposes, the inhabitants of the arid portion of the United States have appropriated and used the waters of streams therein to reclaim and make productive and profitable about 10,000,000 acres of land, which now support a population of many millions, and that the inhabitants of Colorado and Kansas \n\n[206 U.S. 46, 56]\n\u00a0\n within the watershed of the Arkansas river have, by irrigation from said river, made productive and profitable about 200,000 acres of land, which provide homes for and support a population of many thousands.\n\n'The eighth paragraph alleges that the common-law doctrine of riparian rights is not applicable to riparian lands within the arid region, and that only by the use of waters of natural streams and flood waters for irrigation and other beneficial purposes can the lands in the arid region be made productive, and only by such use can additional areas be reclaimed and rendered productive and salable.\n\n'The ninth paragraph recites the passage of the so-called reclamation act of June 17, 1902. [32 Stat. at L. 388, chap. 1093, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1905, p. 349.]\n\n'The tenth paragraph alleges that about 60,000,000 acres of land belonging to the United States within the arid region can be reclaimed under the provisions of the socalled reclamation act.\n\n'The eleventh paragraph alleges that the amount of land that can be so reclaimed will support a population of many millions.\n\n'The twelfth paragraph alleges that, under the operation of the said reclamation act, 100,000 acres of public land can be reclaimed within the watershed of the Arkansas river west of the 99th degree west.\n\n'The thirteenth paragraph alleges that the lands, when so reclaimed, will support a population of not less that 50,000.\n\n'The fourteenth paragraph alleges that, under the operation of the so- called reclamation act, about $1,000,000 has been expended in exploring, procuring, and setting apart sites upon which reservoirs and dams contemplated by the act can be constructed and maintained; that contracts have been let for the construction of reservoirs which, when completed, will cost over two millions and will have a stronge capacity to reclaim 500,000 acres of arid land, which land when reclaimed will sustain a population of not less than 250,000; that plans are contemplated for the expenditure of $20,000,000 under \n\n[206 U.S. 46, 57]\n\u00a0\n said act, to irrigate about 1,000,000 acres of arid public lands.\n\n'The fifteenth paragraph recites that there are $16,000,000 available under the so-called reclamation act.\n\n'The sixteenth paragraph sets forth the contention of Kansas as seen in its amended bill of complaint, viz., that it is entitled to have the waters of the Arkansas river, which rises in Colorado, flow uninterrupted and unimpeded into Kansas.\n\n'The seventeenth paragraph sets forth the contention of Colorado in respect to its claim of ownership, viz., that under the provisions of its Constitution it is the owner of all waters within that state.\n\n'The eighteenth paragraph is as follows:\n\n\"That neither the contention of the state of Colorado nor the contention of the state of Kansas is correct; nor does either contention accord with the doctrine prevailing in the arid region in respect to the waters of natural streams and of flood and other waters. That either contention, if sustained, would defeat the object, intent, and purpose of the reclamation act, prevent the settlement and sale of the arid lands belonging to the United States, and especially those within the watershed of the Arkansas river west of the 99th degree west longitude, and would otherwise work great damage to the interests of the United States.\"\n\n Messrs.

C. Campbell for intervener, the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n While we said in overruling the demurrer that 'this court, speaking broadly, has jurisdiction,' we contemplated further consideration of both the fact and the extent of our jurisdiction, to be fully determined after the facts were presented. We therefore commence with this inquiry. And first, of our jurisdiction of the controversy between Kansas and Colorado.\n This suit involves no question of boundary or of the limits of territorial jurisdiction. Other and incorporeal rights are claimed by the respective litigants. Controversies between the states are becoming frequent, and, in the rapidly changing conditions of life and business, are likely to become still more so. Involving, as they do, the rights of political communities which in many respects are sovereign and independent, they present not infrequently questions of far-reaching import and of exceeding difficulty.\n It is well, therefore, to consider the foundations of our jurisdiction over controversies between states. It is no longer open to question that by the Constitution a nation was brought into being, and that that instrument was not merely operative to establish a closer union or league of states. Whatever powers of government were granted to the nation or reserved to the states (and for the description and limitation of those powers we must always accept the Constitution as alone and absolutely controlling), there was created a nation, to be known as the United States of America, and as such then assumed its place among the nations of the world.\n The first resolution passed by the convention that framed the Constitution, sitting as a committee of the whole, was 'Resolved, That it is the opinion of this committee that a national government ought to be established, consisting of a \n\n[206 U.S. 46, 81]\n\u00a0\n supreme legislative, judiciary, and executive.' 1 Elliot, Debates, p. 151.\n In M'Culloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 405, 4 L. ed. 579, 601, Chief Justice Marshall said:\n'The government of the Union, then (whatever may be the influence of this fact on the case), is, emphatically and truly, a government of the people. In form and in substance it emanates from them. Its powers are granted by them, and are to be exercised directly on them, and for their benefit.'\n\n See also Martin v. Hunter, 1 Wheat, 304, 324, 4 L. ed. 97, 102, opinion by Mr. Justice Story.\n In Scott v. Sandford, 19 How. 393, 441, 15 L. ed. 691, 715, Chief Justice Taney observed:\n'The new government was not a mere change in a dynasty, or in a form of government, leaving the nation or sovereignty the same, and clothed with all the rights, and bound by all the obligations, of the preceding one. But, when the present United States came into existence under the new government, it was a new political body, a new nation, then for the first time taking its place in the family of nations.'\n\n And in Miller on the Constitution of the United States, p. 83, referring to the adoption of the Constitution, that learned jurist said: 'It was then that a nation was born.'\n In the Constitution are provisions in separate articles for the three great departments of government,-legislative, executive, and judicial. But there is this significant difference in the grants of powers to these departments: The first article, treating of legislative powers, does not make a general grant of legislative power. It reads: 'Article 1,  1. All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress,' etc.; and then, in article 8, mentions and defines the legislative powers that are granted. By reason of the fact that there is no general grant of legislative power it has become an accepted constitutional rule that this is a government of enumerated powers. \n\n[206 U.S. 46, 82]\n\u00a0\n In M'Culloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 405, 4 L. ed. 601, Chief Justice Marshall said:\n'This government is acknowledged by all to be one of enumerated powers. The principal that it can exercise only the powers granted to it would seem too apparent to have required to be enforced by all those arguments which its enlightened friends, while it was depending before the people, found it necessary to urge. That principle is now universally admitted.'\n\n On the other hand, in article 3, which treats of the judicial department,-and this is important for our present consideration,-we find that  1 reads that 'the judicial power of the United States shall be vested in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.' By this is granted the entire judicial power of the nation. Section 2, which provides that 'the judicial power shall extend to all cases, in law and equity, arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United States,' etc., is not a limitation nor an enumeration. It is a definite declaration,-a provision that the judicial power shall extend to-that is, shall include-the several matters particularly mentioned, leaving unrestricted the general grant of the entire judicial power. There may be, of course, limitations on that grant of power, but, if there are any, they must be expressed; for otherwise the general grant would vest in the courts all the judicial power which the new nation was capable of exercising. Construing this article in the early case of Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419, 1 L. ed. 440, the court held that the judicial power of the Supreme Court extended to a suit brought against a state by a citizen of another state. In announcing his opinion in the case, Mr. Justice Wilson said (p. 453, L. ed. p. 454):\n'This question, important in itself, will depend on others more important still; and may, perhaps, be ultimately resolved into one no less redical than this,-Do the people of the United States form a nation?'\n\n In reference to this question attention may, however, properly be called to Hans v. Louisiana, \n134 U.S. 1\n, 33 L. ed. 842, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 504. \n\n[206 U.S. 46, 83]\n\u00a0\n The decision in Chisholm v. Georgia led to the adoption of the 11th Amendment to the Constitution, withdrawing from the judicial power of the United States every suit in law or equity commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by citizens of another state or citizens or subjects of a foreign state. This amendment refers only to suits and actions by individuals, leaving undisturbed the jurisdiction over suits or actions by one state against another. As said by Chief Justice Marshall in Cohen v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 407, 5 L. ed. 257, 291: 'The Amendment, therefore, extended to suits commenced or prosecuted by individuals, but not to those brought by states.' See also South Dakota v. North Carolina, \n192 U.S. 286\n, 48 L. ed. 448, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 269.\n Speaking generally, it may be observed that the judicial power of a nation extends to all controversies justiciable in their nature, and the parties to which or the property involved in which may be reached by judicial process, and, when the judicial power of the United States was vested in the Supreme and other courts, all the judicial power which the nation was capable of exercising was vested in those tribunals; and unless there be some limitations expressed in the Constitution it must be held to embrace all controversies of a justiciable nature arising within the territorial limits of the nation, no matter who may be the parties thereto. This general truth is not inconsistent with the decisions that no suit or action can be maintained against the nation in any of its courts without its consent, for they only recognize the obvious truth that a nation is not, without its consent, subject to the controlling action of any of its instrumentalities or agencies. The creature cannot rule the creator. Kawananakoa v. Polyblank, \n205 U.S. 349\n, 51 L. ed. 834, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 526. Nor is it inconsistent with the ruling in Wisconsin v. Pelican Ins. Co. \n127 U.S. 265\n, 32 L. ed. 239, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1370, that an original action cannot be maintained in this court by one state to enforce its penal laws against a citizen of another state. That was no denial of the jurisdiction of the court, but a decision upon the merits of the claim of the state.\n These considerations lead to the propositions that when a \n\n[206 U.S. 46, 84]\n\u00a0\n legislative power is claimed for the national government the question is whether that power is one of those granted by the Constitution, either in terms or by necessary implication; whereas, in respect to judicial functions, the question is whether there by any limitations expressed in the Constitution on the general grant of national power.\n We may also notice a matter in respect thereto referred to at length in Missouri v. Illinois, \n180 \nU.S. 208, 220\n, 45 S. L. ed. 497, 504, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 331, 336. The 9th article of the Articles of Confederation provided that 'the United States in Congress assembled shall also be the last resort on appeal in all disputes and differences now subsisting or that hereafter may arise between two or more states concerning boundary, jurisdiction, or any other cause whatever.' In the early drafts of the Constitution provision was made giving to the Supreme Court 'jurisdiction of controversies between two or more states, except such as shall regard territory or jurisdiction,' and also that the Senate should have exclusive power to regulate the manner of deciding the disputes and controversies between the states respecting jurisdiction or territory. As finally adopted, the Constitution omits all provisions for the Senate taking cognizance of disputes between the states, and leaves out the exception referred to in the jurisdiction granted to the Supreme Court. That carries with it a very direct recognition of the fact that to the Supreme Court is granted jurisdiction of all controversies between the states which are justiciable in their nature. 'All the states have transferred the decision of their controversies to this court; each had a right to demand of it the exercise of the power which they had made judicial by the Confederation of 1781 and 1788; that we should do that which neither states nor Congress could do,-settle the controversies between them.' Rhode Islands v. Massachusetts, 12 Pet. 657, 743, 9 L. ed. 1233, 1268\n\n\n Under the same general grant of judicial power jurisdiction over suits brought by the United States has been sustained. United States v. Texas, \n143 U.S. 621\n, 36 L. ed. 285, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 488, \n162 U.S. 1\n, 40 L. ed. 867, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 725; United States v. Michigan, \n190 U.S. 379\n, 47 L. ed. 1103, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 742. \n\n[206 U.S. 46, 85]\n\u00a0\n The exemption of the United States to suit in one of its own courts without its consent has been repeatedly recognized. Kansas v. United States, \n204 \nU.S. 231, 341\n, 51 S. L. ed. --, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 388, and cases cited.\n Turning now to the controversy as here presented, it is whether Kansas has a right to the continuous flow of the waters of the Arkansas river, as that flow existed before any human interference therewith, or Colorado the right to appropriate the waters of that stream so as to prevent that continuous flow, or that the amount of the flow is subject to the superior authority and supervisory control of the United States. While several of the defendant corporations have answered, it is unnecessary to specially consider their defenses, for, if the case against Colorado fails, it fails also as against them. Colorado denies that it is in any substantial manner diminishing the flow of the Arkansas river into Kansas. If that be true, then it is in no way infringing upon the rights of Kansas. If it is diminishing that flow, has it an absolute right to determine for itself the extent to which it will diminish it, even to the entire appropriation of the water? And if it has not that absolute right, is the amount of appropriation that it is now making such an infringment upon the rights of Kansas as to call for judicial interference? Is the question one solely between the states, or is the matter subject to national legislative regulation? and, if the latter, to what extent has that regulation been carried? Clearly this controversy is one of a justiciable nature. The right to the flow of a stream was one recognized at common law, for a trespass upon which a cause of action existed.\n The primary question is, of course, of national control. For, if the nation has the right to regulate the flow of the waters, we must inquire what it has done in the way of regulation. If it has done nothing the further question will then arise, What are the respective rights of the two states, in the absence of national regulation? Congress has, by virtue of the grant to it of power to regulate commerce 'among the several states,' extensive control over the highways, natural or artificial, upon which such commerce may be carried. It may prevent or remove \n\n[206 U.S. 46, 86]\n\u00a0\n obstructions in the natural water ways and preserve the navigability of those ways. In United States v. Rio Grande Dam & Irrig. Co. \n174 U.S. 690\n, 43 L. ed. 1136, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 770, in which was considered the validity of the appropriation of the water of a stream by virtue of local legislation, so far as such appropriation affected the navigability of the stream, we said (p. 703, L. ed. p. 1141, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 775):\n'Although this power of changing the common-law rule as to streams within its dominion undoubtedly belongs to each state, yet two limitations must be recognized: First, that in the absence of specific authority from Congress a state cannot, by its legislation, destroy the right of the United States, as the owner of lands bordering on a stream, to the continued flow of its waters; so far, at least, as may be necessary for the beneficial uses of the government property. Second, that it is limited by the superior power of the general government to secure the uninterrupted navigability of all navigable streams within the limits of the United States. In other words, the jurisdiction of the general government over interstate commerce and its natural highways vests in that government the right to take all needed measures to preserve the navigability of the navigable water courses of the country, even against any state action.'\n\n It follows from this that if, in the present case, the national government was asserting, as against either Kansas or Colorado, that the appropriation for the purposes of irrigation of the waters of the Arkansas was affecting the navigability of the stream, it would become our duty to determine the truth of the charge. But the government makes no such contention. On the contrary, it distinctly asserts that the Arkansas river is not now and never was practically navigable beyond Fort Gibson in the Indian territory, and nowhere claims that any appropriation propriation of the waters by Kansas or Colorado affects its navigability.\n It rests its petition of intervention upon its alleged duty of legislating for the reclamation of arid lands; alleges that in or near the Arkansas river, as it runs through Kansas and Colo- \n\n[206 U.S. 46, 87]\n\u00a0\n rado, are large tracts of those lands; that the national government is itself the owner of many thousands of acres; that it has the right to make such legislative provision as, in its judgment, is needful for the reclamation of all these arid lands, and, for that purpose, to appropriate the accessible waters.\n In support of the main proposition it is stated in the brief of its counsel:\n'That the doctrine of riparian rights is inapplicable to conditions prevailing in the arid region; that such doctrine, if applicable in said region, would prevent the sale, reclamation, and cultivation of the public arid lands, and defeat the policy of the government in respect thereto; that the doctrine which is applicable to conditions in said arid region, and which prevails therein, is that the waters of natural streams may be used to irrigate and cultivate arid lands, whether riparian or nonriparian, and that the priority of appropriation of such waters and the application of the same for beneficial purposes establishes a prior and superior right.'\n\n In other words, the determination of the rights of the two states inter sese in regard to the flow of waters in the Arkansas river is subordinate to a superior right on the part of the national government to control the whole system of the reclamation of arid lands. That involves the question whether the reclamation of arid lands is one of the powers granted to the general government. As heretofore stated, the constant declaration of this court from the beginning is that this government is one of enumerated powers. 'The government, then, of the United States, can claim no powers which are not granted to it by the Constitution, and the powers actually granted must be such as are expressly given or given by necessary implication.' Story, J., in Martin v. Hunter, 1 Wheat. 304, 326, 4 L. ed. 97, 102. 'The government of the United States is one of delegated, limited, and enumerated powers.' United States v. Harris, \n106 \nU.S. 629, 635\n, 27 S. L. ed. 290, 292, 1 Sup. Ct. Rep. 601, 606.\n Turning to the enumeration of the powers granted to Congress by the 8th section of the 1st article of the Constitu- \n\n[206 U.S. 46, 88]\n\u00a0\n tion, it is enough to say that no one of them, by any implication, refers to the reclamation of arid lands. The last paragraph of the section which authorizes Congress to make all laws which shall be necessary to proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof, is not the delegation of a new and independent power, but simply provision for making effective the powers theretofore mentioned. The construction of that paragraph was precisely stated by Chief Justice Marshall in these words [4 Wheat. 421, 4 L. ed. 605]: 'We think the sound construction of the Constitution must allow to the national legislature that discretion, with respect to the means by which the powers it confers are to be carried into execution, which will enable that body to perform the high duties assigned to it, in the manner most beneficial to the people. Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the Constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the Constitution, are constitutional,'-a statement which has become the settled rule of construction. From this and other declarations it is clear that the Constitution is not to be construed technically and narrowly, as an indictment, or even as a grant presumably against the interest of the grantor, and passing only that which is clearly included within its language, but as creating a system of government whose provisions are designed to make effective and operative all the governmental powers granted. Yet, while so construed, it still is true that no independent and unmentioned power passes to the national government or can rightfully be exercised by the Congress.\n We must look beyond  8 for congressional authority over arid lands, and it is said to be found in the second paragraph of  3 of article 4, reading: 'The Congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging \n\n[206 U.S. 46, 89]\n\u00a0\n to the United States; and nothing in this Constitution shall be so construed as to prejudice any claims of the United States, or of any particular state.'\n The full scope of this paragraph has never been definitely settled. Primarily, at least, it is a grant of power to the United States of control over its property. That is implied by the words 'territory or other property.' It is true it has been referred to in some decisions as granting political and legislative control over the territories as distinguished from the states of the Union. It is unnecessary in the present case to consider whether the language justifies this construction. Certainly we have no disposition to limit or qualify the expressions which have heretofore fallen from this court in respect thereto. But clearly it does not grant to Congress any legislative control over the states, and must, so far as they are concerned, be limited to authority over the property belonging to the United States within their limits. Appreciating the force of this, counsel for the government relies upon 'the doctrine of sovereign and inherent power;' adding, 'I am aware that in advancing this doctrine I seem to challenge great decisions of the court, and I speak with deference.' His argument runs substantially along this line: All legislative power must be vested in either the state or the national government; no legislative powers belong to a state government other than those which affect solely the internal affairs of that state; consequently all powers which are national in their scope must be found vested in the Congress of the United States. But the proposition that there are legislative powers affecting the nation as a whole which belong to, although not expressed in the grant of powers, is in direct conflict with the doctrine that this is a government of enumerated powers. That this is such a government clearly appears from the Constitution, independently of the Amendments, for otherwise there would be an instrument granting certain specified things made operative to grant other and distinct things. This natural construction of the original body of the Constitution is made absolutely certain \n\n[206 U.S. 46, 90]\n\u00a0\n by the 10th Amendment. This Amendment, which was seemingly adopted with prescience of just such contention as the present, disclosed the widespread fear that the national government might, under the pressure of a supposed general welfare, attempt to exercise powers which had not been granted. With equal determination the framers intended that no such assumption should ever find justification in the organic act, and that if, in the future, further powers seemed necessary, they should be granted by the people in the manner they had provided for amending that act. It reads: 'The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.' The argument of counsel ignores the principal factor in this article, to wit, 'the people.' Its principal purpose was not the distribution of power between the United States and the states, but a reservation to the people of all powers not granted. The preamble of the Constitution declares who framed it,-'we, the people of the United States,' not the people of one state, but the people of all the states; and article 10 reserves to the people of all the states the powers not delegated to the United States. The powers affecting the internal affairs of the states not granted to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, and all powers of a national character which are not delegated to the national government by the Constitution are reserved to the people of the United States. The people who adopted the Constitution knew that in the nature of things they could not foresee all the questions which might arise in the future, all the circumstances which might call for the exercise of further national powers than those granted to the United States, and, after making provision for an amendment to the Constitution by which any needed additional powers would be granted, they reserved to themselves all powers not so delegated. This article 10 is not to be shorn of its meaning by any narrow or technical construction, but is to be considered fairly and \n\n[206 U.S. 46, 91]\n\u00a0\n liberally so as to give effect to its scope and meaning. As we said, construing an express limitation on the powers of Congress, in Fairbank v. United States, \n181 \nU.S. 283, 288\n, 45 S. L. ed. 862, 865, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 648, 650:\n'We are not here confronted with a question of the extent of the powers of Congress, but one of the limitations imposed by the Constitution on its action, and it seems to us clear that the same rule and spirit of construction must also be recognized. If powers granted are to be taken as broadly granted and as carrying with them authority to pass those acts which may be reasonably necessary to carry them into full execution; in other words, if the Constitution in its grant of powers is to be so construed that Congress shall be able to carry into full effect the powers granted, it is equally imperative that, where prohibition or limitation is placed upon the power of Congress, that prohibition or limitation should be enforced in its spirit and to its entirety. It would be a strange rule of construction that language granting powers is to be liberally construed, and that language of restriction is to be narrowly and technically construed. Especially is this true when, in respect to grants of powers, there is, as heretofore noticed, the help found in the last clause of the 8th section, and no such helping clause in respect to prohibitions and limitations. The true spirit of constitutional interpretation in both directions is to give full, liberal construction to the language, aiming ever to show fidelity to the spirit and purpose.'\n\n This very matter of the reclamation of arid lands illustrates this: At the time of the adoption of the Constitution, within the known and conceded limits of the United States there were no large tracts of arid land, and nothing which called for any further action than that which might be taken by the legislature of the state in which any particular tract of such land was to be found; and the Constitution, therefore, makes no provision for a national control of the arid regions or their reclamation. But, as our national territory has been enlarged, we have within our borders extensive tracts of arid lands \n\n[206 U.S. 46, 92]\n\u00a0\n which ought to be reclaimed, and it may well be that no power is adequate for their reclamation other than that of the national government. But, if no such power has been granted, none can be exercised.\n It does not follow from this that the national government is entirely powerless in respect to this matter. These arid lands are largely within the territories, and over them, by virtue of the second paragraph of  3 of article 4, heretofore quoted, or by virtue of the power vested in the national government to acquire territory by treaties, Congress has full power of legislation, subject to no restrictions other than those expressly named in the Constitution, and, therefore, it may legislate in respect to all arid lands within their limits. As to those lands within the limits of the states, at least of the Western states, the national government is the most considerable owner and has power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting its property. We do not mean that its legislation can override state laws in respect to the general subject of reclamation. While arid lands are to be found mainly, if not only, in the Western and newer states, yet the powers of the national government within the limits of those states are the same (no greater and no less) than those within the limits of the original thirteen; and it would be strange if, in the absence of a definite grant of power, the national government could enter the territory of the states along the Atlantic and legislate in respect to improving, by irrigation or otherwise, the lands within their borders. Nor do we understand that hitherto Congress has acted in disregard to this limitation. As said by Mr. Justice White, delivering the opinion of the court in Gutierres v. Albuquerque Land & Irrig. Co. \n188 \nU.S. 545, 554\n, 47 S. L. ed. 588, 593, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 338, 341, after referring to previous legislation:\n'It may be observed that the purport of the previous acts is reflexively illustrated by the act of June 17, 1902 (32 Stat. at L. 388, chap. 1093, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1905, p. 349). That act appropriated the receipts from the sale and disposal of the public lands in certain states and territories \n\n[206 U.S. 46, 93]\n\u00a0\n to the construction of irrigation works for the reclamation of arid lands. the 8th section of the act is as follows:\n\n\"Sec. 8. That nothing in this act shall be construed as affecting or intending to affect or to in any way interfere with the laws of any state or territory relating to the control, appropriation, use, or distribution of water used in irrigation, or any vested right acquired thereunder, and the Secretary of the Interior, in carrying out the provisions of this act, shall proceed in conformity with such laws, and nothing herein shall in any way affect any right of any state, or of the Federal government, or of any landowner, appropriator, or user of water in, to, or from any interstate stream or the waters thereof: Provided, That the right to the use of the water acquired under the provisions of this act shall be appurtenant to the land irrigated, and beneficial use shall be the basis, the measure, and the limit of the right.\"\n\n But it is useless to pursue the inquiry further in this direction. It is enough for the purposes of this case that each state has full jurisdiction over the lands within its borders, including the beds of streams and other waters. Martin v.

Keokuk, supra, Mr. Justice Bradley said (p. 338, L. ed. p. 228):\n'And since this court, in the case of The Genesee Chief v. Fitzhugh, 12 How. 443, 13 L. ed. 1058, has declared that the Great Lakes and other navigable waters of the country, above as well as below the flow of the tide, are, in the strictest sense, entitled to the denomination of navigable waters, and amenable to the admiralty jurisdiction, there seems to be no sound reasons for adhering to the old rule as to the proprietorship of the beds and shores of such \n\n[206 U.S. 46, 94]\n\u00a0\n waters. It properly belongs to the states by their inherent sovereignty, and the United States has wisely abstained from extending (if it could extend) its survey and grants beyond the limits of high water.'\n\n In Hardin v. Jordan, supra, the same justice, after stating that the title to the shore and lands under water is in the state, added (pp. 381, 382, L. ed. p. 433, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 812):\n'Such title being in the state, the lands are subject to state regulation and control, under the condition, however, of not interfering with the regulations which may be made by Congress with regard to public navigation and commerce. . . . Sometimes large areas so reclaimed are occupied by cities, and are put to other public or private uses, state control and ownership therein being supreme, subject only to the paramount authority of Congress in making regulations of commerce, and in subjecting the lands to the necessities and uses of commerce. . . . This right of the states to regulate and control the shores of tide waters, and the land under them, is the same as that which is exercised by the Crown in England. In this country the same rule has been extended to our great navigable lakes, which are treated as inland seas; and also, in some of the states, to navigable rivers, as the Mississippi, the Missouri, the Ohio, and, in Pennsylvania, to all the permanent rivers of the state; but it depends on the law of each state to what waters and to what extent this prerogative of the state over the lands under water shall be exercised.'\n\n It may determine for itself whether the common-law rule in respect to riparian rights or that doctrine which obtains in the arid regions of the West of the appropriation of waters for the purposes of irrigation shall control. Congress cannot enforce either rule upon any state. It is undoubtedly true that the early settlers brought to this country the common law of England, and that that common law throws light on the meaning and scope of the Constitution of the United States, and is also in many states expressly recognized as of controlling force in the absence of express statute. As said by Mr. \n\n[206 U.S. 46, 95]\n\u00a0\n Justice Gray in United States v. Wong Kim Ark, \n169 \nU.S. 649, 654\n, 42 S. L. ed. 890, 893, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 456, 459:\n'In this, as in other respects, it must be interpreted in the light of the common law, the principles and history of which were familiarly known to the framers of the Constitution. Minor v. Happersett, 21 Wall. 162, 22 L. ed. 627; Ex parte Wilson, \n114 \nU.S. 417, 422\n, 29 S. L. ed. 89, 91, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 935; Boyd v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 616, 624\n, 625 S., 29 L. ed. 746, 748, 749, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 524; Smith v. Alabama, \n124 U.S. 465\n, 31 L. ed. 508, 1 Inters. Com. Rep. 804, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 564. The language of the Constitution, as has been well said, could not be understood without reference to the common law. 1 Kent, Com. 336; Bradley, J., in Moore v. United States, \n91 \nU.S. 270, 274\n, 23 S. L. ed. 346, 347.'\n\n In the argument on the demurrer counsel for plaintiff endeavored to show that Congress had expressly imposed the common law on all this territory prior to its formation into states. See also the opinion of the Supreme Court of Kansas in Clark v. Allaman, 71 Kan. 206, 70 L.R.A. 971, 80 Pac. 571. But when the states of Kansas and Colorado were admitted into the Union they were admitted with the full powers of local sovereignty which belonged to other states (Pollard v. Hagan and Shively v. Bowlby, supra; Hardin v. Shedd, \n190 \nU.S. 508, 519\n, 47 S. L. ed. 1156, 1157, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 685), and Colorado, by its legislation, has recognized the right of appropriating the flowing waters to the purposes of irrigation. Now the question arises between two states, one recognizing generally the common- law rule of riparian rights and the other prescribing the doctrine of the public ownership of flowing water. Neither state can legislate for, or impose its own policy upon the other. A stream flows through the two and a controversy is presented as to the flow of that stream. It does not follow, however, that because Congress cannot determine the rule which shall control between the two states, or because neither state can enforce its own policy upon the other, that the controversy ceases to be one of a justiciable nature, or that there is no power which can take cognizance of the controversy and determine the relative rights of the two states. Indeed, the disagreement, coupled with its effect upon a stream passing through the two states, makes a matter for investigation and \n\n[206 U.S. 46, 96]\n\u00a0\n determination by this court. It has been said that there is no common law of the United States as distinguished from the common law of the several states. This contention was made in Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Call Pub. Co. \n181 U.S. 92\n, 45 L. ed. 765, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 561, in which it was asserted that, as Congress, having sole jurisdiction over interstate commerce, had prescribed no rates for interstate telegraphic communications, there was no limit on the power of a telegraph company in respect thereto. After referring to the general contention, we paid (pp. 101, 102, L. ed. pp. 770, 771, Sup. Ct. Rep. pp. 564, 565):\n'Properly understood, no exceptions can be taken to declarations of this kind. There is no body of Federal common law separate and distinct from the common law existing in the several states in the sense that there is a body of statute law enacted by Congress separate and distinct from the body of statute law enacted by the several states. But it is an entirely different thing to hold that there is no common law in force generally throughout the United States, and that the countless multitude of interestate commercial transactions are subject to no rules and durdened by no restrictions other than those expressed in the statutes of Congress. . . . Can it be that the great multitude of interstate commercial transactions are freed from the burdens created by the common law, as so defined, and are subject to no rule except that to be found in the statutes of Congress? We are clearly of opinion that this cannot be so, and that the principles of the common law are operative upon all interstate commercial transactions, except so far as they are modified by congressional enactment.'\n\n What is the common law? Kent says (vol. 1, p. 471):\n'The common law includes those principles, usages, and rules of action applicable to the government and security of persons and property, which do not rest for their authority upon any express and positive declaration of the will of the legislature.'\n\n As it does not rest on any statute or other written declaration of the sovereign, there must, as to each principle thereof, be a first statement. Those statements are found in the deci- \n\n[206 U.S. 46, 97]\n\u00a0\n sions of courts, and the first statement presents the principle as certainly as the last. Multiplication of declarations merely adds certainty. For after all, the common law is but the accumulated expressions of the various judicial tribunals in their efforts to ascertain what is right and just between individuals in respect to private disputes. As Congress cannot make compacts between the states, as it cannot, in respect to certain matters, by legislation compel their separate action, disputes between them must be settled either by force or else by appeal to tribunals empowered to determine the right and wrong thereof. Force, under our system of government, is eliminated. The clear language of the Constitution vests in this court the power to settle those disputes. We have exercised that power in a variety of instances, determining in the several instances the justice of the dispute. Nor is our jurisdiction ousted, even if, because Kansas and Colorado are states sovereign and independent in local matters, the relations between them depend in any respect upon principles of international law. International law is no alien in this tribunal. In The Paquete Habana, \n175 \nU.S. 677, 700\n, 44 S. L. ed. 320, 328, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 290, 299, Mr. Justice Gray declared:\n'International law is part of our law, and must be ascertained and administered by the courts of justice of appropriate jurisdiction as often as questions of right depending upon it are duly presented for their determination.'\n\n And in delivering the opinion in the demurrer in this case Chief Justice Fuller said (p. 146, L. ed. p. 846, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 560):\n'Sitting, as it were, as an international, as well as a domestic, tribunal, we apply Federal law, state law, and international law, as the exigencies of the particular case may demand.'\n\n One cardinal rule, underlying all the relations of the states to each other, is that of equality of right. Each state stands on the same level with all the rest. It can impose its own legislation on no one of the others, and is bound to yield its own views to none. Yet, whenever, as in the case of Missouri v. Illinois, supra, the action of one state reaches, through the agency of natural laws, into the territory of another state, \n\n[206 U.S. 46, 98]\n\u00a0\n the question of the extent and the limitations of the rights of the two states becomes a matter of justiciable dispute between them, and this court is called upon to settle that dispute in such a way as will recognize the equal rights of both and at the same time establish justice between them. In other words, through these successive disputes and decisions this court is practically building up what may not improperly be called interstate common law. This very case presents a significant illustration. Before either Kansas or Colorado was settled the Arkansas river was a stream running through the territory which now composes these two states. Arid lands abound in Colorado. Reclamation is possible only by the application of water, and the extreme contention of Colorado is that it has a right to appropriate all the waters of this stream for the purposes of irrigating its soil and making more valuable its own territory. But the appropriation of the entire flow of the river would naturally tend to make the lands along the stream in Kansas less arable. It would be taking from the adjacent territory that which had been the customary natural means of preserving its arable character. On the other hand, the possible contention of Kansas, that the flowing water in the Arkansas must, in accordance with the extreme doctrine of the common law of England, be left to flow as it was wont to flow, no portion of it being appropriated in Colorado for the purposes of irrigation, would have the effect to perpetuate a desert condition in portions of Colorado beyond the power of reclamation. Surely here is a dispute of a justiciable nature which might and ought to be tried and determined. If the two states were absolutely independent nations it would be settled by treaty or by force. Neither of these ways being practicable, it must be settled by decision of this court.\n It will be perceived that Kansas asserts a pecuniary interest as the owner of certain tracts along the banks of the Arkansas and as the owner of the bed of the stream. We need not stop to consider what right such private ownership of property might give. \n\n[206 U.S. 46, 99]\n\u00a0\n In deciding this case on demurrer we said, referring to the opinion in Missouri v. Illinois (p. 142, L. ed. p. 844, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 558):\n'As will be perceived, the court there ruled that the mere fact that a state had no pecuniary interest in the controversy would not defeat the original jurisdiction of this court, which might be invoked by the state as parens patrice, trustee, guardian, or representative of all or a considerable portion of its citizens; and that the threatened pollution of the waters of a river flowing between states, under the authority of one of them, thereby putting the health and comfort of the citizens of the other in jeopardy, presented a cause of action justiciable under the Constitution.\n\n'In the case before us, the state of Kansas files her bill as representing and on behalf of the citizens, as well as in vindication of her alleged rights as an individual owner, and seeks relief in respect of being deprived of the waters of the river accustomed to flow through and across the state, and the consequent destruction of the property of herself and of her citizens and injury to their health and comfort. The action complained of is state action, and not the action of state officers in abuse or excess of their powers.'\n\n It is the state of Kansas which invokes the action of this court, charging that, through the action of Colorado, a large portion of its territory is threatened with disaster. In this respect it is in no manner evading the provisions of the 11th Amendment to the Federal Constitution. It is not acting directly and solely for the benefit of any individual citizen to protect his riparian rights. Beyond its property rights it has an interest as a state in this large tract of land bordering on the Arkansas river. Its prosperity affects the general welfare of the state. The controversy rises, therefore, above a mere question of local private right and involves a matter of state interest, and must be considered from that standpoint. Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Co. \n206 U.S. 230\n, 51 L. ed. 1038, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 618.\n This changes in some respects the scope of our inquiry. It is not limited to the simple matter of whether any portion of the \n\n[206 U.S. 46, 100]\n\u00a0\n waters of the Arkansas is withheld by Colorado. We must consider the effect of what has been done upon the conditions in the respective states, and so adjust the dispute upon the basis of equality of rights as to secure as far as possible to Colorado the benefits of irrigation without depriving Kansas of the like beneficial effects of a flowing stream. A little reflection will make this clear. Suppose the controversy was between two individuals, upper and lower riparian owners on a little stream with rocky bank and rocky bottom. The question properly might be limited to the single one of the diminution of the flow by the upper riparian proprietor. The lower riparian proprietor might insist that he was entitled to the full, undiminished, and unpolluted flow of the water of the stream as it had been wont to run. It would not be a defense on the part of the upper riparian proprietor that, by the use to which he had appropriated the water, he had benefited the lower proprietor, or that the latter had received in any other respects an equivalent. The question would be one of legal right, narrowed to place, amount of flow, and freedom from pollution.\n We do not intimate that entirely different considerations obtain in a controversy between two states. Colorado could not be upheld in appropriating the entire flow of the Arkansas river, on the ground that it is willing to give, and does give, to Kansas, something else which may be considered of equal value. That would be equivalent to this court's making a contract between the two states, and that it is not authorized to do. But we are justified in looking at the question not narrowly and solely as to the amount of the flow in the channel of the Arkansas river, inquiring merely whether any portion thereof is appropriated by Colorado, but we may properly consider what, in case a portion of that flow is appropriated by Colorado, are the effects of such appropriation upon Kansas territory. For instance, if there be many thousands of acres in Colorado destitute of vegetation, which, by the taking of water from the Arkansas river, and in no other way, can be \n\n[206 U.S. 46, 101]\n\u00a0\n made valuable as arable lands producing an abundance of vegetable growth, and this transformation of desert land has the effect, through percolation of water in the soil, or in any other way, of giving to Kansas territory, although not in the Arkansas valley, a benefit from water as great as that which would inure from keeping the flow of the Arkansas in its channel undiminished, then we may rightfully regard the usefulness to Colorado as justifying its action, although the locality of the benefit from the flow of the Arkansas through Kansas has territorially changed. Science may not as yet be able to give positive information as to the processes by which the distribution of water over certain territory has operation beyond the mere limits of the area in which the water is distributed, but they who have dwelt in the West know that there are constant changes in the productiveness of different portions of the territory, owing, apparently, to a wider and more constant distribution of water. To illustrate, the early settlers of Kansas territory found that farming was unsuccessful unless confined to its eastern 100 or 120 miles. West of that crops were almost always a failure; but now that region is the home of a large population, with crops as certain as those elsewhere, and yet this change has not been brought about by irrigation. A common belief is that the original sod was largely impervious to water; that when the spring rains came the water, instead of sinking into the ground, filled the water courses to overflowing and ran off to the Gulf of Mexico. There was no water in the soil to go up in vapor and come down in showers, and the constant heat of summer destroyed the crops; but after the sod had once been turned the water from those rains largely sank into the ground, and then, as the summer came on, went up in vapor and came down in showers, and so, by continued watering, prevented the burning up of the growing crops. We do not mean to say that science has demonstrated this to be the operating cause, or that other theories are not propounded, but the fact is that, instead of stopping at a distance of 120 miles from the Missouri river, the area of cultivated and \n\n[206 U.S. 46, 102]\n\u00a0\n profitably cultivated land has extended from 150 to 200 miles further west, and seems to be steadily moving towards the western boundary of the state. Now, if there is this change gradually moving westward from the Missouri river, is it altogether an unreasonable expectation that, as the arid lands of Colorado are irrigated and become from year to year covered with vegetation, there will move eastward from Colorado an extension of the area of arable lands until, between the Missouri river and the mountains of Colorado, there shall be no land which is not as fully subject to cultivation as lands elsewhere in the country? Will not the productiveness of Kansas as a whole, its capacity to support an increasing population, be increased by the use of the water in Colorado for irrigation? May we not consider some appropriation by Colorado of the waters of the Arkansas to the irrigation and reclamation of its arid lands as a reasonable exercise of its sovereignty, and as not unreasonably trespassing upon any rights of Kansas? And here we must notice the local law of Kansas as declared by its supreme court, premising that the views expressed in this opinion are to be confined to a case in which the facts and the local law of the two states are as here disclosed. In Clark v. Allaman, 71 Kan. 206, 70 L.R.A. 971, 80 Pac. 571, is an exhaustive discussion of the question, Mr. Justice Burch delivering the unanimous opinion of the court. In the syllabus, which by statute (Kan. Comp. Laws,  14, p. 317) is prepared by the justice writing the opinion, and states the law of the case, are these paragraphs:\n'The use of the water of a running stream for irrigation, after its primary uses for quenching thirst and other domestic requirements have been subserved, is one of the common-law rights of a riparian proprietor.\n\n'The use of water by a riparian proprietor for irrigation purposes must be reasonable under all the circumstances, and the right must be exercised with due regard to the equal right of every other riparian owner along the course of the stream.\n\n'A diminution of the flow of water over riparian land, caused \n\n[206 U.S. 46, 103]\n\u00a0\n by its use for irrigation purposes by upper riparian proprietors, occasions no injury for which damages may be allowed unless it results in subtracting from the value of the land by interfering with the reasonable uses of the water which the landowner is able to enjoy.\n\n'In determining the quantity of land tributary to and lying along a stream which a single proprietor may irrigate, the principle of equality of right with others should control, irrespective of the accidental matter of governmental subdivisions of the land.'\n\n And in the opinion, on pages 242, 243, L.R.A. pp. 986, 987, Pac. p. 584, are quoted these observations of Chief Justice Shaw in the case of Elliot v. Fitchburg R. Co. 10 Cush. 191, 193, 196, 57 Am. Dec. 85, 87, 88:\n'The right to flowing water is now well settled to be a right incident to property in the land; it is a right publici juris, of such character that, whilst it is common and equal to all through whose land it runs, and no one can obstruct or divert it, yet, as one of the beneficial gifts of Providence, each proprietor has a right to a just and reasonable use of it, as it passes through his land; and so long as it is not wholly obstructed or diverted, or no larger appropriation of the water running through it is made than a just and reasonable use, it cannot be said to be wrongful or injurious to a proprietor lower down. What is such a just and reasonable use may often be a difficult question, depending on various circumstances. To take a quantity of water from a large running stream for agriculture or manufacturing purposes would cause no sensible or practicable diminution of the benefit, to the prejudice of a lower proprietor; whereas, taking the same quantity from a small running brook, passing through many farms, would be of great and manifest injury to those below, who need it for domestic supply or watering cattle; and therefore it would be an unreasonable use of the water, and an action would lie in the latter case, and not in the former. It is, therefore, to a considerable extent a question of degree; still, the rule is the same, that each proprietor has a right to a reasonable use of it, for \n\n[206 U.S. 46, 104]\n\u00a0\n his own benefit, for domestic use, and for manufacturing and agricultural purposes. . . .\n\n'That a portion of the water of a stream may be used for the purpose of irrigating land, we think is well established as one of the rights of the proprietors of the soil along or through which it passes. Yet a proprietor cannot, under color of that right, or for the actual purpose of irrigating his own land, wholly abstract or divert the water course, or take such an unreasonable quantity of water, or make such unreasonable use of it, as to deprive other proprietors of the substantial benefits which they might derive from it, if not diverted or used unreasonably. . . .\n\n'This rule, that no riparian proprietor can wholly abstract or divert a water course, by which it would cease to be a running stream, or use it unreasonably in its passage, and thereby deprive a lower proprietor of a quality of his property deemed in law incidental and beneficial, necessarily flows from the principle that the right to the reasonable and beneficial use of a running stream is common to all the riparian proprietors, and so each is bound so to use his common right as not essentially to prevent or interfere with an equally beneficial enjoyment of the common right by all the proprietors. . . .\n\n'The right to the use of flowing water is publici juris, and common to all the riparian proprietors; it is not an absolute and exclusive right to all the water flowing past their land, so that any obstruction would give a cause of action; but it is a right to the flow and enjoyment of the water, subject to a similar right in all the proprietors, to the reasonable enjoyment of the same gift of Providence. It is, therefore, only for an abstraction and deprivation of this common benefit, or for an unreasonable and unauthorized use of it, that an action will lie.'\n\n As Kansas thus recognizes the right of appropriating the waters of a stream for the purposes of irrigation, subject to the condition of an equitable division between the riparian proprietors, she cannot complain if the same rule is administered \n\n[206 U.S. 46, 105]\n\u00a0\n between herself and a sister state. And this is especially true when the waters are, except for domestic purposes, practically useful only for purposes of irrigation. The Arkansas river, from its source to the eastern end of the Royal gorge, is a mountain torrent, coming down between rocy banks and over a rocky bed. Along this distance it is of comparatively little use for irrigation purposes. After it debouches from the Royal gorge it enters a valley, in which it wanders from one side to the other through eastern Colorado, southwestern Kansas, and into Oklahoma, with but a slight descent, and presenting but little opportunities for the development of water power through falls or by dams. Its length in Kansas is about 350 miles, and the descent is only 2,320 feet, or less than 7 feet to a mile. There are substantially no falls, no narrow passageways in which dams can be readily constructed for the development of water power; and while there are some in eastern Colorado, yet they are of little elevation, and mainly to assist in the storing of water for purposes of irrigation. So that, if the extreme rule of the common law were enforced, Oklahoma, having the same right to insist that there should be no diversion of the stream in Kansas for the purposes of irrigation that Kansas has in respect to Colorado, the result would be that the waters, except for the meager amount required for domestic purposes, would flow through eastern Colorado and Kansas of comparatively little advantage to either state, and both would lose the great benefit which comes from the use of the water for irrigation. The drainage area of the Arkansas river in Colorado is 26,000 suqare miles; in Kansas, 20,000 square miles; and all this area, unless the stream can be used for purposes of irrigation, would be left to the slow development which comes from the cultivation of the soil.\n The testimony in this case is voluminous, amounting to 8,559 typewritten pages, with 122 exhibits, and it would be impossible to make a full statement of facts without an extravagant extension of this opinion, which is already too long; \n\n[206 U.S. 46, 106]\n\u00a0\n and yet some facts must be stated to indicate the basis for the conclusion to which we have come. It must also be noted that, as might be expected in such a volume of testimony, coming as it does from three hundred and forty- seven witnesses, there is no little contradiction and a good deal of confusion, and this contradiction is to be found, not merely in the testimony of witnesses, but also in the exhibits, among which are reports from the officials of the government and the two states. We have endeavored to deduce from this volume those matters which seem most clearly proved, and must, as to other matters, be content to generalize and state that which seems to be the tendency of the evidence.\n Colorado is divided into five irrigating divisions, each of which is in charge of a division engineer. That which includes the drainage area of the Arkansas is District No. 2, divided into eleven districts. Under the laws of Colorado, irrigating ditches have been established in this district and the amount of water which each may take from the river decreed. In addition some reservoirs have been built for storing the surplus waters which come down in times of flood, and this adds largely to the amount available for irrigation. The storage capacity of six of these reservoirs is shown to be 8,527,673,652 cubic feet. The significance and value of these reservoirs can be appreciated when we remember that the Arkansas, like many other streams, has its origin in the mountain districts of Colorado, and that, by the melting of the snows, almost every year there is a flood. The amount of water authorized to be taken by the ditches from the river is, as alleged in the bill, 4,200 cubic feet, and from its affluents and tributaries 4,300 feet. (Whenever this term is used in reference to the flow of water it means the number of cubic feet that pass in a second.) The average flow of the river as it comes out of the Royal gorge at Ca non City is, as shown by official measurements for a series of years, 750 cubic feet. So that it appears that the irrigating ditches are authorized to take from the Arkansas river much more water than passes in the channel into the valley. It is not clear \n\n[206 U.S. 46, 107]\n\u00a0\n what surplus water, if any, comes out of the tributaries. There are some twenty-five of them, the average flow from four of which into the Arkansas is 313 cubic feet. Aside from this surplus water some may be returned through overflow of the ditches or from seepage. What either of these amounts may be is not disclosed. Indeed, the extent to which seepage operates in adding to the flow of a stream, or in distributing water through lands adjacent to those upon which water is poured, is something proof of which must necessarily be almost impossible. We may note the fact that a tract bordering upon land which has been flooded shows by its increasing vegetation that it has received in some way the benefit of water, and yet the amount of water passing by seepage may never be definitely known. The underground movement of water will always be a problem of uncertainty. We know that when water is turned upon dry and barren soil the barrenness disappears, vegetation is developed, and that which was a desert becomes a garden. It is the magic of transformation; the wilderness budding and blossoming as the rose. The writer of this opinion recalls a conversation with Bayard Taylor, the celebrated traveler, in which the latter stated that nothing had contributed so much to secure the steady control of the French in Algiers as the fact that, after taking possession of that territory, they sank artesian wells on the borders of the desert, and thus reclaimed portions of it; for the Arabs believed that people who could reclaim the desert were possessed of a power that could not be withstood.\n Further, adjacent barren ground is slowly but surely affected, and itself begins to increase its vegetation. We may not be entirely sure as to the methods by which this change is accomplished, although the result is undoubted. It may be that water percolating under the surface has reached this adjacent ground. Perhaps the vegetation, which we know attracts moisture from the air, may increase the rainfall, and thus affect the adjacent barren regions.\n It appears that prior to 1885 there was comparatively little \n\n[206 U.S. 46, 108]\n\u00a0\n water taken from the Arkansas for irrigation purposes,-certainly not enough to make any perceptible impression on the flow of the river,-but about that time certain corporations commenced the work of irrigation on a large scale, with ditches some of which might well be called canals. Thus, in 1884, work was commenced on ditches capable of carrying off 450 cubic feet; in 1887 others capable of carrying off 1,481 cubic feet; and in 1890 still others, carrying 1,705 cubic feet. Most of these were completed within two years after the commencement of the several works. By the year 1902, according to the report of the Census Bureau of the United States, there were 300,115 acres, in 4,557 farms, actually irrigated.\n The counties in Colorado from Ca non City eastward through which the Arkansas runs are Fremont, Pueblo, Otero, Bent, and Prowers. The following tables prepared by the defendants from various census reports show the population, unmber of acres cultivated, and total value of farm products in these several counties for the years 1880, 1890, and 1900:\n\n[]\n Population.

Whatever has been effective in bringing about this development is certainly entitled to recognition, and should not be wantonly or unnecessarily destroyed or interfered with. That this development is largely owing to irrigation is something of which, from a consideration of the testimony, there can be no reasonable doubt. It has been a prime factor in securing this result, and before, at the instance of a sister state, this effective cause of Colorado's development is destroyed or materially interfered with, it should be clear that such sister state has not merely some technical right, but also a right with a corresponding benefit.\n It may be asked why cultivation in Colorado without irrigation may not have the same effect that has attended the cultivation in Kansas west of where it was productive when the territory was first settled. It may possibly have such effect to some degree, but it must be remembered that the land in Colorado is many hundred feet in elevation above that in Kansas; that large portions of it are absolutely destitute of sod, and that cultivation would have comparatively little effect upon the retention of water. Add further the fact that the rainfall in Colorado is less than that in Kansas, and it would seem almost certain that reliance upon mere cultivation of the soil would not have anything like the effect in Colo- \n\n[206 U.S. 46, 110]\n\u00a0\n rado that it has had in Kansas, and that the barrenness which characterized portions of the territory of Colorado would have continued for an indefinite time unless relived by irrigation.\n Turning to Kansas, the counties along the Arkansas river, commencing from the Colorado line, are: Hamilton, Kearney, Finney, Gray, Ford, Edwards, Pawnee, Barton, Rice, Reno, Sedgwick, Sumner, Cowley.

As the withdrawal of water in Colorado for irrigating purposes became substantially effective about the year 1890, it might, if nothing else appeared, not unreasonably be concluded that the diminished flow of the river in Kansas, caused by the action of Colorado, had resulted in making the land more unproductive, and hence induced settlers to leave the state. As against this it should be noted, as a matter of history, that in the years preceding 1890, Kansas passed through a period of depression, with crops largely a failure in different parts of the state. But, more than that, in 1889 Oklahoma, lying directly south of Kansas, was opened for settlement and immediately there was a large immigration into that territory, coming from all parts of the West, and especially from the state of Kansas, induced by glowing reports of its great possibilities. The population of Oklahoma, \n\n[206 U.S. 46, 113]\n\u00a0\n as shown by the United States census, was, in 1890, 61,834, and in 1900, 348,331.\n Turning to the tables of the corn and wheat products, they do not disclose any marked injury which can be attributed to a diminution of the flow of the river. While there is a variance in the amount produced in the different counties from year to year, it is a variance no more than that which will be found in other parts of the Union, and although the population from 1890 to 1900 in fact diminished, the amount of both the corn and wheat product largely increased. Not only was the total product increased, but the productiveness pr acre seems to have been materially improved. Take the corn crop, and per acre, it was, in 1890, 12 bushels and a fraction; in 1895, 21 and a fraction; in 1900, 15; and in 1904, 28 bushels. Of wheat, the product per acre in 1890 was nearly 15 bushels; in 1895 it was only about 3 bushels. (For some reason, while that was a good year for corn, it seems to have been a bad year for wheat.) But in 1900 the product per acre rose to 19 bushels, and in 1904 it was 12 bushels.\n These are official figures taken from the United States census reports, and they tend strongly to show that the withdrawal of the water in Colorado for purposes of irrigation has not proved a source of serious detriment to the Kansas counties along the Arkansas river. It is not strange that the western counties show the least development, for, being nearest the irrigation in Colorado, they would be most affected thereby. At one time there were some irrigating ditches in these western counties, which promised to be valuable in supplying water, and thus increasing the productiveness of the lands in the vicinity of the stream, and it is true that those ditches have ceased to be of much value, the flow in them having largely diminished.\n It cannot be denied, in view of all the testimony (for that which we have quoted is but a sample of much more bearing upon the question), that the diminution of the flow of water in the river by the irrigation of Colorado has worked some \n\n[206 U.S. 46, 114]\n\u00a0\n detriment to the southwestern part of Kansas, and yet, when we compare the amount of this detriment with the great benefit which has obviously resulted to the counties in Colorado, it would seem that equality of right and equity between the two states forbids any interference with the present withdrawal of water in Colorado for purposes of irrigation.\n Many other matters have been presented and discussed. We have examined and fully considered them, but, as heretofore stated, we shall have to content ourselves with merely general observations respecting them. Evidence has been offered of an alleged underflow of the river as it passes through the state of Kansas, and it seems to be the contention on the part of Kansas that beneath the surface there is, as it were, a second river, with the same course as that on the surface, but with a distinct and continuous flow as of a separate stream. We are of the opinion that the testimony does not warrant the finding of such second and subterranean stream. If the bed of a stream is not solid rock, but earth, through which water will percolate, and, as alleged in plaintiff's bill, the 'valley of the river in the state of Kansas is composed of sand covered with alluvial soil,' undoubtedly water will be found many feet below the surface, and the lighter the soil the more easily will it find its way downward and the more water will be discoverable by wells or other modes of exploring the subsurface. Undoubtedly, too, in many cases there may be, corresponding to the flow on the surface, a current beneath the surface; but the presence of such subsurface water, even though in places of considerable amount and running in the same direction, is something very different from an independent subsurface river flowing continuously from the Colorado line through the state of Kansas. It is not properly denominated a second and subsurface stream. It is rather to be regarded as merely the accumulation of water which will always be found beneath the bed of any stream whose bottom is not solid rock. Naturally, the more abundant the flow of the surface stream and the wider its channel the more of this subsurface water there will be. If \n\n[206 U.S. 46, 115]\n\u00a0\n the entire volume of water passing down the surface was taken away the subsurface water would gradually disappear, and in that way the amount of the flow in the surface channel coming from Colorado into Kansas may affect the amount of water beneath the subsurface. As subsurface water it percolates on either side as well as moves along the course of the river, and the more abundant the subsurface wate t he further it will reach in its percolations on either side as well as more distinct will be its movement down the course of the stream. The testimony, therefore, given in reference to this subsurface water, its amount and its flow, bears only upon the question of the diminution of the flow from Colorado into Kansas caused by the appropriation in the former state of the waters for the purposes of irrigation.\n Equally untenable is the contention of Colorado that there are really two rivers, one commencing in the mountains of Colorado and terminating at or near the state line, and the other commencing at or near the place where the former ends, and, from springs and branches, starting a new stream to flow onward through Kansas and Oklahoma towards the Gulf of Mexico. From time immemorial the existence of a single continuous river has been recognized by geographers, explorers, and travelers. That there is a great variance in the amount of water flowing down the channel at different seasons of the year and in different years is undoubted; that at times the entire bed of the channel has been in places dry is evident from the testimony. In that way it may be called a broken river. But this is a fact common to all streams having their origin in a mountainous region, and whose volume is largely affected by the melting of the mountain snows. Thus, from one of complainant's exhibits furnished by the United States Geological Survey, the mean monthly flow at Ca non City at the mouth of the Royal gorge for the years 1890, 1895, and 1900 is as follows: \n\n[206 U.S. 46, 116]\n\u00a0\n\n Arkansas River-Canon City. Mean Monthly Discharge in Second Feet []\n 1890 1895 1900 [] January 310 344 a 345 February 363 361 a 353 March 320 471 a 439 April 477 868 736 May 2,090 1,506 2,251 June 2,611 1,900 3,492 July 1,571 1,413 891 August 670 1,095 273 September 519 635 211 October 531 505 241 November 522 499 266 December 502 444 298 []\n a Approximate.\n Doubtless the variance at different seasons of the year is more regular and more pronounced than in those streams whose sources are only slightly elevated and the rise and fall of whose waters is mainly owing to rains. Contrasting, for instance, the Hudson with the Missouri, illustrates this. When the June flood comes down the Missouri river it is a mighty torrent. One can stand on the bluffs at Kansas City and see an enormous volume of water, extending in width from 2 to 5 miles to the bluffs on the other side of the river, flowing onward with tremendous velocity and force; and yet at other times the entire flow of the Missouri river passes between two piers of the railroad bridge across the river at that point. No such difference between high and low water appears in the Hudson. In the days when navigation west of the Mississippi was largely by steamboats on the Missouri river, it was familiar experience for the flat- bottomed steamboats, drawing but little water, to be aground on sandbars and detained for hours in efforts to cross them. Gen. Doniphan commanded an expedition which marched from Fort Leavenworth, in 1846, up the Arkansas valley and into the territory of New Mexico. He did not enter the valley again until shortly before his death, in 1887, and, when asked what he recognized, replied that there \n\n[206 U.S. 46, 117]\n\u00a0\n were one or two natural objects, like Pawnee rock, that appeared as they did when he marched up the valley; the river was the same, but all else was changed; and the valley, instead of being destitute of human occupation, was filled with farm houses and farms, villages and cities,- something that he had never expected would be seen in his day.\n Summing up our conclusions, we are of the opinion that the contention of Colorado of two streams cannot be sustained; that the appropriation of the waters of the Arkansas by Colorado, for purposes of irrigation, has diminished the flow of water into the state of Kanas ; that the result of that appropriation has been the reclamation of large areas in Colorado, transforming thousands of acres into fertile fields, and rendering possible their occupation and cultivation when otherwise they would have continued barren and unoccupied; that while the influence of such diminution has been of perceptible injury to portions of the Arkansas valley in Kansas, particularly those portions closest to the Colorado line, yet, to the great body of the valley it has worked little, if any, detriment, and regarding the interests of both states, and the right of each to receive benefit through irrigation and in any other manner from the waters of this stream, we are not satisfied that Kansas has made out a case entitling it to a decree. At the same time it is obvious that if the depletion of the waters of the river by Colorado continues to increase there will come a time when Kansas may justly say that there is no longer an equitable division of benefits, and may rightfully call for relief against the action of Colorado, its corporations and citizens, in appropriating the waters of the Arkansas for irrigation purposes.\n The decree which, therefore, will be entered, will be one dismissing the petition of the intervener, without prejudice to the rights of the United States to take such action as it shall deem necessary to preserve or improve the mavigability of the Arkansas river. The decree will also dismiss the bill of the state of Kansas as against all the defendants, without prejudice to the right of the plaintiff to institute new proceedings when- \n\n[206 U.S. 46, 118]\n\u00a0\n ever it shall appear that, through a material increase in the depletion of the waters of the Arkansas by Colorado, its corporations or citizens, the substantial interests of Kansas are being injured to the extent of destroying the equitable apportionment of benefits between the two states resulting from the flow of the river. Each party will pay its own costs.\n In closing, we may say that the parties to this litigation have approached the investigation of the questions in the most honorable spirit, seeking to present fully the facts as they could be ascertained from witnesses, and discussing the evidence and questions of law with marked research and ability.\n Mr. Justice White and Mr. Justice McKenna concur in the result.\n Mr. Justice Moody took no part in the decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","143":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF KAN. v.

October 9 leave was granted to the United States to file a demurrer, and, in lieu of this, a motion to dismiss was substituted, which was submitted November 12 on printed briefs on both sides.\n The bill was filed by the attorney general of Kansas, on behalf of the state, as trustee for the Missouri, Kansas, & Texas Railway Company, of certain lands in the Indian territory, alleged to have been granted to the state for the benefit of the railway company.\n It is stated by counsel for complainant, as appearing from the bill, that in 1866 'there were three Kansas railroad companies running through the state to the Indian territory line. The first was the Union Pacific Railway Company, Southern Branch, since the Missouri, Kansas, & Texas Railway Company, extending from Fort Riley, now Junction City, Kansas, in a southeasterly direction, down the valley of the Neosho river to the southern line of the state of Kansas, near Chetopa, Kansas; the second was the Leavenworth, Lawrence, & \n\n[204 U.S. 331, 338]\n\u00a0\n Fort Gibson Railway Company, since conveyed to the Atchison, Topeka, & Santa F e Railroad Company, extending from Leavenworth, through Lawrence, to the northern line of the Indian territory, near Coffeyville, Montgomery county, Kansas, in the direction of Galveston bay, in Texas; and the third was the Kansas & Neosho Valley Railway Company, since the Kansas City, Fort Scott, & Memphis, and now a part of the St. Louis & San Francisco Railroad Company, extending from a point of connection with the Union Pacific Railroad at or near the mouth of the Kansas river, thence southeasterly, through the eastern tier of counties, to the northern line of the Indian territory, at or near Baxter Springs, in Cherokee county, Kansas.'\n On July 25, 1866, an act of Congress was passed entitled 'An Act Granting Lands to the State of Kansas to Aid in the Construction of the Kansas & Neosho Valley Railroad and Its Extension to Red River.' 14 Stat. at L. 236, chap. 241. On the next day, July 26, an act was passed, using the same language, except as to the routes, entitled 'An Act Granting Lands to the State of Kansas to Aid in the Construction of a Southern Branch of the Union Pacific Railway and Telegraph, from Fort Riley, Kansas, to Fort Smith, Arkansas' (14 Stat. at L. 289, chap. 270), which provided as follows:\n'That for the purpose of aiding the Union Pacific Railroad Company, Southern Branch, the same being a corporation organized under the laws of the state of Kansas, to construct and operate a railroad from Fort Riley, Kansas, or near said military reservation, thence down the valley of the Neosho river to the southern line of the state of Kansas, with a view to an extension of the same through a portion of the Indian territory to Fort Smith, Arkansas, there is hereby granted to the state of Kansas, for the use and benefit of said railroad company, every alternate section of land or parts thereof designated by odd numbers to the extent of five alternate sections per mile on each side of said road, and not exceeding in all ten sections per mile; . . . \n\n[204 U.S. 331, 339]\n\u00a0\n 'Sec. 3. . . . And the lands hereby granted shall inure to the benefit of said company, as follows: When the governor of the state of Kansas shall certify that any section of ten consecutive miles of said road is completed in a good, substantial, and workmanlike manner as a first-class railroad, then the said Secretary of the Interior shall issue to the said company patents for so many sections of the land herein granted within the limits above named, and coterminous with said completed section hereinbefore granted; . . .\n\n'Sec. 8. And be it further enacted, That said Pacific Railroad Company, Southern Branch, its successors and assigns, is hereby authorized and empowered to extend and construct its railroad from the southern boundary of Kansas, south through the Indian territory, with the consent of the Indians, and not otherwise, along the valley of Grand and Arkansas rivers, to Fort Smith, in the state of Arkansas; and the right of way through said Indian territory is hereby granted to said company, its successors and assigns, to the extent of one hundred feet on each side of said road or roads, and all necessary grounds for stations, buildings, workshops, machine shops, switches, side tracks, turntables, and water stations.\n\n'Sec. 9. And be it further enacted, That the same grant [s] of lands through said Indian territory are hereby made as provided in the first section of this act, whenever the Indian title shall be extinguished by treaty or otherwise, not to exceed the ratio per mile granted in the first section of this act: Provided, That said lands become a part of the public lands of the United States.'\n\n The bill averred that the road was constructed through the Indian territory, and set forth at length Indian treaties and congressionsl legislation with reference to that territory, under which it was alleged that the Creek Indian Nation had ceased to occupy or claim the lands in question as a tribe or nation, and that some of the lands had been allotted in severalty to individual members of the Creek Nation; and that thereby \n\n[204 U.S. 331, 340]\n\u00a0\n said lands passed to the state under the provisions of the grant mentioned. It was prayed that a decree be entered adjudging the state to be the owner, as trustee for the railway company, of all odd-numbered sections of land to the extent of the grant along the line of the road through the Creek Nation, in the Indian territory, and that the allottees be directed to surrender the possession to the state as trustee, and be enjoined from disposing of said lands, or 'in the event that, from any equitable considerations, the court shall entertain the view that the allottees and those claiming under them should not be disturbed, then that an account be taken of the value of the lands in controversy,' and that the United States be adjudged to pay to the state, as trustee, the sum of such values, estimated at more than $10,000,000.\n In our opinion it appears upon the face of the bill that the state of Kansas is only nominally a party, and that the real party in interest is the railroad company. Section 3 provided that patents should be issued not to the state, but to the company direct, which made the state nothing but a mere conduit for the passage of title. And this is so even if it were ruled that the state of Kansas was made trustee under  9, because it would only be trustee of the bare legal title. In very many cases 'in which the grant was directly to the railroad company, or in which the act of Congress required that the patents for lands earned should be issued not to the state, for the benefit of the railroad company, but directly to the company itself,' it has been held that the title vested absolutely in the railroad company. Sioux City & St. P. R. Co. v. United States, \n159 \nU.S. 349, 364\n, 40 S. L. ed. 177, 182, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 17, 23.\n Title passed by the grant on the performance of its conditions and to the grantees to whom the patents were to be issued, and here  3 provided that patents should issue not to the state, but to the railroad company direct.\n And if the lands in the Indian territory could be held in any view to have been granted in proesenti, such grant was certainly not to the state of Kansas. \n\n[204 U.S. 331, 341]\n\u00a0\n The road, in aid of which the grant was made to the state, extended no farther than the southern boundary thereof, and the patents were to be issued to the company. True, as declared in  1, the road was to be constructed 'with a view to an extension of the same through a portion of the Indian territory to Fort Smith, Arkansas,' and that extension was authorized by  8, but the lands referred to in  9 were not lands in the state of Kansas, nor was that state mentioned in the section. It seems clear that those lands were not intended to be granted to that state for the construction of a road beyond its boundaries.\n Moreover, the bill sets forth many communications and protests by the railroad company to the Dawes Commission, the townsite commission, the Indian agent, and the Secretary of the Interior, in all of which the tracts in controversy were claimed by the railroad company as its own without reference to any interest of the state of Kansas therein.\n In these circumstances we think it apparent that the name of the state is being used simply for the prosecution in this court of the claim of the railroad company, and our original jurisdiction cannot be maintained.\n Again, the United States is the real party in interest as defendant, and has not consented to be sued, which it cannot be without its consent. Minnesota v. Hitchcock, \n185 \nU.S. 373, 387\n, 46 S. L. ed. 954, 962, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 650, 656; Oregon v. Hitchcock, \n202 U.S. 60\n, 50 L. ed. 935, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 568; United States v. Lee, \n106 \nU.S. 196, 207\n, 27 S. L. ed. 171, 177, 1 Sup. Ct. Rep. 240.\n'If whether a suit is one against a state is to be determined, not by the fact of the party named as defendant on the record, but by the result of the judgment or decree which may be entered, the same rule must apply to the United States. The question whether the United States is a party to a controversy is not determined by the merely nominal party on the record, but by the question of the effect of the judgment or decree which can be entered.'\n\n In the present case the parties defendant other than the United States and its officers are Creek Indian allottees and \n\n[204 U.S. 331, 342]\n\u00a0\n persons claiming under them, and, if their allotments should be taken from them, which is part of the relief sought by the bill, the United States would be subject to a demand from them for the value thereof or for other lands, while the bill prays in the alternative that, 'in the event that from any equitable considerations the court should entertain the view that the allottees and those claiming under them should not be disturbed, then that an account be taken of the value of the lands in controversy at the time of the respective allotments, and the defendants, the United States of America, be ordered, adjudged, and decreed to pay to your oratrix, as trustee, the sum of such values.'\n It does not follow that because a state may be sued by the United States without its consent, therefore the United States may be sued by a state without its consent. Public policy forbids that conclusion.\n In United States v. Texas, \n143 \nU.S. 621, 646\n, 36 S. L. ed. 285, 293, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 488, 494, it was held that the exercise by this court of original jurisdiction 'in a suit brought by one state against another to determine the boundary line between them, or in a suit brought by the United States against a state to determine the boundary between a territory of the United States and that state, so far from infringing, in either case, upon the sovereignty, is with the consent of the state sued. Such consent was given by Texas when admitted into the Union upon an equal footing in all respects with the other states.' That case was quoted from with approval in Minnesota v. Hitchcock, supra, where Mr. Justice Brewer, delivering the opinion, pointed out that the judicial power of the United States extends to cases in which the United States is a party plaintiff as well as to cases in which it is a party defendant, for 'while the United States, as a government, may not be sued without its consent, yet, with its consent, it may be sued, and the judicial power of the United States extends to such a controversy.'\n We are not dealing here with the merits of the controversy raised by the bill, but solely with the question of the original \n\n[204 U.S. 331, 343]\n\u00a0\n jurisdiction of this court. And, as the United States has not consented to be sued, it results that, on this ground also, the bill must be dismissed.\n And it is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice Moody took no part in the disposition of this case. \n\n\n\n","144":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF MONTANA EX REL HAIRE v. RICE(1907)\nNo. 252\nArgued: Decided: January 28, 1907\n\n\n\n By an act approved February 22, 1889 (25 Stat. at L. 676, chap. 180), hereafter referred to as the enabling act, the state of Montana \n\n[204 U.S. 291, 292]\n\u00a0\n was, with other states, admitted to the Union. By it grants of public lands were made by the United States to the several states admitted, of which only those made by  17 need be stated here. By that section grants were made to the state of Montana in the following terms:\n'To the state of Montana: For the establishment and maintenance of a school of mines, one hundred thousand acres; for state normal schools, one hundred thousand acres; for agricultural colleges, in addition to the grant hereinbefore made for that purpose, fifty thousand cares; for the establishment of a state reform school, fifty thousand acres; for the establishment of a deaf and dumb asylum, fifty thousand acres; for public buildings at the capital of the state, in addition to the grant hereinbefore made for that purpose, one hundred and fifty thousand acres.\n\n'. . . And the lands granted by this section shall be held, appropriated, and disposed of exclusively for the purposes herein mentioned, in such manner as the legislature of the respective states may severally provide.'\n\n Provision was made in the act for the selection of the granted lands from the surveyed, unreserved, and unappropriated public lands of the United States, and selections were made by the state of Montana. The constitutional convention of Montana adopted an ordinance designated as Orainance No. 1, entitled 'Federal Relations,' which ordained that 'the state hereby accepts the several grants of land from the United States to the state of Montana, . . . upon the terms and conditions therein provided.' An act of the legislative assembly of the state of Montana, approved February 2, 1905, authorized and directed the state board of land commissioners to sign and issue interest-bearing bonds to the amount of $ 75,000, for the principal and interest of which the state of Montana should not be liable ( 1), and directed the state treasurer to sell the bonds ( 6). Section 7 directed that--\n'The moneys derived from the sale of said bonds shall be used to erect, furnish, and equip an addition to the present \n\n[204 U.S. 291, 293]\n\u00a0\n state normal school building at Dillon, Montana, and shall be paid out for such purpose by the state treasurer upon vouchers approved by the executive board of the state normal school, and allowed and ordered paid by the state board of examiners.'\n\n The law further provided that all sums realized from the sale of, or the leasing of, or from licenses to cut trees on, the lands granted for the state normal school by  17 of the enabling act, should be pledged as security for the payment of the principal and interest of the bonds issued under the act, and should be set apart as a separate fund for that purpose. It was made the duty of the state treasurer to keep such money in a fund to be designated as the state normal school fund, and to pay therefrom the principal and interest of the bonds authorized by the act.\n Section 12, article 11, of the Constitution of the state of Montana, is as follows:\n'The funds of the state university and all other state institutions of learning, from whatever source accruing, shall forever remain inviolate and sacred to the purpose for which they were dedicated. The various funds shall be respectively invested under such regulations as may be prescribed by law, and shall be guaranteed by the state against loss or diversion. The interest of said invested funds, together with the rents from leased lands or properties, shall be devoted to the maintenance and perpetution of these respective institutions.'\n\n The bonds authorized by the foregoing law of the state of Montana were duly offered for sale, and purchased by the state board of land commissioners themselves as an investment of the common school fund of the state.\n Charles S. Haire performed valuable services as an architect in the erection of an addition to the state normal school, obtained vouchers approved and allowed in the manner prescribed in  7 of the state law, and presented the vouchers to the state treasurer, who declined to pay them, whereupon the state of Montana, on his relation, brought a petition in \n\n[204 U.S. 291, 294]\n\u00a0\n the supreme court of the state of Montana against the state treasurer, praying an alternative writ of mandamus, directing the respondent to pay his claim out of the fund created by the sale of bonds aforesaid, or to show cause for the refusal. The alternative writ issued, and to it the respondent interposed a demurrer and a motion to quash. The only reason alleged by the respondent in support of his pleadings, material here, was that the act of the legislature was in violation of the Constitution of Montana. The case was heard by all the judges of the supreme court of the state, as an original case, and it was adjudged that the alternative writ of mandamus be quashed and the proceedings dismissed, for the reasons that the act authorizing the issue of the bonds, secured by pledge of the proceeds of the lands, was a violation of  12, article 11, of the state Constitution, and that this section of the Constitution was not in conflict with  17 of the enabling act. Haire then petitioned the court for a rehearing, alleging the following reasons:\n 1st. Because the opinion is inconsistent and contradictory;\n 2d. Because the court does not give any force or effect to the requirements of  17 of the enabling act, that the lands granted for a state normal school shall be appropriated for the purpose for which the grant is made, and in other respects misconstrue  17;\n 3d. Because the court misconstrued  12, article 11, of the Constitution of Montana.\n In the further development and specification, in the petition for rehearing, of the second reason, it appears, in substance, that among the grounds relied upon to support it were the claims that  17 of the enabling act had directed that the legislature, and not the state, should dispose of the granted lands; that the lands or their proceeds were appropriated by Congress to the establishment as well as the maintenance of the normal school; and that, in acting in pursuance of the authority conferred by Congress, the legislature was not restricted by the Constitution of the state, which in that respect was subordinate \n\n[204 U.S. 291, 295]\n\u00a0\n to the authority of a law of the United States. The supreme court of the state took the petition for rehearing under advisement, modified slightly, but not essentially, its former opinion, which had passed adversely on the claims of the petitioner set forth in the petition for rehearing, denied the rehearing, and entered final judgment for the respondent. Whereupon this writ of error was brought, assigning as errors:\n'1. The said court erred in holding and deciding that the act of Congress, approved February 22, 1889, providing, among other things, for the admission of Montana into the Union, and known as the 'enabling act,' does not authorize the legislative assembly of the state of Montana to appropriate or apply the proceeds derived from the sale or leasing of the lands granted to said state by  17 of said act for state normal schools, or from the sale of the timber thereon, to the establishment of such schools.\n\n'The court erred in holding that  12 of article 11 of the Constitution of the state, as construed by said court, is not repugnant to  17 of said act of Congress, and is valid.\n\n'3. The court erred in holding and deciding that  12 of article 11 of the Constitution of the state of Montana, as construed by said court, does not impair the obligation of the contract resulting from the acceptance of the grant of lands made to the state of Montana by  17 of said act of Congress.\n\n'4. The court erred in holding and deciding that the proceeds derived from the sale of said lands and the timber thereon constitute a permanent fund, no part of which can be used to establish a state normal school, or for any other purpose, except that of investment.\n\n'5. The court erred in holding and deciding that the interest received from the investment of the proceeds of the sale of said lands and the timber thereon, together with the rents derived from leasing said lands, can be used only for the purpose of maintaining and perpetuating a state normal school. \n\n[204 U.S. 291, 296]\n\u00a0\n\n'6. The court erred in holding and deciding that the act of the legislative assembly of the state of Montana, entitled 'An Act to Enable the Normal School Land Grant to be Further Utilized in Providing Additional Buildings and Equipment for the State Normal School College,' approved February 2, 1905, is invalid, as being in conflict with  12 of article 11 of the Constitution of the state of Montana.\n\n\n'7. The court erred in denying the application of plaintiff in error for a writ of mandate.'\n\n Mr. Milton S. Gunn for plaintiff inerror.\n\n\n[204 U.S. 291, 297]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Albert J. Galen, W. H. Poorman, and E. M. Hall for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Moody, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The objection is made that no Federal question is presented by the record. It must, therefore, be determined whether the controversy turned in the state court upon any Federal question, and, if so, whether it was raised and decided in that court in a manner required to give this court jurisdiction to re-examine the decision upon it. The jurisdiction to do this depends upon whether the case falls within that part of  709 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 575), by which this court is given the authority upon writ of error to re-examine the final judgment or decree of the highest court of a state, 'where any title, right, privilege, or immunity is claimed under the Constitution, or any treaty or statute of, or commission held or authority exercised under, the United States, and the decision is against the title, right, privilege, or immunity specially set up or claimed, by either party, under such Constitution, treaty, statute, commission or authority.' Our jurisdiction in this case does not exist, unless a right claimed under a law of the United States, or an authority exercised under the United States, was specially set up in and denied by the supreme court of Montana. A brief discussion of the facts will determine whether these conditions of jurisditction are present. The United States granted to the state of Montana 100,000 acres of the public lands for a normal school, to be held, appropriated, and disposed of for such purpose, in such manner as the legislature should provide. The legislature, by a law enacted in due form, did provide that bonds should be issued, secured by the \n\n[204 U.S. 291, 298]\n\u00a0\n proceeds of the sale or leasing of the lands; that the proceeds of the bonds should be used for the erection of an addition to a normal school building and paid out for that purpose on approved vouchers. In effect, though by a circuitous method, this was a devotion of the proceeds of the sale of the land to the erection of an addition to the building. Haire presented to the state treasurer, the custodian and disbursing officer of the fund, approved vouchers for his claim for services in the erection, and payment of them was refused. The state, on relation of Haire, by proceedings which were deemed appropriate in form, sought to enforce against the state treasurer the payment of the vouchers, claiming, as appears from the opinion of the state court:\n First. That the legislature had authority, under a statute of the United States, namely,  17 of the enabling act, to deal with the lands as it did by the bond act;\n Second. That the bond act was not in violation of the state Constitution; and,\n Third. That if it were in violation of that Constitution, the law enacted in pursuance of an authority granted by the United States was valid and effective notwithstanding. All three of these claims were denied by the state court. The first and third are clearly claims of a 'right under an authority exercised under the United States,' and, therefore, raised a Federal question. Maguire v. Tyler, 1 Black, 195, 17 L. ed. 137. But it is not enough that a claim of a Federal right arose upon the facts. It must also appear affirmatively that the right was 'specially set up.' No reference was made to any Federal right in the petition for the writ of mandamus, the demurrer, or the motion to quash, and the petition for a rehearing, where the Federal question was first brought forward by the plaintiff in error, so far as the record discloses, was denied by the court. It is not enough that the Federal question was first presented by a petition for rehearing, unless that question was thereupon considered, and passed on adversely by the court. Corkran Oil & Development Co. v. Arnaudet, \n199 U.S. 182\n, 50 L. ed. 143, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 41. \n\n[204 U.S. 291, 299]\n\u00a0\n But an examination of the opinion of the supreme court of the state shows clearly that that court decided two questions: First, that the bond act was in violation of  12 of article 11 of the state Constitution, which in substance provided that all funds of the state institutions of learning should be invested and only the interest upon them used for the support of those institutions; and, second, a question stated in the opinion as follows: 'But, on behalf of the relator, it is contended that by the terms of  17 of the enabling act the lands granted to the state for normal school purposes are to be held, appropriated, and disposed of [ exclusively] for normal school purposes, in such manner as the legislature of Montana may provide, and that this act is sufficiently broad to warrant the legislature in borrowing money and pledging such lands for the payment of the principal and interest. And it is further contended that, if  12 of article 11 of the Constitution contravenes the provisions of  17 of the enabling act,  12 is invalid and of no force or effect' [83 Pac. 876]; which was decided adversely to the contentions stated. The decision of both questions, as the court determined them, was essential to the judgment rendered, and the decision of the second was a distinct denial of the Federal right claimed by the plaintiff in error. Where it clearly and unmistakably appears from the opinion of the state court under review that a Federal question was assumed by the highest court of the state to be in issue, was actually decided against the Federal claim, and the decision of the question was essential to the judgment rendered, it is sufficient to give this court authority to re-examine that question on writ of error. San Jos e Land & Water Co. v. San Jos e Ranch Co. \n189 U.S. 177\n, 47 L.ed. 765, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 487. Applying this rule to the case, there is jurisdiction to re-examine the claim of the plaintiff in error on its merits.\n In support of it the plaintiff in error argues that the grant of all the land by the enabling act was by an ordinance accepted by the state 'upon the terms and conditions therein provided;' that the legislature of the state was, by the last \n\n[204 U.S. 291, 300]\n\u00a0\n clause of  17, appointed as agent of the United States, with full power to dispose of the lands in any manner which it deemed fitting, provided only that the lands or their proceeds should be devoted to normal school purposes; and that, therefore, in the execution of this agency, the legislature was not and could not be restrained by the provisions of the state Constitution. It is vitally necessary to the conclusion reached by these arguments that the enabling act should be interpreted as constituting the legislature, as a body of individuals, and not as a parliamentary body, the agent of the United States. But it is not susceptible of such an interpretation. It granted the lands to the state of Montana, and the title to them, when selected, vested in the grantee. In the same act the people of the territory, about to become a state, were authorized to choose delegates to a convention charged with the duty of forming a Constitution and state government. It was contemplated by Congress that the convention would create the legislature, determine its place in the state government, its relations to the other governmental agencies, its methods of procedure, and, in accordance with the universal practice of the states, limit its powers. It is not to be supposed that Congress intended that the authority conferred by  17 of the enabling act upon the legislature should be exercised by the mere ascertainment of its will, perhaps when not in stated session, or by a majority of the votes of the two houses, sitting together, or without the assent of the executive, or independently of the methods and limitations upon its powers prescribed by its creator. On the contrary, the natural inference is that Congress, in designating the legislature as the agency to deal with the lands, intended such a legislature as would be established by the Constitution of the state. It was to a legislature whose powers were certain to be limited by the organic law, to a legislature as a parliamentary body, acting within its lawful powers, and by parliamentary methods, and not to the collection of individuals who, for the time being, might happen to be members \n\n[204 U.S. 291, 301]\n\u00a0\n of that body, that the authority over these lands was given by the enabling act. It follows, therefore, that in executing the authority intrusted to it by Congress the legislature must act in subordination to the state Constitution, and we think that in so holding the supreme court of the state committed no error.\n It is further claimed by the plaintiff in error that the supreme court of the state erred in holding that the law under which the bonds were issued and the proceeds of public lands devoted to their payment was repugnant to the Constitution of the state. Upon this question the decision of that court is conclusive, and plainly we have no power to review it.\n It is further urged that the construction given by the state court to its Constitution impaired the obligation of a contract, resulting from the acceptance of the granted lands by the state of Montana, and that this impariment was in violation of the Constitution of the United States. Nothing more need be said of that claim than that it appears for the first time in the petition for a writ of error from this court, and the accompanying assignment of errors. This is not sufficient to give this court jurisdiction of any Federal question (Corkran Oil & Development Co. v. Arnaudet, ubi supra), even though another Federal question has been properly raised and brought here by the same writ of error (Dewey v. Des Moines, \n173 U.S. 193\n, 43 L. ed. 665, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 379).\n Other questions were argued, but the view we have taken of the case renders it unnecessary to consider them.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of Montana is therefore affirmed. \n\n\n\n","145":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF WYOMING EX REL WYOMING AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE v.

The object of the proceeding was to compel the state treasurer to pay to the treasurer of the college certain funds in his hands, being the proceeds of land grants and the amount of appropriations made by Congress for the promotion of education in agricultural and mechanical arts. An alternative writ issued, and the respondent appeared and demurred to the petition. The cause was then heard by the supreme court of Wyoming, and by that court the demurrer, which was regarded by court and counsel as sufficiently raising the merits of the controversy, was sustained and judgment rendered for the respondent. The case comes here upon writ of error, with allegations of violations of Federal rights, which, so far as material to the decision, are stated in the opinion.\n Messrs. Porter B.

Wyo. Sess. Laws 1890, 1891, chap. 92. It was declared to be 'a state public educational institution,' with the object of giving to men and women, without regard to color, 'a liberal education and a thorough knowledge of such arts and sciences as will aid in the prosecution of agricultural pursuits, with their varied applications.'\n The University of Wyoming was established by the territory with the declared object of providing education for both sexes in 'the different branches of literature, the arts and sciences, with their varied applications.' The Constitution of the state of Wyoming confirmed the establishment of the university and declared it to be the university of the state of Wyoming. The first session of the state legislature enacted a law declaring more fully the objects of the university, which \n\n[206 U.S. 278, 282]\n\u00a0\n provided, among other things, that it should be open to both sexes, regardless of race or color, and should 'embrace colleges or departments of letters, of science, and of the arts. . . . The college, or the department of the arts, shall embrace courses of instruction in the practical and fine arts, especially in the application of science to the arts of mining and metallurgy, mechanics, engineering, architecture, agriculture, and commerce, together with instruction in military tactics.'\n Land grants and appropriations, which presently will be described in detail, have been made by Congress for the support of education in the state, and the state, acting through its legislature, has accepted the appropriations under the conditions prescribed in the acts of Congress, and has appropriated these national bounties to the support of the university. The agricultural college claimed that, under the acts of Congress bestowing these gifts, it is entitled to them, and the denial of the supreme court of the state of this claim raises the Federal question first to be considered.\n By the act of July 2, 1862 (12 Stat. at L. 503, chap. 130), amended by act of March 3, 1883 (22 Stat. at L. 484, chap. 102, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3212), Congress 'granted to the several states, for the purposes hereinafter mentioned,' certain quantities of the public lands, or, under certain conditions, in lieu thereof land scrip. The entire proceeds of the sale of the land or of the land scrip were directed to be safely invested by the states as a perpetual fund, whose interest should be 'inviolably appropriated by each state which may take and claim the benefit of this act, to the endowment, support, and maintenance of at least one college, where the leading object shall be, without excluding other scientific and classical studies, and including military tactics, to teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and the mechanic arts, in such manner as the legislatures of the states may respectively prescribe, in order to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and professions in life.' The act further provided that 'if any portion of the fund invested . . . be . . . lost, it shall be replaced by the state to which \n\n[206 U.S. 278, 283]\n\u00a0\n it belongs;' and that 'no state, while in a condition of rebellion or insurrection against the government of the United States, shall be entitled to the benefit of this act. No state shall be entitled to the benefits of this act unless it shall express its acceptance thereof by its legislature.'\n The grant made in this statute is clearly to the state, and not to any institution established by the state. Montana ex rel. Haire v. Rice, \n204 U.S. 291\n, 51 L. ed. 490, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 281.\n By the act of August 30, 1890 (26 Stat. at L. 417, chap. 841, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3214), Congress made permanent annual appropriations of a certain sum of money 'to each state and territory for the more complete endowment and maintenance of colleges for the benefit of agriculture and the mechanic arts, now established, or which may be hereafter established, in accordance with an act of Congress approved July second, eighteen hundred and sixty-two, . . . to be applied only to instruction in agriculture, the mechanic arts, the English language, and the various branches of mathematical, physical, natural, and economic science, with special reference to their applications in the industries of life, and to the facilities for such instruction.' It is so obvious that these appropriations are made to the state, and not to any institutions within the state, and that the states, acting through their legislatures, are to expend the appropriations in accordance with the trust imposed upon them, that it is unnecessary to quote the numerous expressions in this act which support that view. By the act of March 2, 1887 (24 Stat. at L. 440, chap. 314, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3218), Congress directed that a certain sum should be annually appropriated 'to each state' for the support of agricultural experiment stations at the institutions established under the act of 1862. The law provides that the appropriation shall be apid to the treasurer of the institution where the agricultural experiment station is established, and no money has come or will come into the hands of the state treasurer. It is, therefore, unnecessary to consider further the provisions of this act. There is in the hands of the state treasurer the permanent fund established under the act of 1862, and one of the annual \n\n[206 U.S. 278, 284]\n\u00a0\n appropriations paid to him under the act of 1890. The interest on the fund and the annual appropriation the state treasurer is about to pay to the University of Wyoming in obedience to the laws of the state. The agricultural college claims that it is entitled under those statutes to receive this money. If this claim fails it is the end of the case. But, as has been shown, both the fund and its interest and the annual appropriations are the property of the state, and not of any institution within it. The agricultural college shows no title or right to this money under these statutes. The whole case of the plaintiff in error fails at the threshold, and it is unnecessary to determine whether the state has complied with its trust in bestowing the government bounty upon the University of Wyoming, or has violated the obligation of a contract by repealing, as it has, the act establishing the agricultural college. These questions were discussed with learning and ability in the court below, and we do not intend to intimate any disagreement with the conclusions of that court. But, as the plaintiff in error must fail in the attempt to compel the payment to it of the money in the hands of the defendant for the reasons already given, there is no need to go further in this court, and the judgment of the Supreme Court of Wyoming is therefore affirmed. \n\n\n\n","146":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTEWART v. U S(1907)\nNo. 256\nArgued: April 12, 1907Decided: May 13, 1907\n\n\n\n The appellant herein filed his petition in the court of claims to obtain compensation for services performed by him while a register of the United States land office at Humboldt, in \n\n[206 U.S. 185, 186]\n\u00a0\n the state of Kansas, during the time from May 12, 1869, until November 20, 1871\n\n\n His petition to recover for such services was filed in the court of claims pursuant to the provisions of  13 of the Indian appropriation act ( chapter 994), approved March 3, 1903 (32 Stat. at L. 1010, 1011). The section reads as follows:\n'Sec. 13. That any one or more of the registers and receivers of the United States land offices in the state of Kansas upon whom was imposed the responsibility of making sale and disposal of the Osage ceded, Osage trust, and Osage diminished reserve land in said state under the treaty of September twenty-ninth, eighteen hundred and sixty-five [14 Stat. at L. 687], between the United States and the Osage Indians, and the acts of Congress for carrying said treaty into effect, may bring suit in the court of claims against the Osage Nation and the United States to determine the claim of the plaintiff or plaintiffs for commissions or compensation for the sale of said lands or any service or duty connected therewith. And the said court shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine said cause and to render judgment thereon on the merits; and the Attorney General shall appear on behalf of the United States and the Osage Nation, and either party feeling aggrieved at the decision of the court of claims may appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, and the final judgment in such case shall determine the rights of all such registers and receivers similarly situated. Said Osage Nation may also appear in said suit by an attorney employed with the authority of said nation. The court of claims shall have full authority, by proper orders and process, to make parties to any such suit all persons whose presence in the litigation it may deem necessary or proper to the final determination of the matter in controversy.'\n\n The petition was dismissed on its merits by the court of claims (39 Ct. Cl. 321), and from such dismissal the appellant was allowed an appeal to this court. The following facts were found by the court:\n The United States and the Great and Little Osage Indians \n\n[206 U.S. 185, 187]\n\u00a0\n entered into a treaty September 29, 1865, which was proclaimed January 21, 1867. (14 Stat. at L. 687.) In the first article it was stated that the tribe of the Great and Little Osage Indians, having more land than was necessary for their occupation, and all payments by the government to them under former treaties having ceased, leaving them greatly impoverished, and being desirous of improving their condition by disposing of their surplus land, they therefore granted and sold to the United States the lands described in that article, and, in consideration of the grant and sale to them of such lands, the United States agreed to pay the Indians the sum of $300,000, which sum was to be placed to the credit of such Indians and interest thereon paid. The lands were to be surveyed and sold, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, on the most advantageous terms, for cash, as public lands are surveyed and sold under existing laws, and, after reimbursing the United States for the cost of such survey and sale and the said sum of $300,000 advanced to the Indians, the remaining proceeds of sales were to be placed in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the 'civilization fund,' to be used under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior.\n By article 2 of the treaty the Indians also ceded to the United States the tract of land therein described, in trust for the Indians, to be surveyed and sold for theirbenefit by the Secretary of the Interior under such rules and regulations as he might from time to time prescribe, under the direction of the Commissioner of the General Land Office, as other lands are surveyed and sold. Provision was then made in the article for the proceeds arising from the sale.\n By article 16 it was provided that, if the Indians should remove from the state of Kansas and settle upon lands to be provided for them by the United States in the Indian territory on terms to be agreed upon, then the diminished reservation should be disposed of by the United States in the same manner and for the same purposes as thereinbefore provided in \n\n[206 U.S. 185, 188]\n\u00a0\n relation to said trust lands, with exceptions not material to be noticed. ( The Indians did subsequently remove from Kansas.)\n It was also provided by the 13th article that, as the Indians had no annuities from which the expenses for carrying the treaty into effect could be taken, the United States should appropriate $20,000, or so much thereof as might be necessary, for the purpose of surveying and selling the land thereby ceded in trust, which amount so expended was to be reimbursed to the Treasury of the United States from the proceeds of the first sales of the lands.\n On the 23d of November, and again on the 19th of December, 1867, the Commissioner of the General Land Office, by authority of the Secretary of the Interior, issued instructions to the registers and receivers in the state of Kansas for the rendition of services in the sale of land ceded to the United States by article 1 of the treaty above mentioned, and the lands agreed to be held in trust by the United States and surveyed and sold for the benefit of the said Indians by article 2 of that treaty. Among other instructions, under date of December 19, 1867, it was provided that the registers and receivers were to be 'allowed a commission of 1 per cent each on the proceeds of the sales of these lands, with limitations, as a matter of course, to the legal maximum of $2,500, inclusive of commissions and fees, etc., on the disposal of the public lands, the payment of which is to be made by the receiver, in his capacity of disbursing agent, and to be debited in a special account, together with such other expenses incident to the sale of the lands alluded to as may be authorized by law and instructions.'\n On the 28th of March, 1871, further instructions were given in regard to the performance of services, in which was the further statement that 'nothing, however, shall be herein construed as authorizing the register and receiver to receive more than the maximum of $2,500 per annum, now allowed by law, and the receiver, in adjusting his accounts, will take care to first ascertain how much short of the maximum \n\n[206 U.S. 185, 189]\n\u00a0\n the receipt from public lands, including the fees received from declaratory statements on the Osage lands, will bring their fees and commissions, and will then charge to the Indian fund only so much commissions as will bring their compensation to the maximum.' In accordance with these instructions claimant performed services in the sale of lands ceded by the Osage Indians under article 1, and of lands held in trust by the United States under article 2 of the treaty, and of lands included within the diminished reservation of the Indians under article 16 of the treaty.\n The claimant was paid for each year of his service the full maximum amount due him, in accordance with the instructions from the General Land Office. This full maximum would not, in some cases, have been reached without resort to the sales of land under the treaty. This suit has been brought by claimant to recover a commission of 1 per cent on the amount of the sales of the land, and the filing fees on the lands mentioned in the treaty and now in the Treasury, as a reasonable compensation for his services in the sale of these lands as outside of and in addition to his regular official duties in the sale of public lands.\n The total amount received on the sale of Osage ceded lands was $1,055, 162.01; and the total amount received on sale of Osage trust and diminished reserve lands was $9,608,156.27; and the total amount of money held in trust by the government for said Osage Indians under said treaty of September 29, 1865, is $8,327,439.07, on which interest at 5 per cent is paid by the United States, amounting annually to $416,371.95.\n Messrs. George A. King, William B. King, and R. V. Belt for appellant.\n\n\n[206 U.S. 185, 191]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General Van Orsdel for appellee the United States.\n Mr. Lorenzo A. Bailey for appellee the Osage Nation.\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n Except for the treaty between the United States and the Osage Indians, relative to the lands in question, and the passage of appropriate legislation by the United States, the lands would never have been sold, as they were not public lands of the United States for the sale of which Congress had already provided under its general legislation. The treaty, however, provided that the lands described in article 1 were to be surveyed and sold under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior on the most advantageous terms, for cash, as public lands are surveyed and sold under existing laws; and under article 2 the lands were to be sold for the benefit of the Indians by the Secretary of the Interior, under such rules and regulations as he might, from time to time, prescribe, under the direction of the Commissioner of the General Land Office, as other lands are surveyed and sold; and, under article 16, in case of the removal of the Indians, the diminished reserve was to be disposed of by the United States in the same manner and for the same purposes as provided in relation to the so-called trust lands. Thus power was given to the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Commissioner of Public Lands, to make the same rules and regulations for the sale of the treaty lands as applied to the survey and sale of 'public lands,' and to that end he had power to provide for their sale by the various receivers and registers of the land office in the \n\n[206 U.S. 185, 192]\n\u00a0\n state of Kansas, in whose jurisdiction such lands lay. Although the treaty provided the sum of $20,000 to pay the expense of carrying out its provisions, yet it is evident that the purpose of the treaty was that these lands should be sold at the least expense to the Indians in their sale, and we think that the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Commissioner of the General Land Office, had the right to provide, as was done in this case, that the various registers and receivers should sell the lands and should not receive more than the maximum compensation for their services per annum otherwise allowed by law. In cases where the maximum amount would not be received without resorting to the treaty fund, such resort was permitted, and the fund was in fact resorted to in this case in order to reach the maximum for the fractional years of claimant's service. The Secretary of the Interior having made this rule, and the instructions of December 19, 1867, being in existence when the claimant herein received his appointment as register, he took it subject to the provision that his maximum compensation for all services rendered should not exceed the sum named by law. See  2237, 2238, 2240, and 2241, U. S. Rev. Stat., U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 1366, 1367, 1369, prescribing, among other things, the compensation of registers and receivers. This compensation the claimant was paid thirty years since, without objection or protest from him that he was entitled to any further payment on account of services in the sales of these treaty lands.\n The case of United States v. Brindle, \n110 U.S. 688\n, 28 L. ed. 286, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 180, does not aid claimant. In that case Brindle was, on the 28th day of October, 1856, \"duly appointed special receiver and superintendent to assist the special commissioner to dispose of the Delaware Indian trust lands at Fort Leavenworth, in the territory of Kansas, under the treaty with the Delaware tribe of Indians.' On the 18th of February, 1857, he was appointed and commissioned for four years as receiver of public moneys for the district of lands subject to sale at Lecompton, Kansas, and on the 15th day of may, 1857, he was duly \n\n[206 U.S. 185, 193]\n\u00a0\n appointed as special receiver and superintendent to assist the special commissioner to dispose of the trust lands of the Kaskaskia and Peoria, Piankeshaw and Wea Indian confederated tribes of Indians at Paoli, Kansas territory.' Brindle was thus appointed special receiver and superintendent of the Delaware Indian trust lands before he was made receiver of public money, and while he was receiver of public money he was duly appointed as special receiver of the other Indian tribes, as above stated. The duties of the positions (special receiver, etc., and receiver of the public moneys) were thus kept separate and apart. As receiver he was to receive public moneys for land subject to sale at Lecompton, Kansas, while his duties in regard to the other positions to which he had been specially appointed referred to the disposition of the Indian lands, in one case at Fort Leavenworth and in the other case at Paoli, both in the territory of Kansas. This court held that when, subsequent to his appointment as receiver of the public moneys, Brindle was appointed special receiver and superintendent to assist the special commissioner 'in disposing of the trust lands, he was employed to render a service in no way connected with the office he held. He was not appointed to any office known to the law. No new duty was imposed on him as receiver of the Land Office. The President was, both by the treaties and the act of 1855 [10 Stat. at L. 700, chap. 204], charged with the duty of selling the lands, and, under his instructions, Brindle was employed to assist in the work. By express provisions in the treaties the exenses incurred by the United States in making the sales were to be paid from the proceeds. This clearly implied the payment of a reasonable compensation for the service of those employed to carry the trust into effect.'\n In the case at bar the duty had already, prior to claimant's appointment, been imposed on the various receivers and registers, as such, of attending to the sale of these lands within their various districts, and express provision had been made that in no case was their compensation to exceed the maximum sum already provided by law. When such provision had been \n\n[206 U.S. 185, 194]\n\u00a0\n made in regard to compensation there is no room for any implication of a promise to pay an additional reasonable compensation for the services of such registers and receivers in the sale of those lands. Such implication was specially negatived before the claimant took office. He received his pay under the provision of law already stated, without any protest or claim on his part that he was entitled to anything further or other than the amount he from time to time received. More than thirty years after the last payment, Congress passed the act of March 3, 1903, the 13th section of which is contained in the foregoing statement of facts. The passage of the act did not imply any admission that there was anything due the claimant. It simply provided for the presentation of his claim to the court and for a decision on the merits, without assuming to say that he had any claim of a meritorious nature.\n We agree with the Court of Claims that the claimant has failed to make out a case, and the judgment dismissing his petition is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice Moody took no part in the decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","147":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTONE v.

S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3540\n\n\n\n On January 26, 1901, Congress passed an act (31 Stat. at L. 741, chap. 181) authorizing the Southern Illinois & Missouri Bridge Company ( defendant in error), a corporation of the state of Illinois, to erect, construct, maintain, and operate a bridge and ap- \n\n[206 U.S. 267, 270]\n\u00a0\n proaches thereto over the Mississippi river from a point on the Mississippi river in Alexander county, in the state of Illinois, opposite the terminus of the St. Louis Southwestern Railway, at or near Gray's Point, in Scott county, in the state of Missouri, or from some other convenient point on said river in said Alexander county, Illinois, to some opposite point on said river in the state of Missouri, within the distance of 3 miles above or below the terminus of said railway.\n The bridge was to be constructed for the passage of railway trains, and, at the option of the corporation, might be so constructed as to provide for the use thereof by wagons, vehicles, and the transit of foot passengers and animals at such reasonable tolls as might be approved by the Secretary of War.\n It was also provided that the bridge constructed under the act and subject to its limitations should be a lawful structure and recognized and known as a post route of the United States.\n Section 5 provides:\n'That the approaches to the bridge built under this act shall be so designed and constructed as not to interfere with the free discharge of the river in seasons of flood; and any encroachment on the high-water cross sections by piers, solid embankments, or otherwise, which might result in unduly accelerating the high-water current at the site of the bridge, shall not be allowed.'\n\n Section 7 provides for the submission to the Secretary of War of the drawings of the bridge, piers, approaches, and accessory works and a map of the location, giving, for the space of at least 2 miles above and 1 mile below the proposed site, the topography of the banks of the river and the shore lines at high and low water. The maps and drawings are to be referred to the board of officers of the Corps of Engineers, United States Army, for examination and report.\n Provision is made for hearing objections to the construction of the bridge, and it is provided that the proposed bridge shall be a lawful structure only when built in accordance with the plans recommended by the Board of Engineers and approved \n\n[206 U.S. 267, 271]\n\u00a0\n by the Chief of Engineers and by the Secretary of War, and while so managed and kept in repair as to offer at all times reasonable and proper means for the passage of rafts, steamboats, and other water craft under the said bridge, and while said requirements are observed.\n Section 10 provides for alterations and changes as may be required by the Secretary of War, in accordance with existing law, in the bridge constructed under the provisions of the act, so as to preserve free and convenient navigation. Such changes were to be made, under the direction of the Secretary of War, at the expense of the persons, companies, or corporations owning, controlling, and operating the bridge.\n Section 11 provides that the bridge shall be constructed under the general supervision of the Secretary of War, and no changes or alterations in the plan shall be made during the construction of said bridge or after its completion, unless recommended by the Chief of Engineers and approved by the Secretary of War.\n The act makes provision for the preservation of the navigable channel during the construction of the bridge.\n Section 12 provides that whenever Congress shall decide that the public interests require it, the right to order the removal of the bridge at the expense of the owners is expressly reserved, without liability for damages on the part of the United States.\n Section 13 provides that if the bridge is not commenced within one year and completed within three years from the date of the approval of the act, the same shall be null and void, and the rights thereby conferred ceased and determine.\n The Southern Illinois & Missouri Bridge Company, in pursuance of this act, submitted its drawings and plans and the same were duly approved as required by law.\n The bridge company, on the 24th day of April, 1902, filed its petition in the circuit court of Scott county, Missouri, for the appropriation of a strip of land containing 20.3 acres, said to be approximately 4,000 feet long and 200 feet wide, alleging that it is necessary to have a right of way \n\n[206 U.S. 267, 272]\n\u00a0\n for the railway tracks, bridge, and terminal yards of the company, and, for the purpose of carrying out its charter privileges, it is necessary to hold and own the described tract.\n On trial in the circuit court that court held that the bridge company had no right to make the appropriation under the laws of Missouri.\n From this adjudication an appeal was taken to the supreme court of Missouri and that court reversed the judgment of the circuit court, and remanded the case with directions to the lower court to appoint three disinterested commissioners to assess the damages which the defendants would sustain by the appropriation of the strip of land. 174 Mo. 1, 63 L.R. A. 301, 73 S. W. 453.\n Such proceedings were had, and $10,000 was assessed as damages in favor of the plaintiffs in error, defendants below, and a second appeal was prosecuted to the supreme court of Missouri, where judgment below was affirmed. 194 Mo. 175, 92 S. W. 475.\n To that judgment this writ of error is prosecuted.\n Many of the assignments of error involve only questions of state law, the rulings concerning which, in the supreme court of the state, are conclusive, and involve no substantial Federal question.\n Among these may be named:\n The contention that the statutes of Missouri do not authorize the incorporation of a bridge company to build a bridge across the Mississippi river;\n That the laws of Missouri do not confer the right of eminent domain on a corporation of another state;\n That a corporation of Illinois can only exercise in Missouri such powers as are conferred upon it by the state of its creation.\n These questions involve the powers of corporations under the laws of Missouri, which are concluded by the adjudication of the state supreme court.\n There is no contention that the statutes conferring the right of eminent domain, passed by the legislature of the state of Missouri, and which its courts have decided authorize this \n\n[206 U.S. 267, 273]\n\u00a0\n appropriation by the defendant in error, do not make ample provision for assessment of damages to the landowner by due process of law. Whether a given corporation comes within the law of the state, and is entitled to assert its power, presents only a question of state law.\n Nor is error shown in the contention that the erection of the bridge was not begun within the year, as provided by the act of Congress. The evidence shows that the bridge has been constructed without complaint by the Federal authorities, and, indeed, Congress has extended the time for the completion of the bridge by an act passed January 18, 1904. 33 Stat. at L. 6, chap. 5. It cannot prejudice any Federal right secured to the plaintiffs in error that the right of eminent domain is authorized by the state notwithstanding the bridge was not begun within the time which Congress might have insisted upon as a condition of enjoyment of the privileges conferred.\n If the record presents any Federal question at all, it rests in the contention that the appropriation in controversy is in contravention of the act of Congress, because it is an unauthorized extension of the approaches to the bridge upon the Missouri side, not included in the drawings and plans as submitted to the Secretary of War, and which met with his approval, as already recited.\n The copy of the approved drawings in the record shows that the approach to the bridge upon the west side was shown in a series of arches extending from the river bank to a distance of 720 feet. And it is the contention of the plaintiffs in error that, in view of the act of Congress, the approach must be limited to the extent and construction shown in the plans and drawings thus approved by the Secretary of War. Indeed, it is contended that this plan, after its approval, became a limitation upon the power of the state to extend the bridge by authorizing further approaches and connections.\n But we think this contention wholly untenable. The act of Congress and the powers given the Secretary of War thereunder are the result of the exertion of the constitutional power \n\n[206 U.S. 267, 274]\n\u00a0\n conferred upon Congress to regulate commerce between the states. Federal control of bridges constructed over navigable waters is maintained because of the right to prevent obstructions to navigation and preserve such public highways as rivers for free and unobstructed use in the interest of commerce. Newport & C. Bridge Co. v. United States, \n105 U.S. 470\n-475, 26 L. ed. 1143-1145, and cases therein cited.\n An examination of the act of Congress under which the bridge company was authorized to construct this bridge manifests the purpose to prevent its becoming an obstruction or interference with free navigation of the river, and when the matter of approaches is specifically spoken of it is provided that they shall be so designed and constructed as not to interfere with the free discharge of the river in seasons of flood.\n It is evident that the purpose of requiring the submission of plans, and their approval by the Secretary of War, was to preserve, as far as may be, the unobstructed passage of the river in the uses of navigation. To the extent that it was necessary to protect such interests, the law provides that the structure shall be unalterable, and that its approaches shall be approved by the Secretary and remain unchanged without his sanction, but it certainly never was designed to destroy the usefulness of the bridge by limiting the power of the state to authorize the corporation constructing and owning it, by proper connections and other facilities, to make the bridge available for the purposes for which it was intended. The bridge and approaches as approved by the Secretary of War have not been altered. The connecting approaches and tracks are additional means of making the bridge available for the purposes intended.\n As was pertinently observed by the Chief Justice, in delivering the opinion of the court in Union P. R. Co. v. Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co. \n163 U.S. 588\n, 41 L. ed. 273, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1173: 'A railroad bridge can be of no use to the public unless united with necessary appurtenances, such as approaches, tracks, depots, and other facilities for the public accommodation.' \n\n[206 U.S. 267, 275]\n\u00a0\n If the state was deprived of its power to authorize extensions and connections which should make this bridge available for the common use of railroads for which it was intended, it would have been a vain thing to provide for a bridge abruptly terminating at a height and point where, without further approaches and connecting facilities, its usefulness would have been destroyed.\n This record shows that the point 720 feet to the west, where the approach required by the War Department ends, is at a height of some 60 feet from the ground. The structure was thence extended some distance to the crest of a bluff, thence over the lands of the plaintiffs in error to a point where the terminal yards of the bridge company are situated.\n We cannot find it within the purpose of Congress, if it had the power so to do, by the terms of this act to limit the state in its right to authorize these necessary terminals and connecting facilities, because the plans and specifications, which fully subserved the purpose of showing the extent to which navigation would be affected, had been specifically approved by the Secretary of War, and are not to be altered without his consent.\n In our view no Federal right was taken from the plaintiffs in error by the action complained of under the state laws as interpreted by the supreme court of the state of Missouri, and if it may be said that the contention fairly presents a Federal question, we are unable to find merit in it.\n Judgment of the Supreme Court of Missouri is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","148":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSWING v. WESTON LUMBER CO(1907)\nNo. 145\nArgued: January 10, 1907Decided: April 8, 1907\n\n\n\n Messrs. Patterson A. Reece and Virgil I. Hixson for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Edward C. Chapin for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n This action was brought in the circuit court of Schoolcraft county, Michigan, by Swing, trustee of the Union Mutual Fire Insurance Company, a corporation of Ohio, against the Weston Lumber Company, a corporation of Michigan, to collect its share as a policy holder of an assessment made by the order of the supreme court of Ohio in liquidating the liabilities of the insurance company.\n The assessment against defendant was in respect of a policy for $5, 000 and a renewal thereof on defendant's lumber and other property at Manistique, Michigan. The insurance company was never licensed to do business in Michigan, and the \n\n[205 U.S. 275, 276]\n\u00a0\n defense was pleaded that it was a foreign corporation, not authorized to transact business in that state, and that the policies were issued in direct violation of the laws of Michigan, the company not having complied with those relating to foreign insurance companies doing business in the state; and that the contracts of insurance were at variance with and contrary to the settled policy of the state.\n The case was tried by the court without a jury. At the conclusion of the trial plaintiff made requests for certain findings as matters of law, including this:\n'11. That the statutes of this state do not and could not, under the Constitution of the United States, prohibit this defendant from going or sending outside of this state and there procuring insurance on property belonging to the defendant and located in this state, from an insurance company not authorized thorized to do business in this state;' which the court refused.\n\n Findings of fact and conclusions of law were made and filed. It was found, among other things, that--\n'In the latter part of the summer of 1889 defendant desired to increase the amount of insurance carried upon lumber accumulated in its yards, and made application to a local agency conducted by a banking institution of the town for a considerable addition to the line of its insurance already held in that agency. Not being able to write, in one risk, in its own companies, the amount of additional insurance desired, the local agency, through W. C. Marsh, an employee of the bank, who attended to its insurance business, placed twelve different policies with outside agencies. Part of this line of insurance was sent to George R. Lewis & Company, an agency of Minneapolis, Minnesota, through which concern the $5,000 insurance involved in this case was placed with the said Union Mutual Fire Insurance Company of Cincinnati, Ohio.'\n\n It was admitted that the insurance company had never complied with any of the requirements imposed by the statutes of Michigan on insurance companies of other states seeking to transact business in Michigan. \n\n[205 U.S. 275, 277]\n\u00a0\n Sections 5157 and 10467 of the Compiled Laws of Michigan of 1897 are as follows:\n (5157.) 'That it shall be unlawful for any person or persons, as agent, solicitor, surveyor, broker, or in any other capacity, to transact or to aid in any manner, directly or indirectly, in transacting or soliciting within this state any insurance business for any person, persons, firm, or copartnership who are nonresidents of this state, or for any fire or inland navigation insurance company or association, not incorporated by the laws [or] of this state, or to act for or in behalf of any person or persons, firm or corporation, as agent or broker, or in any other capacity, to procure, or assist to procure, a fire or inland marine policy or policies of insurance on property situated in this state, for any nonresident person, persons, firm, or copartnership, or in any company or association without this state, whether incorporated or not, without procuring or receiving from the commissioner of insurance the certificate of authority provided for in  23 of an act entitled 'An Act Relative to the Organization of Fire and Marine Insurance Companies Transacting Business within This State,' approved April third, eighteen hundred and sixty-nine, as amended. Such certificate of authority shall state the name or names of the person, persons, firm, or copartnership, or the location of the company or association, as the case may be, and that the party named in the certificate has complied with the laws of this state, regulating fire, marine, and inland navigation insurance, and the name of the duly appointed attorney in this state on whom process may be served.' Act of 1881,  1.\n (10467.) 'But when, by the laws of this state, any act is forbidden to be done by any corporation, or by any association of individuals, without express authority by law, and such act shall have been done by a foreign corporation, it shall not be authorized to maintain any action founded upon such act, or upon any liability or obligation, express or implied, arising out of, or made or entered into in consideration of, such act.' \n\n[205 U.S. 275, 278]\n\u00a0\n Judgment was entered in favor of defendant, and affirmed, on error, by the supreme court of Michigan. 140 Mich. 344, 103 N. W. 816.\n The supreme court held that a foreign mutual insurance company which had not been authorized to do business in Michigan as provided by its statutes could not maintain a suit to collect assessments due on a policy issued by one of its agents in another state on request of an insurance broker of Michigan who was unable to place the whole line in his own authorized companies. Seamans v. Temple Co. 105 Mich. 400, 28 L.R.A. 430, 55 Am. St. Rep. 457, 63 N. W. 408, citing many cases, was referred to and quoted from. It appeared therefrom that it had been for years the policy of the state to limit the business of insurance to such corporations, domestic and foreign, as should be authorized to do business, after compliance with certain regulations and conditions prescribed by law, and that the statutes were intended to be prohibitory in their character.\n The power of the state to prohibit foreign insurance companies from doing business within its limits, or, in allowing them to do so, to impose such conditions as it pleases, is undoubted.

Rep. 630.\n What was held here on the facts was that the contract was brought about and completed in Michigan by a representative of the foreign corporation. So far as defendant was concerned its application for insurance was made and the business was done with the home office at Manistique, with which it was in the habit of doing business. It was not a case of defendant 'going or sending outside of this state and there procuring insurance on property belonging to the defendant and located in this state from an insurance company not authorized to do business in this state,' as supposed in plaintiff's eleventh request for finding. That request is the only pretense in the record of a Federal question being raised prior to the judgments below, and was entirely inadequate for that purpose. \n\n[205 U.S. 275, 279]\n\u00a0\n Naturally enough, neither the circuit court nor the supreme court referred to any Federal question whatever.\n The writ of error cannot be maintained.

That section makes it the duty of any officer in charge of any\n Sec. 18. That it shall be the duty of the owners, officers, and agents of any vessel bringing an alien to the United States to adopt due precautions to prevent the landing of any such alien from such vessel at any time or place other than that designated by the immigration officers, and any such owner, officer, agent, or person in charge of such vessel, who shall land or permit to land, any alien at any time or place other than that designated by the immigration officers, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall, on conviction, be punished by a fine for each alien so permitted to land of not less than one hundred nor more than one thousand dollars, or by imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year, or by both such fine and imprisonment, and every such alien so landed shall be deemed to be unlawfully in the United States and shall be deported, as provided by law. \n\n[207 U.S. 120, 124]\n\u00a0\n vessel bringing an alien to the United States to adopt due precautions to prevent the landing of such alien at any time or place other than that designated by the immigration officers, and punishes him if he lands or permits to land any alien at any other time or place. The indictment was for wilfully permitting an alien to land at another place. The evidence was that the defendant was master of the Cunard Steamship Slavonia, that the alien was an Austrian sailor who shipped as a cook at Fiume, Hungary, for the round trip, not to be paid off until he returned, and that on the evening of the day of arrival at New York, after he had reported his work finished, he went ashore intending to come back, but changed his mind. He did not formally ask leave to go, but leave habitually was given and no additional precautions were taken when leave was asked. The judge was requested to direct a verdict for the defendant and to instruct the jury that, if the sailor intended to return when he left the ship, they must acquit, etc.; but he left it to the jury to say whether the defendant had used reasonable precautions, adverting to the fact that there were other desertions, and emphasizing the failure to enforce a rule requiring the men to ask leave to go ashore. Exceptions were taken, but the circuit court of appeals sustained the judgment, as we have said. 152 Fed. 1.\n We assume for purposes of decision that one who makes it possible for an alien to land, by omitting due precautions to prevent it, permits him to land within the meaning of the penal clause in  18. But we are of opinion that the section does not apply to the ordinary case of a sailor deserting while on shore leave, and that therefore the judgment must be reversed. We are led to this opinion by what seems to us the literal meaning of the section and also by the construction that would be almost necessary if the literal meaning seemed to us less plain.\n The reasoning is not long. The phrase which qualifies the whole section is, 'bringing an alien to the United States.' It is only 'such' officers of 'such' vessels that are punished. 'Bringing to the United States,' taken leterally and nicely, \n\n[207 U.S. 120, 125]\n\u00a0\n means, as a similar pharase in  8 plainly means, transporting with intent to leave in the United States and for the sake of transport,-not transporting with intent to carry back, and merely as incident to employment on the instrument of transport. So again, leterally, the later words 'to land' mean to go ashore. To avoid certain inconveniences the goverment and the courts below say that sailors do not land unless they permanently leave the ship. But the single word is used for all cases and must mean the same thing for all, for sailors and other aliens. It hardly can be supposed that a master would be held justified under this section for allowing a leper to wander through the streets of New York on the ground that, as he expected the passenger to return and his expectations had been fulfilled, he could not be said to have allowed the leper to land. The words must be taken in their literal sense. 'Landing from such vessel' takes place and is complete the moment the vessel is left and the shore reached. But it is necessary to commerce, as all admit, that sailors should go ashore, and no one believes that the statute intended altogether to prohibit their doing so. The contrary always has been understood of the earlier acts, in judicial decisions and executive practice. If we reject the ambiguous interpretation of 'to land,' as we have, the necessary result can be reached only by saying that the section does not apply to sailors carried to an American port with a bona fide intent to take them out again when the ship goes on, when not only there was no ground for supposing that they were making the voyage a pretext to get here, desert, and get in, but there is no evidence that they were doing so in fact. Whether this result is reached by the interpretation of the words 'bringing an alien to the United States,' that has been suggested, or on the ground that the statute cannot have intended its precautions to apply to the ordinary and necessary landing of seamen, even if the words of the section embrace it, as in Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States, \n143 U.S. 457\n, 36 L. ed. 226, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 511, does not matter for this case. We think it superfluous to go through all the sections of the act for confirmation of our opin- \n\n[207 U.S. 120, 126]\n\u00a0\n ion. It is enough to say that we feel no doubt when we read the act as a whole.\n A reason for the construction adopted below was found in the omission of the word 'immigrant' which had followed 'alien' in the earlier acts. No doubt that may have been intended to widen the reach of the statute, but we see no reason to suppose that the omission meant to do more than to avoid the suggestion that no one was within the act who did not come here with intent to remain. It is not necessary to regard the change as a mere abbreviation, although the title of the statute is 'An Act to Regulate the Immigration of Aliens into the United States.'\n Upon our construction of the statute we need not go further into the particular circumstances. But we may add that even on a different reading the jury was permitted to establish a questionably high standard of conduct, if it be admitted, as it was, that shore leave might be granted. No practicable method of preventing sailors from occasionally yielding to the seductions of an unduly prolonged stay on land was suggested or occurs to our mind.\n In the second case the district judge declined to follow the decision in Taylor v. The United States, 152 Fed. 1, which we have been considering, and quashed an indictment which disclosed that the alien alleged to have been permitted unlawfully to land was a seaman. The United States brings a writ of error under the act of March 2, 1907, chap. 2564, 34 Stat. at L. 1246, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1907, p. 209, on the ground, it must be presumed, that the judgment was based upon the construction of the statute. There are other technical questions apparent on the record, but, if they are open, the government very properly has not pressed them, but has confined itself to the question of law with which we have dealt. There is an allegation in the indictment that the alien was a stowaway under order of deportation, and there is a suggestion that this raises a doubt if he was a bona fide seaman. This is the only additional point raised.\n But we perceive nothing in the fact that an alien has been refused leave to land from a British ship and has been ordered \n\n[207 U.S. 120, 127]\n\u00a0\n to be deported, to make it impossible, as matter of law, for the British master subsequently to accept him as a sailor on the high seas, even if bound for an American port. If the government had wished to try the good faith of this particular transaction, and not simply to get a construction of the act, there was no need to rely on the allegation mentioned alone. Of course it is possible for a master unlawfully to permit an alien to land, even if the alien is a sailor, and it was alleged that the master did so. But we take the government at its word.\n The defendant argues that the United States cannot be allowed a writ of error in a criminal case like this. We do not perceive the difficulty. No doubt of the power of Congress is intimated in United States v. Sanges, \n144 U.S. 310\n, 36 L. ed. 445, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 609. If the 5th Amendment has any bearing, the act of 1907 is directed to judgments rendered before the moment of jeopardy is reached. Kepner v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 100, 128\n, 49 S. L. ed. 114, 124, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 797. We think it unnecessary to discuss the question at length.\n Judgment in No. 238 reversed.\n Judgment in No. 404 affirmed. \n\n\n\n","150":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTEXAS & P R. CO. v. CISCO OIL MILL(1907)\nNo. 79\nArgued: Decided: February 25, 1907\n\n\n\n Messrs. John F. Dillon, Winslow S. Pierce, David D. Duncan, and Thomas J. Freeman for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. J. J. Butts for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n This writ of error is prosecuted to obtain the reversal of a judgment for $641.69, with interest, entered in favor of the Cisco Oil Mill by the court of civil appeals of Texas upon the reversal of a judgment of a district state court in favor of the Texas & Pacific Railway Company. The action was \n\n[204 U.S. 449, 450]\n\u00a0\n brought by the oil company to recover of the railway company the principal sum just stated, because of alleged overcharges by the railway company, paid by the oil company under protest at the time of the delivery of four cars of cotton seed, shipped in the month of September, 1901, from towns in Louisiana east of Alexandria, in that state, to Cisco, Texas. The appellate court, after excluding as surplusage averments in the petition 'evidently designed to bring the case within the provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act.' was of opinion and decided the case upon the hypothesis that the petition stated a valid cause of action at common law for the recovery of the sums coercively collected upon the delivery of the merchandise, in excess of a reasonable rate, and adopted the finding of the trial court as to the amount of the unreasonable exaction.\n In its opinion the court of civil appeals expressly declared that the trial court had rendered judgment in favor of the railway company because the rate demanded and collected of the oil company 'was in accord with appellee's rate sheets and freight schedule which had been filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission and promulgated as provided by the act of Congress.' Deciding, however, that the case before it presented 'substantially the same questions, upon substantially the same state of facts,' which had been passed on in the case of Abilene Cotton Oil Co. v. Texas & P. R. Co. [(Tex. Civ. App.) 85 S. W. 1052], the court, for the reason given by it in that case, reversed the trial court and rendered judgment in favor of the Cisco Oil Mill.\n The considerations which made necessary our decision, just announced, reversing the judgment of the court of civil appeals in the Abilene Case, equally apply in the instant case and compel like action. And this result follows despite the contention that a right of action existed because it is assumed no schedule rate was in existence when the shipments were made. This was based on the claim that it was not affirmatively found below that the schedule of rates applicable to the \n\n[204 U.S. 449, 451]\n\u00a0\n shipments in question had been posted as required by  6 of the act to regulate commerce, noted in margin. \n The assumption, it is insisted, is authorized because, it is asserted, the conclusion that the schedule of rates became legally operative was not justified by the finding that such schedule had been filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission and copies thereof furnished to the freight officers of the rairoad company at Cisco and other points. The contention is without merit. The filing of the schedule with the Commission and the furnishing by the railroad company of copies to its freight offices incontrovertibly evidenced that the tariff of rates contained in the schedule had been established and put in force as mentioned in the first sentence of the section, and the railroad company could not have been heard to assert to the contrary. The requirement that schedules should be 'posted in two public and conspicuous places in every depot,' etc., was not made a condition precedent to the establishment and putting in force of the tariff of rates, but was a provision based upon the existence of an established rate, and plainly had for its object the affording of special facilities to the public for ascertaining the rates actually in force. To hold that the clause had the far-reaching effect \n\n[204 U.S. 449, 452]\n\u00a0\n claimed would be to say that it was the intention of Congress that the negligent posting by an employee of but one instead of two copies of the schedule, or the neglect to post either, would operate to cancel the previously established schedule,-a conclusion impossible of acceptance. While  6 forbade an increase or reduction of rates, etc., 'which have been established and published as aforesaid,' otherwise than as provided in the section, we think the publication referred to was that which caused the rates to become operative; and this deduction is fortified by the terms of  10 of the act, making it a criminal offense for a common carrier or its agent or a shipper or his employee improperly 'to obtain transportation for property at less than the regular rates then established and in force on the line of transportation of such common carrier.'\n Whether, by the failure to post an established schedule, a carrier became subject to penalties provided in the act to regulate commerce, or whether, if damage had been occasioned to a shipper by such omission, a right to recover on that ground alone would have obtained, we are not called upon in this case to decide.\n The judgment below is reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n First paragraph of  6 of the act to regulate commerce, as amended March 2, 1889 (25 Stat. at L. 855, chap. 382, U.

Pierce, and Thomas J.

It was alleged that, on shipments of car loads of cotton seed, made in September and October, 1901, over the line of the defendant's road from various points in Louisiana east of Alexandria, in that state, to Abilene, Texas, the carrier had exacted, over the protest of the oil company, on the delivery of the cotton seed, the payment of an unjust and unreasonable rate, which exceeded, in the aggregate, by the sum sued for, a just and reasonable charge. There were, moreover, averments that the rate exacted was discriminatory, constituted an undue preference, and amounted to charging more for a shorter than for a longer haul. Besides a general traverse, the railway company defended on the ground that the shipments were interstate, and were, therefore, covered by the act of Congress to regulate commerce. It was averred that, as the rate complained of was the one fixed in the rate \n\n[204 U.S. 426, 431]\n\u00a0\n sheets which the company had established, filed, published, and posted, as required by that act, the state court was without jurisdiction to entertain the cause, and, even if such court had jurisdiction, it could not, without disregarding the act to regulate commerce, grant relief upon the basis that the established rate was unreasonable, when it had not been found to be so by the Interstate Commerce Commission.\n The trial court made findings of fact. Those relating to the subject of the establishing, filing, and publishing by the railway company of rate sheets containing the rate which was complained of were as follows:\n'7th. That the Western Classification Committee, agent and representative of numerous railways and of defendant, filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission what is known as the Western Classification, giving classifications of different articles or items of merchandise, and in same cotton seed is classed as 'A;' that this was the joint act of a number of roads, and the defendant adopted said joint classification; that on May 30, 1901, the Southwestern Freight Committee, agent of a number of roads and agent of defendant, filed with the said Commission a supplement for numerous roads in connection with defendant, whereby the rate on cotton seed from all points in Louisiana east of Alexandria was fixed at 67 cents per 100 pounds to all points in Texas from all points in Louisiana east of Alexandria and west of Alexandria.\n\n'8th. That said classification and said rate schedule was adopted by defendant and was filed by said S. W. Freight Committee with said Interstate Commerce Commission in behalf of defendant.\n\n'9th. That copies of said schedule and said tariffs and classifications were kept in the office of said defendant at said points of shipment and at said Abilene, that is, in the freight office and depots, for the inspection of the public, as admitted by plaintiff, which admission is found in the statement of facts.\n\n'10th. That, other than said schedule and classification, nothing has been filed with the Interstate Commerce Com- \n\n[204 U.S. 426, 432]\n\u00a0\n mission by or in behalf of defendant in the way of classifications, schedules, or rates on cotton seed from points on its road in Louisiana to points on its road in Texas.'\n\n From the facts found the court stated the following as its conclusions:\n'1st. The facts so found show that this was an interstate shipment.\n\n'2d. The facts so found show that the defendant complied with the interstate commerce law, and said rates and classifications were thereby properly established and in force, except that the rate charged on cotton seed in car load lots was unreasonable and excessive.\n\n'3d. I find that the rate charged by the defendant was that established under the interstate commerce law.'\n\n As nothing in these conclusions relates to the averments of discrimination, undue preference, or a greater charge for a shorter than for a longer haul, those subjects, it may be assumed, were considered to have been eliminated in the course of the trial.\n There was judgment for the railway company. When the controversy came to be disposed of by the court of civil appeals, to which the cause was taken, that court deemed there was only one question presented for decision; that is, whether, consistently with the act to regulate commerce, there was power in the court to grant relief upon the finding that the rate charged for an interstate shipment was unreasonable, although such rate was the one fixed by the duly published and filed rate sheet, and when the rate had not been found to be unreasonable by the Interstate Commerce Commission. In opening its opinion the court said (85 S. W. 1052):\n'Adopting the construction of the pleadings evidently given them in the briefs, and treating it as presented, the case, briefly stated, is an action by appellant for damages for a violation of an alleged commonlaw right, in that appellee demanded and coercively collected from appellant freight charges in excess of a reasonable compensation, for the trans- \n\n[204 U.S. 426, 433]\n\u00a0\n portation of a number of car loads of cotton seed from the town of Cottonport and other designated towns in the state of Louisiana to the city of Abilene in the state of Texas.'\n\n After referring to the findings as to the unreasonableness of the charge exacted, and after pointing out that the railway company had not, by a cross assignment, challenged the correctness of the findings of the trial court as to the unreasonableness of the rate, it was said:\n'So that we are relieved from a consideration of the difficulties discussed in some of the cases in ascertaining the fact, and therefore now have squarely before us the questions whether, in a state court, a shipper in cases of interstate carriage can, by the principles of the common law, be accorded relief from unjust and unreasonable freight rates exacted from him, or shall relief in such cases be denied merely because such unreasonable rate has been filed and promulgated by the carrier under the interstate commerce act?'\n\n Proceeding in an elaborate opinion to dispose of the question thus stated to be the only one for consideration, the conclusion was reached that jurisdiction to grant relief existed, and that to do so was not repugnant to the act to regulate commerce. Applying these conclusions to the findings of fact, the relief prayed was allowed. The court said:\n'We therefore adopt the trial court's findings of fact, and, applying thereto the principles of law we have deduced, reverse the judgment, and here render judgment in appellant's favor for the said sum of $1,951.83, excessive freights charged, together with interest. . . .'\n\n The assigned errors are addressed exclusively to the operation of the act to regulate commerce upon the jurisdiction of the court below to entertain the controversy, and its power in any event to afford relief to the oil company, based upon the alleged unreasonableness of the rate under the circumstances disclosed. Before we take up the consideration of that subject, however, two questions must be disposed of: First, it is insisted that this court is without jurisdiction, because no \n\n[204 U.S. 426, 434]\n\u00a0\n Federal question is presented. We think it suffices to say that it obviously results from the statements previously made that a question of that character was presented by the pleadings, was passed upon by the trial court, was expressly and necessarily decided by the court below, and is also essentially involved in the cause as it is before us. Second, it is urged that the effect of the act to regulate commerce upon the right of the oil company to recover need not be passed upon, since, even if error on that subject was committed below, a review of the decision in that regard is unnecessary, because, if the correct legal inference be drawn from the facts found by the trial court, which were adopted by the appellate court, it will result that the railway company had not established a legal schedule of rates in compliance with the act to regulate commerce, and therefore the jurisdiction of the court and its right to afford relief was not at all affected by the provisions of the act. We do not presently stop to consider whether the consequences as to jurisdiction and right to recover which are asserted would result if the premise was well founded, because we think the premise is either shown by the findings to be unfounded or it is not open for contention on the record. The premise rests upon two propositions of fact: a. That the findings of the trial court show that the rate sheet filed was joint and therefore did not necessarily relate to a shipment entirely over the road of the railway company. This contention, we think, is shown by the findings to be without merit, since those findings clearly point out that the rate sheet was filed by an agent of the defendant railroad, was by it adopted, and constituted the only rate sheet embracing the traffic in question. b. Although it is conceded that the evidence showed that the schedule of rates was established and filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission, and was kept at the stations of the railway company for public inspection, and that the oil company had knowledge of the fact, it is insisted that the facts found do not justify the conclusion that there was a compliance with the requirements of the act to regulate com- \n\n[204 U.S. 426, 435]\n\u00a0\n merce as to the posting of the established schedule. We think this contention is not open on this record. As we have seen, the trial court expressly concluded that the railway company had complied with the act to regulate commerce in the matter of filing, etc., its schedule of rates, and the appellate court opened its opinion by the statement that the course of the trial and the briefs of counsel confined the issue for determination to the question of the effect of the act to regulate commerce upon the rights of the parties, manifestly upon the assumption that the correctness of the conclusion of the trial court as to compliance with the act was conceded by both parties. In other words, as the court below, in deciding the case, expressly declared that the course of the argument and briefs of counsel before it had confined the case to the issue of whether there was a right to recover upon the hypothesis that a schedule of rates had been filed and published, we do not think that it is now open to contend that that which the court below in effect declared was conceded in the briefs of counsel to be a lawful schedule of rates was not such. Non constat, that if the court of civil appeals, having the evidence before it, had not treated the case as presented, it might not have considered the facts in relation to the publication of the schedule and affirmatively found facts inevitably compelling the conclusion that the act to regulate commerce had been fully complied with, even if such inference was not sufficiently sustained by the findings of the trial court which the appellate court adopted. Because we thus find the question not open for consideration we must not be considered as conceding the correctness of the conclusion attempted to be drawn from the supposed failure to post.\n We are thus brought to the underlying proposition in the case,-viz., the effect of the act to regulate commerce upon the claim asserted by the oil company. As presented below and pressed at bar, the question takes a seemingly two-fold aspect,-the jurisdiction of the court below as affected by the act to regulate commerce and the right to the relief sought consist- \n\n[204 U.S. 426, 436]\n\u00a0\n ently with that act, even if jurisdiction existed. We say that these questions are only seemingly different, because they present but different phases of the fundamental question, which is the scope and effect of the act to regulate commerce upon the right of a shipper to maintain an action at law against a common carrier to recover damages because of the exaction of an alleged unreasonable rate, although the rate collected and complained of was the rate stated in the schedule filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission and published according to the requirements of the act to regulate commerce, and which it was the duty of the carrier under the law to enforce as against shippers. We come, therefore, first, to the consideration of that subject.\n Without going into detail, it may not be doubted that, at common law, where a carrier refused to receive goods offered for carriage except upon the payment of an unreasonable sum, the shipper had a right of action in damages. It is also beyond controversy that, when a carrier accepted goods, without payment of the cost of carriage or an agreement as to the price to be paid, and made an unreasonable exaction as a condition of the delivery of the goods, an action could be maintained to recover the excess over a reasonable charge. And it may further be conceded that it is now settled that even where, on the receipt of goods by a carrier, an exorbitant charge is stated, and the same is coercively exacted, either in advance or at the completion of the service, an action may be maintained to recover the overcharge. 2 Kent, Com. 599, and note a; 2 Smith, Lead. Cas. pt. 1, 8th ed. (Hare & W. notes) p. 457.\n As the right to recover, which the court below sustained, was clearly within the principles just stated, and as it is conceded that the act to regulate commerce did not, in so many words, abrogate such right, it fofollows that the contention that the right was taken away by the act to regulate commerce rests upon the proposition that such result was accomplished b implication. In testing the correctness of this proposition we \n\n[204 U.S. 426, 437]\n\u00a0\n concede that we must be guided by the principle that repeals by implication are not favored, and, indeed, that a statute will not be construed as taking away a common-law right existing at the date of its enactment, unless that result is imperatively required; that is to say, unless it be found that the pre-existing right is so repugnant to the statute that the survival of such right would in effect deprive the subsequent statute of its efficacy; in other words, render its provisions nugatory.\n Both parties concede that the question for decision has not been directly passed upon by this court, and that its determination is only persuasively influenced by adjudications of other courts. They both, hence, mainly rely upon the text of the act to regulate commerce as it existed at the time the shipments in question were made. The case, therefore, must rest upon an interpretation of the text of the act and is measurably one of first impression.\n Let us, without gogoing into detail, give an outline of the general scope of that act, with the object of fixing the rights which it was intended t conserve or create, the wrongs which it proposed to redress, and the remedies which the act established to accomplish the purposes which the lawmakers had in view.\n The act made it the duty of carriers subject to its provisions to charge only just and reasonable rates. To that end the duty was imposed of establishing and publishing schedules of such rates. It forbade all unjust preferences and discriminations, made it unlawful to depart from the rates in the established schedules until the same were changed as authorized by the act, and such departure was made an offense punishable by fine or imprisonment, or both, and the prohibitions of the act and the punishments which it imposed were directed not only against carriers but against shippers, or any person who, directly or indirectly, by any machination or device, in any manner whatsoever, accomplished the result of producing the wrongful discriminations or preferences which the act forbade. It was made the duty of carriers subject to the act \n\n[204 U.S. 426, 438]\n\u00a0\n to file with the Interstate Commerce Commission created by that act copies of established schedules, and power was conferred upon that body to provide as to the form of the schedules, and penalties were imposed for not establishing and filing the required schedules. The Commission was endowed with plenary administrative power to supervise the conduct of carriers, to investigate their affairs, their accounts, and their methods of dealing, and generally to enforce the provisions of the act. To that end it was made the duty of the district attorneys of the United States, under the direction of the Attorney General, to prosecute proceedings commenced by the Commission to enforce compliance with the act. The act specially provided that whenever any common carrier subject to its provisions 'shall do, cause to be done, or permit to be done, any act, matter, or thing in this act prohibited or declared to be unlawful, or shall omit to do any act, matter, or thing in this act required to be done, such common carrier shall be liable to the person or persons injured thereby for the full amount of damages sustained in consequence of any such violation of the provisions of this act. . . .' [24 Stat. at L. 382, chap. 104,  8, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3159.] Power was conferred upon the Commission to hear complaints concerning violations of the act, to investigate the same, and, if the complaints were well founded, to direct not only the making of reparation to the injured persons, but to order the carrier to desist from such violation in the future. In the event of the failure of a carrier to obey the order of the Commission, that body, or the party in whose favor an award of reparation was made, was empowered to compel compliance by invoking the authority of the courts of the United States in the manner pointed out in the statute, prima facie effect in such courts being given to the findings of fact made by the Commission. By the 9th section of the act it was provided as follows:\n'That any person or persons claiming to be damaged by any common carrier subject to the provisions of this act may either make complaint to the Commission, as hereinafter provided for, or may bring suit in his or their own behalf for the recovery \n\n[204 U.S. 426, 439]\n\u00a0\n of the damages for which such common carrier may be liable under the provisions of this act, in any district or circuit court of the United States of competent jurisdiction; but such person or persons shall not have the right to pursue both of said remedies, and must, in each case, elect which one of the two methods of procedure herein provided for he or they will adopt. . . .'\n\n And by  22, which we shall hereafter fully consider, existing appropriate commonlaw and statutory remedies were saved.\n When the act to regulate commerce was enacted there was contrariety of opinion whether, when a rate charged by a carrier was, in and of itself reasonable, the person from whom such a charge was exacted had at common law an action against the carrier because of damage asserted to have been suffered by a discrimination against such person or a preference given by the carrier to another. Rarsons v. Chicago & N. W. R. Co. \n167 \nU.S. 447, 455\n, 42 S. L. ed. 231, 234, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 887; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Baltimore & O. R. Co. \n145 \nU.S. 263, 275\n, 36 S. L. ed. 699, 703, 4 Inters. Com. Rep. 92, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 884. That the act to regulate commerce was intended to afford an effective means for redressing the wrongs resulting from unjust discrimination and undue preference is undoubted. Indeed, it is not open to controversy that to provide for these subjects was among the principal purposes of the act. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Cincinnati, N. O. & T. P. R. Co. \n167 \nU.S. 479, 494\n, 42 S. L. ed. 243, 251, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 896. And it is apparent that the means by which these great purposes were to be accomplished was the placing upon all carriers the positive duty to establish schedules of reasonable rates which should have a uniform application to all, and which should not be departed from so long as the established schedule remained unaltered in the manner provided by law. Cincinnati, N. O. & T. P. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n162 U.S. 184\n, 40 L. ed. 935, 5 Inters. Com. Rep. 391, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 700, \n167 U.S. 479\n, 42 L. ed. 243, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 896.\n When the general scope of the act is enlightened by the \n\n[204 U.S. 426, 440]\n\u00a0\n considerations just stated it becomes manifest that there is not only a relation, but an indissoluble unity, between the provision for the establishment and maintenance of rates until corrected in accordance with the statute and the prohibitions against preferences and discrimination. This follows, because, unless the requirement of a uniform standard of rates be complied with, it would result that violations of the statute as to preferences and discrimination would inevitably follow. This is clearly so, for if it be that the standard of rates fixed in the mode provided by the statute could be treated on the complaint of a shipper by a court and jury as unreasonable, without reference to prior action by the Commission, finding the established rate to be unreasonable, and ordering the carrier to desist in the future from violating the act, it would come to pass that a shipper might obtain relief upon the basis that the established rate was unreasonable, in the opinion of a court and jury, and thus such shipper would receive a preference or discrimination not enjoyed by those against whom the schedule of rates was continued to be enforced. This can only be met by the suggestion that the judgment of a court, when based upon a complaint made by a shipper without previous action by the Commission, would give rise to a change of the schedule rate and thus cause the new rate resulting from the action of the court to be applicable in future as to all. This suggestion, however, is manifestly without merit, and only serves to illustrate the absolute destruction of the act and the remedial provisions which it created which would arise from a recognition of the right asserted. For if, without previous action by the Commission, power might be exerted by courts and juries generally to determine the reasonableness of an established rate, it would follow that, unless all courts reached an identical conclusion, a uniform standard of rates in the future would be impossible, as the standard would fluctuate and vary, dependent upon the divergent conclusions reached as to reasonableness by the various courts called upon to consider the subject as an original question. Indeed, the recognition of such a right is \n\n[204 U.S. 426, 441]\n\u00a0\n wholly inconsistent with the administrative power conferred upon the Commission, and with the duty, which the statute casts upon that body, of seeing to it that the statutory requirement as to uniformity and equality of rates is observed. Equally obvious is it that the existence of such a power in the courts, independent of prior action by the Commission, would lead to favoritism, to the enforcement of one rate in one jurisdiction and a different one in another, would destroy the prohibitions against preferences and discrimination, and afford, moreover, a ready means by which, through collusive proceedings, the wrongs which the statute was intended to remedy could be successfully inflicted. Indeed, no reason can be perceived for the enactment of the provision endowing the administrative tribunal which the act created with power, on due proof, not only to award reparation to a particular shipper, but to command the carrier to desist from violation of the act in the future, thus compelling the alteration of the old or the filing of a new schedule, conformably to the action of the Commission, if the power was left in courts to grant relief on complaint of any shipper, upon the theory that the established rate could be disregarded and be treated as unreasonable, without reference to previous action by the Commission in the premises. This must be, because, if the power existed in both courts and the Commission to originally hear complaints on this subject, there might be a divergence between the action of the Commission and the decision of a court. In other words, the established schedule might be found reasonable by the Commission in the first instance and unreasonable by a court acting originally, and thus a conflict would arise which would render the enforcement of the act impossible.\n Nor is there merit in the contention that  9 of the act compels to the conclusion that it was the purpose of Congress to confer power upon courts primarily to relieve from the duty of enforcing the established rate by finding that the same as to a particular person or corporation was so unreasonable as to justify an award of damages. True it is that \n\n[204 U.S. 426, 442]\n\u00a0\n the general terms of the section, when taken alone, might sanction such a conclusion, but, when the provision of that section is read in connection with the context of the act, and in the light of the considerations which we have enumerated, we think the broad construction contended for is not admissible. And this becomes particularly cogent when it is observed that the power of the courts to award damages to those claiming to have been injured, as provided in the section, contemplates only a decree in favor of the individual complainant, redressing the particular wrong asserted to have been done, and does not embrace the power to direct the carrier to abstain in the future from similar violations of the act; in other words, to command a correction of the established schedules, which power, as we have shown, is conferred by the act upon the Commission in express terms. In other words, we think that it inevitably follows from the context of the act that the independent right of an individual originally to maintain actions in courts to obtain pecuniary redress for violations of the act, conferred by the 9th section, must be confined to redress of such wrongs as can, consistently with the context of the act, be redressed by courts without previous action by the Commission, and, therefore, does not imply the power in a court to primarily hear complaints conconcerning wrongs of the character of the one here complained of. Although an established schedule of rates may have been altered by a carrier voluntarily or as the result of the enforcement of an order of the Commission to desist from violating the law, rendered in accordance with the provisions of the statute, it may not be doubted that the power of the Commission would nevertheless extend to hearing legal complaints of, and awarding reparation to, individuals for wrongs unlawfully suffered from the application of the unreasonable schedule during the period when such schedule was in force.\n And the conclusion to which we are thus constrained by an original consideration of the text of the statute finds direct support, first, in adjudged cases in lower Federal courts, and \n\n[204 U.S. 426, 443]\n\u00a0\n in the construction which the act has apparently received from the beginning in practical execution; and, second, is persuasively supported by decisions of this court, which, whilst not dealing directly with the question here presented, yet necessarily concern the same.\n\n 1. \nIn Swift & Co. v. Philadelphia & R. R. Co. 5 Inters. Com. Rep. 116, 64 Fed. 59, it was held that, in an action at law to recover damages for the exaction of an alleged unreasonable freight charge, the rate established in conformity with the act to regulate commerce must be treated by the courts as binding upon the shipper until regularly corrected in the mode provided by the statute. And in Kinnavey v. Terminal R. Asso. 81 Fed. 802, in an able opinion, the question was carefully considered and the same doctrine was announced and applied. When it is considered that the act to regulate commerce was enacted in 1887, and that neither the diligence of counsel nor our own researches have brought into view any case except the one now under consideration holding that a court could, compatibly with the terms of that act, grant relief upon the basis that the established rate could be disregarded as unreasonable, it would seem to follow that the terms of the act had generally been treated in practical execution as incompatible with the existence of such power or right.\n And this is greatly fortified when it is borne in mind that the reports of the decisions of the Interstate Commerce Commission show that many cases have been passed upon by that body concerning the unreasonableness of a rate fixed in an established schedule, which have resulted in awarding reparation to shippers and to the making of orders directing carriers to desist from future violation of the act; that is to say, in necessary legal effect, correcting established schedules.\n\n 2. \nThe cases of Cincinnati, N. O. & T. P. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n162 U.S. 184\n, 40 L. ed. 935, 5 Inters. Com. Rep. 391, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 700; Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Behlmer, \n175 U.S. 648\n, 44 L. ed. 309, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 209; and Interstate Commerce Commission v. Louisville & N. R. Co. \n190 U.S. 275\n, 47 L. ed. 1048, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 687, involved the enforcement against carriers \n\n[204 U.S. 426, 444]\n\u00a0\n of orders of the Commission. After deciding that the orders of the Commission were not entitled to be enforced because of errors of law committed by that body, this court declined to consider the question of the reasonableness per se of the rates as an original question; in other words, the correction of the established schedule without previous consideration of the subject by the Commission.\n It was pointed out that by the effect of the act to regulate commerce it was peculiarly within the province of the Commission to primarily consider and pass upon a controversy concerning the unreasonableness per se of the rates fixed in an established schedule. It was, therefore, declared to be the duty of the courts, where the Commission had not considered such a disputed question, to remand the case to the Commission to enable it to perform that duty,-a conclusion wholly incompatible with the conception that courts, in independent proceedings, were empowered by the act to regulate commerce, equally with the Commission, primarily to determine the reasonableness of rates in force through an established schedule.\n In Gulf, C. & S. F. R. Co. v. Hefley, \n158 U.S. 98\n, 39 L. ed. 910, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 802, the facts were these: A rate had been fixed by a carrier in a bill of lading for an interstate shipment, which rate was less than that established under the provisions of the act to regulate commerce. On arrival of the goods at destination the carrier refused to deliver on tender of payment of the bill of lading rate, and demanded payment of and collected the higher established schedule rate. For so doing, the carrier was proceeded against under a statute of the state of Texas, imposing a penalty upon a carrier for charging more than the rate fixed in a bill of lading. A judgment of the state court, enforcing the penalty, was reversed, upon the ground that the state statute, as applied, was repugnant to the act to regulate commerce, the court saying (p. 102, L. ed. p. 911, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 803):\n'The carrier cannot obey one statute without sometimes exposing itself to the penalties prescribed by the other. Take the case before us: If, in disregard of the joint tariff estab- \n\n[204 U.S. 426, 445]\n\u00a0\n lished by the defendant and the St. Louis & San Francisco Railway Company and filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission, the latter company, as a matter of favoritism, had issued this bill of lading at a rate less than the tariff rate, both the defendant company and its agent would, by delivering the goods upon the receipt of only such reduced rate, subject themselves to the penalties of the national law; while, on the other hand, if the tariff rate was insisted upon, then the corporation would become liable for the damages named in the state act. In case of such a conflict the state law must yield.'\n\n In Texas & P. R. Co. v. Mugg, \n202 U.S. 242\n, 50 L. ed. 1011, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 628, the facts were as follows: On an interstate shipment a given rate, less than the lawful schedule rate, was quoted to the shipper by the agent of the railroad at the point of shipment. On the arrival of the goods at their destination the road exacted the schedule rate, whilst the shipper insisted he was entitled to the lower and quoted rate. And a recovery of the excess collected over the quoted rate was allowed by a court of the state of Texas. Reversing the judgment, it was here held that the rate fixed in the schedule filed pursuant to the act to regulate commerce was controlling, that it was, beyond the power of the carrier to depart from such rates in favor of any shipper, and that the erroneous quotation of rates made by the agent of the railroad did not justify recovery, since to do so would be, in effect, enabling the shipper, whose duty it was to ascertain the published rate, to secure a preference over other shippers, contrary to the act to regulate commerce.\n In view of the binding effect of the established rates upon both the carrier and the shipper, as expounded in the two decisions of this court just referred to, the contention now made, if adopted, would necessitate the holding that a cause of action in favor of a shipper arose from the failure of the carrier to make an agreement, when, if the agreement had been made, both the carrier and the shipper would have been guilty of a criminal offense and the agreement would have been so absolutely void as to be impossible of enforcement. Nor is \n\n[204 U.S. 426, 446]\n\u00a0\n there force in the suggestion that a like dilemma arises from the recognition of power in the Commission to award reparation in favor of an individual because of a finding by that body that a rate in an established schedule was unreasonable. As we have shown, there is a wide distinction between the two cases. When the Commission is called upon, on the complaint of an individual, to consider the reasonableness of an established rate, its power is invoked not merely to authorize a departure from such rate in favor of the complainant alone, but to exert the authority conferred upon it by the act, if the complaint is found to be just, to compel the establishment of a new schedule of rates applicable to all. And like reasoning would be applicable to the granting of reparation to an individual after the establishment of a new schedule because of a wrong endured during the period when the unreasonable schedule was enforced by the carrier and before its change and the establishment of a new one. In other words, the difference between the two is that which, on the one hand, would arise from destroying the uniformity of rates which it was the object of the statute to secure, and, on the other, from enforcing of that equality which the statute commands.\n But it is insisted that, however, cogent may be the views previously stated, they should not control, because of the following provision contained in  22 of the act to regulate commerce, viz.: '. . . Nothing in this act contained shall in any way abridge or alter the remedies now existing at common law or by statute, but the provisions of this act are in addition to such remedies.' This clause, however, cannot in reason be construed as continuing in shippers a common-law right, the continued existence of which would be absolutely inconsistent with the provisions of the act. In other words, the act cannot be held to destroy itself. The clause is concerned alone with rights recognized in or duties imposed by the act, and the manifest purpose of the provision in question was to make plain the intention that any specific remedy given by the act should be regarded as cumulative, when other ap- \n\n[204 U.S. 426, 447]\n\u00a0\n propriate common-law or statutory remedies existed for the redress of the particular grievance or wrong dealt with in the act.\n The proposition that, if the statute be construed as depriving courts generally, at the instance of shippers, of the power to grant redress upon the basis that an established rate was unreasonable without previous action by the Commission great harm will result, is only an argument of inconvenience which assails the wisdom of the legislation or its efficiency, and affords no justification for so interpreting the statute as to destroy it. Even, however, if, in any case, we were at liberty to depart from the obvious and necessary intent of a statute upon considerations of expediency, we are admonished that the suggestions of expediency here advanced are not shown on this record to be justified. As we have seen, although the act to regulate commerce has been in force for many years, it appears that, by judicial exposition and in practical execution, it has been interpreted and applied in accordance with the construction which we give it. That the result of such long-continued, uniform construction has not been considered as harmful to the public interests is persuasively demonstrated by the fact that the amendments which have been made to the act have not only not tended to repudiate such construction, but, on the contrary, have had the direct effect of strengthening and making, if possible, more imperative, the provisions of the act requiring the establishment of rates and the adhesion by both carriers and shippers to the rates as established until set aside in pursuance to the provisions of the act. Thus, by  1 of the act approved February 19, 1903, commonly known as the Elkins act [32 Stat. at L. 847, chap. 708, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1905, p. 599], which, although enacted since the shipments in question, is yet illustrative, the wilful failure upon the part of any carrier to file and publish 'the tariffs or rates and charges,' as required by the act to regulate commerce and the acts amendatory thereof, 'or strictly to observe such tariffs until changed according to law,' was made a misdemeanor, and it was also made a misdemeanor to offer, grant, \n\n[204 U.S. 426, 448]\n\u00a0\n give, solicit, accept, or receive any rebate from published rates or other concession or discrimination. And in the closing sentence of  1 it was provided as follows:\n'Whenever any carrier files with the Interstate Commerce Commission or publishes a particular rate under the provisions of the act to regulate commerce or acts amendatory thereof, or participates in any rates so filed or published, that rate, as against such carrier, its officers, or agents, in any prosecution begun under this act, shall be conclusively deemed to be the legal rate, and any departure from such rate or any offer to depart therefrom shall be deemed to be an offense under this section of this act.'\n\n And, by  3, power was conferred upon the Interstate Commerce Commission to invoke the equitable powers of a circuit court of the United States to enforce an observance of the published tariffs.\n Concluding, as we do, that a shipper seeking reparation predicated upon the unreasonableness of the established rate must, under the act to regulate commerce, primarily invoke redress through the Interstate Commerce Commission, which body alone is vested with power originally to entertain proceedings for the alteration of an established schedule, because the rates fixed therein are unreasonable, it is unnecessary for us to consider whether the court below would have had jurisdiction to afford relief if the right asserted had not been repugnant to the provisions of the act to regulate commerce. It follows, from what we have said, that the court below erred in the construction which it gave to the act to regulate commerce.\n The judgment below is, therefore, reversed, and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] U.

KELSEY(1907)\nNo. 18\nArgued: Decided: October 21, 1907\n\n\n\n This is a writ or error from this court to the surrogates' court of the county and state of New York, to review a judgment entered in that court in pursuance of an order of the court of appeals of that state. The judgment assessed a succession tax upon the personal estate of Albert Tilt, deceased, upon the ground that he was, at the time of his death, a resident of the state of New York. Before the assessment of the tax the estate of Tilt, who died testate, was fully administered in \n\n[207 U.S. 43, 44]\n\u00a0\n the courts of New Jersey, where the will was probated. In the course of the administration all the personal property, after paying debts, taxes, and charges of administration, was distributed by the executors to the beneficiaries under the will. A reversal of the judgment of the surrogates' court is sought for the reason that it did not give full faith and credit to the judicial proceedings of the state of New Jersey, as required by the Constitution and laws of the United States.\n Mr. William G. Wilson for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n[207 U.S. 43, 45]\n\u00a0\n Mr. George M. Judd for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[207 U.S. 43, 46]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Moody delivered the opinion of the court:\n In the disposition of this case we are somewhat embarrassed by our ignorance of the reasons which controlled the decision of the highest court of the state. The opinion of the surro- \n\n[207 U.S. 43, 47]\n\u00a0\n gate was very brief. His judgment was affirmed upon appeal successively by the supreme court and the court of appeals,-in each court without an opinion and with two judges dissenting. The record shows the following facts: Albert Tilt was engaged in business as a silk manufacturer in Paterson, New Jersey, until the time of his death. Until 1888 he was a resident and citizen of Paterson. In that year he removed to New York city, became a resident and citizen of New York, and remained such until some time in the year 1899. He died in New York on May 2, 1900. His residence and citizenship at the time of his death was in dispute. For many years he had owned a house in New York City, where he lived during the greater part of the year, and another house in Roxbury, New Jersey, where he lived during the summer and early autumn. It is contended by the executors of his will, the plaintiffs in error, that in the last year of his life he changed his domicil from New York City to Roxbury, and that at the time of his death he was domiciled in New Jersey. On the other hand it is contended by the comptroller of New York, the defendant in error, that his domicil continued until his death to be in New York. Upon this question the evidence was conflicting.\n After the death of Mr. Tilt, his will was admitted to probate by the surrogate of Morris county, New Jersey, who by law had jurisdiction to do this if the testator resided in the county at the time of his death. The petition for probate described the testator as 'late of the township of Roxbury, in said county,' and the letters testamentary granted on May 23, 1900, by the surrogate, described him as 'late of the county of Morris, deceased.' An order was made fixing a time within which creditors must prove claims against the estate. On the expiration of this time a further order was made, that all creditors who had neglected to bring in their claims and demands should 'be forever barred from their action therefor against the executors of said deceased.' Succession taxes, imposed by the law of New Jersey and the law of the United \n\n[207 U.S. 43, 48]\n\u00a0\n States, and all debts, were paid. The executors presented their accounts to the orphans' court of the county, and that court, acting within its jurisdiction, on June 20, 1901, allowed the accounts and directed the distribution of the estate, according to the terms of the will. The executors made the distribution in conformity with the court's order, thereby parting with all the property of the testator which had been in their hands. After the distribution had been accomplished, the state of New York for the first time made known its claim for a transfer tax. The comptroller of the state filed his petition with the surrogate of the county of New York. In response to this petition, on August 16, 1901, Robert Mazet was appointed by the surrogate as appraiser, to fix the fair market value of the property of Albert Tilt, deceased. This was done with the view of ascertaining the amount of a transfer tax due under a section of a statute providing for such a tax 'when the transfer is by will or by the intestate laws of this state from any person dying seised and possessed of the property while a resident of the state.' On March 6, 1903, Mazet filed his report in the surrogate's court. The material part of this report was: First, that the net personal property of the deceased 'subject to tax herein' was, at the time of his death, of the fair market value of $ 1,056,951.22; second, that Tilt was a resident of New York City at the time of his death; third, that he left a will which had been 'duly admitted to probate in the surrogate's court of the county of Morris, state of New Jersey;' fourth, after stating the disposition of his property made by the testatory by this will, the report appraised the estate 'subject to tax herein' at its fair market value at the amount already stated. On June 15, 1903, the surrogate entered an order adopting the value of the property reported by the appraiser and assessing the amount of the transfer tax specifically on each bequest contained in the will. The total tax amounted to about $13,000. On August 10, 1903, a paper, entitled 'Appeal to the Surrogate,' was filed by the executors. This paper gave notice of an \n\n[207 U.S. 43, 49]\n\u00a0\n appeal to the surrogate from the appraisement, assessment, and determination of the transfer tax, and from the surrogate's own order of June 15. The only ground of appeal which need be stated here is the fifth, which alleged 'that the right to assess or impose a tax under the laws of the state of New York upon the transfer of the property of the testator, if there ever was any such right, was barred before the commencement of this proceeding, by a decree of the orphans' court of Morris county, New Jersey, a court of competent jurisdiction, made on the 25th day of February, 1901, barring all claims against the said testator or his estate which had not been presented and proved to said executors, pursuant to public notice heretofore given and published, as prescribed by the laws of the state of New Jersey; and by the further decree of the same court, made on the 20th day of June, 1901, directing the distribution of the estate of said testator in the hands of said executors, according to the terms of the will of the said Albert Tilt, deceased; in obedience to which the said executors, without any notice or knowledge of any claim or liability for the payment of a transfer tax under the laws of the state of New York, distributed the said estate, so that there was not, at the time of the commencement of this proceeding, and is not now, any property of the said estate in the hands of said executors.' It was then agreed by counsel that the surrogate should determine on affidavits whether or not Albert Tilt was a resident of New York at the time of his death. Pending the consideration of this question the executor requested in writing certain findings of facts and conclusions of law, of which only two need be stated here. They are as follows: (2) 'Under the Constitution of the United States full faith and credit must be given to the probate of said will and codicil of said Albert Tilt in the state of New Jersey, and to the accounting and distribution made by his executors under the decree of the orphans' court of Morris county, in said state, of the estate of said Albert Tilt as a resident of New Jersey at the time of his death.' (3) 'None of the personal \n\n[207 U.S. 43, 50]\n\u00a0\n estate of said Albert Tilt is subject to the payment of a transfer tax under the laws of the state of New York, excepting only such of his personal estate as was actually within the state of New York at the time of his death.' These requests were refused by the surrogate, who, in a short opinion, found as a fact that Tilt was a resident of New York at the time of his death, and ruled that his personal estate, wherever situated, was subject to the payment of a transfer tax under the laws of New York. An order was accordingly entered affirming the order of June 15. Thereupon the executors filed exceptions, the last two of which were as follows: (20) 'To the refusal of the said surrogate to find, as a conclusion of law, that, under the Constitution of the United States, full faith and credit must be given to the probate of said will and codicil of said Albert Tilt in the state of New Jersey, and to the accounting and distribution made by his executors under the decree of the orphans' court of Morris county in said state, of the estate of said Albert Tilt as a resident of New Jersey at the time of his death. (21) To the refusal of the said surrogate to find, as a conclusion of law, that none of the personal estate of said Albert Tilt is subject to the payment of a transfer tax under the laws of the state of New York, excepting only such of his personal estate as was actually within the state of New York at the time of his death.' An appeal was then taken, and, as already stated, the action of the surrogate was affirmed by the supreme court and the court of appeals. The proceedings before the surrogate are somewhat fully set forth, because it is contended that no Federal question was properly and seasonably raised in the state courts. We think, however, that a right under the Constituion of the United States was specially set up and claimed by the executors, as required by  709 of the Revised States (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 575), and denied by the highest court of the state, and that therefore we have authority to re-examine the decision. It appears clearly in the paper entitled 'Appeal to the Surrogate' that the executors relied upon the judicial proceedings in New Jersey as a defense to the assessment of \n\n[207 U.S. 43, 51]\n\u00a0\n the New York tax. They 'specially set up and claimed' a right under those proceedings, though it was not in terms stated to be a right claimed under the Constitution. This, in the case of a judgment of the court of another state, has been held to be a sufficient compliance with the statute. Great Western Teleg. Co. v. Purdy, \n162 U.S. 329\n, 40 L. ed. 986, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 810; Bell v. Bell, \n181 U.S. 175\n, 45 L. ed. 804, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 551; Andrews v. Andrews, \n188 U.S. 15\n, 47 L. ed. 366, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 237; and see the remark of the Chief Justice in Mutual L. Ins. Co. v. McGrew, \n188 U.S. 291\n, at page 311, 47 L. ed. 480, at page 485, 63 L.R.A. 33, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 375. Moreover, while the surrogate still had the appeal under consideration and undecided, requests in writing were made to him which clearly and specifically set up the claim that the full faith and credit due, under the Constitution, to the judicial proceedings of the state of New Jersey, forbade the assessment of the tax. These requests were entertained and the claim denied by the surrogate and an exception taken. Upon the record thus made an appeal was taken, and in the disposition of the appeal the Federal question was necessarily passed upon by the highest court of the state, whose decision, therefore, we may re-examine.\n That re-examination, however, must be confined to the single question whether, by the assessment of the tax, full faith and credit has been denied to the judicial proceedings of the state of New Jersey, in violation of article 4,  1, of the Constitution. In the consideration of this question, the first inquiry which presents itself is whether the adjudication of the New Jersey court, that Tilt was, at the time of his death, a resident of New Jersey, was conclusive upon the state of New York, a stranger to the proceedings. If it was, that is the end of the case; because then New York could not take the first step necessary to bring the estate within the provision of the tax law of that state. But, upon principle and authority, that adjudication, though essential to the assumption of jurisdiction to grant letters testamentary, was neither conclusive on the question of domicil, nor even evidence of it in a collateral proceeding. Thormann v. Frame, \n176 U.S. 350\n, 44 L. ed. 500, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 446; \n\n[207 U.S. 43, 52]\n\u00a0\n Overby v. Gordon, \n177 U.S. 214\n, 44 L. ed. 741, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 603; Dallinger v. Richardson, 176 Mass. 77, 57 N. E. 224, and see Mutual Ben. L. Ins. Co. v. Tisdale, \n91 U.S. 238\n, 23 L. ed. 314; De Mora v. Concha, L. R. 29 Ch. Div. 268, Affirmed in L. R. 11 App. Cas. 541; Brigham v. Fayerweather, 140 Mass. 411, 5 N. E. 265. The difference in the effect of a judgment on the res before the court and of the adjudication of the facts on which the judgment is based is pointed out by Mr. Justice Holmes in the last case. In an opinion holding that a decree of a probate court admitting a will to probate was not, on an issue between parties, one of whom was not a party to the probate proceedings, competent evidence of the testator's mental capacity, he said: 'A judgment in rem is an act of the sovereign power; and, as such, its effects cannot be disputed; at least, within the jurisdiction. If a competent court declares a vessel forfeited, or orders it sold free of all claims, or divorces a couple, or establishes a will, . . . a paramount title is passed, the couple is divorced, the will is established as against all the world, whether parties or not, because the sovereign has said that it shall be so. . . . But the same is true when the judgment is that A recover a debt of B. The public force is pledged to collect the debt from B, and no one within the jurisdiction can oppose it. And it does not follow in the former case any more than in the latter, nor is it true, that the judgment, because conclusive on all the world in what we may call its legislative effect, is equally conclusive upon all as an adjudication of the facts upon which it is grounded. On the contrary, those judgments, such as sentences of prize courts, to which the greatest effect has been given in collateral proceedings, are said to be conclusive evidence of the facts upon which they proceed only against parties who were entitled to be heard before they were rendered. . . . We may lay on one side, then, any argument based on the misleading expression that all the world are parties to a proceeding in rem. This does not mean that all the world are entitled to be heard; and, as strangers in interest are not entitled to be heard, there is no reason why they should be bound by the \n\n[207 U.S. 43, 53]\n\u00a0\n findings of fact, although bound to admit the title or status which the judgment establishes.' We think that this quotation expresses the correct rule and that it is sustained by the decisions of this court. Applying it here, it follows that the full faith and credit due to the proceedings of the New Jersey court do not require that the courts of New York shall be bound by its adjudication on the question of domicil. On the contrary, it is open to the courts of any state, in the trial of a collateral issue, to determine, upon the evidence produced, the true domicil of the deceased.\n But assuming that the New York court had the right to determine, and determined rightly, the domicil of the deceased, what then? The grievance here is not the finding that Mr. Tilt died a resident of New York. It is the assessment, based upon that finding, of a transfer tax upon the legacies contained in his will. The real question in the case is whether the assessment of that tax by the state of New York is consistent with the full faith and credit required by the Constitution to be given to the judicial proceedings of another state. After the will had been allowed and letters testamentary had been issued by the New Jersey surrogate, the executors named in the will took possession of all the personal property of the testator (the real property not being concerned in this litigation) and began to administer it in accordance with the terms of the will and under the direction of the court. That property, appraised at about $1,000, 000, consisted of bank deposits almost entirely in New Jersey banks, life insurance policies, a few small mortgages, notes, and accounts receivable, furniture, horses, and carriages, and (constituting more than eight tenths of the whole of the personal estate) stock in New Jersey corporations. A limit of time was fixed for the presentation of claims against the estate, at the expiration of which it was decreed that all creditors who had neglected to bring in their demands should be barred from any action thereon against the executors. What was then done appears in an affidavit of a witness, which was agreed by counsel in \n\n[207 U.S. 43, 54]\n\u00a0\n the hearing before the New York surrogate to show the facts. The affidavit is in part as follows: 'Said executors accounted as such in the orphans' court of said Morris county, New Jersey, which court had jurisdiction under the laws of New Jersey to entertain such accounting and to direct final distribution of the estate of said testator thereon, and such proceedings were thereupon had that on June 20, 1901, a decree was made in said orphans' court by the judge presiding therein, finally settling and allowing the accounts of said executors, and directing the distribution of the balance of the estate of said Albert Tilt remaining in the hands of said executors according to the terms of said will. Thereupon and prior to August, 1901, such distribution was made by said executors pursuant to the terms of said will, in conformity with the direction of said decree, and thereafter there remained in the hands of said executors no money or personal property whatsoever of the estate of said Albert Tilt.'\n Thus, executors appointed by a court having, upon the face of the record, authority to make the appointment, had accounted for the property which had come into their hands to the court having jurisdiction, under the laws of the state, to pass on the accounts, and, without knowledge of any claim by the state of New York, had, by the direction of the court, acting within its jurisdiction, paid out the whole estate to those who were entitled to it by the will. All that was done by the executors, and all that was received by the beneficiaries in the disposition of the estate, was done and received by orders of court, duly entered in the course of judicial proceedings. For the purpose of enabling the executors to distribute the estate with safety to themselves, in accordance with a common practice in the settlement of the estate of deceased persons, and under authority conferred by the laws of the state, court, prior to the distribution, had decreed that all those who had neglected to bring in their claims should be 'forever barred from their action therefor against the executors of the deceased.' Upon these facts, does the assessment of this \n\n[207 U.S. 43, 55]\n\u00a0\n transfer tax by the state of New York, by whose laws the tax thus assessed is made a lien on the property transferred and a personal obligation of the transferee and the executors (Laws of 1896, chap. 908,  222), give the full faith and credit to which these judicial proceedings are entitled? The answer to this question depends upon the nature of the proceedings and their effect upon the rights of those persons who were not parties or privies to them. If they are binding upon such persons, the state of New York may not levy a tax upon property which has been transferred free from the burden, and impose a personal liability on the executors, who have been declared forever exempt from all demands against the estate. The enforcement of the claim for such a tax against the property, against the distributees of the property, and against those who have distributed it, under the direction of the court, and with its assurance that no claims against them shall longer exist, is plainly inconsistent with the judicial proceedings of which the property has been administered. Is, then, the nature of the proceedings such that they are binding not only upon those who were parties or privies to them, but upon all others as well?\n When the owners of property die, that property, under the conditions and restrictions of the law applicable, is transmitted to their successors named by their wills or by the laws regulating inheritance in cases of intestacy. For a suitable time it is essential that the property should remain under the control of the state, until all just charges against it can be discovered and paid, and those entitled to it as new owners can be ascertained. It is in the public interest that the property should come under the control of the new owners, after such delays only as will afford opportunity for investigation and hearing to guard against mistake, injustice, or fraud. It is the duty of the sovereign to provide a tribunal, under whose direction the just demands against the estate may be determined and paid, the succession decreed, and the estate devolved to those who are found to be entitled to it. Sometimes this duty is \n\n[207 U.S. 43, 56]\n\u00a0\n performed by conferring jurisdiction upon a single court and sometimes by dividing the jurisdiction among two or three courts. The courts may be termed ecclesiastical, probate, orphans', surrogate, or equity courts. The jurisdiction may be exercised exclusively in one, or divided among two or more, as the sovereign shall determine. But somewhere the power must exist to decide finally, as against the world, all questions which arise in the settlement of the succession. Mistakes may occur and sometimes do occur, but it is better that they should be endured than that, in a vain search for infallibility, questions shall remain open indefinitely. As was said by Mr. Justice Bradley, speaking on this subject in Broderick's Will ( Kieley v. McGlynn) 21 Wall. 503, p. 519, 22 L. ed. 599, p. 605: 'The world must move on and those who claim an interest in persons and things must be charged with knowledge of their status and condition and of the vicissitudes to which they are subject. This is the foundation of all judicial proceedings in rem.' It is therefore within the power of the sovereign to give to its courts the authority, while settling the succession of estates in their possession, through their officers, the executors or administrators, to determine finally, as against the world, all questions which arise therein.

W. 99.\n In respect to the settlement of the successions to property on death the states of the Union are sovereign and may give to their judicial proceedings such conclusive effect, subject to the requirements of due process of law and to any other constitutional limitation which may be applicable. \n\n[207 U.S. 43, 57]\n\u00a0\n But though a state may attach to the judicial proceedings of the courts through which the devolution of the estates of deceased persons is accomplished, the conclusive effect which has been described, it may not choose to do so, or may choose to do so only in respect of part of the adjudications made in the course of the settlement of the succession. It may, for instance, choose to regard the probate of a will or the grant of letters of administration as conclusive on all, and, on the other hand, to regard an order of distribution as open to attack in a collateral proceeding by those who were not parties to it. The extent to which such proceedings shall be held conclusive is a matter to be determined by each state according to its own views of public policy. The variation in practice in the different states is considerable and no good purpose would be served by considering them. It is enough to instance that in the states of Connecticut and Massachusetts, according to the cases just cited, a decree of distribution is binding upon all, while in the state of New York it appears not to be binding on one who was not a party to it. Re Killan, 172 N. Y. 547, 63 L.R.A. 95, 65 N. E. 561.\n When, therefore, we come to consider what faith and credit must be given to these judicial proceedings of New Jersey, we must first ascertain what effect that state attaches to them. The statute enacted to carry into effect the constitutional provision provided that they should have, in any court within the United States, such faith and credit 'as they have by law or usage in the courts of the state from which they are taken.' Act May 26, 1790 [1 Stat. at L. 122, chap. 11], now  905, Rev. Stat. (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 677). They can have no greater or less or other effect in other courts than in those of their own state. Cheever v. Wilson, 9 Wall. 108, 19 L. ed. 604; Board of Public Works v. Columbia College, 17 Wall. 521, 21 L. ed. 687; Robertson v. Pickrell, \n109 U.S. 608\n, 27 L. ed. 1049, 3 Sup. Ct. Rep. 407; Hancock Nat. Bank v. Farnum, \n176 U.S. 640\n, 44 L. ed. 619, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 506. In ascertaining, on a writ of error to a state court, what credit is given to these judicial proceedings by the laws and usages of the state of New Jersey, we are limited to the evidence on that subject before the court whose judgment we are reviewing. Hanley v. Donoghue, \n116 U.S. 1\n, 29 L. ed. 535, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 242; \n\n[207 U.S. 43, 58]\n\u00a0\n Chicago & A. R. Co. v. Wiggins Ferry Co. \n119 U.S. 622\n, 30 L. ed. 522, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 398. The only evidence upon this point was in an affidavit of an attorney and counselor at law of that state. The evidence is meagre and not entirely satisfactory and conclusive. It was, however, uncontradicted. It tended to show that the surrogate had jurisdiction to probate the will and issue letters testamentary, and that the probate and issue of letters could not be impeached in a collateral proceeding; that the surrogate had 'under the laws of New Jersey full and competent jurisdiction' to make the order limiting the time for creditors of the estate to bring in their demands, and the subsequent order that all who had neglected to do so 'should be forever barred from their action therefor against the executors of said deceased;' that the acts of the surrogate cannot be impeached collaterally, and that the orphans' court had jurisdiction under the laws of New Jersey 'to direct final distribution of the estate of said testator,' and it cited four cases from the New Jersey reports (Re Coursen, 4 N.J. Eq. 408; Quidort v. Pergeaux, 18 N. J. Eq. 472; Ryno v. Ryno, 27 N. J. Eq. 522; and Re Straub, 49 N. J. Eq. 264, 24 Atl. 569). In relying upon evidence of this kind we are quite aware that we may not ascertain with the precision which might be desired the credit which the state of New Jersey attaches to these judicial proceedings. But it is all that we can have. We think that we may safely infer from it that the order of the surrogate barring all creditors who had failed to bring in the demand from any further claim against the executors was binding upon all. It was an order which he had 'full and competent authority to make,' and it was one of the acts which could not be impeached collaterally. We think, also, that the jurisdiction to direct a final distribution means a distribution which shall be final, so far, at least, as any person having a demand against the estate is concerned. If we have discerned correctly the effect which New Jersey gives to these judicial proceedings, it is obvious that the assessment of this tax renies them full faith and credit in two respects: First, in seeking a part of an estate \n\n[207 U.S. 43, 59]\n\u00a0\n which has been finally distributed to those who were entitled to it under the will; and, second, in fixing a personal responsibility for the tax upon the executors who had been conclusively exonerated from such a liability.\n Up to this point it has been assumed that the New Jersey court had jurisdiction to probate the will and administer the estate, and what has been said upon the effect of the judicial proceedings has been based upon that assumption. When, however, full faith and credit is demanded for a judgment in the courts of other states, an inquiry into the jurisdiction is always permitted, and if it be shown that the proceedings relied upon were without the jurisdiction of the court, they need not be respected. Thompson v. Whitman, 18 Wall. 457, 21 L. ed. 897; Thormann v. Frame, \n176 U.S. 350\n, 44 L. ed. 500, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 446, and cases cited.\n The defendant in error, acting upon this well-settled rule, might have attacked the jurisdiction of the New Jersey courts, and thus brought forward for consideration many important questions which, in the view we take of the case, need not even be stated. But there was no attempt, except in argument here, to deny the right of the New Jersey court to act upon the paper writing, purporting to dispose of the estate of Tilt, and, by admitting it to probate, to convert it into an operative will. It is true that, as a basis of assessing transfer taxes, it was proved that Tilt was a resident of New York at the time of his death,-a fact which would be relevant to the question of jurisdiction. But that fact was not proved or used for the purpose of invalidating the proceedings taken in probating the will and administering the estate. On the contrary, the taxes were based upon the provisions of the instrument, which derived all its authenticity as a will and all its capacity to transmit property from the judicial proceedings in New Jersey. It appears conclusively from the action taken in the New York surrogate court that there was no attempt to declare the New Jersey proceedings void because they were taken without jurisdiction. In the appraiser's report it is said that the deceased had left a will 'which was duly admitted to probate in \n\n[207 U.S. 43, 60]\n\u00a0\n the surrogate's court of the county of Morris, state of New Jersey, and that letters testamentary were issued by said surrogate court.' The specific legacies and the disposition of the residue of the estate were then stated. The surrogate, in assessing the taxes, assessed them specifically on the beneficiaries, giving their respective names and the values of the property they respectively took under the will. Two life estates and several remainders, created by the will, were valued appropriately and the taxes assessed accordingly. All this is utterly inconsistent with an attack upon the jurisdiction, and we need not consider whether it could have been made with success.\n It is quite obvious that what was done here was the assessment by one state of taxes upon transfers of personal property, taking effect under the laws of another state, entirely regardless of the situs of the property transferred. This suggests grave constitutional questions, which we cannot consider because they were not properly and seasonably raised in the court below.\n For the foregoing reasons we think that the judgment below denied to the New Jersey proceedings the full faith and credit to which they were entitled by the Constitution and laws of the United States, and accordingly it is reversed.\n Mr. Justice Harlan dissents. \n\n\n\n","153":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTINDLE v.

The complaint contained three counts, setting up separate items of damages, namely, $349.30, $230.83, and $321. 73 for goods sold, and judgment was demanded for the aggregate, with interest on each item.\n One of the defenses was that plaintiffs' claims were barred by a discharge in bankruptcy of defendant's firm, to which plaintiffs replied that they were not such as could be discharged in bankruptcy proceedings.\n The New York court of appeals held that, according to the rulings of this court in Crawford v. Burke, \n195 U.S. 176\n, 49 L. ed. 147, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 9, the alleged indebtedness to plaintiffs was covered by the discharge, and directed plaintiffs' complaint to be dismissed. 183 N. Y. 267, 76 N. E. 25.\n This writ of error was then prosecuted, and plaintiffs' counsel contends that their debts were not provable debts, and therefore not discharged, and that Crawford v. Burke might well be modified in view of certain suggestions deemed to be novel.\n Sections 17 and 63a of the bankruptcy act of 1898 read as follows:\n'Sec. 17. A discharge in bankruptcy shall release a bankrupt from all of his provable debts, except such as . . . (2) are judgments in actions for frauds, or obtaining property by false pretenses or false representations, or for wilful and malicious injuries to the person or property of another; . . . or (4) were created by his fraud, embezzlement, misappropriation, or defalcation while acting as an officer or in any fiduciary capacity.\n\n'Sec. 63. Debts which may be proved:--\n\n'(a) Debts of the bankrupt may be proved and allowed against his estate which are (1) a fixed liability, as evidenced by a judgment or an instrument in writing, absolutely owing at the time of the filing of the petition against him, whether then payable or not . . . ; (4) founded upon an open account, or upon a contract expressed or implied; and (5) founded \n\n[205 U.S. 183, 186]\n\u00a0\n upon provable debts reduced to judgments after the filing of the petition and before the consideration of the bankrupt's application for a discharge.' [30 Stat. at L. 550, 562, chap. 541, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 3428, 3447.]\n\n Counsel admit that the claims in question were all liquidated. By their nature and amount as well as by the form of the complaint they stand upon the contracts originally made. Whiteside v. Brawley, 152 Mass. 133, 134, 24 N. E. 1088\n\n\n Crawford v. Burke was an action in trover instituted in the circuit court of Cook county, Illinois, by Burke against Crawford and Valentine, plaintiffs in error, to recover damages for the wilful and fraudulent conversion of the interests of the plaintiff in certain shares of stock. There were ten counts in the declaration, five charging fraudulent conversion of that stock, and five, the obtaining of money from plaintiff in the way of margins by means of false and fraudulent representations. Defendants pleaded their discharge in bankruptcy, but were found guilty on all the counts, and judgment was entered against them, which was affirmed by the appellate court and by the supreme court of Illinois. This court held that plaintiff's claim was 'provable under the bankruptcy act,' that is, was 'susceptible of being proved,' and that it might have been proved under  63a as 'founded upon an open account or upon a contract express or implied,' if plaintiff had chosen to waive the tort and take his place with the other creditors of the estate. And that the words, in the fourth subdivision of  17, 'while acting as an officer, or in any fiduciary capacity,' extended to 'fraud, embezzlement, misappropriation' as well as 'defalcation.'\n That case completely determines this, as the New York Court of Appeals correctly held.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","154":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTINSLEY v.

Bradford, Marcellus Green, and Garner Wynn Green for appellant.\n\n\n\n[205 U.S. 20, 23]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General McReynolds and Solicitor General Hoyt for appellees. \n\n[205 U.S. 20, 24]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n In May, 1906, the grand jury in the United States circuit court for the middle district of Tennessee returned an indictment against thirty corporations, two partnerships, and twenty-five persons, as defendants. This indictment contained six counts. Generally speaking, the first, second, fourth, and fifth charged the defendants with violating  1 of the act of Congress approved July 2, 1890, entitled 'An Act to Protect Trade and Commerce against Unlawful Restraints and Monopolies' [26 Stat. at L. 209, chap. 647, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3200], and the third and sixth counts charged them under  5440 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3676). In July, 1906, the government presented to the district judge of the eastern district of Virginia, at Richmond, a complaint made by Morgan Treat, United States Marshal, alleging that he believed James G. Tinsley stood indicted as aforesaid, and \n\n[205 U.S. 20, 25]\n\u00a0\n annexing a certified copy of the indictment as a part of the complaint, and praying that Tinsley might 'be arrested and imprisoned and removed or bailed, as the case may be, for trial before the said circuit court of the United States for the middle district of Tennessee, and further dealt with according to law.' Tinsley was arrested and taken directly before the district judge, who acted as committing magistrate as well as the judge to order removal. In the proceedings before the district judge, Tinsley admitted that he was one of the defendants named in the indictment. The government relied on the certified copy of the indictment, and offered no evidence except that; and asked for an order to be made for Tinsley's commitment and removal forthwith.\n The record of those proceedings states:\n'And thereupon the defendant, J. G. Tinsley, offered himself as witness in his own behalf, and, being about to be sworn, the United States, by its counsel, thereupon objected to the witness being sworn or to any testimony being given in rebuttal of the indictment in these proceedings, on the ground that, the identity of the defendant being admitted, insamuch as the indictment on its face charges offenses against the United States, committed and triable in the jurisdiction in which the defendant stands indicted, no evidence is admissible here to impeach the indictment, and the order of commitment should be made without other proof.\n\n'The defendant's counsel thereupon offered to prove by the defendant and other witnesses, then and there present, that the circuit court for the middle district of Tennessee had no jurisdiction over the person of said defendant touching the offenses charged in said indictment, in that defendant and said other witnesses would, if permitted, testify that defendant is, and has been for many years, a resident and citizen of the city of Richmond, state of Virginia, and that defendant never, at any time, or at any place in the state of Tennessee, at the times charged in the indictment, did or performed, or was party to, or engaged in, any act or thing in the said indictment \n\n[205 U.S. 20, 26]\n\u00a0\n charged as having been done and performed in any way whatsoever by this defendant in the said state of Tennessee; nor has defendant done, or performed, or been engaged in, or a party to, the same or any of them in any other place or places at any other time or times whatsoever.\n\n'Thereupon counsel for the government renewed its objections as aforesaid:\n\n'After hearing counsel on both sides, the court announced its conclusions as follows:\n\n\"The conclusion reached by the court is that, in a proceeding for the arrest and removal of persons charged with a violation of the laws of the United States pursuant to  1014 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 716), before a United States district judge, sitting in the state of Virginia, in which state there no longer exists the right of a preliminary examination upon a crime charged prior to the trial upon the merits, when said judge is called upon to act as well in the matter of the apprehension of such persons as in their removal to the jurisdiction in which they have been indicted, that upon the government's presentation of a sufficient indictment, regularly found by a grand jury in a court of the United States, properly charging the commission of an offense within the district in which such indictment is found, coupled with proof of the identity of the person indicted, it is its duty to properly bail such person for appearance before the court in which he is indicted, or cause him to be removed thereto.\"\n\n It was then ruled that the testimony offered was inadmissible, and the district judge ordered that the accused either give bail or be held for removal. Tinsley declined to give bond, a warrant directing removal to the middle district of Tennessee was issued, and he remained in custody pending its execution. No objection was offered to the inductment at any time during the proceedings before the district judge.\n The district judge should not have allowed himself to be controlled by the statutes of Virginia. In that commonwealth it appears to have been formerly required that after indictment \n\n[205 U.S. 20, 27]\n\u00a0\n an examination should be had; but by subsequent legislation it was provided that where an indictment had been found, a capias should be issued for the arrest of the defendant, and no inquiry was to be made. But, when there was no indictment, a person arrested for an indictable offense must be taken before a magistrate for preliminary examination, and it was the magistrate's duty to inquire whether or not there was sufficient cause for charging the accused with the offense. Pollard's Anno. Code, Va.  3955, 3969, 4003; Jones v. Com. 86 Va. 661, 10 S. E. 1005\n\n\n But, as hereinafter seen, the district judge, on application to remove, acts judicially, and that part of  1014 of the Revised Statutes of the United States which says that the proceedings are to be conducted 'agreeably to the usual mode of process against offenders in such state,' has no relation to the inquiry on application for removal.\n Application was then made to the circuit court for writs of habeas corpus and certiorari, which were granted and due returns made. The petition alleged that Tinsley was unlawfully restrained of his liberty by the marshal, under color of authority of the United States, by virtue of a warrant for removal, claimed to have been issued under  1014, Revised Statutes. It set forth in full the proceedings taken before the district judge and the rulings and orders made during the hearing. It was charged that, under and by virtue of clause 3,  2, article 3, of the Constitution, and of the 6th Amendment, he was entitled to be tried, and could only be tried for any alleged offense against the United States in the state and district where the offenses charged in the indictment were committed; that the offenses specified in the indictment were not committed in the middle district of Tennessee; that none of the acts supposed to have been engaged in by petitioner were done within that district; that the indictment stated no offense and was insufficient and void. It was further alleged that the warrant of removal was in violation of  2 of article 3 of the Constitution \n\n[205 U.S. 20, 28]\n\u00a0\n and of the 6th Amendment; that the rulings of the district judge, in holding the certified copy of the indictment conclusive and in refusing to permit the introduction of any evidence on behalf of petitioner, deprived him of rights secured by the Constitution and by  1014, Revised Statutes; and that he was deprived of his liberty without due process of law.\n At the hearing before the circuit court, in addition to the record of the proceedings before the district judge, an offer was made to prove by witnesses the facts set forth in the petition, but the court did not admit the same, because it was held that he certified copy of the indictment, with proof of the identity of the party accused, sufficiently established the existence of probable cause.\n In other words, the indictment was in effect held to be conclusive. The circuit judge said, it is true, that probable cause must be shown in order to obtain a removal, but he held that inasmuch as the copy of the indictment alone was regarded as sufficient evidence of probable cause in Beavers v. Henkel, \n194 U.S. 73\n, 48 L. ed. 882, 24Sup. Ct. Rep. 605, it was sufficient in the present case. In that case, however, no evidence was introduced to overcome the prima facie case made by the indictment except that evidence was offered as to what passed in the grand jury room, and rejected on that ground, and not because it went to the merits.\n Section 1014 of the Revised Statutes reads as follows:\n'For any crime or offense against the United States, the offender may, by any justice or judge of the United States, or by any commissioner of a circuit court to take bail, or by any chancellor, judge of a supreme or superior court, chief or first judge of common pleas, mayor of a city, justice of the peace, or other magistrate, of any state where he may be found, and agreeably to the usual mode of process against offenders in such state, and at the expense of the United States, be arrested and imprisoned, or bailed, as the case may be, for trial before such court of the United States as by law \n\n[205 U.S. 20, 29]\n\u00a0\n has cognizance of the offense. Copies of the process shall be returned as speedily as may be into the clerk's office of such court, together with the recognizances of the witnesses for their appearance to testify in the case. And where any offender or witness is committed in any district other than that where the offense is to be tried, it shall be the duty of the judge of the district where such offender or witness is imprisoned, seasonably to issue, and of the marshal to execute, a warrant for his removal to the district where the trial is to be had.'\n\n Obviously the first part of this section provides for the arrest of any offender against the United States wherever found, and without reference to whether he has been indicted; but when he has been indicted in a district in another state than the district of arrest, then, after the offender has been committed, it becomes the duty of the district judge, on inquiry, to issue a warrant of removal. And it has been repeatedly held that in such cases the judge exercises something more than a mere ministerial function, involving no judicial discretion. He must look into the indictment to ascertain whether an offense against the United States is charged, find whether there was probable cause, and determine whether the court to which the accused is sought to be removed has jurisdiction of the same. 'The liberty of the citizen, and his general right to be tried in a tribunal or forum of his domicil, imposes upon the judge the duty of considering and passing upon those questions.' Mr. Justice Jackson, then Circuit Judge, Re Greene, 52 Fed. 106. In the language of Mr. Justice Brewer, delivering the opinion in Beavers v. Henkel, supra:\n'It may be conceded that no such removal should be summarily and arbitrarily made. There are risks and burdens attending it which ought not to be needlessly cast upon any individual. These may not be serious in a removal from New York to Brooklyn, but might be if the removal was from San Francisco to New York. And statutory provisions \n\n[205 U.S. 20, 30]\n\u00a0\n must be interpreted in the light of all that may be done under them. We must never forget that in all controversies, civil or criminal, between the government and an individual, the latter is entitled to reasonable protection. Such seems to have been the purpose of Congress in enacting  1014, Rev. Stat., which requires that the order of removal be issued by the judge of the district in which the defendant is arrested. In other words, the removal is made a judicial, rather than a mere ministerial, act.'\n\n In Greene v. Henkel, \n183 U.S. 249\n, 46 L. ed. 177, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 218, Greene was indicted in the district court of the United States for the southern district of Georgia. He was arrested and taken before a commissioner in the state of New York. The commissioner held that the certified copy of the indictment was conclusive evidence of probable cause, and refused to hear any evidence on the part of the defendant; and thereupon application was made to the district judge of the southern district of New York for an order of removal. That judge held that the commissioner should have heard evidence, and remanded the case. Evidence was then taken before the commissioner, and he decided that there was probable cause. Application was again made to the district judge for an order of removal, and he held that the evidence showed the existence of probable cause, and made the order accordingly. Greene thereupon presented his petition to the circuit court for a writ of habeas corpus, which was denied, and the case brought here on appeal. The evidence before the commissioner and before the district judge was not annexed to the petition nor brought up on certiorari, so that it formed no part of the record in the habeas corpus case. We held that, in the absence of the evidence, we must assume that the finding of probable cause was sustained.\n But it was insisted that the offense was only that which was contained in the indictment, and, if the indictment were insufficient for any reason, that then no offense was charged upon which removal could be had. This court, however, \n\n[205 U.S. 20, 31]\n\u00a0\n ruled that the indictment did not preclude the government from giving evidence of a certain and definite character concerning the commission of the offense, and that the mere fact that there might be lacking in the indictment some averment of time or place or circumstance in order to render it free from technical defects would not prevent the removal if evidence were given on the hearing which supplied such defects and showed probable cause to believe the defendants guilty of the offense defectively stated in the indictment. Mr. Justice Peckham, in delivering the opinion, was careful to say that it was not held that where the indictment charged no offense against the United States or the evidence failed to show any, or, if it appeared that the offense charged was not committed or triable in the district to which the removal was sought, the judge would be justified in ordering the removal, because there would be no jurisdiction to commit or any to order the removal of the prisoner. 'There must be some competent evidence to show that an offense has been committed over which the court in the other district had jurisdiction, and that the defendant is the individual named in the charge, and that there is probable cause for believing him guilty of the offense charged.' On the facts of that case it was not found necessary to express an opinion upon the question whether the finding of an indictment was, in the proceeding under  1014, conclusive evidence of the existence of probable cause for believing the defendant in the indictment guilty of the charge set forth. Although it may be said that if the indictment were conclusive upon the accused, it would be conclusive upon the government also.\n It was held in Beavers v. Henkel, supra, Benson v. Henkel, \n198 U.S. 1\n, 49 L. ed. 919, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 569, Hyde v. Shine, \n199 U.S. 62\n, 50 L. ed. 90, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 760, as well as Greene v. Henkel, supra, that an indictment constituted prima facie evidence of probable cause, but not that it was conclusive.\n We regard that question as specifically presented in the \n\n[205 U.S. 20, 32]\n\u00a0\n present case, and we hold that the indictment cannot be treated as conclusive under  1014.\n This being so, we are of opinion that the evidence offered should have been admitted. It is contended that that evidence was immaterial, and, if admitted, could not have affected the decision of either the district or circuit judge. Of course, if the indictment were conclusive, any evidence might be said to be immaterial; but if the indictment were only prima facie, then evidence tending to show that no offense triable in the middle district of Tennessee had been committed by defendant in that district could not be regarded as immaterial.\n The Constitution provides that 'the trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by jury; and such trial shall be held in the state where the said crimes shall have been committed' (article 3,  2 ); and that 'in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed' (Amendment 6); and, in order that anyone accused shall not be deprived of this constitutional right, the judge applied to to remove him from his domicil to a district in another state must find that there is probable cause for believing him to have committed the alleged offense, and in such other district. And in doing this his decision does not determine the question of guilt any more than his view that the indictment is enough for the purpose of removal definitely determines its validity.\n Appellant was entitled to the judgment of the district judge as to the existence of probable cause on the evidence that might have been adduced, and even if the district judge had thereupon determined that probable cause existed, and such determination could not be revised on habeas corpus, it is nevertheless true that we have no such decision here, and the order of removal cannot be sustained in its absence. Nor can the exclusion of the evidence offered be treated as \n\n[205 U.S. 20, 33]\n\u00a0\n mere error, inasmuch as the ruling involved the denial of a right secured by statute under the Constitution.\n This conclusion is fatal to the order and warrant of removal and requires a reversal of the judgment below and the discharge of appellant.\n Final order reversed and cause remanded with directions to discharge appellant from custody under the order and warrant of removal, without prejudice to a renewal of the application to remove.\n Mr. Justice Harlan dissented.\n Mr. Justice Moody took no part in the disposition of the case. \n\n\n\n","155":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTRACY v. GINZBERG(1907)\nNo. 204\nArgued: February 26, 1907Decided: March 18, 1907\n\n\n\n This suit was instituted in the supreme judicial court of Massachusetts by the plaintiff in error, a citizen of New York, against the defendant in error, a citizen of Massachusetts, individually and as trustee to H. C. Long & Company, composed of H. C. Long and Frank A. Sanderson.\n The case made by the bill of complaint is as follows: On the 23d of December, 1902, the plaintiff sold to Long and Sanderson the personal property used in carrying on hotel business at a certain place in Boston, and assigned to them the lease of the realty occupied by the hotel. As partial payment therefor he took back a mortgage on the personal property for the sum of $7,500, running to the James Everard's Breweries, a corporation of New York. The mortgage covered not only \n\n[205 U.S. 170, 171]\n\u00a0\n a part of the purchase price, but also $3,000 in cash, which the plaintiff paid for the liquor license, which, on or about the above date, he procured to be assigned to Long and Sanderson and to himself, as joint owners, and also the sum of $1,400 in cash, which the plaintiff paid to the city of Boston as a fee for the liquor license issued by the board of police of that city to Long and Sanderson and to the plaintiff. That license expired by limitation on May 1st, 1903\n\n\n In consideration of the advance, by plaintiff's procurement, of the above sums of $3,000 and $1,400, Long and Sanderson, on the above date, by writing, assigned their right, title, and interest in said license to the plaintiff, covenanting and agreeing that all future applications for renewals of the license should be in the names of Long and Sanderson and the plaintiff, and that, upon such renewal being granted, they would assign, transfer, and set over any such license.\n Long and Sanderson being without money for the purpose, the plaintiff paid $1,400 to the city as the renewal fee, and thereupon a new first and fourth-class license was issued by the board of police to Long and Sanderson and the plaintiff to sell intoxicating liquors in the said hotel building. This license was taken by the plaintiff into his possession, and he had it in his possession at the bringing of this suit.\n On the payment of the license fee for 1903, 1904, Long and Sanderson, by an instrument of writing dated April 24th, 1903, assigned, transferred, and set over to the plaintiff their interest in that license, and further agreed to assign and set over to him their interest in any renewal of the license so long as they should be indebted to James Everard's Breweries. The plaintiff alleged that that assignment was for present and valuable consideration, and that by reason thereof he became the sole owner of the license.\n Long and Sanderson were adjudged bankrupts on the 23d of July, 1903, being at the time indebted, and are still indebted, to James Everard's Breweries in a sum exceeding $7,000. \n\n[205 U.S. 170, 172]\n\u00a0\n The number of first and fourth-class licenses in Boston is limited by law, and are substantially all issued each year, so that a new license cannot be issued until an old license is canceled. Old licenses are of great value to persons who desire to engage in the liquor business in Boston. They sell from $3,000 to $5,000 to persons who present them for cancelation together with an application for a new license to themselves.\n Because of the large surrender value of old licenses and of the long- continued custom of reissuing licenses to old holders until refused for cause, such licenses have been recognized by the courts of Massachusetts as property rights, and the powers of the board of police in dealing with them have been limited to the exercise of the sound discretion within the limits established by the laws of the commonwealth.\n The defendant, Ginzberg, having full knowledge of the above facts, procured the board of police, on or about the 1st of April, 1904, to cancel the plaintiff's license. This was done without notice to plaintiff or hearing on any charge of the violation of the terms of the license. With the assistance of the police board, prior to the cancelation of the license, Ginzberg sold the license for $3,000, which he refused to pay over to the plaintiff. He also collected from the city the sum of $200 as a rebate upon the plaintiff's license, and refused to account for any sum to the plaintiff whatever. In the matter complained of Ginzberg acted beyond his powers as trustee of the bankrupt estate, and, without warrant of law, disposed of [to one O'Hearn] a valuable privilege belonging to the plaintiff, and has procured the destruction and cancelation of the plaintiff's valuable rights.\n The relief prayed was that the title of the plaintiff to the first and fourth-class liquor license issued to Long and Sanderson and himself be established; that Ginzberg be ordered to account for the sums received by him as the proceeds of the plaintiff's license, and be required to pay the same over to plaintiff; that the plaintiff's losses and damages by reason of the acts of defendant be established, and that he be ordered \n\n[205 U.S. 170, 173]\n\u00a0\n to pay the same; that execution issue against Ginzberg, individually, for such sums as may be found due to the plaintiff by reason of his wrongful interference with plaintiff's property; that if, upon hearing, it should appear that defendant acted within his duties as trustee of the bankrupt estate, that the decree run against him as such trustee, but without execution thereon; and that the plaintiff have such other and further relief as may be just.\n Such is the case made by the bill. Afther answer and replication the evidence was taken by a special commissioner, to be reported to the full court. In its finding of facts the court said: 'In the case at bar, the police commissioners were satisfied that the name of Tracy was inserted in the two licenses to secure to his principal the debt or part of the debt, due from the defendants Long and Sanderson; that he was not a partner in the liquor business, and for that reason the police commissioners gave a preference to O'Hearn, who was nominated by the trustee in bankruptcy, with[out] the consent, or against the objections, of Tracy, in deciding to whom a license should be issued on the vacancy caused by Long and Sanderson going out of business. The trustee received $3,000 for the nomination by him, and I find that it is, in fact, the value of such a nomination. It follows that the $3,000 received by the defendant was received for something which he had, and not for anything which the plaintiff had, and the defendant is entitled to have the bill dismissed with costs.' By the final decree the bill was dismissed and the case carried before the full court, which affirmed the decree of the trial court.\n The supreme judicial court of Massachusetts affirmed the judgment, holding that to sell intoxicating liquor was a personal privilege, valuable as property, in a certain sense, for the personal use of the holder, but not assignable or transferable by him in any way; and that 'the value of the release is recognized as depending wholly upon the practice of the police commissioners, and because there is no legal right to assign \n\n[205 U.S. 170, 174]\n\u00a0\n the privileges of such a license, and the police commissioners refuse to be bound by assignments, or to recognize at all assignments for security, the court has decided that a holder of an assignment for security has no rights under the assignment.' Further: 'In the present case the release or assignment of the licenses by the bankrupts to one who wished to obtain licenses for the next year, induced [him] . . . to pay the trustee in bankruptcy $3,000. The money so received was not for any property owned by the plaintiff. It was for a position before the police commissioner, from which the payer had reasonable ground to expect their favorable action. The plaintiff could not control this position, or do anything that would induce the payment by O'Hearn of the money which the defendant received. Upon the facts shown, the board of police commissioners did not consider the insertion of the plaintiff's name in the original license as affecting their right to issue new licenses. It is plain that they were right as regards the licenses for the ensuing year. Whether they were right or not in regard to the plaintiff's relation to the old license is immaterial, for it is plain that the money received by the defendant was not paid on account of the plaintiff's interest. but on account of what the defendant did in enabling O'Hearn to obtain the new licenses.' 189 Mass. 260, 75 N.

Sullivan, and Lourie & Ginsberg for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of the court: \n\n[205 U.S. 170, 177]\n\u00a0\n The plaintiff insists that the action of the police commissioners deprived him of property without due process of law. The answer to this contention is that the expectation called a right or property was of the board's creation, and therefore subject to the limitations which the board imposed.\n The plaintiff also insists that by the judgment of the supreme judicial court of Massachusetts he has been deprived of his property without the due process of law guaranteed by the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. This proposition is without merit. Within the meaning of that Amendment, the court, by its judgment, did not deprive the plaintiff of property without due process of law. He sought a decree adjudging that he was entitled to the money received by Ginzberg from O'Hearn. The court, proceeding entirely upon principles of general and local law, and giving all parties interested in the question an opportunity to be \n\n[205 U.S. 170, 178]\n\u00a0\n heard, decided that plaintiff had no right to that money. The decision of a state court, involving nothing more than the ownership of property, with all parties in interest before it, cannot be regarded by the unsuccessful party as a deprivation of property without due process of law, simply because its effect is to deny his claim to own such property. If we were of opinion, upon this record, that the money received by Ginzberg from O'Hearn really belonged to Tracy,-upon which question we express no opinion,-still it could not be affirmed that the latter had, within the meaning of the Constitution, and by reason of the judgment below, been deprived of his property without due process of law. Under the opposite view every judgment of a state court involving merely the ownership of property could be brought here for review,-a result not to be though of. The 14th Amendment did not impair the authority of the states, by their judicial tribunals, and according to their settled usages and established modes of procedure, to determine finally, for the parties before them, controverted questions as to the ownership of property, which did not involve any right secured by the Federal Constitution, or by any valid act of Congress, or by any treaty. Within the meaning of that Amendment, a deprivation of property without due process of law occurs when it results from the arbitrary exercise of power, inconsistent with 'those settled usages and modes of proceeding existing in the common and statute law of England before the emigration of our ancestors, and which are shown not to have been unsuited to their civil and political condition by having been acted on by them after the settlement of this country.'

It cannot be said that the state court in this case, by its final judgment, departed from those usages or modes or proceeding.\n The judgment is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","156":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTRAVERS v. REINHARDT(1907)\nNo. 76\nArgued: Decided: April 15, 1907\n\n\n\n\n[205 U.S. 423, 424]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Bernard Carter, Arthur A. Birney, Charles H. Stanley, Edward A. Newman, and Fillmore Beall for appellants.\n\n\n[205 U.S. 423, 427]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George E. Hamilton, M. J. Colbert, William A. Gordon, and J. Holdsworth Gordon for appellees.\n\n\n[205 U.S. 423, 428]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of the court:\n This suit was originally brought for the partition or sale of \n\n[205 U.S. 423, 429]\n\u00a0\n certain real estate in the city of Washington devised by the will (and codicils thereto) of Nicholas Travers, who died in the year 1849, leaving four sons and three daughters.\n The only parts of that estate remaining in dispute are certain lots in square 291 in Washington, and the questions to be determined depend upon the construction of that will and upon the evidence touching the alleged marriage of James Travers, a son of the testator, with Sophia V. Grayson.\n By the first item of the will certain lots are devised to the testator's son Elias 'and his heirs and assigns forever in fee simple.' By the same item other lots are devised to the same son, 'which last two devises shall be subject to the general provision hereinafter made in case of any sons dying without leaving a wife or child or children.'\n By the second item the testator devised lot 5, in square 291, to his son 'Joseph Travers and his heirs forever,' and two other specified lots 'to him and his heirs forever, in fee simple;' lot 5 'being subject to the general provision aforesaid hereafter made.'\n By the third item he devised to his son Nicholas and his heirs forever certain lots in square 291 'subject to the general provision hereinafter made;' also 'to him and his heirs forever, in fee simple,' other real estate in square 36, and a designated parcel of ground in square 291, 'said piece or parcel of ground to be subject to the general provision hereafter made.'\n By the fourth item certain devises are made to the son 'James Travers and his heirs forever,' 'all of which devises are to be subject to the general provision hereinafter made.'\n Here follows, at the close of the fourth item, the 'general provision' referred to: 'With regard to the several estates hereinbefore devised to my several sons, it is hereby declared to by my will, and I do order and direct, as a general provision, that if any of my sons should die without leaving a wife or a child or children living at his death, then his estate herein devised to him, saving and excepting those portions thereof expressly granted and so named to be 'in fee simple,' and which they \n\n[205 U.S. 423, 430]\n\u00a0\n can sell and dispose of as they think fit, shall go, and be invested in fee, to my surviving sons and the child or children of such as may be dead, such child or children representing the share of the father; but if either of my sons shall, at his death, leave a wife either with or without a child or children, such wife shall be entitled to her dower rights and privileges.'\n This was follwoed in the will by certain devises for the benefit of the daughters, as well as by several codicils to the will, but it is not necessary to give their provisions in detail.\n By a codicil, dated June 26th, 1848, the testator revoked certain parts of his will, providing: 'And in lieu thereof I do hereby give and devise all of said lots or part of lots, so as aforesaid described, with the house and other improvements and appurtenances, to my son James and his heirs, subject to the express stipulations and restrictions contained in the will to which this is a codicil, wherein I declare that all and every portion of my real estate not devised by the use of the words 'in fee simple' shall be held by such devisees for life, and then according to stipulations and restrictions as therein contained and declared by said will.'\n It is contended here, as it was in the courts below, that the words in the above general provision, that 'if any of my sons should die without leaving a wife or child or children living at his death,' should be interpreted as if it read 'if any of my sons should die without leaving a wife and child or children living at his death.' The court is thus asked, by interpretation, to substitute the word 'and' in place of 'or' in the above sentence.\n Looking at all the provisions of the will, and ascertaining, as best we may, the intention of the testator, we perceive no reason for interpreting the words used by him otherwise than according to their ordinary, natural meaning.\n It is insisted by appellants that the general, dominant purpose of the testator was that his real estate should descend only through his sons, and that his daughters and their descendants should have no share therein. And the doctrine is in- \n\n[205 U.S. 423, 431]\n\u00a0\n voked that 'the predominant idea of the testator's mind, if apparent, is heeded as against all doubtful and conflicting provisions which might of themselves defeat it. The general intent and particular intent being inconsistent, the latter [the particular] must be sacrificed to the former [ the general intent].' Schouler, Wills,  476. This general doctrine is not controverted, but there are other cardinal rules in the interpretation of wills which must be regarded. Mr. Justice Story, speaking for this court, said that effect must be given 'to all the words of a will, if, by the rules of law, it can be done. And where words occur in a will their plain and ordinary sense is to be attached to them, unless the testator manifestly applies them in some other sense.' Wright v. Denn, 10 Wheat. 204, 239, 6 L. ed. 303, 312. 'The first and great rule in the exposition of wills,' said Chief Justice Marshall, 'to which all other rules must bend, is that the intention of the testator expressed in his shall prevail, provided it be consistent with the rules of law.' Smith v. Bell, 6 Pet. 68, 75, 8 L. ed. 322, 325; Finlay v. King, 3 Pet. 346, 377, 7 L. ed. 701, 712. The same thought, in substance, was expressed by Lord Chancellor Eldon in Crooke v. De Vandes, 9 Ves. Jr. 197, 205. He said that 'where words have once got a clear, settled, legal meaning, it is very dangerous to conjecture against that, upon no better foundation than simply that it is improbable the testator could have meant to do one thing by one set of words, having done another thing, using other words, as to persons in the same degree of relation to him.' It would seem clear that the words 'without leaving a wife or child or children,' where they first appear in the above general provision, were purposely chosen. They appear three times in the will, and their usual meaning is not doubtful. We think the testator meant 'or,' not 'and.' The court would not be justified in making the proposed substitution unless the whole context of the will plainly and beyond question requires that to be done in order to give effect to the will of the testator. That the words in the general provision, 'without leaving a wife or a child or children,' were deliberately selected, is to \n\n[205 U.S. 423, 432]\n\u00a0\n some extent shown by the last sentence in the first item of the will, 'which two devises shall be subject to the general provision hereinafter made in case of any sons dying without leaving a wife or child or children.' We do not think that the testator used the word 'or,' intending thereby to convey the same thought as would be expressed by 'and.' We concur with the court of appeals, speaking by Chief Justice Shepard, in holding that the words in question are unambiguous, and their obvious, ordinary meaning must not be defeated by conjecture. 25 App. D. C. 567, 576.\n The important question remains whether James Travers, the son of the testator, died leaving a wife or a child or children. If he did, then the decree below must be affirmed.\n The original bill averred that James Travers died in 1883 'without widow or lawful child or children or descendants of a child or children surviving him.' This averment was not specifically denied in the answers, but in the progress of the cause the defendants, children of the sisters of James Travers, amended their answer and alleged that he left surviving him 'his widow, Sophia V. Travers, now Sophia V. O'Brien, who was his lawful wife at the time of his death and who had been his lawful wife for many years prior thereto, and he left one child, Annie E. Travers, one of the defendants herein, who was his lawful child.' The issue thus made constituted the principal matter to which the proof was directed. Both of the courts below held that under the evidence Sophia V. was to be deemed the lawful wife of James Travers at the time of his death. Children were born to them, but they died very young. It is conceded that they left no child surviving them, Annie E. Travers being only an adopted child.\n The appellants insisted throughout the case, and now insist, that the relation between James Travers and Sophia V. was not at any time one of a matrimonial cohabitation, but an illicit or meretricious cohabitation, which did not create the relation of husband and wife.\n Upon a careful scrutiny of all the evidence as to the alleged \n\n[205 U.S. 423, 433]\n\u00a0\n marriage we think that the following facts may be regarded as established:\n\n 1. \nJames Travers, whose domicil was in the District of Columbia, and Sophia V. Grayson, whose domicil was in West Virginia, were in Alexandria together on the 15th of August, 1865, when some sort of marriage ceremony ( exactly what does not appear) was performed by a friend of Travers, whom the woman, then only about seventeen years of age, and without living parents, supposed at the time was a minister, entitled to officiate in that capacity at a marriage. She thought it was a real marriage by a minister, although he did not produce or have any license to solemnize the marriage of these parties. It must be taken upon the evidence that he was not a minister. By the statutes of Virginia then in force it was provided: 'Every marriage in this state shall be under a license and solemnized in the manner herein provided, but no marriage solemnized by any persons professing to be authorized to solemnize the same shall be deemed or adjudged to be void, nor shall the validity thereof be in any way affected on account of any want of authority in such persons, if the marriage be in all other respects lawful, and be consummated with a full belief on the part of the persons so married, or either of them, that they have been lawfully joined in marriage.'\n\n 2. \nImmediately after the affair at Alexandria the parties-the woman, from and after that occasion, assuming the name of Mrs. Travers-left Virginia and went to Shrewsbury, New Jersey, where, as husband and wife, they remained for a short time, after which they went to Belair, Harford county, Maryland, living there, as husband and wife, at a rented place.\n\n 3. \nIn 1867 Travers purchased a farm in Talbot county, Maryland, on which he lived with said Sophia until some time in 1883, when that farm was sold, and, on account of Travers's health, they removed to Point Pleasant, New Jersey, and purchased property there, having lived on the Talbot county farm, as husband and wife, for more than fifteen years. Travers died at Point Pleasant in the latter part of the year 1883, and \n\n[205 U.S. 423, 434]\n\u00a0\n five years after his death the woman, claiming to be and recognized in the community as the widow of James Travers, married a lawyer of Philadelphia, the ceremony being performed at the Catholic church in Point Pleasant.\n From the 15th of August, 1865, up to his death, on the 1st day of November, 1883,-a period of more than eighteen years,-Travers and Mrs. Travers continuously cohabited as husband and wife. During all that period they acted as if they were lawfully husband and wife, and uniformly held themselves out as sustaining that relation; and beyond all question they were regarded as husband and wife in the several communities in which they lived after leaving Alexandria in 1865. There is no proof that anyone coming in contact with them regarded them otherwise.\n\n 5. \nAbout five or six years after the latter date Mrs. Travers learned, for the first time, that Travers's 'friend,' who had officiated at the ceremony in Alexandria, was not a minister. She was asked, when giving her deposition, this question: 'Q. After you discovered, some four or five years after you went to live with Mr. Travers, that you had not been married to him according to any ceremony, did he ever make any promise to you in that regard? A. Always. Poor fellow, he would have it all right _____ Mr. Birney. We object to that. Q. And what did he say? A. Well, he would always say that it was all right, and we were just as much married as if we had been married before a priest or a minister.' Upon the basis of their being husband and wife the parties continuously rested their relations to each other up to the death of Travers.\n\n 6. \nThat Travers recognized Mrs. Travers as his wife and held her out as such, appears from many facts: (a) In a mortgage executed September 27th, 1867, to secure the balance of the purchase money due on the Talbot county farm, the mortgagors are described, both in the body of the mortgage as 'James Travers and Sophia V. Travers, \n\n[205 U.S. 423, 435]\n\u00a0\n his wife, of Harford county, in the state of Maryland,' and in the certificate of acknowledgment as 'James Travers and Sophia V. Travers, his wife,' and she signed and acknowledged the mortgage as Sophia V. Travers. ( b) By a mutilated, holographic will dated February 8th, 1881, and signed by James Travers, he gave, devised, and bequeathed 'to my wife, Sophy Virginia Travers,' all his household furniture, books, pictures, etc., to have and to hold the same to her, and her executors, administrators, trators, and assigns forever; also, to her the use, improvement, and income of his dwelling house and farm, 'to have and to hold the same to her for and during her natural life; and from and after the decease of my said wife, I give and bequeath,' etc.; and by which, further, he gave, devised, and bequeathed 'to my wife, Sophy Virginia Travers, for her sole use,' all the rest and residue of the testator's estate, real, personal, or mixed, of which he died seised and possessed, or to which he should be entitled at the time of his decease. That will concluded: 'Lastly, I do nominate and appoint my said wife sole executrix of this, my last will and testament.' (c) By a will dated at Point Pleasant, New Jersey, October 5th, 1883, witnessed by three persons, James Travers devised to his brothers and sisters all his interest and property in the District of Columbia, and 'to my wife, while she remains my widow, all my property of every description and character not hereinbeore disposed of, with full power of disposition and alienation, provided, however, that in case our daughter survives her, that all the property not disposed of prior to my wife's decease shall be and become the property of our said daughter, and, in the event of my wife's contracting another marriage, then, it is my will that she shall possess and enjoy as of her own right, only one third of the property then remaining, and that the other two thirds shall be invested and held in trust for my daughter, Annie, and paid to her upon attaining her majority. . . . I hereby appoint my wife sole executrix of this, my last will and testament.' That will was duly proven before the surrogate of Ocean county, New Jersey, partly by Mrs. Travers, and that officer certified that 'Sophia Virginia Travers, of the county of Ocean, the executrix therein named, proved the \n\n[205 U.S. 423, 436]\n\u00a0\n same before me and she is duly authorized to take upon herself the administration of the estate of the testator, agreeably to said will.' That will was duly filed and recorded in the proper office in the District of Columbia.\n In view of these facts, the question is whether the woman Sophia was to be deemed the lawful wife of James Travers at the time of his death, in 1883. Marriage in fact, as distinguished from a ceremonial marriage, may be proven in various ways. Of course, the best evidence of the exchange of marriage consent between the parties would come from those who were personally present when they mutually agreed to take each other as husband and wife, and to assume all the responsibilities of that relation. But a legal marriage may be established in other ways. It may be shown by what is called habit or repute. Referring to marriage at common law, Kent says: 'The consent of the parties may be declared before a magistrate, or simply before witnesses, or subsequently confessed or acknowledged, or the marriage may even be inferred from continual cohabitation and reputation as husband and wife, except in cases of civil actions for adultery, or in public prosecutions for bigamy or adultery, when actual proof of the marriage is required.' 2 Kent, Com. 12th ed. 88.\n Naturally, the first inquiry must have reference to what occurred at Alexandria, Virginia, in 1865, when, as the woman supposed,-in good faith, we think,-that there was a real, valid marriage between her and James Travers. But we will assume for the purposes of this case only that that marriage was not a valid one under the laws of Virginia. We do this in deference to the decision of the supreme court of appeals of Virginia in Offield v. Davis, 100 Va. 250, 263, 40 S. E. 910, in which that court, construing the above statute of that commonwealth, held it to be mandatory, not directory, and had abrogated the common law in force in Virginia, and that no marriage or attempted marriage, if it took place there, would be held valid there, unless it be shown to have been under a license, and solemnized according to the statute of that commonwealth. We will also \n\n[205 U.S. 423, 437]\n\u00a0\n assume, but only for the purposes of the present decision, and because of the earnest contentions of the appellants, that cohabitation in Maryland, as husband and wife, for more than fifteen years, and the recognition of that relation in the communities where they resided in that state, did not entitle James Travers and the woman Sophia to be regarded in that state as lawfully husband and wife. We make this assumption also because it appears here that James Travers and Sophia V. Grayson did not become husband and wife in virtue of any religious ceremony, and because it has been decided by the court of appeals of Maryland that in that state 'there cannot be a valid marriage without a religious ceremony,' although 'a marriage may be competently proved without the testimony of witnesses who were present at the ceremony.' Richardson v. Smith, 80 Md. 89, 93, 30 Atl. 568. That court also said in the same case: 'The law has wisely provided that marriage may be proved by general reputation, cohabitation, and acknowledgment; when these exist, it will be inferred that a religious ceremony has taken place; and this proof will not be invalidated because evidence cannot be obtained of the time, place, and manner of the celebration of the marriage. On this point we think it unnecessary to do more than quote from Redgrave v. Redgrave, 38 Md. 97: 'Where parties live together ostensibly as man and wife, demeaning themselves towards each other as such, and are received into society and treated by their friends and relations as having and being entitled to that status, the law will, in favor of morality and decency, presume that they have been legally married. 1 Taylor, Ev.  140, 517; Hervey v. Hervey, 2 W. Bl. 877; Goodman v. Goodman, 28 L. J. Ch. N. S. 745; Jewell v. Jewell, 1 How. 219, 232, 11 L. ed. 108, 114. Indeed, the most usual way of proving marriage, except in actions for criminal conversation and in prosecutions for bigamy, is by general reputation, cohabitation, and acknowledgment. Sellman v. Bowen, 8 Gill & J. 50, 29 Am. Dec. 524; Boone v. Purnell, 28 Md. 607, 92 Am. Dec. 713.\" We may refer, in this connection, to what the supreme court of the District of Columbia, \n\n[205 U.S. 423, 438]\n\u00a0\n speaking by Judge Merrick, who was learned in the law of Maryland, said in Thomas v. Holtzman, 7 Mackey, 62, 66: 'In the first place, it is not at all apparent that it ever was the law that a marriage in facie ecclesioe was necessary for the purpose of legitimating the issue. It is true that the court of appeals of Maryland in the last four or five years has decided that such was the law, but that decision is not binding upon us. It is laid down by Blackstone that a marriage per verba de proesenti, without the intervention of a clergyman, is a legitimate marriage. And both Story and Kent say that, according to the universal understanding in this country, a marriage per verba de proesenti, without the intervention of a clergyman, followed by cohabitation, makes a legitimate marriage.'\n In Voorhees v. Voorhees, 46 N. J. Eq. 411, 413, 414, 19 Am. St. Rep. 404, 406, 19 Atl. 172, 173, the court of chancery of New Jersey said: 'Two essentials of a valid marriage are capacity and consent. . . . Marriage is a civil contract, and no ceremonial is indispensably requisite to its creation. A contract of marriage made per verba de proesenti amounts to an actual marriage and is valid,' quoting O'Gara v. Eisenlohr, 38 N. Y. 296. In Atlantic City R. Co. v. Goodin, 62 N. J. L. 394, 400, 45 L.R.A. 671, 674, 72 Am. St. Rep. 652, 658, 42 Atl. 333, 336, the New Jersey court of errors and appeals said: 'In the Voorhees Case Vice Chancellor Van Fleet concedes that a contract of marriage made per verba de proesenti amounts to an actual marriage and is valid, and in the case of Stevens v. Stevens, 56 N. J. Eq. 488, 38 Atl. 460, Vice Chancellor Pitney declares the law on the subject to the same effect, citing abundant authority.'\n This brings us to consider what were the relations of these parties after selling the Maryland farm and after taking up their residence in New Jersey in 1883. That their cohabitation, as husband and wife, after 1865 and while they lived in Maryland, continued without change after they became domiciled in New Jersey and up to the death of James Travers, and that they held themselves out in New Jersey as lawfully husband and wife, and recognized themselves and were recognized in the community as sustaining that relation, is manifest from \n\n[205 U.S. 423, 439]\n\u00a0\n all the evidence and circumstances. It is impossible to explain their conduct towards each other while living in New Jersey upon any other theory than that they regarded each other as legally holding the matrimonial relation of husband and wife. It is true that no witness proves express words signifying an actual agreement or contract between the parties to live together as husband and wife. No witness heard them say, in words, in the presence of each other, 'We have agreed to take each other as husband and wife, and live together as such.' But their conduct towards each other, from the time they left Alexandria, in 1865, up to the death of James Travers, in 1883, admits of no other interpretation than that they had agreed, from the outset, to be husband and wife. And that agreement, so far as this record shows, was faithfully kept up to the death of James Travers. When it is remembered that James Travers assured the woman Sophia that they were as much married as if they had been married by a priest or minister; that in his mortgage of 1867 she is described as his wife; that in the holographic will of 1881 he recognized her as his wife; that in his last will, made at his domicil in New Jersey, he referred to her as his wife, and devised by that will property to her while she remained his widow and did not contract another marriage; and that he made her the sole executrix of his will, describing her as his wife,-when these facts are supplemented by the fact that they lived together, without intermission, in good faith, and openly, for more than eighteen years as husband and wife, nothing more is needed to show that he and the woman had mutually agreed to sustain the relation of husband and wife. Under the evidence in the cause they are to be held as having, prior to the death of James Travers, agreed per verba de proesenti to become husband and wife.\n Did the law of New Jersey recognize them as husband and wife after they took up their residence in that state and lived together, in good faith, as husband and wife, and were there recognized as such? Upon the authorities cited this question must be answered in the affirmative. \n\n[205 U.S. 423, 440]\n\u00a0\n We are of opinion that even if the alleged marriage would have been regarded as invalid in Virginia for want of license, had the parties remained there, and invalid in Maryland for want of a religious ceremony, had they remained in that state, it was to be deemed a valid marriage in New Jersey after James Travers and the woman Sophia, as husband and wife, took up their permanent residence there and lived together in that relation, continuously, in good faith, and openly, up to the death of Travers, being regarded by themselves and in the community as husband and wife. Their conduct towards each other in the eye of the public, while in New Jersey, taken in connection with their previous association, was equivalent, in law, to a declaration by each that they did, and during their joint lives were to, occupy the relation of husband and wife. Such a declaration was as effective to establish the status of marriage in New Jersey as if it had been made in words of the present tense after they became domiciled in that state.\n The views we have expressed find support in the authorities. In Meister v. Moore, \n96 \nU.S. 76, 79\n, 24 S. L. ed. 826, 827, it was said that an informal marriage by contract per verba de proesenti constituted a marriage at common law, and that a statute simply requiring 'all marriages to be entered into in the presence of a magistrate or clergyman, or that it be preceded by a license, or publication of banns, or be attested by witnesses,' may be construed 'as merely directory, instead of being treated as destructive of a common-law right to form the marriage relation by words of present assent.'\n In Maryland use of Markley v. Baldwin, \n112 \nU.S. 490, 494\n, 495 S., 28 L. ed. 822, 824, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 278, the court said: 'It is proper to say that, by the law of Pennsylvania, where, if at all, the parties were married, a marriage is a civil contract, and may be made per verba de proesenti; that is, by words in the present tense, without attending ceremonies, religious or civil. Such is also the law of many other states in the absence of statutory regulation. It is the doctrine of the common law. But, where no such ceremonies are required, and no record is made to attest the marriage, some public recogni- \n\n[205 U.S. 423, 441]\n\u00a0\n tion of it is necessary as evidence of its existence. The protection of the parties and their children and considerations of public policy require this public recognition; and it may be made in any way which can be seen and known by men, such as living together as man and wife, treating each other and speaking of each other in the presence of third parties as being in that relation, and declaring the relation in documents executed by them whilst living together, such as deeds, wills, and other formal instruments.'\n So in Hoggan v. Craigie, Macl. & Rob. 942, 965, in which Lord Chancellor Cranworth, referring to contracts of marriage per verba de proesenti, said: 'It is not necessary to prove the contract itself; it is sufficient if the facts of the case are such as to lead to satisfactory evidence of such a contract having taken place; upon this principle the acknowledgment of the parties, their conduct towards each other, and the repute consequent upon it, may be sufficient to prove a marriage. . . . Everything, therefore, is pertinent and relevant in an inquiry like the present, which indicates the present or previous consent of the parties.' Again, in Campbell v. Campbell, known as the Breadalbane Case, L. R. 1 H. L. Sc. App. Cas. 182, 192, 196, 211, Lord Chancellor Chelmsford said: 'Habit and repute . . . arise from parties cohabiting together openly and constantly, as if they were husband and wife, and so conducting themselves towards each other for such a length of time in the society or neighborhood of which they are members as to produce a general belief that they are really married.' In the same case Lord Westbury, after observing that it might not be strictly correct to speak of cohabitation with habit and repute as a mode of contracting marriage, said: 'It is rather a mode of making manifest to the world that tacit consent which the law will infer to have been already interchanged. If I were to express what I collect from the different opinions on the subject I should rather be inclined to express the rule in the following language: that cohabitation as husband and wife is a manifestation of the parties having consented to contract that relation inter se. \n\n[205 U.S. 423, 442]\n\u00a0\n It is a holding forth to the world, by the manner of daily life, by conduct, demeanor, and habit, that the man and woman who live together have agreed to take each other in marriage and to stand in the mutual relation of husband and wife; and when credit is given by those among whom they live, by their relatives, neighbors, friends, and acquaintances, to these representations and this continued conduct, then habit and repute arise and attend upon the cohabitation. The parties are holden and reputed to be husband and wife; and the law of Scotland accepts this combination of circumstances as evidence that consent to marry has been lawfully interchanged.' In his treatise on Domestic Relations, Eversley says: 'Marriage may also be proved between the parties by their conduct towards each other, and the first consent need not be proved; 'it is sufficient if the facts of the case are such as to lead to satisfactory evidence of such a contract having taken place; the acknowledgment of the parties, their conduct towards each other, and the repute consequent upon it, may be sufficient to prove a marriage.\" P. 41. See also 2 Greenl. Ev. Harriman's ed.  461, 462, and notes; 3 Wigmore, Ev.  2082, 2083, and authorities cited.\n Without further discussion or citation of authorities, we adjudge that the courts below did not err in holding that, under the evidence, James Travers and the Mrs. Travers, who lived with him constantly and openly as his wife for more than eighteen years, were, in law, to be deemed husband and wife at the time of his death, in New Jersey, in 1883. It results from this view that the decree of the Court of Appeals, affirming the decree of the Supreme Court of the District, must itself be affirmed.\n It is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice McKenna and Mr. Justice Moody did not participate in the decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes dissenting:\n I feel some doubts in this case which I think that I ought \n\n[205 U.S. 423, 443]\n\u00a0\n to state. I understand it to be assumed, as it must be admitted, that James Travers and Sophia V. Grayson lived together for many years, calling themselves man and wife, when they were not man and wife, and probably knew that they were not man and wife. This condition of things lasted from 1865, the time of the pretended marriage in Virginia, to which their cohabitation referred for its justification, until 1883, the year of James Travers's death. So long as they lived in Maryland, that is, until some time in 1883, if they had attempted to make their union more legitimate by simple mutual agreement they could not have done it. Therefore the instances of James Travers calling Sophia his wife during that period may be laid on one side.\n Just before he died Travers moved to New Jersey and there made his will. As in Maryland, he spoke of his wife in that instrument, and, as I understand it, the decision that he was married must rest wholly on this recognition and the fact that in New Jersey a marriage may be made without the intervention of a magistrate. I do not see how these facts can be enough. Habit and repute might be evidence of a marriage when unexplained. But they must be evidence of a contract, however informal, to have any effect. When an appellation shown to have been used for nearly eighteen years with conscious want of justification continues to be used for the last month of lifetime, I do not see how the fact that the parties have crossed a state line can make that last month's use evidence that in that last moment the parties made a contract which then, for the first time, they could have made in this way.\n It is imperative that a contract should have been made in New Jersey. Therefore, even if both parties had supposed that they were married, instead of knowing the contrary, it would not have mattered. To live in New Jersey and think you are married does not constitute a marriage by the law of that state. If there were nothing else in the case it might be evidence of marriage, but, on these facts, the belief, if it was entertained, referred to the original inadequate ground. \n\n[205 U.S. 423, 444]\n\u00a0\n Collins v. Voorhees, 47 N. J. Eq. 555, 14 L.R.A. 364, 24 Am. St. Rep. 412, 22 Atl. 1054. A void contract is not made over again or validated by being acted upon at a time when a valid contract could be made. When a void contract is acted upon, the remedy, when there is one, is not on the contract, but upon a quasi-contract, for a quantum meruit. There is no such alternative when a marriage fails. \n\n\n\n","157":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S EX REL WEST v. HITCHCOCK(1907)\nNo. 194\nArgued: January 30, 1907Decided: March 4, 1907\n\n\n\n Messrs. William H. Robeson, Samuel A. Putman, and William C. Shelley for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[205 U.S. 80, 82]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General Campbell and Messrs. Fred. H. Barclay and Jesse C. Adkins for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a petition for mandamus to require the Secretary of the Interior to approve the selection and taking of \n\n[205 U.S. 80, 83]\n\u00a0\n 160 acres by the relator out of the lands ceded to the United States by the Wichita and affiliated bands of Indians, under an agreement of June 4, 1891, ratified by the act of Congress of March 2, 1895, chap. 188, 28 Stat. at L. 876, 895-897. The petition alleges that the relator is a white man, married to a Wichita woman, and thereby a member of the tribe, and that his adoption was confirmed and recognized in various ways set forth. By the second article of the agreement, as part of the consideration, the United States agreed that there should be allotted to each member of the said bands, native and adopted, 160 acres out of the said lands, to be selected by the members, with qualifications not in question here. The fourth article contains provisions as to the title to allotments when they 'shall have been selected and taken as aforesaid, and approved by the Secretary of the Interior.' After a demurrer to the petition, which was overruled (19 App. D. C. 333), the Secretary answered, alleging that he had examined and considered the application of the relator, and on July 3, 1901, had reached and announced a decision that the relator was not a member of the tribe, and thereupon had denied the application. The relator moved for a peremptory mandamus, which was denied, and filed a demurrer, which was overruled, and thereupon pleaded that the Secretary did not by the decision alleged, decide that the relator was not a member of the tribe, and for that reason deny him the allotment. Issue was joined and evidence taken, and after a hearing judgment was entered for the respondent and the petition dismissed. The judgment was affirmed on appeal ( 26 App. D. C. 290), and then the case was brought to this court. The issues here are those raised by the plea, the demurrer to the answer, and the motion for a peremptory writ.\n It is argued that the answer admits the averments of the petition, as it does not deny them in terms, and that therefore it must be taken that there was no question concerning the relator's membership for the Secretary to decide. His \n\n[205 U.S. 80, 84]\n\u00a0\n identity was not disputed, nor, it is said, the acts of adoption that took place long before the relator applied to have his selection approved, and, therefore, the Secretary's duty was merely ministerial, to carry out the mandate of the act. But the admission, at most, is only the admission implied by a plea of estoppel by judgment. In truth it hardly goes so far as that; for when a party says that he is the proper person to decide the question raised, and that he has decided it against the party raising it, he hardly can be said to admit that his decision was wrong.\n The approval of the Secretary, required by the agreement, must include, as one of its elements, the recognition of the applicant's right. If a mere outsider were to make a claim, it would have to be rejected by someone, and the Secretary is the natural, if not the only, person to do it. No list or authentic determination of the parties entitled is referred to by the agreement, so as to narrow the Secretary's duty to identification or questions of decent in case of subsequent death. The right is conferred upon the members of the bands, but the ascertainment of membership is left wholly at large. No criteria of adoption are stated. The Secretary must have authority to decide on membership in a doubtful case, and, if he has it in any case, he has it in all. Furthermore, as his decision is not a matter of any particular form, his answer saying that he has decided the case is enough; for even if he had not decided it before, such an answer would announce a decision sufficiently by itself.\n But the answer was not confined to a general allegation that the Secretary had decided the case. It gave the date of the decision, and the relator, under his plea, put the decision in evidence. It was a letter which seemed to admit that the relator had been adopted by the Indians as a member of their tribe, but assumed that the adoption must have been approved by the Indian Office to be valid, as provided by a regulation of that Department. The relator contends that the validity of the adoption was a matter purely of \n\n[205 U.S. 80, 85]\n\u00a0\n Indian law or custom, and that the Department could not take it under control. Probably it would have been unfortunate for the Indians if such control had not been exercised, as the temptation to white men to go through an Indian marriage for the purpose of getting Indian rights is sufficiently plain. We are disposed to think that authority was conferred by the general words of the statutes. Rev. Stat.  441, 463, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 252, 262. By the latter section: 'The Commissioner of Indian Affairs shall, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, and agreeably to such regulations as the President may prescribe, have the management of all Indian affairs, and of all matters arising out of Indian relations.' We should hesitate a good deal, especially in view of the long- established practice of the Department, before saying that this language was not broad enough to warrant a regulation obviously made for the welfare of the rather helpless people concerned. The power of Congress is not doubted. The Indians have been treated as wards of the nation. Some such supervision was necessary, and has been exercised. In the absence of special provisions, naturally it would be exercised by the Indian Department.\n However, it hardly is necessary to pass upon that point. Although the answer gave the decision a date, that did not open it for consideration. If the Secretary had authority to pass on the relator's right to select land, his jurisdiction did not depend upon his decision being right. By alleging that he had denied the application he did not invoke the revision of his reasons by a court, even when he saw fit to add the date. He raised no question of law, but simply stood on his authority and put forward his decision as final. As we have implied, such an answer affirms not merely the past but the present determination of the answering tribunal, and must be assumed to be based on reasons that the respondent deems adequate. Even if those given in the letter of July 3, 1901, had been bad, they could not be taken to exhaust the Secretary's grounds. He has not disclosed to \n\n[205 U.S. 80, 86]\n\u00a0\n the court any statement of those grounds purporting to be exhaustive and complete, and the court cannot make an inquisition into his mental processes to see whether they were correct. See DeCambra v. Rogers, \n189 \nU.S. 119, 122\n, 47 S. L. ed. 734, 735, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 519.\n We doubt if Congress meant to open an appeal to the courts in all cases where an applicant is dissatisfied. Of course the promise of the United States that there shall be allotted 160 acres to each member of the Wichita band may be said to confer an absolute right upon every actual member of the band. But someone must decide who the members are. We already have expressed the opinion that the primary decision must come from the Secretary. There is no indication of an intent to let applicants go farther. There are insuperable difficulties in the way of at least this form of suit, and the Department of the Interior generally has been the custodian of Indian rights.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","158":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. BROWN(1907)\nNo. 283\nArgued: Decided: May 13, 1907\n\n\n\n\n[206 U.S. 240, 241]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General Van Orsdel and Messrs. George B. Davis and Franklyn W.

Michener for Brown.\n\n\n\n[206 U.S. 240, 243]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a claim for pay as first lieutenant of United States Volunteers after February 17, 1899, on which date, by the sentence of a court-martial, the claimant was dismissed from the service. The court- martial consisted of five members, the minimum number by the 75th and 79th articles of war (Rev. Stat.  1342, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 959, 960), and the president of the court was an officer in the Regular Army. By article 77 'officers of the Regular Army shall not be competent to sit on courts-martial to try the officers of soldiers of other forces, except as provided in article 78.' (Article 78 has no bearing on the case.) On this ground it is contended that the proceedings were void. Even if the presence of an incompetent person as a member would not have made the proceedings invalid in any event, in this case without him there would have been no court. It has been decided that a sentence against a volunteer officer by a court composed wholly of regular officers is void, and this principle is thought to govern the present case. McClaughry v. Deming, \n186 U.S. 49\n, 46 L. ed. 1049, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 786. On this ground the court of claims decided that the claimant was entitled to recover up to the time of the final muster out of his regiment on May 25, 1899, including two months' extra pay under the act of January 12, 1899, chap. 46 (30 Stat. at L. 784). 41 Ct. Cl. 275, 515. There are cross appeals to this court.\n The answer of the United States to the foregoing argument \n\n[206 U.S. 240, 244]\n\u00a0\n is that the regular officer had been granted an indefinite leave of absence from the Regular Army in order to enable him to accept a commission as lieutenant colonel, Second United States Volunteer Infantry, and that he was serving in the letter capacity when he sat upon the court. It is argued that it always has been understood that under such circumstances the position in the volunteer service alone is to be regarded, that much harm will be done if a contrary construction should be adopted now, and that the leave given to appoint regular officers to the volunteer service should be construed to carry with an appointment the same consequences that would attach to a commission if held by anyone else. Act of April 22, 1898, chap. 187,  13, 30 Stat. at L. 363; act of May 28, 1898, chap. 367,  2, 30 Stat. at L. 421, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 881.\n This argument would have great force when it was required, as formerly, only that courts-martial for the trial of militia officers 'should be composed entirely of militia officers.' Act of April 10, 1806, chap. 20, art. 97, 2 Stat. at L. 359, 371. If there was a settled practice of treating these words as satisfied if the members of the court were militia officers, whether they also held commissions in the Regular Army or not, we well might hesitate to overthrow it. But when the express prohibition contained in article 77 was adopted by the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 959), it made the former construction no longer possible. The words of the statute are peremptory and must be obeyed. We do not apprehend any serious consequences, in view of the date of the change. But, whatever the consequences, we must accept the plain meaning of plain words. It follows that the proceedings of the court were void and that it is not necessary to mention or consider other objections that were urged.\n We are of opinion that the court of claims was right also in the allowances made to the claimant. In 1900 the claimant applied for an honorable discharge as of May 25, 1899, the date when his regiment was mustered out, but was refused. Of course, the refusal of a certificate of honorable discharge on the ground that the applicant already has been dishonorably dis- \n\n[206 U.S. 240, 245]\n\u00a0\n charged is not an active retention of the officer in the service. The act of March 2, 1899, chap. 352,  15 (30 Stat. at L. 977, 981), provided that the officers and men of the Volunteer Army should be mustered out, and, under the act of January 12, 1899, chap. 46 (30 Stat. at L. 784), 'as far as practicable,' the discharge of officers and men was to take effect at the muster out of the organization to which they belonged. It would be monstrous to hold that it had been determined not to be practical to discharge the claimant when his regiment was mustered out, or that the circumstances of his case, notwithstanding his technical success, afford a ground for a later claim. The claimant was allowed two months' extra pay for service outside the United States. He was not entitled to one month's extra pay for service within the United States. See act of May 26, 1900, chap. 586, 31 Stat. at L. 205, 217, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3346. Of course, the claim for travel under the same act (31 Stat. at L. 210, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 841) must fail. The claimant was discharged before that act was passed.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice Moody did not sit and took no part in the decision. \n\n\n\n","159":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v.

He was given judgment for $141.33. The 10 per cent increase was not allowed.\n A statement of the case is well expressed in the findings and conclusion of the court, as follows:\n'The claimant, Ammen Farenholt, entered the naval service as an assistant surgeon May 29, 1894, and was promoted to the grade of passed assistant surgeon May 29, 1897. He attained the rank of lieutenant on December 26, 1900, and was a passed assistant surgeon in the Navy with the rank of lieutenant during all of the time covered by this petition.\n\n'From December 26, 1900, to April 12, 1901, he was on sea duty attached to the U. S. S. 'Concord.' From April 12, 1901, to July 27, 1901, he was on sea duty attached to the U. S. S. 'Oregon.'\n\n'The claimant has already received pay at mounted rates for the periods before December 26, 1900, and after July 27, 1901, under the decisions of the court of claims in Richardson v. United States, 38 Ct. Cl. 182, as applied by the Comptroller of the Treasury in Brownell's Case (9 Comp. Dec. 676), but the Treasury Department declines to allow him mounted pay between these dates only because it considers that it is deprived of jurisdiction over the claim therefor by reason of a prior allowance and settlement of pay for the same period.\n\n'If entitled to Army pay at mounted rates for this period the amount due would be as follows:\n\n Pay of a lieutenant of the Navy, which corresponds in rank with a captain in the Army, mounted, from December 26, 1900, to July 27, 1901, with increased pay for length of service, 7 months and 2 days, at $2,400.00 per annum $1,413.33 Less amount received for same period, at $2,160.00 per annum 1,272.00 ___\n Difference $141.33 \n\n[206 U.S. 226, 228]\n\u00a0\n 'Before the date of the decision of this court in the case of Richardson v. United States, supra, January 5, 1903, assistant surgeons in the Navy received only the pay of an officer of corresponding rank in the Army 'not mounted.' By that decision it was held that they are entitled to the pay of such an officer 'mounted.' This decision was not appealed from and has been accepted as the proper interpretation of the law. It has been applied by ruling of the Comptroller of the Treasury to passed assistant surgeons.\n'All officers of the medical corps in grades for which there is in the Army pay table a distinction between 'mounted' and 'not mounted' pay, have ever since been paid at mounted rates of pay for their service from the date the personnel act took effect, July 1, 1899, to the present time.\n\n Conclusion of Law.\n'Upon the foregoing findings of fact, the court decides as a conclusion of law, on the authority of Richardson v. United States, supra, that the claimant is entitled to recover against the United States the sum one hundred and forty-one dollars and thirtythree cents ($141.33).\n\n'By a majority of the court.'\n\n Section 13 of the act of March 3, 1899 (30 Stat. at L. 1007, chap. 413, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1072), called the Navy personnel act, provides 'that after June 30, 1899, commissioned officers of the line of the Navy and of the medical and pay corps shall receive the same pay and allowances except forage, as are or may be provided by or in pursuance of law for the officers of corresponding rank in the Army.'\n Section 1466, Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1029), assimiliates in rank lieutenants in the Navy with captains in the Army. And  1261 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 893) \n\n[206 U.S. 226, 229]\n\u00a0\n fixes the pay of a captain, mounted, at $2,000 a year and a captain not mounted at $1,800 a year. Section 1262 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 896) gives 10 per cent increase for each term of five years' service.\n The appellee is a lieutenant in the Navy; he ranks with a captain in the Army, but the question is, Of which class, mounted or not mounted?\n The government contends, with captains not mounted. Its argument is that the extra pay that mounted officers receive is not compensation, but reimbursement for expenses incurred; and to give it to a naval officer who does not bear such expenses would produce the inequality that the Navy personnel act was passed to prevent. United States v. Crosley, \n196 U.S. 332\n, 49 L. ed. 499, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 261. Counsel, however, concedes that Richardson v. United States, supra, was correctly decided, and that the rule has been extended by the Comptroller of the Treasury to passed assistant surgeons, but attacks the practice of the Comptroller, and rejects the application of the Richardson Case upon the distinction between an assistant surgeon, which Richardson was, and a passed assistant surgeon, which appellee is.\n The act of June 7, 1900 (31 Stat. at L. 697, chap. 859, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 990), provides that 'the active list of surgeons shall hereafter consist of fifty-five, and that of passed assistant and assistant surgeons of one hundred and ten. Assistant surgeons shall rank with assistant surgeons in the Army.' Commenting on this statute the government says: 'Assistant surgeons in the Army being mounted, the court very justly granted mounted pay to Richardson, who ranked with assistant surgeons in the Army.' In other words, the government contends it was the purpose of Congress to give the inferior officer the better pay. The Assistant Attorney General ventures on no explanation of this anomaly, but insists upon the written word. A court is not always confined to the written word. Construction sometimes is to be exercised as well as interpretation. And 'construction is the drawing of conclusions respecting subjects that lie beyond the direct expression of the text, from elements known from and given in the text,-conclusions which are in the spirit, though not within \n\n[206 U.S. 226, 230]\n\u00a0\n the letter, of the text.' Lieber, 56. The application of this rule is clear. Consideration of the provisions relative to the rank and pay of officers of the Army and Navy make it evident that Congress used the words 'assistant surgeon' as descriptive of the whole class of assistant surgeons, passed as well as those not passed.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice Moody took no part in the decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","160":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v.

It was entered under bond for warehousing without the payment of duty, and withdrawn from warehouse after the present tariff act went into effect, and was assessed by the collector for duty on the basis of weight at the time of its entry. The importers, Falk & Brother, protested and appealed from the decision of the collector to the board of general appraisers. The board affirmed the ruling of the collector on its opinion in Re Schmidt (G. A. 4214, T. D 19715). Falk & Brother then instituted proceedings for review before the circuit court for the southern district of New York, and that court sustained the decision of the board of appraisers. 145 Fed. 574. The circuit court of appeals reversed the circuit court. 146 Fed. 484.\n The contention of the importers is that the merchandise is subject to duty under the provisions of Schedule F of the act of July 24, 1897, based upon weight at the time of withdrawal from bond for consumption, under the provisions of  50 of the act of October 1, 1890. It is contended that the proviso of the latter act has not been repealed but is in full force and effect, and is applicable to merchandise entered in bond subsequent to the passage of the act of July 24, 1897. The board of appraisers held that the proviso of  50 of the act of 1890 was repealed by  33 of the act of 1897\n\n\n Those sections are, respectively, as follows: \n\n[204 U.S. 143, 146]\n\u00a0\n 'Sec. 50.

The court said: 'Neither is general in its application, but is restricted to merchandise previously imported for which \n\n[204 U.S. 143, 147]\n\u00a0\n no entry has been made.' The court, however, sustained the decision of the board on the ground that  2983 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1958) was applicable. That section is as follows: 'In no case shall there be any abatement of the duties or allowance for any injury, damage, deterioration, loss, or leakage sustained by any merchandise while deposited in any public or private bonded warehouse.'\n The importers denied the application of that section, and contended that under the law, and particularly under  20 of the customs administrative act of June 10, as amended December 15, 1902 (presently to be stated), they were authorized to withdraw the merchandise from warehouse upon the payment of duties and charges based upon its weight at the time of withdrawal. The court ruled against the contention, and said: 'It seems too plain for discussion that the word 'loss' [referring to  2983], coupled as it is in the disjunctive with 'leakage,' applies precisely to such a case as the one before us. I cannot find any sound reason for believing that the Congress did not have  2983 in mind when it enacted said 20, as amended. It is obvious that  20, especially as amended, refers exclusively to rate rather than weight.' The circuit court of appeals differed from the circuit court in the application of  2983. It held that the loss there provided for related solely to the loss of merchandise subject to duty, and such loss had not occurred. The court further held that the other terms of the section referred to actual reduction in the value or quantity of the merchandise itself. 'It is clear,' it was said, 'that evaporation of moisture is not 'loss' . . . sustained by . . . merchandise.' The case of Seeberger v. Wright & L. Oil & Lead Mfg. Co. \n157 U.S. 183\n, 39 L. ed. 665, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 583, was referred to as analogous. The court also disagreed with the construction of the circuit court of  20 of the customs administrative act, and held that by virtue of the proviso added to that section December 15, 1902 (stated later), duties should have been assessed according to the weight of the tobacco at the time of its withdrawal. \n\n[204 U.S. 143, 148]\n\u00a0\n This history of the case exhibits the contentions of the parties and the elements of the contentions, and, it will be seen, the case is one of statutory construction.\n First, as to Seeberger v. Wright & L. Oil & Lead Mfg. Co. supra, which is urged as controlling. The importation there was flaxseed. The proof showed that the seed contained dust composed of clay, sand, and gravel to an average of 4 per cent. The case turned upon the meaning of the word 'draught' in  2898 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1919). It was assumed that the word did not apply to impurities, and it was said that the lower court was correct in assuming that the flaxseed in question which was made dutiable, under the act of 1883 [22 Stat at L. 513, chap. 121], at 20 cents per bushel of 56 pounds, less tare, meant 56 pounds of clean seed, or, at least, seed free from any impurities, such as the clay, sand, and gravel in question.\n The moisture which the tobacco in the case at bar absorbed cannot be said to be an impurity within the meaning of that decision, even though moisture in tobacco is a variable quantity and its amount can be estimated by weighing the tobacco at different times. Nor can it be considered as an independent, nontaxable substance, even though, as conceded in this case, it was absorbed on the ocean voyage. The statutes contemplate and apply to merchandise which may change in weight, and if the moisture in the tobacco in this case can be regarded as an independent substance,-so much 'sea water,' to use counsel's graphic phrase,-a question of the application of  50 or 33 could not arise. One or other of those sections was considered applicable from the beginning, and the importations regarded as controlled by it, as merchandise subject to duty by weight, and necessarily there was involved the question at what time the weight should be estimated,-at the time of entry or at the time of withdrawal from warehouse. To that question, then, we shall address ourselves.\n It is said by counsel for the United States that, prior to October 1, 1890, duties were uniformly demanded and collected according to the weight of merchandise at original entry, citing \n\n[204 U.S. 143, 149]\n\u00a0\n in support of the assertion the custom regulations of 1884 and 1899. Upon that date (October 1, 1890) the tariff act of 1890 took effect. Section 50 provided, as we have seen, that goods previously imported, for which no entry had been made, and goods warehoused, for which no permit of delivery had been issued, should be subject to no other duty than if the goods were imported after the day the act took effect. It was also provided that, when duties were based upon the weight of warehoused merchandise, the duty should 'be levied and collected upon the weight of such merchandise at the time of its withdrawal' (italics ours). A question arose as to the scope of the proviso,-whether it was restricted to the matter immediately preceding, that is, merchandise imported before the act took effect, or was of general application, applying as well to merchandise imported after as before the act took effect. The Attorney General decided that the latter was its effect. He said (20 Ops. Atty. Gen. 81, 82): 'I am aware that under former tariff acts the rule has been to levy duties upon weighable merchandise according to the weight at the date of importation, but this proviso seems to be intended to change that rule, and there seems to be sufficient reason for such change.'\n The executive officers of the government followed this construction until the act of July 24, 1897, known as the Dingley act, was passed. The construction made by the Attorney General is disputed as applicable to  33 of the act of 1897, and it is urged that the whole scope and meaning of that section, when reduced to its simplest terms, make goods theretofore entered under bond for warehouse subject to the duties imposed by the act upon the withdrawal thereof, when the section is construed in accordance with the rule that a proviso refers only to the provision of a statute to which it is appended. This may be conceded to be the primary purpose of a proviso, but a presumption of such purpose cannot prevail to determine the intention of the legislature against other tests of meaning more demonstrative. We said in United States v. Whitridge, 197 U. S. at page 143, 49 L. ed. at page 698, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. at page 408: 'While no doubt the grammatical and \n\n[204 U.S. 143, 150]\n\u00a0\n logical scope of a proviso is confined to the subject-matter of the principal clause, we cannot forget that in practice no such limit is observed.' And the Attorney General's opinion cannot be overlooked. The proviso which he construed in  50 of the act of 1890 was re-enacted in  33 of the act of 1897. It would be extreme to hold that Congress by doing so intended to set up the technical rule relating to provisos against the construction of the Attorney General, and to change that construction by repeating the very words construed. And there could have been no oversight. The practice of the executive officers for years gave emphasis and materiality to the construction. A change was made, however,-a change of one word,-a change recommended by the Treasury Department to increase the revenues and give greater convenience to the administration of the customs laws. The word 'entry' was substituted for the word 'withdrawal,' and necessarily thereafter duties upon merchandise there provided for were to be based upon weight at the time of entry. Nor do we see that there is any contradiction of this in other provisions of the statute. Certain provisions of the customs administrative act are, however, relied upon. The provisions of that act, hereafter quoted, originated in  1 of the act of March 14, 1866 (14 Stat. at L. 8, chap. 17), and were carried into the Revised Statutes as  2970 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1950), which provided that merchandise deposited in warehouse might be withdrawn for consumption within one year from the date of importation, upon payment of the duties and charges to which it might be subject by law at the time of withdrawal. At the expiration of one year, and until the expiration of three years, it might be withdrawn for consumption on payment of the duties assessed on the original entry and charges, and an additional duty of 10 per centum on the amount of such duties. It was decided in Merritt v. Cameron, \n137 \nU.S. 542, 550\n, 551 S., 34 L. ed. 772, 775, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 174, that that section 'was intended to provide for cases in which a change of rate of duty had been made by statute while the merchandise was in bonded warehouse.' \n\n[204 U.S. 143, 151]\n\u00a0\n Then came  20 of the customs administrative act of June 10, 1890 (26 Stat. at L. 140, chap. 407), as amended by act of October 1, 1890 (26 Stat. at L. 624, chap. 1244, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1950), providing that warehouse merchandise might be withdrawn for consumption within three years from the date of the original importation, on payment of the duties and charges to which it might be subject by law at the time of such withdrawal. The section was amended in 1902 (32 Stat. at L. 753, chap. 1 U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1905, p. 419) by the addition of the following proviso: 'Provided, That the same rate of duty shall be collected thereon as may be imposed by law upon like articles of merchandise imported at the time of the withdrawal.' The circuit court of appeals gave controlling force to the proviso as fixing the meaning of the section. The court said that it had held in Mosle v. Bidwell, 65 C. C. A. 533, 130 Fed. 334, 'that the amendment of 1902 was declaratory of the meaning of the section prior to said amendment, and that its meaning as thus declared was that no greater or different duties could be imposed than those to which other like goods imported at the time of withdrawal would be subject.' Regarding this decision as conclusive the court said: 'If other like goods had been imported at the time when these goods (the tobacco in question) were withdrawn, duty would have been assessed thereon according to their weight at such time.' But the question in Mosle v. Bidwell was not the same as in the case at bar. The question now is not what rate of duty merchandise is subject to, or whether it is exempt from duty, but at what date its weight is to be taken as a basis of duty. And weight is a fact independent of the rate of duty. The proviso of  20 of the customs administrative act, therefore, cannot be made paramount to the proviso in  33 of the tariff act of 1897. Nor was that the purpose of its enactment. It was enacted to nullify the effect of the decision of the circuit court in Mosle v. Bidwell, by which  20 was construed to require the payment of duties which had accrued at the time of importation, notwithstanding a change of rate or that the goods had become exempt from duty before \n\n[204 U.S. 143, 152]\n\u00a0\n their withdrawal from warehouse. This construction was contrary to the general understanding of the section and the practice of the Department. This, then, is our view: The Attorney General having construed the proviso of  50 of the act of 1890 as not restricted to the matter which immediately preceded it, but as of general application, and this construction having been followed by the executive officers charged with the administration of the law, Congress adopted the construction by the enactment of  33 of the act of 1897 and intended to make no other change than to require, as the basis of duty, the weight of the merchandise at the time of entry, instead of its weight at the time of its withdrawal from warehouse.\n Judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is therefore reversed and that of the Circuit Court is affirmed and the case remanded to the latter court.\n Mr. Justice Moody took no part in the decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","161":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v.

This order, promulgated by the Secretary of War, was accompanied with an enumeration of the tariff proposed, and regulations for the collection of the same. However, for causes which need not be referred to, the tariff in question was subsequently modified, and did not go into operation until November, 1898\n\n\n The duties imposed by this tariff were levied on goods coming into the Philippine Islands, whether from the United States or other countries. This tariff was in force when the treaty of peace [30 Stat. at L. 1754] was signed (December 10, 1898), when the treaty was ratified (April 11, 1899), and was continued by the Philippine commission appointed by the President in April, 1900. Indeed, the civil government, as established in the islands by the President, either in virtue of his inherent authority or as a result of the power recognized and conferred by the act of Congress approved March 2, 1901 (31 Stat. at L. 910, chap. 803), continued the original tariff in force, except as to some modifications not material to be noticed, and formulated its provisions in the shape of a legislative act entitled 'An Act to Revise and Amend the Tariff Laws of the Philippine Archipelago. And this tariff was in force in March, 1902, when it was expressly approved and continued by Congress. (32 Stat. at L. 54, chap. 140, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1905, p. 388.)\n In May, 1901, the cases of De Lima v. Bidwell and Dooley v. United States were by this court decided. \n182 \nU.S. 1, 222\n, 45 S. L. ed. 1041, 1074, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 743, 762. The first case involved the right to recover duties paid under protest to the collector of the port of New York upon sugar brought into the United States from the island of Porto Rico during the autumn of 1899, and subsequent to \n\n[206 U.S. 370, 379]\n\u00a0\n the cession of the island. The second case involved the right to recover the amount of certain duties on goods carried into Porto Rico from the United States between July 6, 1898, and May 1, 1900, the duties in question having been levied by authority of the general in command of the army of occupation or subsequently by order of the President as commander in chief. In the first case (De Lima v. Bidwell) it was decided that, as the effect of the ratification of the treaty was to take the island of Porto Rico out of the category of foreign territory, within the meaning of that word as used in existing tariff laws of the United States, no right remained to enforce, against goods coming from Porto Rico into the United States, the previously enacted tariff of duties, although, considering the terms of the treaty and the relation of the island to the United States, Congress ahd power to impose a tariff on goods coming from that island into the United States. As a corollary of the doctrine announced in De Lima v. Bidwell, in the second case (Dooley v. United States) it was held that whilst the President, as commander in chief, had authority to impose tariff duties in Porto Rico on goods coming into that country from the United States prior to the ratification of the treaty, no such executive power existed after that ratification. It was consequently held that none of the duties paid prior to the ratification of the treaty could be recovered, whilst those paid subsequently could be.\n In the following year (December 2, 1901) another case, entitled Dooley v. United States, was decided. \n183 U.S. 151\n, 46 L. ed. 128, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 62. That case involved the validity of tariff duties levied in Porto Rico on goods brought into that island from the United States, the duties in question having been imposed after the ratification of the treaty, and in and by virtue of the act of Congress known as the Foraker act. Applying the principles announced in the previous cases just referred to, it was held that the duties were lawful because, although collected after the ratification, they were imposed not simply by virtue of the authority of the President, acting under \n\n[206 U.S. 370, 380]\n\u00a0\n the military power, but in conformity to a valid act of Congress.\n And on the same day with the foregoing the case of Fourteen Diamond Rings v. United States (The Diamond Rings) was decided. \n183 U.S. 176\n, 46 L. ed. 138, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 59. That case involved the validity of tariff duties levied on diamond rings brought from the Philippine Islands into the United States. Adhering to the doctrines settled by the prior rulings, it was held that, as the Philippine Islands, by the ratification of the treaty, had ceased to be foreign within the meaning of the tariff laws, the imposition of the duties complained of was unlawful. In the course of the opinion the effect of the treaty as applied in the previous cases to Porto Rico was pointed out, and the status of the Philippine Islands in virtue of the treaty was, in effect, held to be controlled by the former decisions.\n In April, 1905, the two cases of Lincoln v. United States and Warner, B. & Co. v. United States were by this court decided. \n197 U.S. 419\n, 49 L. ed. 816, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 455. The cases came here, one on error to the district court of the United States for the southern district of New York, and the other by appeal from the court of claims. The one (Lincoln Case) was commenced on March 29, 1902; the other (Warner, B. & Co. Case) on January 17, 1902. In both cases recovery from the United States was sought of the amount of duty paid upon goods taken from the United States into the Philippine Islands after the ratification of the treaty with Spain, and before the passage of the act of Congress of March 8, 1902. Reversing the judgments which had been rendered below in both cases in favor of the United States, it was declared that there was nothing in the situation of the Philippine Islands which took that territory out of the reach of the doctrine announced in the previous cases which we have reviewed, and it was therefore decided that the President was without power, after the ratification of the treaty, in the absence of express authority from Congress, to impose the tariff duties in question. A contention on the part of the United States that Congress, by the 2d section of the act approved July 1, 1902 (entitled 'An Act \n\n[206 U.S. 370, 381]\n\u00a0\n Temporarily to Provide for the Administration of the Affairs of Civil Government in the Philippine Islands, and for Other Purposes') [32 Stat. at L. 691, chap. 1369], had ratified the action of the President in imposing and collecting the duties in controversy, therefore no recovery could be had, was held to be unfounded, for grounds stated in the opinion, to which we shall hereafter advert. The case was heard upon rehearing, and in a decision announced on May 28, 1906, the views previously entertained by the court were reiterated and adhered to. \n202 U.S. 484\n, 50 L. ed. 1117, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 728. In the month following (June, 1906) Congress passed an act containing a provision which reads as follows (34 Stat. at L. 636, chap. 3912):\n'That the tariff duties, both import and export, imposed by the authorities of the United States or of the provisional military government thereof in the Philippine Islands prior to March eight, nineteen hundred and two, at all ports and places in said islands, upon all goods, wares, andme rchandise imported into said islands from the United States, or from foreign countries, or exported from said islands, are hereby legalized and ratified, and the collection of all such duties prior to March eight, nineteen hundred and two, is hereby legalized and ratified and confirmed as fully to all intents and purposes as if the same had, by prior act of Congress, been specifically authorized and directed.'\n\n Now this case was commenced after the decision in the Fourteen Ciamond Rings, to recover the amount of tariff duties exacted in the Philippine Islands on merchandise brought from the United States, the duties having been collected under the authority of the order of the President after the ratification of the treaty, but before the time when Congress, by  1 of the act of March 8, 1902, had enacted tariff duties for the Philippine Islands. The case was pending in the court of claims when the Lincoln and Warner, B. & Co. Cases were decided by this court. It was found by the court below that the military officers of the United States collected the duties and paid over the amount thereof to the treasurer of the Philippine Islands, and that the money was disbursed for the expenses of that \n\n[206 U.S. 370, 382]\n\u00a0\n government without going into the Treasury of the United States. Considering that the original illegality of the duties complained of was established by the previous decisions of this court, and that the act of Congress of June 30, 1906, ratifying the collection of duties, was beyond the power of Congress to enact, the court below rendered judgment against the United States for the amount of duties paid. Ct. Cl.\n Applying the doctrine settled by this court in the cases to which we have referred, concerning the power to levy tariff duties under the authority of the President, on goods taken from the United States into Porto Rico and the Philippine Islands, or brought into the United States from either of such countries subsequent to the ratification of the treaty, and prior to the levy by Congress of tariff duties, it is obvious that the court below correctly held that such tariff exactions were illegal. It follows, therefore, that the only question open for consideration is whether the court below erred in refusing to give effect to the act of Congress of June 30, 1906, which ratified the collection of the duties levied under the order of the President.\n As the text of the act of Congress is unambiguous, and manifests, as explicitly as can be done, the purpose of Congress to ratify, the case comes to the simple question whether Congress possessed the power to ratify which it assumed to exercise. When the controversy is thus reduced to its ultimate issue we think the error committed by the court below, both in reason and authority, is readily demonstrable.\n That where an agent, without precedent authority, has exercised, in the name of a principal, a power which the principal had the capacity to bestow, the principal may ratify and affirm the unauthorized act, and thus retroactively give it validity when rights of third persons have not intervened, is so elementary as to need but statement. That the power of ratification as to matters within their authority may be exercised by Congress, state governments, or municipal corporations, is also elementary. We shall not stop to review the whole subject, or cite the numerous cases contained in the books dealing with \n\n[206 U.S. 370, 383]\n\u00a0\n the matter, but content ourselves with referring to two cases as to the power of Congress, which are apposite and illustrative. In Hamilton v. Dillin, 21 Wall. 73, 22 L. ed. 528, the facts were as follows: During the Civil War the Secretary of the Treasury, with the sanction of the President, adopted rules and regulations for granting permits to trade between the belligerent lines. One of these rules exacted the payment of a contribution, styled a fee, of 4 cents a pound on cotton purchased. Hamilton, having taken a permit and paid Dillin, surveyor of the port of Nashville, Tennessee, under the regulti ons, a sum of money for a permit to trade in cotton, sued to recover the same as having been illegally exacted. In deciding the case (p. 88, L. ed. p. 531) the court came to consider whether 'the action of the Executive was authorized, or, if not originally authorized, was confirmed by Congress.' Both these questions were determined in the affirmative. When the court came to consider the legislation relied upon as having confirmed the acts of the President in establishing the regulations in question, after stating the same the court declared: 'We are also of opinion that the act of July 2, 1864 [13 Stat. at L. 375, chap. 225], recognized and confirmed the regulations in question.' Mattingly v. District of Columbia, \n97 U.S. 687\n, 24 L. ed. 1098, concerned the validity of an act of Congress in effect confirming the doings of the board of public works of the District of Columbia touching the improvement of streets and roads, and ratifying certain void assessments for street improvements. The court said (p. 690, L. ed. p. 1099):\n'We do not propose to inquire whether the charges of the bill are well founded. Such an inquiry can have no bearing upon the case as it now stands; for were it conceded that the board of public works had no authority to do the work that was done at the time when it was done, and consequently no authority to make an assessment of a part of its costs upon the complainants' property, or to assess in the manner in which the assessment was made, the concession would not dispose of the case, or establish that the complainants have a right to the equitable relief for which they pray. There has been congres- \n\n[206 U.S. 370, 384]\n\u00a0\n sional legislation since 1872, the effect of which upon the assessments is controlling. There were also acts of the legislative assembly of the District, which very forcibly imply a confirmation of the acts and assessments of the board of which the bill complains. If Congress or the legislative assembly had the power to commit to the board the duty of making the improvements, and [the power] to prescribe that the assessments should be made in the manner in which they were made, it had power to ratify the acts which it might have authorized. And the ratification, if made, was equivalent to an original authority, according to the Maxim, Omnis ratihabitio retrotrahitur et mandato priori oequiparatur. Under the Constitution Congress had power to exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever over the District, and this includes the power of taxation. Cohen v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 5 L. ed. 257. Congress may legislate within the District, respecting the people and property therein, as may the legislature of any state over any of its subordinate municipalities. It may therefore cure irregularities, and confirm proceedings which, without the confirmation, would be void, because unauthorized, provided such confirmation does not interfere with intervening rights.'\n\n It is then evident, speaking generally, both on principle and authority, that Congress had the power to pass the ratifying act of June 30, 1906, and that that act bars the plaintiff's right to recover, unless, by the application of some exception, this case is taken out of the operation of the general rule. And this brings us to consider the several propositions relied upon at bar to establish that such is the case.\n First. Whilst it is admitted that Congress had the power to levy tariff duties on goods coming into the United States from the Philippine Islands or coming into such islands from the United States after the ratification of the treaty, it is yet urged that, as that body was without authority to delegate to the President the legislative power of prescribing a tariff of duties, it hence could not, by ratification, make valid the exercise by the President of a legislative authority which could not have \n\n[206 U.S. 370, 385]\n\u00a0\n been delegated to him in the first instance. But the premise upon which this proposition rests presupposes that Congress, in dealing with the Philippine sl ands, may not, growing out of the relation of those islands to the United States, delegate legislative authority to such agencies as it may select,-a proposition which is not now open for discussion. Dorr v. United States, \n195 U.S. 138\n, 49 L. ed. 128, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 808.\n Second. As to the duties collected were illegal, it is insisted that, for the purpose of testing the validity of the act of Congress, the fact of such collection must be put out of view, and the act ratifying the exaction must be treated as if it were solely an original exercise by Congress of the taxing power. This being done, it is said, reduces the case to the inquiry, had Congress power, years after goods which were entitled to free entry had been brought into the Philippine Islands, to retroactively impose tariff duties upon the consummated act of bringing the goods into that country? But the proposition begs the question for decision, by shutting out from view the potential fact that when the goods were brought into the Philippine Islands there was a tariff in existence under which duties were exacted in the name of the United States. Indeed, the contention goes further even than this, since it entirely disregards the important consideration that, although the duties were illegally exacted, the illegality was not the result of an inherent want of power in the United States to have authorized the imposition of the duties, but simply arose from the failure to delegate to the official the authority essential to give immediate validity to his conduct in enforcing the payment of the duties. And when these misconceptions are borne in mind it results that the unsoundness of the proposition relied upon is demonstrated by the application of the elementary principle of ratification to which we have previously referred. Moreover, the fallacy which the proposition involves becomes yet more obvious when it is observed that the contention cannot even be formulated without misstating the nature of the act of Congress; in other words, without treating that act as retrospective legislation \n\n[206 U.S. 370, 386]\n\u00a0\n enacting a tariff, when, on its very face, the act is but an exercise of the conceded power dependent upon the law of agency to ratify an act done on behalf of the United States, which the United States could have originally authorized.\n Third. It is urged that the ratifying statute cannot be given effect without violating the 5th Amendment to the Constitution, since to give efficacy to the act would deprive the claimants of their property without due process of law, or would appropriate the same for public use without just compensation. This rests upon these two contentions: It is said that the money paid to discharge the illegally exacted duties after payment, as before, 'justly and equitably belonged' to the claimants, and that the title thereto continued in them as a vested right of property. It is consequently insisted that the right to recover the money could not be taken away without violating the 5th Amendment, as stated. But here, again, the argument disregards the fact that when the duties were illegally exacted in the name of the United States Congress possessed the power to have authorized their imposition in the mode in which they were enforced, and hence, from the very moment of collection, a right in Congress to ratify the transaction, if it saw fit to do so, was engendered. In other words, as a necessary result of the power to ratify, it followed that the right to recover the duties in question was subject to the exercise by Congress of its undoubted power to ratify. To hold to the contrary would be to say that whilst the unauthorized act of an officer done on behalf of the United States was subject to ratification by the United States, yet, if the officer acted without authority, the act, when performed, annihilated the power to ratify; that is, that the very condition which engendered the power destroyed it.\n But if it be conceded that the claim to a return of the moneys paid in discharged of the exacte d uties was, in a sense, a vested right, it in principle, as we have already observed, would be but the character of right referred to by Kent in his Commentaries, where, in treating of the validity of statutes retroactively operating on certain classes of rights, it is said (vol. 2, pp. 415, 416): \n\n[206 U.S. 370, 387]\n\u00a0\n 'The legal rights affected in those cases by the statutes were deemed to have been vested subject to the equity existing against them, and which the statutes recognized and enforced. Goshen v. Stonington, 4 Conn. 209, 10 Am. Dec. 121; Wilkinson v. Leland, 2 Pet. 627, 7 L. ed. 542; Langdon v. Strong, 2 Vt. 234; Watson v. Mercer, 8 Pet. 88, 8 L. ed. 876, 3 Story. Const. 267.'\n Nor does the mere fact that, at the time the ratifying statute was enacted, this action was pending for the recovery of the sums paid, cause the statute to be repugnant to the Constitution. The mere commencement of the suit did not change the nature of the right. Hence again, if it be conceded that the capacity to prosecute the pending suit to judgment was, in a sense, a vested right, certainly also the power of the United States to ratify was, to say the least, a right of as high a character. To arrogate to themselves the authority to devest the right of the United States to ratify is, then, in reason, the assumption upon which the asserted right of the claimants to recover must rest.\n Considering how far the bringing of actions would operate to deprive government of the power to enact curative statutes which, if the actions had not been brought, would have been unquestionably valid, Cooley, in his Constitutional Limitations, says (7th ed. p. 543):\n'Nor is it important, in any of the cases to which we have referred, that the legislative act which cures the irregularity, defect, or want of original authority, was passed after suit brought, in which such irregularity or defect became matter of importance. The bringing of suit vests in a party no right to a particular decision (Bacon v. Callender, 6 Mass. 303; Butler v. Palmer, 1 Hill, 324; Cowgill v. Long, 15 Ill. 202; Miller v. Graham, 17 Ohio St. 1; State v. Squires, 26 Iowa, 340; Patterson v. Philbrook, 9 Mass. 151); and his case must be determined on the law as it stands, not when the suit was brought, but when the judgment is rendered (Watson v. Mercer, 8 Pet. 88, 8 L. ed. 876; Mather v. Chapman, 6 Conn. 54; People ex rel. Bristol v. Ingham County, 20 Mich. 95; Satterlee v. Matthewson, 16 \n\n[206 U.S. 370, 388]\n\u00a0\n serg. & R. 169, and 2 Pet. 380, 7 L. ed. 458; Excelsior Mfg. Co. v. Keyser, 62 Miss. 155; Phenix Ins. Co. v. Pollard, 63 Miss. 641; McLane v. Bonn, 70 Iowa, 752, 30 N. W. 478; Johnson v. Richardson, 44 Ark. 365).' And the following cases, in various forms, illustrate the application of the principle: United States v. Morris, 10 Wheat. 246, 6 L. ed. 314; Grim v. Weissenberg school district, 57 Pa. 433, 438, 98 Am. Dec. 237; Chester v. Black, 132 Pa. 568, 6 L.R.A. 802, 19 Atl. 276; Price v. Huey, 22 Ind. 18; Welch v. Wadsworth, 30 Conn. 149, 158, 79 Am. Dec. 236; Rich v. Flanders, 39 N. H. 310, 311; Iowa R. Land Co. v. Soper, 39 Iowa, 112, 119; Ferry v. Campbell, 110 Iowa, 290, 50 L.R.A. 92, 81 N. W. 604; Mills v. Geer, 111 Ga. 275, 279, 287, 288, 52 L.R.A. 934, 36 S. E. 673.\n\n Fourth. Aside, however, from principle and the general result of the adjudged cases, it is finally insisted that the want of power in Congress to ratify the collection of the duties in question under the circumstances here disclosed conclusively results from the decision in De Lima v. Bidwell, \n182 U.S. 1\n, 45 L. ed. 1041, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 743. As we have seen, that case concerned the validity of collections of duties in the port of New York on goods brought into the United States from Porto Rico, and, whilst insisting on the legality of the duties, the government, at the same time, urged that, even if originally invalid, they had yet been ratified as the result of provisions of a specified act of Congress which had been passed after the suit to recover the duties had been commenced. As tht portion of the duties sued for which had been collected after ratification of the treaty were decided to be illegal, it followed that a decision as to the question of ratification was required. In passing upon the subject, after intimating doubt as to whether the act relied upon, as manifesting the intention of Congress to ratify, was intended to have that effect, it was remarked (p. 199, L. ed. p. 1057, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 754):\n'It can clearly have no retroactive effect as to moneys theretofore paid under protest, for which an action to recover back had already been brought. As the action in this case was brought March 13, 1900, eleven days before the act was passed, the right to recover the money sued for could not be taken away by a \n\n[206 U.S. 370, 389]\n\u00a0\n subsequent act of Congress. Plaintiffs sue in assumpsit for money which the collector has in his hands, justly and equitably belonging to them. To say that Congress could, by a subsequent act, deprive them of the right to prosecute this action, would be beyond its power. In any event, it should not be interpreted so as to make it retroactive. Kennett's Petition, 24 N. H. 139; Alter's Appeal, 67 Pa. 341, 5 Am. Rep. 433; Norman v. Heist, 5 Watts & S. 171, 40 Am. Dec. 493; Donovan v. Pitcher, 53 Ala. 411, 25 Am. Dec. 643; Palairet's Appeal, 67 Pa. 479, 5 Am. Rep. 450; State use of Methodist Episcopal Church v. Warren, 28 Md. 338.'\n\n Now, considering the language just quoted in connection with the doubt expressed as to the import of the alleged ratifying statute, it results that the reasoning employed stated two considerations: First, the want of power in Congress to ratify after suit brought; and second, the duty of construing the statute relied upon so as not to produce ratification, in view of its ambiguity. As the question of construction was last stated and that question was declared to be 'in any event' decisive, we think the observations made concerning the want of power to ratify after suit brought must be regarded as not having been necessary to the decision rendered, and therefore must be treated as obiter. And this interpretation was, we think, applied in the cases of Lincoln v. United States and Warner, B. & Co. v. United States, \n197 U.S. 419\n, 49 L. ed. 816, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 455. In those cases, as we have said, one of the defenses insisted upon by the government was a ratification alleged to have been operated by the act of Congress of July 1, 1902, which was passed after the bringing of the actions to recover. It is patent on the face of the opinion announced on the original hearing that the decision was exclusively based upon the ground that the act of Congress was so ambiguous concerning the ratification relied upon that it should not be implied that such ratification was contemplated. And it is to be observed that De Lima v. Bidwell was not overlooked, since that case was referred to in the course of the opinion. On the rerehearing the case was argued on questions submitted by the court, viz., whether the act relied upon manifested the purpose to ratify, and, if it did, whether Congress had \n\n[206 U.S. 370, 390]\n\u00a0\n power so to do. In the opinion on the rehearing, while the court reiterated the view previously expressed, that the act could not be treated as ratifying the collection of the duties sought to be recovered, because of its ambiguity in that regard, yet it expressly recognized the power in Congress to ratify, and in effect declared that, as to those things to which the alleged ratifying act clearly applied, ratification had resulted. This is so, since in the course of the opinion, in answering the argument that the alleged ratifying statute would be meaningless unless it was held applicable to the particular duties in controversy, it was pointed out (202 U.S. p. 499, 50 L. ed. p. 1119, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 730) that there were duties which had been levied and collected other than those in controversy, to which the act clearly applied, and 'that question [ as to them] was put at rest by this ratification.' Furthe, in calling attention to the ambiguity in the ratifying statute relied upon and the resulting doubt whether it embraced all duties, it was pointed out that the fact that actions were pending at the time of the passage of the ratifying act lent cogency to the view that, if Congress had intended by the ratification to affect them, it would have explicitly so declared. On this subject the court said (p. 498, L. ed. p. 1119, Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 730):\n'This construction is favored by the consideration that the suits had been begun when the act of July 1, 1902, was passed, and that, even if Congress could deprive plaintiffs of their vested rights in process of being asserted (Hamilton v. Dillin, 21 Wall. 73, 22 L. ed. 528), still it is not to be presumed to do so on language which, literally taken, has a narrower sense.'\n\n Certainly, this language, particularly in view of the reference made to Hamilton v. Dillin, is wholly incompatible with the conception that the observation as to pending actions made in De Lima v. Bidwell was to be taken as having settled the proposition that a power to ratify which otherwise obtained could not be exerted after suit brought.\n Be this as it may, however, as, after deliberate consideration, we are of opinion that the mere bringing of this action did not deprive Congress of its power to ratify the collections made by \n\n[206 U.S. 370, 391]\n\u00a0\n its officers, in the name of the United States, of the moneys sought to be recovered in this action, we may not allow the remarks made in De Lima v. Bidwell, under the circumstances stated, to control our judgment.\n There was much discussion at bar concerning whether the payments of the duties were voluntary. As it would seem that the circumstances surrounding these payments were substantially like unto those existing in the Lincoln and Warner, B. & Co. Cases, in which the opinions of the court made no reference to the question of voluntary payment, we have concluded to pass that question by, as our conclusion on the subject of ratification disposes of the controversy.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice Brewer and Mr. Justice Peckham dissent.\n Mr. Justice Moody took no part in the decision of the cause.\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan, concurring:\n By the act of 1906, 34 Stat. at L. 636, chap. 3912, Congress legalized, ratified, and confirmed, as fully, to all intents and purposes, as if the same had, by prior act, been specifically authorized and directed, the collection of all duties, both import and export, imposed by the authorities of the United States or of the provisional military government in the Philippine Islands, prior to March 8th, 1902, at all parts and places in said Islands, from the United States or from foreign countries. Interpreted in the light of previous and pending litigation, this act should be construed as denying the authority of any court to take cognizance of a suit brought against the United States to recover any claim arising out of such collections. The act should, therefore, be construed as withdrawing the consent of the United States to be sued on account of claims of that character. In this view, it was error to render judgment against the United States, whatever might be the liability of the collector, if his exaction of \n\n[206 U.S. 370, 392]\n\u00a0\n the duties in question was without authority of law. Upon this ground alone, and without considering any of the questions discussed in the opinion of the court, I concur in the judgment of reversal. \n\n\n\n","162":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v.

McCalmont for appellee.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n This was a petition for the recovery of $116.66. The case having been heard by the court of claims, that court, upon the evidence, filed the following findings of fact and conclusion of law:\n Findings of Fact.\n\n 1. \nThe claimant, John M. Hite, was appointed assistant engineer in the United States Navy, with the relative rank of ensign, for temporary service during the late war with Spain, on May 14, 1898; he reported for duty on board the U. S. S. 'Massachusetts,' in obedience to orders of the Navy Department, on June 1, 1898, and served creditably as such officer on said ship until December 17, 1898, at which date he was detached and ordered to his home, and on December 22, 1898, was honorably discharged from the naval service. \n\n[204 U.S. 343, 345]\n\u00a0\n The order referred to is in the words following:\n'Navy Department,\n\n'Washington, D. C., Dec. 12, 1898\n\n\n\n'Sir:--\n\n'You are hereby detached from duty on board the U. S. S. 'Massachusetts,' and will proceed to your home.\n\n'Immediately upon your arrival report your local address in full to the Bureau of Navigation, Navy Department, washington, D. C. See article 224, U. S. Navy Regulations, 1896.\n\n'Report also the date of your detachment, and inform the Department of the status of your accounts, and whether you are indebted to the government by reason of advances drawn by you.\n\n'Respectfully,\n\n'John D. Long, Secretary.\n\n'Assistant Engineer John M. Hite, U. S. N.,\n\n'U. S. S. Massachusetts.'\n\n\n 2. \nThe U. S. S. 'Massachusetts' was in commission and cruised beyond the limits of the United States (in Cuban waters) during the time of the claimant's service on board.\n\n 3. \nIn settlement of claimant's claim for extra pay authorized by the act of March 3, 1899 [30 Stat. at L. 1214, chap. 427], he was allowed by the accounting officers of the Treasury Department two months' pay at the rate of pay of an assistant engineer in the Navy on waiting orders only, to wit, $166.66.\n If entitled to two months' pay upon the basis of sea service the difference is $116.66.\n Conclusion of Law.\n Upon the foregoing findings of fact the court decides, as a conclusion of law, that the claimant is entitled to judgment in the sum of one hundred and sixteen dollars and sixty-six cents ($116.66).\n The case is reported 41 Ct. Cl. 256.\n The act of March 3, 1899 (30 Stat. at L. 1228, chap. 427), among other things, provides: \n\n[204 U.S. 343, 346]\n\u00a0\n 'The officers and enlisted men comprising the temporary force of the Navy during the war with Spain, who served creditably beyond the limits of the United States, and who have been or may hereafter be discharged, shall be paid two months' extrapay; and all such officers and enlisted men of the Navy who have so served within the limits of the United States, and who have been or may hereafter be discharged, shall be paid one month's extra pay.'\n Appellee's counsel say that the issue is correctly stated by counsel for the United States as follows:\n'The claimant contends that the two months' extra pay provided for in the foregoing statute should be at the rate of pay he received while doing sea service, to wit, $1,700 per year.\n\n'The contention of the government is that under the ruling of this court in United States v. North, \n112 U.S. 510\n, 28 L. ed. 808, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 285, the claimant has been paid all that was due him, inasmuch as he was paid two months' extra pay provided for in the statute at the rate of pay he was receiving at the time of his discharge,-to wit, at the rate of $ 1,000 per annum.'\n\n Appellee was appointed an officer in the Navy, May 14, 1898, by authority of the act of Congress of May 4 of that year (30 Stat. at L. 369, chap. 234, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1056), which provided:\n'Whenever, within the next twelve months, an exigency may exist which, in the judgment of the President, renders their services necessary, he is hereby authorized to appoint from civil life and commission such officers of the line and staff, not above the rank or relative rank of commander, and warrant officers including warrant machinists, and such officers of the Marine Corps not above the rank of captain, to be appointed from the noncommissioned officers of the corps and from civil life, as may be requisite: Provided, That such officers shall serve only during the continuance of the exigency under which their services are required in the existing war.'\n\n The war with Spain began April 21, 1898, and the treaty \n\n[204 U.S. 343, 347]\n\u00a0\n of Paris was signed December 10, 1898. [30 Stat. at L. 1754.] Appellee served until December 17, 1898, at which time he was detached from the vessel on which he was serving and ordered home, where, on December 22, he was honorably discharged from the naval service. It seems to have been thought reasonable that the government should pay the expenses of the journey home and for the time in getting there.\n The act of March 3, 1899, provided for extra pay for active service. Hite was detached because it became the Department's duty to discharge him under the proviso of the act of 1898, and the detachment was manifestly preliminary to his discharge. The order detaching him did not prescribe that on arrival home he was to hold himself 'on waiting orders' or for further assignment to duty. On the other hand, it required him to inform the Department of the status of his accounts, obviously in order that they might be settled on his leaving the service.\n The two months' extra pay is given, as Chief Justice Peele, delivering the opinion of the court of claims, says, 'because of creditable service beyond the limits of the United States during the war with Spain, and, therefore, upon discharge such officers become entitled to the same pay they were receiving while so serving beyond the limits of the United States.' 'To hold, because the claimant war ordered to his home, where he was discharged five days later, instead of being discharged on the day he was detached, that therefore he is entitled only to the lesser pay, would be a construction too narrow to harmonize with the purpose of Congress as disclosed by the act.' Notwithstanding the considered dissenting opinion in the court below, we agree with the conclusion that, his engagement having ended, and he having been discharged, the two months' extra pay should have been given him upon the basis of the pay he was receiving when detached.\n The contention of the government is that this case is governed by the ruling in United States v. North, \n112 U.S. 510\n, 28 L. ed. 808, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 285. In that case it was held that officers of the Navy and of the \n\n[204 U.S. 343, 348]\n\u00a0\n regular Army, who were employed in the prosecution of the war with Mexico, were entitled to the three months' extra pay provided for by the act of Congress of July 19, 1848, chap. 104,  5, 9 Stat. at L. 248, and the act of February 19, 1879, chap. 90, 20 Stat. at L. 316.\n The act of 1848 provided: 'That the officers, etc., engaged, etc., in the war with Mexico, and who served out the term of their engagement, or have been or may be honorably discharged, . . . shall be entitled to receive three months' extra pay.'\n North was an officer in the Navy of the United States from May 29, 1829, to January 14, 1861, when he resigned. He served in the war with Mexico, as lieutenant, on board the frigate Potomac, from February 10, 1846, until July, 1847, when his vessel sailed for the United States. And Chief Justice Waite said:\n'Those of the regular Army or Navy who were 'engaged in the military service of the United States in the war with Mexico' may be said to 'have served out the term of their engagement,' or to have been 'honorably discharged,' within the meaning of those terms as used in the act of 1848, when the war was over, or when they were ordered or mustered out of that service. Being in the Army and Navy, their 'engagement' was to serve wherever they were ordered for duty. Their engagement to serve in the war with Mexico ended when they were taken away from that service by proper authority.\n\n'The pay they were to receive was evidently that which they were receiving at the end of their engagement, or when they were honorably discharged. The language is, 'shall be entitled to receive three months' extra pay,' evidently meaning the same pay they would have received if they had remained in the same service three months longer. It follows that, as North was serving at sea when he was ordered away, he was entitled to three months' sea pay.'\n\n In the present case, appellee was taken away from the ser- \n\n[204 U.S. 343, 349]\n\u00a0\n vice when he was detached from his vessel, as he was appointed to serve 'only during the continuance of the exigency under which their services were required in the existing war,' and was entitled, in the circumstances of the case, to extra pay on the basis of that which he was receiving when detached, as we have said above.\n Emory's Case was also considered by the court in the same opinion and the same conclusion reached, and reference was there made to that case as reported in 19 Ct. Cl. 254.\n The judgment of the Court of Claims was right, and it is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice Moody took no part in the disposition of this case. \n\n\n\n","163":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. KEATLEY(1907)\nNo. 482\nArgued: Decided: February 25, 1907\n\n\n\n Assistant Attorney General Van Orsdel and Mr. Philip M. Ashford for appellant.\n Mr. Frank B. Crosthwaite for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n The claimant in the court below, appellee here, was clerk of the United States circuit court for the southern district of West Virginia from July 1 to July 6, 1902, and clerk of that court and the district court from July 16, 1902, to September 17, 1904. He regularly rendered accounts for such services, which contained, among other things, charges for 'separate docket fees in separate trials under one indictment.' The charges were disallowed and this suit was brought therefor in the court of claims. Judgment was rendered for claimant for the sum of $125.45, certain items being disallowed.\n A counterclaim was filed by the United States for the recovery of $57. 90, charged for 'docketing judgments,' alleged to have been erroneously and unlawfully paid to claimant \n\n[204 U.S. 562, 563]\n\u00a0\n by the accounting officers of the United States. The counterclaim was disallowed and the United States assigns as error the action of the court in rendering judgment for the claimant as aforesaid and overruling the counterclaim. In passing on the charge for the service the court of claims said:\n'The defendant's contention as to item 6 is troublesome. It appears that joint indictments were returned against several defendants; that on motion of defendants' counsel separate trials were granted to some of the defendants, whereupon the clerk made separate docket entries in accordance with said motion, docketing said causes as though separate indictments had been returned against the parties granted separate trials.\n\n'Paragraph 10 of  828 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 635) provides:\n\n\"For making dockets and indexes, issuing venire, tax costs, and all other services on the trial or argument of a cause where issue is joined and testimony given, three dollars.'\n\n'By paragraph 11 a fee of $2 is allowed where no testimony is given, and by paragraph 12 a fee of $1 is allowed where the cause is dismissed or discontinued or judgment or decree rendered without issue.'\n\n The contention of the appellant turns upon the word 'cause.' The argument is that the word 'cause' is limited by the word indictment, and if it be returned against a number of persons and they be granted separate trials there is only one 'cause.' It is conceded that the court may grant separate trials, and it is not disputed that the court did so in the case for which the services sued for were charged and that each was separately designated on the records.\n We think the order granting separate trials made separate causes, and therefore each was independent of the other. State v. Rogers, 6 Baxt. 563; Noland v. State, 19 Ohio, 131; Bryan v. Spivey, 106 N. C. 95, 11 S. E. 510. The services rendered were a proper charge under the statute.\n\n 2. \nThe counterclaim was for the recovery of $57.90, charges \n\n[204 U.S. 562, 564]\n\u00a0\n made for 'docketing judgments,' and the lists filed showed amounts from $0. 15 to $8.70. The court of claims' comment was: 'The defendant's counterclaim, predicated upon the alleged illegal allowance for the docketing of judgments, will have to be dismissed. The services here charged for were admittedly performed, by order of the court, and, under United States v. Jones, \n193 U.S. 528\n, 48 L. ed. 776, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 561, allowable.'\n The case referred to is United States v. Jones, supra. In the absence of anything in the record to the contrary, we must assume that the application of that case was made on account of the facts presented to the court of claims in this. Counsel for the United States say that the findings of the court of claims 'on the subject of the counterclaim are not as full and complete as they might be.' A belief is expressed, however, that it appears, from the face of the counterclaim, that they are folio fees. At all events, it is insisted, that they are not the charges specified in paragraphs 10, 11, and 12 of  828 of the Revised Statutes. This the appellee concedes in effect, and urges that the charge was made under and is justified by paragraph 8 of that section, which reads as follows: 'For entering any rule, order, continuance, judgment, decree, or recognizance, or drawing any bond or making any record, certificate, return, or report, for each folio, fifteen cents.' The words we have italicized are the words upon which appellee relies, combined with the following order of the court:\n'The clerk of this court is directed to keep a judgment docket wherein shall be recorded abstracts of all judgments rendered in cases wherein the United States is a party. Said judgment docket shall contain:\n\n'The number of the case.\n\n'The date of the indictment.\n\n'The names of the parties.\n\n'The amount of the judgment.\n\n'The amount of costs.\n\n'The date of the judgment. \n\n[204 U.S. 562, 565]\n\u00a0\n 'When docketed.\n\n'The amount paid.\n\n'The disposition of the funds and any additional matter which the clerk may deem pertinent.'\n\n The record required by that rule, appellee contends, is different from the various dockets which are kept in all United States courts in which brief entries of fact are made, and which, it is said, are covered by the docket fee. The contention is consonant with the decision of the court of claims, and we do not think it is refuted by the suggestions made by appellant.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","164":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v.

His entire service was within the limits of the United States.\n\n 2. \nWhile on duty as second lieutenant of the First Ohio \n\n[205 U.S. 161, 162]\n\u00a0\n Volunteer Cavalry, at Huntsville, Alabama, during the Spanish war, claimant received the following order:\n'Headquarters 1st Ohio Volunteer Cavalry, Camp Wheeler, Huntsville, Ala., August 24, 1898\n\n\n\n Special Orders,\n No. 44.\n'1. 1st Lieut. William D. Forsyth, 1st Ohio Volunteer Cavalry, having been ordered before a board of examination for appointment as second lieutenant in the Regular Army, is hereby relieved of the command of Troop E. He will turn over the property, funds, and records of the troop to his successor.\n\n'2. 2d Lieut. Donn C. Mitchell, 1st Ohio Volunteer Cavalry, is hereby appointed to the command of Troop E. He will receipt to Lieut. Forsyth for the property and funds pertaining to the troop.\n\n'By order of Lieut. Col. Day.\n\n (Signed) A. C. Rogers,\n Captain and Regtl. Adj. 1st Ohio Vol. Cav.'\n This order was approved by the commanding general in the field in the following orders:\n'Headquarters Fourth Army Corps, Camp Wheeler, Huntsville, Ala., September 2, 1898.\n\n Special Orders,\n No. 97.\n ... * *\n'2. It appearing from evidence that the following-named officers of the First Ohio Volunteer Cavalry have exercised the functions of commanders above that pertaining to the grades held by them from and after the dates set opposite their respective names, the assignment thereto contemplated by General Order No. 86, current series, Adjutant General's Office, is confirmed, namely:\n\n ... * * \n\n[205 U.S. 161, 163]\n\u00a0\n\n'2d Lieut. Donn C. Mitchell, as captain, from August 24th, 1898.\n\n ... * *\n'By command of Major-General Coppinger:\n\n (Signed) Clarence K. Edwards,\n Assistant Adjutant-General.'\n Under these orders claimant exercised command of Troop E from August 26, 1898, to October 23, 1898, when he was mustered out with his regiment.\n So much of G. O. No. 86, A. G. O. of 1898, as relates to the matter of pay for exercising a higher command, is as follows:\n General Orders,\n No. 86.\n'Headquarters of the Army,\n\n Adjutant General's Office,\n Washington, July 2, 1898.\n'1. In  7 of the act 'For the Better Organization of the Line of the Army of the United States,' approved April 26, 1898 [30 Stat. at L. 365, chap. 191, I. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 895], it is provided 'That in time of war every officer serving with troops operating against an enemy who shall exercise, under assignment in orders issued by competent authority, a command above that pertaining to his grade, shall be entitled to receive the pay and allowances of the grade appropriate to the command so exercised.'\n\n'The Attorney General has held that this clause 'was intended to apply to all instances where the troops of the United States are assembled in separate bodies, such as regiments, brigades, divisions, or corps, for the purpose of carrying on and bringing to a conclusion the war with Spain,' but that 'all service in the Army at the present time is not to be considered as operating against an enemy,' Troops and their officers on the western frontiers, performing the same service as garrisons which is requisite in time of peace, and in no wise considered a part of the Army assembled to carry on the war with Spain, would not be within the meaning of the act.\n\n'To entitle an officer to the pay of a grade above that \n\n[205 U.S. 161, 164]\n\u00a0\n actually held by him the assignment in orders under the clause cited must be by the written order of the commanding general in the field or the Secretary of War, and no pay or allowances of a higher grade than that actually held by an officer will be paid under this provision except when a certified copy, in duplicate, of such order, with statement of service, is filed with the paymaster. . . .'\n\n General Orders No. 86 was amended by General Orders No. 155, dated September 27, 1898, by striking out the above portion of the order, and, on the same date, Circular No. 18, promulgating this order, was amended by striking out the portion above quoted and inserting in lieu thereof the following language, to wit:\n'To entitle an officer to the pay of a grade above that actually held by him under  7 of the act of Congress approved April 26, 1898, he must be assigned in orders issued by competent authority to a command appropriate to such higher grade of troops operating against the enemy.' Circ. No. 39, A. G. O., Sept. 27, 1898.\n\n At the time that he assumed, and during the time that he exercised, command of troop E, he was the senior officer present with the troop.\n The Treasury Department, from the decision of the Comptroller of March 31, 1899 (5 Comp. Dec. 641), to the decision of the court in Humphreys v. United States, 38 Ct. Cl. 689, on May 25, 1903 (pp. 15-16), recognized this sort of orders, so subsequently confirmed, as sufficient authority for the higher pay. Under similar orders, subsequently affirmed, all officers were paid either by the Pay Department or by the Treasury Department in claims presented after the war.\n\n 3. \nFrom August 26, 1898, to October 19, 1898, claimant was originally paid the rate due a second lieutenant of cavalry, and from October 20 to October 23, 1898, he originally received the pay of a first lieutenant of cavalry. He subsequently filed a claim for additional pay for command of the troop and was paid by the auditor for the War Department, \n\n[205 U.S. 161, 165]\n\u00a0\n October 30, 1899, the pay of a captain for the entire period from August 26, 1898, to October 23, 1898.\n\n 4. \nOn the 14th day of September, 1898, a furlough of thirty days for said regiment was authorized under General Orders No. 130, A. G. O., 1898, and amendatory circulars. The above-named claimant did not receive such furlough. From the beginning of the furlough to September 26, 1898, the said claimant was sick in Mount Carmel Hospital, Columbus, Ohio. From September 26, 1898, to the end of the furlough period he was detained for duty and actually performed duty. During the whole furlough period he was at all times subject to the orders of his superior officers until final muster out. Claimant was first taken sick at Huntsville, Alabama, before the furlough, but accompanied his regiment to the home station at Columbus, Ohio, where he was placed in the hospital by officers of said regiment, the surgeon being absent. While at the hospital claimant performed some military service by directing a clerk employed by him for that purpose.\n\n 5. \nIf claimant is entitled to retain the pay already received by him, the amount due him as extra pay at the rate due a captain, mounted, is $ 166.66.\n'If entitled to extra pay at the rate due a second lieutenant, mounted, the amount due is $125.\n\n If entitled to extra pay, and not entitled to retain the pay of a captain as stated in finding 3, there should be deducted from the extra pay allowed the sum of $79.44.\n The court rendered judgment for the claimant in the sum of $166.66. 41 Ct. Cl. 36.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n It is conceded by the government that claimant is entitled to extra pay, so that the question is to what amount. Was he entitled to receive one month's extra pay of a captain of cavalry, mounted ($166.66), or one month's extra pay of a second lieutenant of cavalry, mounted ($125)?\n We lay out of view the suggestion that if claimant were entitled to the extra pay of a second lieutenant of cavalry only, then that a certain sum or sums ought to be deducted as having been previously improvidently paid by the auditor for the War Department. The United States filed no setoff or counterclaim, and we think we cannot overhaul the allowance by the auditor for the War Department in the circumstances. Such payment, if made in error, did not determine the question before us within United States v. Hite, \n204 U.S. 343\n, 51 L. ed. 514, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 386. \n\n[205 U.S. 161, 166]\n\u00a0\n The claim is made under  7 of the act of April 26, 1898 (30 Stat. at L. 364, 365, chap. 191, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 895), reading as follows: 'That in time of war every officer serving with troops operating against an enemy who shall exercise, under assignment in orders issued by competent authority, a command above that pertaining to his grade, shall be entitled to receive the pay and allowances of the grade appropriate to the command so exercised.'\n The main question is whether claimant exercised, 'under assignment in orders issued by competent authority, a command above that pertaining to his grade?' When he assumed command of his company. August 26, 1898, he was the senior officer present, the captain and the first lieutenant being absent. Section 253 of the Army Regulations of 1895, then in force, provided: 'In the absence of its captain, the command of a company devolves upon the subaltern next in rank who is serving with it, unless otherwise specially directed.'\n Assistant Attorney General Van Orsdel and George M. Anderson for appellant.\n George A. King, William B. King, and Clark McKercher for appellee.\n\n Statement by Mr. Chief Justice Fuller:\n\n\n[205 U.S. 161, 169]\n\u00a0\n This embodied the rule of succession by seniority prevailing in the ordinary course of military affairs, while, at the same time, it recognized that there might be exceptions, in respect of which special direction was required, and  7 of the act of April 26, 1898, applied to such cases.\n The exceptions spring from necessity, and where it is apparent that that does not exist, orders relied on as the basis for increased pay under  7 are ineffectual for that purpose.\n In Humphreys v. United States, 38 Ct. Cl. 689, the court of claims held that what the law contemplated was 'necessary, and not gratuitous, assignments, and only such as would be for the good of the service for the vigorous prosecution of the war.' Chief Justice Nott, speaking for the court, said: 'It seems to the court incontrovertible that the words 'under assignment in orders issued by competent authority' constitute the controlling limitation of the statute; and the limitation implies that the benefits of the statute extend only to cases where such an order is necessary to impose the burden of the higher command upon an officer.' We concur in that view, and, tested by it, Special Orders No. 44, dated August 24, 1898, whereby the lieutenant colonel of the First Ohio Volunteer Cavalry announced that First Lieutenant Forsyth was relieved of the command of troop E, and, as incident thereto, that Second Lieutenant Mitchell was appointed to the command, cannot be considered as an 'assignment in orders issued by competent authority,' within  7. That section was not enacted to give increased pay for the discharge of the ordinary duties of the service, but to give compensation for the greater risk and responsibility of active military command, and no assignment in orders when unnecessary to that end can make a case within the statute. Truitt v. United States, 38 Ct. Cl. 398, 406; Parker v. United States, 1 Pet. 293, 297, 7 L. ed. 150, 151. Here the additional duties discharged by Lieutenant Mitchell were 'the ordinary incidental duties of military official life which go with each officer's commission.' 38 Ct. Cl. 692. \n\n[205 U.S. 161, 170]\n\u00a0\n The attempted confirmation by Special Orders No. 97 must fail of effect under  7 for like reasons.\n Other questions argued at the bar need not be discussed.\n Judgment reversed and cause remanded, with a direction to enter judgment in favor of claimant for $125. \n\n\n\n","165":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v.

We summarize from the findings the status of the Philippine Islands at the time of the contract, stating besides the facts concerning the organization in the War Department of what is now known as the Bureau of Insular Affairs.\n After the occupation of Manila, up to September 1, 1900, a \n\n[207 U.S. 229, 232]\n\u00a0\n military government prevailed. From September 1, 1900, to July, 1901, authority of a legislative nature was vested in the Philippine commission, under and subject to rules and regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary of War. From July 4, 1901, the executive authority as to civil affairs was transferred to the president of the Philippine commission under the title of civil governor, his authority being exercised under instructions from the President, subject to the direction and control of the Secretary of War. The Secretary of War organized the Division of Insular Affairs, which was given general charge of departmental business concerning the Philippine Islands. The organization of the division was confirmed and ratified by Congress on July 1, 1902 (32 Stat. at L. 712, chap. 1369, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1907, p. 23), and after that act the division became known as the Bureau of Insular Affairs of the War Department. The facts concerning the contract in controversy are these:\n In May, 1901, the president of the Philippine commission telegraphed the Secretary of War, stating the necessity for a government printing office at Minlia, asking concerning the qualifications of a particular individual suggested for superintendent, and recommending the immediate purchase and shipment of an outfit for the proposed printing office. The finding expressly state, or by clear implication establish, the following:\n In response to said cablegram, the Secretary of War directed the Insular Bureau of the War Department to purchase and forward to Manila the necessary machinery, equipment, and supplies for the establishment and operation of such printing office, and also to secure the services of a competent force of operators therefor; which duty was performed by said division.\n On and prior to August 17, 1901, claimant was furnishing and supplying defendants divers papers and stationery, under contract, for use in various of its departments; and, thereupon, the Chief of the Division of Insular Affairs solicited claimant to furnish and supply, for use in said Philippine public printing office, being established at Manila, Philippine Islands, certain papers of described kinds, as follows: \n\n[207 U.S. 229, 233]\n\u00a0\n (Circular D.)\n War Department, Office of the Secretary, Division of Insular Affairs, Washington, D.

The note referred to and inclosed in the letter was the following: 'Note.-( Care Barber & Company, steamship agents, Pier B, Pennsylvania docks, jersey City, N. J.)\n'A special arrangement has been made so that, after f. o. b. delivery, as above, at Jersey City, the freight rate for the transportation of these supplies and the equipment of the Manila printing office will not be higher than $11.05 per ton (dead weight) and possibly less. Rate for measurement freight to be made on a correspondingly low basis, in accordance with the space occupied. Therefore the Philippine government will, upon invoice verfication at Manila, reimburse you for the cost of this ocean shipment.'\n\n Before the paper was shipped, the Division of Insular Affairs gave further instructions as follows: 'Note.-(Care Barber & Company, East Central Pier, Brooklyn, N. Y.)\n'A special arrangement has been made so that, after f. o. b. delivery, as above, at Brooklyn, the freight rate for the transportation of the supplies and equipment of the Manila printing office will not be higher than $11.05 per ton (dead weight) and posibly less. Rate for measurement freight to be made on a correspondingly low basis, in accordance with the space occupied. Therefore the Philippine government will, upon invoice verification at Manila, reimburse you for the cost of this ocean shipment.'\n\n The findings relating to the value of the paper, its forwarding to and arrival of a part at Manila, and the subsequent controversy between Andrews & Company and the government concerning the same, show the following to be the case: \n\n[207 U.S. 229, 236]\n\u00a0\n In compliance with the directions, Andrews & Company packed the paper for export shipment, directing it to Governor W. H. Taft, Manila, Philippine Islands, in care of Barber & Company, East Central Pier, Brooklyn, New York, and prepaid the freight. The quoted value of the paper was $3,087.75. The freight charges from New York to Manila were $196.35, which, together with $1 for clearance papers, prepaid by Andrews & Company, brought the total purchase or invoice price to $3,285.10. When the paper was delivered to Barber & Company, Andrews & Company took triplicate bills of lading, consigning the paper to Governor W. H. Taft or his assigns, Manila, Philippine Islands, and delivered the duplicate bills of lading to the Chief of Division of Insular Affairs, in accordance with the instructions given. Barber & Company forwarded the paper by the steamship Indrasamaha. When the vessel arrived at Singapore, it was found that a portion of her cago, including the consignment of paper, was badly damaged by water. Some of the paper was condemned by a board of survey convened by the agents of the ship, and was sold in Singapore. The remainder was repacked and forwarded to Manila. When it arrived it was so damaged as to render it unfit for use. The consignee (Governor Taft) refused to accept it, and a committee, which was appointed by him as civil governor, recommended that the paper be stored in a warehouse of the Philippine government until instructions were received from Andrews & Company, who had no agent in the islands. Thereupon the public printer of the Philippine Islands wrote Andrews & Company, informing them of the facts just stated, and asking instructions as to what they wished done, and on May 31, 1902, the Division of Insular Affairs also wrote Andrews & Company on the same subject as follows:\n War Department, Office of the Secretary,\n Division of Insular Affairs,\n Washington, D. C., May 31, 1902.\n Gentlemen:--\n I have the honor to inform you that a letter dated April 14th, 1902, has been received from Mr. John S. Leech, public printer, manila, P. I., advising this division of the \n\n[207 U.S. 229, 237]\n\u00a0\n accident which occurred to the S. S. 'INDRASAMAHA,' which resulted in damaging 500 reams linen paper, valued at $3,285.10, as per your bill of October 24th, 1901.\n Mr. Leech requested that you be informed that the paper is damaged so badly that it will be impossible to use any of it; that an insurance inspector and a government inspection committee were then surveying and inspecting the damaged goods, and that this action was taken for the protection of the contractors, who had taken the precaution to insure their goods against losses.\n Very respectfully,\n Andrews & Company thus replied to this letter:\n Washington, D. C., June 7, 1902.\n Lieut. Col. Edwards,\n Chief Division of Insular Affairs,\n War Department, Washington, D. C.\n Dear Sir:--\n We are in receipt of your favor May 31st, No. 5423-1, quoting letter received by Mr. John S. Leech, public printer, Manila, P. I., with regard to map paper, therein stated to have been damaged in transportation on steamship 'Indrasamaha.'\n This paper was shipped as per your order, bills of lading being obtained as directed, and your instructions carried out implicitly. Your goods were turned over, upon direction of your office, to Messrs. Barber & Company, your agents in that behalf at Jersey City, N. J., in good order and condition, whereupon our responsibility ceased.\n We have the honor, therefore, to request that our bill as rendered be approved for payment.\n Kindly advise us also whether you desire us to make a duplicate of said shipment.\n Requesting the favor of an early reply, we are,\n Very respectfully yours,\n The shipment of paper was not insured either by the government or by Andrews & Company. The proceeds of the sale at Singapore never reached either the government or Andrews & Company, \n\n[207 U.S. 229, 238]\n\u00a0\n and the paper stored at manila remained there until May, 1903, when it was sold, producing a sum insufficient to pay the storage charges, and the proceeds were turned into the treasury of the government of the Philippine Islands in partial payment of the charges.\n All the propositions which the government has elaborately pressed at bar are reducible to two.\n First. That the paper was purchased by the government of the Philippine Islands, and therefore, in any event, there was error in holding the United States liable.\n Second. That, even if the United States was the purchaser, it was erroneously held liable, because the paper was never delivered, and therefore was at the risk of the owner, Andrews & Company, and the loss and damage fell upon them.\n We proceed to consider these propositions:\n\n 1. \nWe need not consider the contention that the Philippine Islands were a distinct governmental entity, for whose contracts the United States was not bound, because that subject is irrelevant, since it begs the real question,-that is, whether the purchase was made by the United States. Testing whether the paper was bought by the United States by the contract and course of dealing as disclosed by the findings, we think there is no escape from the conclusion that the United States was the party contracting for the purchase. It cannot be doubted that the findings make clear the fact that the Secretary of War, through his agent, the Division of Insular Affairs, was the actor on one side and Andrews & Company on the other. Nothing in the dealings, as disclosed by the findings, would warrant the conclusion that the Division of Insular Affairs acted or purported to act as the agent of the government of the Philippine Islands. The telegram to the Secretary of war, which opened the subject, did not even suggest a contract to be made in the name of the government of the Philippine Islands, but simply submitted recommendations to the Secretary of War for his action, accompanied with the request that, if the recommendation was favorably considered, he, the Secretary of War, \n\n[207 U.S. 229, 239]\n\u00a0\n should make the purchase desired. In the second place, the Division of Insular Affairs undertook the negotiation under an order of the Secretary of War, directing that the paper required be purchased, without an intimation that it was contemplated that the Division of Insular Affairs, in executing the authority conferred, should act as the agent of the government in the Philippine Islands, instead of as the representative of the Secretary of War, as a result of the authority vested in him. The first letter written on the part of the Division of Insular Affairs to Andrews & Company, soliciting a proposal to furnish the paper, we think manifests that the purpose of the division was to make the purchase for the United States, in accord with the direction under which the division was acting,-that is, the authority of the Secretary of War, acting for the United States. True it is, the letter made it clear that the paper which the United States proposed to purchase was intended for use in the Philippine Islands, and contained a statement that the price would be 'paid from Philippine funds.' But the mere statement of the purpose for which the paper was intended would not justify the conclusion that the Division of Insular Affairs was acting as the mere agent of the government in the Philippine Islands, instead of as the agent of the Secretary of War, representing the United States. The statement of the fund from which the payment was to be made, instead of justifying the inference that the contract was intended to be made in the name of the government of the Philippine Islands, through its agent, gives countenance to a contrary inference. This follows, because, if the government of the Philippine Islands was the contracting party, its funds would, as a matter of course, be the source from which the payment was to be made. The reference, therefore, to the fund from which the payment was to be made, but served to indicate that the United States, in making the contract, contemplated that the purchase price would be discharged by it from the Philippine funds under its control. That Andrews & Company, when they replied to the inquiry made to them as to price, etc., understood that the contract proposed was on behalf of \n\n[207 U.S. 229, 240]\n\u00a0\n the united States, we think is deducible from their reply. Besides, the subsequent correspondence and dealings which we shall hereafter consider in determining whether the paper was delivered under the contract prior to the happening of the damage, we think will serve to make clear the fact that both parties deemed the contract was one made in the name of and for account of the United States. Especially is this so when it is borne in mind that the findings, either directly or by necessary implication, establish that in October, 1901, soon after the goods were shipped, a bill for the amount of the total purchase price, including the freight to Manila, was rendered by Andrews & Company to the Division of Insular Affairs, and there is nothing in the findings warranting even an implication that that division made any objection upon the ground that the bill should have been made out against the Phillippine government as the purchaser, and have been transmitted to that government for payment. Yet further, is is apparent from the letter written by the division to Andrews & Company, after it was learned that the paper had been damaged or lost, that the Division of Insular Affairs was solicitous, not because a bill had been mistakenly rendered, but as to whether the loss should fall upon the United States or upon Andrews & Company.\n\n 2. \nThat, as a general rule, the delivery of goods by a consignor to a common carrier, for account of a consignee, has effect as delivery to such consignee, is elementary. That where a purchaser of goods directs their delivery for his account to a designated carrier, the latter becomes the agent of the purchaser, and delivery to such carrier is a legal delivery to the purchaser, is also beyond question. Certain also is it that when, on the delivery of goods to a carrier, bills of lading are issued for the delivery of the goods to the consignee or his order, the acceptance by the consignee of such bills of lading constitutes a delivery. Of course, the presumption of delivery arising from the application of any or all of these elementary rules would not control in a case where, by contract, it clearly appeared that, despite the shipment, the goods should remain at the risk \n\n[207 U.S. 229, 241]\n\u00a0\n of the consignor until arrival at the point of ultimate destination. And such in effect is the contention here made on behalf of the government. We come briefly, then, to consider the findings concerning the contract, for the purpose of showing that this contention is without merit.\n In considering the matter, it is to be conceded that the contract is not to be deduced alone from the letter of the Division of Insular Affairs of August 17, 1901, and the reply of Andrews & Company of August 28, but is to be ascertained by a consideration of those letters and the subsequent correspondence under which the purchase was concluded and the shipment made.\n The statement in the proposal of the Division of Insular Affairs of August 17, 1901, by which the negotiation was commenced, 'F. O. B. Manila,' might give rise, if standing alone, to the implication that it was intended that the goods should be delivered at the cost of the seller at Manila. But the further statement in the letter, that the freight from New York to Manila was to be a part of the purchase price, and to be paid as such by the purchaser, rebuts the implication that the words 'F. O. B. Manila' were understood as implying that the amount of the freight charges for the shipment of the goods to Manila should be at the cost of the seller. These words not therefore having been used in their ordinary commercial sense, their meaning must be sought in the context of the proposal in which they are found. Considering that context, it would seem most reasonable to conclude that the words implied that, as the government desired the freight to Manila to be included in the purchase price, the freight therefore to Manila was to be primarily defrayed by the seller. That this was the understanding of Andrews & Company we think results from their reply, in which no reference whatever was made to the F. O. B. Manila clause, but a willingness was expressed to furnish the paper at a price to be fixed by the price paid by the government in Washington for like paper, with the addition of the freight rate to the Philippine Islands, thereby saving the seller from bearing the burden of the freight to Manila, and at the same time securing \n\n[207 U.S. 229, 242]\n\u00a0\n to the goVERNMENT THE DELIVERY OF THE PAPER AT MANILa without the payment there to the carrier of the cost of the freight as such, since that item would become a part of and be included in the price. It is certain, when the subsequent correspondence is considered, that this construction, which the reply of Andrews & Company put upon the words 'F. O. B. Manila,' as used in the proposal, was deemed by the Division of Insular Affairs to be the correct one, since that reply was, in the subsequent correspondence, treated by the division as being directly responsive to and an acceptance of the proposal submitted. Moreover, we think the subsequent correspondence, when considered in other aspects, makes certain the conclusion that the words 'F. O. B. Manila,' as used in the proposal, meant precisely what we have stated the context of the proposal indicated that those words were intended to imply. This we think results from the provisions of the letter of August 28, selecting a particular firm to whom the goods were to be delivered for transport to Manila, and of all the other directions contained in the letter, since they are inconsistent with the theory that the words 'F. O. B. Manila' were used as meaning that the goods should not be delivered as directed, but should remain the property of Andrews & Company, and be under their control and subject to their risk until delivered at Manila. Especially is it impossible to attribute to the words 'F. O. B. Manila,' used in the original proposal and reiterated in the letter of August 28, any other meaning than that which we have affixed to them, when the note which was expressly referred to in the letter of August 28, and which was inclosed therein, is considered. By the terms of that note not only were the previous specific directions as to the mode of shipment confirmed, but it was expressly provided that the delivery to the agent selected by the Division of Insular Affairs should be 'F. O. B. Jersey City,' thus making clear the distinction between the sense in which the words 'F. O. B. Manila' were used in the proposal and their meaning applied to the final delivery at Jersey City in consummation of the contract by which the sum of the freight to Manila had been \n\n[207 U.S. 229, 243]\n\u00a0\n included in the purchase price. So, also, the same implications arise from the final instruction, shifting the place of delivery from Jersey City and directing that the merchandise should be delivered to the agent selected, 'F. O. B. Brooklyn.' We think the contention made in argument, that the letter of August 28 and the acceptance by Andrews & Company of the terms of that letter, should be alone held to constitute the contract, disregarding the note inclosed in the letter as a part thereof, is refuted by its mere statement. In any event, taking the most favorable view possible for the government of the contract, we think it cannot be said that the presumption which arises from the delivery of the goods to the carrier designated by the government, and the acceptance by the government of the bills of lading made to the consignee or his order, is rebutted by the contract.\n Lastly, it is urged that, in any event, the court below erred, since the contract in question was not 'reduced to writing and signed by the contracting parties with their names at the end thereof,' as required by Rev. Stat.  3744, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2510. But it is settled that the invalidity of a contract because of a noncompliance with the section referred to is immaterial after the contract has been performed. St. Louis Hay & Grain Co. v. United States, \n191 \nU.S. 159, 163\n, 48 S. L. ed. 130, 132, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 47. The contention that the contract in question had not been executed because there had been no delivery is disposed of by what we have already said.\n As the views which we have expressed concerning the delivery dispose also of many subsidiary contentions based upon isolated provisions of the contract, such as the right to verify the contents of the package at Manila, etc., it follows that the judgment below was right, and it is therefore affirmed. \n\n\n\n","166":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. WILLIAM CRAMP & SONS SHIP & ENGINE BLDG CO(1907)\nNo. 263\nArgued: Decided: May 13, 1907\n\n\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Brewer: \n\n[206 U.S. 118, 119]\n\u00a0\n On November 19, 1890, the William Cramp & Sons Ship & Engine Building Company entered into a contract with the United States to construct what was called 'Coast-line Battle Ship No. 1,' afterwards known as the battle ship Indiana, for the sum of $3,020,000, the ship to be completed and ready for delivery to the United States within three years from the date of the contract. As a matter of fact the vessel was not completed and delivered until November 19, 1895; but, as the delay was occasioned by the United States, no damages were recoverable from the building company on account thereof. On August 10, 1897, the company commenced this action in the court of claims to recover the sum of $480,231.90. The elements of its claim are thus stated in its petition:\n For time of organization and plant lost in waiting for armor, materials, etc., to be furnished by United States $144,379.50 For special wharfage, 730 days, at 1 cent per ton per day 74,825.00 For general care and maintenance of vessel, including coal, firemen, engineers, watchman, canvas awnings, wooden covers, keeping clean, removing snow, dust, etc., extra painting, tug hire, moving derrick, etc., 730 days, at $135 per day 98,550.00 Additional cost of insurance 34,462.55 Interest on money borrowed caused by delays of United States which prolonged final settlement 60,499.91 Extra trial trip made necessary by construction and completion of vessel being delayed by United States 17,514.94 For loss due to running the official trial of \"Indiana\" with a foul bottom, as, owing to the delay caused by the completion of the vessel, it was impossible to clean and paint the bottom 50,000.00 ___\n Total $480,231.90\n\n On May 10, 1894, as appears from the findings made by the court of claims, an agreement was made between the parties \n\n[206 U.S. 118, 120]\n\u00a0\n by which moneys not then due by the terms of the original contract were paid, the stipulation in this new agreement being:\n'But such payment shall not be made until the party of the first part has given bond with approved security conditioned for the return to the party of the second part of the amount so paid, upon demand being made by the Secretary of the Navy therefor, for indemnity of the party of the second part against loss or injury by reason of such payment, and, in consideration of such advance payment, the party of the first part hereby releases the party of the second part from all and every claim for loss or damage hitherto sustained by reason of any failure on the part of the party of the second part to comply with its contract, or on account of any delay hitherto occasioned by the action of said party of the second part.'\n\n The time intervening between this agreement and the final completion and delivery of the vessel was one year, six months, and nine days; and that time was made the basis for the computation of damages, as will appear hereafter.\n On May 18, 1896, after the completion and delivery of the vessel, the balance of the money due on the contract was paid, and a release and receipt executed by the building company in the following terms:\n'Whereas, by the eleventh clause of the contract dated November 19, 1890, by and between The William Cramp & Sons Ship & Engine Building Company, a corporation created under the laws of the state of Pennsylvania, and doing business at Philadelphia, in said state, represented by the president of said company, party of the first part, and the United States, represented by the Secretary of the Navy, party of the second part, for the construction of a seagoing coast-line battle ship of about 10,000 tons displacement, which, for the purpose of said contract, is designated and known as 'Coast-line Battle Ship No. 1,' it is agreed that a special reserve of sixty thousand dollars ($60,000) shall be \n\n[206 U.S. 118, 121]\n\u00a0\n held until the vessel shall have been finally tried; provided that such final trial shall take place within five months from and after the date of the preliminary or the conditional acceptance of the vessel; and\n\n'Whereas, by the sixth paragraph of the nineteenth clause of said contract it is further provided, that when all the conditions, covenants, and provisions of said contract shall have been performed and fulfilled by and on the part of the party of the first part, said party of the first part shall be entitled, within ten days after the filing and acceptance of its claim, to receive the said special reserve or so much thereof as it may be entitled to on the execution of a final release to the United States in such form as shall be approved by the Secretary of the Navy, of all claims of any kind or description under or by virtue of said contract; and\n\n'Whereas the final trial of said vessel was completed on the eleventh day of April, 1896; and\n\n Whereas all the conditions, covenants, and provisions of said contract have been performed and fulfilled by and on the part of the party of the first part;\n'Now, therefore, in consideration of the premises, the sum of forty- one thousand one hundred and thirty-two dollars and eighty-six cents ($41, 132.86), the balance of the aforesaid special reserve ($60,000), to which the party of the first is entitled b eing to me in hand paid by the United States, represented by the Secretary of the Navy, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, The William Cramp & Sons Ship & Engine Building Company, represented by me, Charles H. Cramp, president of said corporation, does hereby, for itself and its successors and assigns, and its legal representatives, remise, release, and forever discharge the United States of and from all and all manner of debts, dues, sum and sums of money, accounts, reckonings, claims, and demands whatsoever, in law or in equity, for or by reason of or on account of the construction of said vessel under the contract aforesaid.\n\n'In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and \n\n[206 U.S. 118, 122]\n\u00a0\n affixed the seal of The William Cramp & Sons Ship & Engine Building Company this eighteenth day of May, A. D. 1896\n\n\n\n [Seal.] Chas. H. Cramp, President.\n Attest: John Dougherty, Secretary.'\n The court of claims found for the claimant in the following items and amounts:\n The reasonable value for the use of the claimant's yard, machinery, and tools, and for superintendence in the construction of the vessel, including the general upkeep of the yard chargeable to the Indiana, $3,000 per month, making $54,887.67 The reasonable cost of the proper care and protection of the vessel during the two years' delay, including expense of cleaning the bottom, furnishing material and painting, temporary awnings and tents over caps left for the introduction of turrets, additional scaling to remove rust before painting, electric lighting, keeping up steam to prevent freezing of valves, wetting down decks going over machinery, and keeping vessel free from snow, dust, ice, and debris, from May 10, 1894 36,591.78 Wharfage from May 10, 1894, including the dredging of a basin to accommodate the vessel 17,808.00 The proportionate expense for the period from May 10, 1894, of the cost of insurance during the two years' delay 26,272.55 ___\n $135,560.00\n And rendered judgment against the government for $135,560. From this judgment both parties appealed.\n Attorney General Bonaparte, Assistant Attorney General Van Orsdel, and Mr. Charles C. Binney for the United States.\n\n\n[206 U.S. 118, 124]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John C. Fay, Holmes Conrad, Eaton Creecy, and Eppa Hunton for the Cramp Company.\n\n\n[206 U.S. 118, 126]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case turns on the release executed by the building company on May 18, 1896. It is contended by the claimant that it applies simply to claims springing out of the construction of the vessel, and therefore has no application to the matters for which the judgment was rendered against the government. The word 'construction,' the company says, is limited to the mere matter of building; that is, the furnishing of materials, the doing of work, and does not include delays or other matters outside the building of the vessel.\n To rightly understand the scope of this release we must consider the conditions of the contract, and especially the clause in it which calls for a release. The contract was a large one, the price to be paid for the work and material being over $3,000,000, and the contract was evidently designed to cover all contingencies. Provision was made for changes in the specifications, for penalties on account of delays of the contractor, deductions in price on certain conditions, approval of the work by the Secretary of the Navy, forfeiture of the contract, with authority to the Secretary to complete the vessel. The nineteenth clause contains the stipulations as to the amounts and times of payment with authority for increase of the gross amount upon certain conditions. The sixth paragraph of this clause makes special provision for the last payment, to be made 'when all the conditions, covenants, and provisions of said contract shall have been performed and fulfilled by and on the part of the party of the first part' and 'onth e execution of a final release to the United States in such form as shall be approved by the Secretary of the Navy, of all claims of any kind or description under or by virtue of said contract.' Evidently the parties contemplated and specially provided by this stipulation that the whole matter of the contract should be ended at the time of the final release and the last payment. That which was to be \n\n[206 U.S. 118, 127]\n\u00a0\n released was 'all claims of any kind or description under or by virtue of said contract.' Manifestly, included within this was every claim arising not merely from a change in the specifications, but also growing out of delay caused by the government. The language is not alone 'claims under,' but 'claims by virtue' of the contract,-claims of any kind or description.' All the claims for which allowances were made in the judgment of the court of claims come within one or the other of these clauses. It may be that, strictly speaking, they were not claims under the contract, but they were clearly claims by virtue of the contract. Without it no such claims could have arisen. Now, it having been provided in advance that the contract should be closed up by the execution of a release of this kind, it cannot be that the company, when it signed the release, understood that some different kind of release was contemplated. It must have understood that it was the release required by the contract,-a release intended to be of all claims of any kind or description under or by virtue of the contract,- and that the form of words which the Secretary had approved was used to express that purpose. With that release stipulated for in the contract the company signed the instrument of May 18, 1896, which in terms purported to 'remise, release, and forever discharge the United States of and from all and all manner of debts, dues, sum and sums of money, accounts, reckonings, claims and demands whatsoever, in law or in equity, for or by reason of or on account of the construction of said vessel under the contract aforesaid.' Now, whatever limitation may be placed upon the words 'for' or 'on account of' the construction, the provision for the release of all claims and demands whatsoever, 'by reason of the construction of the vessel under the contract aforesaid,' is a recognition of the contract, and includes claims which arise by reason of the construction of the vessel under it. 'By reason of' may well be considered as equivalent to 'by virtue of.' It is only by reason of the performance of the contract in the construction of the vessel \n\n[206 U.S. 118, 128]\n\u00a0\n that these claims arise. But for the contract, and the construction of the vessel under it, there would be no such claims. No payment of moneys not due is necessary to sustain this release. It is under seal, and the contract is itself full consideration. As of significance it must be borne in mind that the release referred specifically to the provisions in the sixth paragraph of the nineteenth clause of the contract, which provided for the character of the release. Indeed, the general language of the release itself and the number of words of description in it show that it was the intent of the Secretary of the Navy to have a final closing of all matters arising under or by virtue of the contract.\n Stipulations of this kind are not to be shorn of their efficiency by any narrow, technical, and close construction. The general language 'all and all manner of debts,' etc. indicates an intent to make an ending of every matter arising under or by virtue of the contract. If parties intend to leave some things open and unsettled, their intent so to do should be made manifest. Here was a contract involving three millions of dollars, and after the work was done, the vessel delivered and accepted, and this release entered, claims are presented amounting to over $500,000. Surely the parties never intended to leave such a bulk of unsettled matters. As bearing upon this matter it may be noticed that while the release was signed and the contract between the buildig company and the government closed on May 18, 1896, this action was not brought until August 10, 1897,- nearly a year and a quarter thereafter.\n We are of opinion that the parties, by the release of May 18, 1896, which was executed in performance of the requirements of the original contract, settled all disputes between the parties as to the claims sued upon.\n The judgment of the Court of Claims is reversed and the case remanded, with instructions to enter a judgment on the findings for the defendant.\n Mr. Justice McKenna and Mr. Justice Moody took no part in the decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","167":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU. S. v. BETHLEHEM STEEL CO.(1907)\nNo. 188\nArgued: Decided: March 11, 1907\n\n\n\n The Bethlehem Steel Company recovered a judgment in the court of claims (41 Ct. Cl. 19) for the sum of $21,000 against the appellant, from which judgment the United States has appealed to this court.\n The company filed its petition in the court of claims, seeking to recover a balance which it alleged was due from the United States on a contract, which had been entered into by the company with Brigadier General Flagler, Chief of Ordnance, in behalf of and for the United States, for the construction of certain gun carriages which the company alleged had been constructed according to the contract, and for which the government had failed to pay the full amount which became due upon its performance.\n The facts were found by the court of claims, from which it appears that the government, on the 8th day of March, 1898, advertised for proposals for the construction of six disappearing gun carriages, and the specifications accompanying \n\n[205 U.S. 105, 106]\n\u00a0\n the advertisement set forth the character and extent of the work. The claimant, in response to the advertisement, submitted four distinct sealed proposals to the War Department for the construction of such carriages. By the first proposal the company agreed to furnish five or more gun carriages for the sum of $31,000 each, the first to be delivered within six months of the date of contract, to be followed by two carriages every three months thereafter. By the second proposal the company offered to furnish the same number for the sum of $33,000 each, the first to be delivered within five months from date of contract, to be followed at the rate of one carriage every month thereafter. By the third proposal the offer was to furnish the same number for the sum of $35,000 each, the first to be delivered within four months, and the second within five months of date of contract; the remaining carriages to follow at the rate of three carriages every two months thereafter. By the fourth proposal the offer was to furnish the same number for the sum of $36,000 each, the first to be delivered in four months, the second in five months, and the remaining carriages at the rate of two carriages every month thereafter.\n These alternative proposals were made in consequence of a letter written the company by the Chief of Ordnance, dated March 11, 1898, of which the following is a copy:\n Office of the Chief of Ordnance,\n United States Army,\n Washington, March 11, 1898\n\n\n Gentlemen:--\n It is suggested that in making bids for carriages you estimate, first, on the price of carriages under the supposition that the works will run for twenty-four hours; second, that later, if it be found advantageous, the ordinary working hours may be observed. It is considered best that bids should be made for carriages by numbers; as, for instance, so much for five 8-inch carriages, for six, eight, etc. Therefore it is considered judicious that bids should be made for rapid \n\n[205 U.S. 105, 107]\n\u00a0\n delivery of a certain number of carriages or for less rapid delivery of the same. It should be understood, however, that time will be considered very important.\n Respectfully,\n D. W. Flagler,\n Brig. Gen., Chief of Ordnance.\n The following are the further findings of the court of claims:\n\n 4. \nThe defendants, through the War Department, accepted proposal No. 4 of the claimant company.\n\n 5. \nIn drawing up the contract between the United States and the claimant company a slight modification of proposal No. 4 was decided upon, which was as follows:\n Whereas in proposal No. 4 claimant company was to deliver five or more carriages, the first in four months, the second in five months, and the remaining ones to follow at the rate of two carriages per month. In drawing up the contract this was changed so as to provide for the delivery of one carriage in four months (as proposed) and five carriages in six months from the date of contract, thus reducing the time of delivery of all the carriages from seven to six months, this reduction of the total delivery being offset by the increased latitude given claimant company as to intermediate deliveries.\n\n 6. \nOn April 4, 1898, the Ordnance Department transmitted a form of contract of even date to the claimant company for execution and return by letter, as follows:\n'Office of the Chief of Ordnance, United States Army, Washington, April 4, 1898. The Bethlehem Iron Co., South Bethlehem, Pa.\n\n'Gentlemen:--\n\n'I am instructed by the Chief of Ordnance to transmit herewith contract, in quintuplicate, dated the 4th instant, for six 12-inch disappearing gun carriages, model 1896, for execution and return to this office. Respectfully, R. Birnie,\n\n Capt., Ord. Dept., U. S. A.' \n\n[205 U.S. 105, 108]\n\u00a0\n To this letter the claimant company made reply on April 5, 1898:\n'The Bethlehem Iron Company,\n\n South Bethlehem, Pa., April 5, 1898.\n Chief of Ordnance, U. S. A.,\n War Department, Washington, D. C.\n'Sir:--\n\n'We have examined the contract forms, covering six disappearing gun carriages, model 1896, for 12-inch B. L. rifles, for which we submitted proposals under the date 19th ultimo, and write to call your attention to the third clause, relating to our liability on account of any patent rights granted by the United States, is not struck out, as has been done in the case of previous contracts for carriages.\n\n'We also note that the penalty mentioned in the contract for each day of delay in delivery of each carriage is $75 instead of $10, as is stipulated in the instructions to bidders and specifications.\n\n'We made our bid under the understanding that the penalty for nondelivery was to be $10 per day, and we respectfully request that the contract forms may be modified in accordance with this understanding.\n\n'We return herewith the contract forms, and remain,\n\n Respectfully, The Bethlehem Iron Company,\n R. W. Davenport, Second Vice President.'\n Whereupon the claimant company was informed by the Chief of Ordnance, by letter of April 9, 1898, as follows:\n'Office of the Chief of Ordnance, United States Army, Washington, April 9, 1898. The Bethlehem Iron Company, South Bethlehem, Pa.\n\n'Gentlemen:--\n\n'In reply to your letter of April 5, 1898, returning contract forms, I have the honor to inform you that \n\n[205 U.S. 105, 109]\n\u00a0\n your request in regard to your liability on account of patent rights has been complied with and the third paragraph has been stricken out.\n\n'In regard to the penalty for delay in delivery being $75 per day instead of $10 per day, I have to state that the former amount is the average difference in time of delivery between your price recently bid for slow delivery of these carriages and the price under the accepted bid. The Department feels it to be just that this average difference should be the prescribed penalty; but, if you should prefer, instead of taking the average difference, that the exact difference per day for each particular carriage should be prescribed, the forms will be altered accordingly.\n\n'The contracts are returned, hoping this explanation will be satisfactory.\n\n Respectfully,\n D. W. Flagler,\n Brigadier General, Chief of Ordnance.'\n Thereafter it was found that an error had been made in the above computation, in that the $75 per day deduction provided for should have been $35 instead, and the claimant company was duly informed of this by letter dated April 16, 1898, which is as follows:\n'Office of the Chief of Ordnance,\n\n United States Army,\n Washington, April 16, 1898.\n The Bethlehem Iron Company,\n South Bethlehem, Pa.\n (Through the Inspector or Ordnance, U.

A.\n'Gentlemen:--\n\n'Referring to my letter, No. 21985, of the 9th instant, I would invite your attention to the fact that an error was made in the computation in the amount of the deduction in price per day of delay in delivery of 12-inch disappearing carriages, L. F., model of 1896, recently ordered from you and to inform you that the contract should read that such deduction in price should be $35 per day of delay in \n\n[205 U.S. 105, 110]\n\u00a0\n delivery, in accordance with principle stated in my above-mentioned letter.\n\n Respectfully,\n D. W. Flagler,\n Brigadier General, Chief of Ordnance.'\n Before signing the contract in its present form the claimant company, by communication on April 20, 1898, requested that the same should be modified in some respects, which request is contained in the following communication:\n'The Bethlehem Iron Company,\n\n South Bethlehem, Pa., April 20, 1898.\n Chief of Ordnance, U. S. A.,\n War Department, Washington, D. C.\n'Sir:--\n\n'Referring to the forms of contract for six 12-inch disappearing gun carriages, carrying the date of April 4, 1898, which have recently been received, but not yet executed, and to the conversation which the writer had with you on Thursday last, we beg to state that on further carefully considering the possibilities of the case we do not believe that we will be able to deliver the six carriages within six minths, as called for by the proposed contract. We will, however, undertake to complete, in accordance with our bid, the delivery of the first carriage in four months, the second within five months, and the remaining four at the rate of two per month, thus making the total time of delivery of the six carriages seven instead of six months, it being understood that no penalty will be charged against us for the one month of delay which will thus accrue on the fifth and sixth carriages.\n\n'By agreeing to this proposition the Department will be the gainer, in that the second carriage will be due at the end of the fifth month, while, as the contract now reads, it would not be due until the end of the sixth month.\n\n'With the above understanding confirmed, we will execute the contract as it now stands, except as to the amount of penalty for delay in delivery, which, in accordance with your letter of April 16, will be $ 35 instead of $75 per day. \n\n[205 U.S. 105, 111]\n\u00a0\n 'We return the contract forms in order that the change as regards penalty may be made.\n\n'We remain, respectfully,\n\n The Bethlehem Iron Company,\n R.

Thereupon the Bethlehem Iron Company proceeded to manufacture the said gun carriages, and ultimately delivered them to the United States, and they were accepted by the latter. The following table gives, first, the date fixed by the said contract for the delivery of each one of said carriages; second, the date of its delivery, and, third, the extent of the delay in its delivery.\n[] No. of Date for d'liv'ry Date of delivery Extent carriage fix'd by c'ntract (actual) of delay []\n 16 Aug. 4, 1898 Jan. 28, 1899 177 days 17 Sept. 4, 1898 Mar. 6, 1899 183 \" 18 Oct. 4, 1898 Apr. 13, 1899 191 \" 19 Oct. 4, 1898 Mar. 18, 1899 165 \" 20 Nov. 4, 1898 Apr. 29, 1899 176 \" 21 Nov. 4, 1898 May 27, 1899 204 \" ___ Total delay 1096 days []\n\n Of the above days of delay, which amounted in the aggregate to 1,096 days, the United States, through the Chief of its Bureau of Ordnance, decided that the Bethlehem Iron Company was responsible for delays to the extent of 100 days upon each of the six disappearing gun carriages, or 600 days in all, but did not charge said company with the balance of said days, or 496 days in all; which, at the stipulated sum of deduction at $35 per day for each day of delay in the delivery of each gun carriage, amounted to the sum of $21,000, which sum was deducted from the payments made the claimant company, and the balance, or the sum of $195,000, was paid over to the claimant company, who receipted for said payment under protest.\n\n 8. \nThe court finds as the ultimate fact that the defendants' officers hindered and delayed the claimant in the performance of the work by changes in the plans of construction, as alleged in the petition, and in various other ways; but the court also finds that the claimant contributed to the delay \n\n[205 U.S. 105, 114]\n\u00a0\n in the completion of the work by being insufficiently equipped and prepared to complete it within the time prescribed in the contract and by taking other work to the exclusion of that referred to in these findings; and the court further finds that the transactions in the process of manufacture were so involved and intermerged that it is impossible, on the evidence produced, for the court to ascertain and determine whether the defendants should be charged with a greater proportion of the delays set forth in the foregoing table in Finding 7 than those assumed by the defendants' officers, to wit, 496 days out of the total amount of delays, to wit, 1,096 days.\n It does not appear that the defendants were ready to use the gun carriages hereinbefore described at the time when they were finally delivered by the claimant; nor does it appear that they could have used them on their fortifications if they had been delivered at an earlier day. Nor does it appear that the defendants suffered any injury or damage whatever by the delay of the claimant in delivering the said gun carriages hereinbefore set forth.\n Conclusion of Law.\n Upon the foregoing findings of fact the court decides, as a conclusion of law, that the claimant recover judgment in the sum of twenty- one thousand dollars ($21,000).\n Assistant Attorney General Van Orsdel, Attorney General Bonaparte, and Mr. Franklin W.

Hayden for appellee.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Peckham: \n\n[205 U.S. 105, 117]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n It is objected on the part of the company that, as the contract in question is, as asserted plain and unambiguous in its terms, no reference can be made to other evidence or to documents which do not form part of the contract. The general rule that prior negotiations are merged in the terms of a written contract between the parties is referred to, and it is insisted that, under that rule, the various letters passing between the \n\n[205 U.S. 105, 118]\n\u00a0\n parties prior to the execution of the contract are not admissible.\n The rule that prior negotiations are merged in the contract is general in its nature, and, we think, does not preclude reference to letters between the parties prior to the execution of the contract in this case. The language employed in this contract for a deduction, in the discretion of the Chief of Ordnance, of $35 per day from the price to be paid for each day of delay in the delivery of each gun carriage, respectively, taken in connection with the subject-matter of the contract, leaves room for the construction of that language in order to determines which was intended, a penalty or liquidated damages. While it is claimed that there is really no doubt as to the proper construction of the contract, even if the contract alone is to be considered, yet we think that much light is given as to the true meaning of language that is not wholly free from doubt by a consideration of the correspondence between the parties before the final execution of the contract itself. Under such circumstances we think it never has been held that recourse could not be had to the facts surrounding the case and to the prior negotiations for the purpose of determining the correct construction of the language of the contract. Simpson v. United States, \n199 U.S. 397\n-399, 50 L. ed. 245, 246, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 54. In Brawley v. United States, \n96 U.S. 168\n-173, 24 L. ed. 622-624, the court says: 'Previous and contemporary transactions and facts may be very properly taken into consideration to ascertain the subject-matter of a contract and the sense in which the parties may have used particular terms.'\n It is not for the purpose of making a contract for the parties, but to understand what contract was actually made, that, in cases of doubt as to the meaning of language actually used, prior negotiations may sometimes be referred to.\n There has, in almost innumerable instances, been a question as to the meaning of language used in that part of a contract which related to the payment of damages for its nonfulfilment, whether the provision therein made was one for liquidated \n\n[205 U.S. 105, 119]\n\u00a0\n damages or whether it meant a penalty simply, the damages to be proved up to the amount of the penalty. This contract might be considered as being one of that class where a doubt might be claimed, if nothing but the contract were examined. The courts at one time seemed to be quite strong in their views and would scarcely admit that there ever was a valid contract providing for liquidated damages. Their tendency was to construe the language as a penalty, so that nothing but the actual damages sustained by the party aggrieved could be recovered. Subsequently the courts became more tolerant of such provisions, and have now become strongly inclined to allow parties to make their own contracts, and to carry out their intentions, even when it would result in the recovery of an amount stated as liquidated damages, upon proof of the violation of the contract, and without proof of the damages actually sustained. This whole subject is reviewed in Sun Printing & Pub. Asso. v. Moore, \n183 \nU.S. 642, 669\n, 46 S. L. ed. 366, 380, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 240, where a large number of authorities upon this subject are referred to. The principle decided in that case is much like the contention of the government herein. The question always is, What did the parties intend by the language used? When such intention is ascertained it is ordinarily the duty of the court to carry it out. See also Clement v. Cash, 21 N. Y. 253, 257; Little v. Banks, 85 N. Y. 258, 266.\n The government, at the time of the execution of this contract (which was dated April 4, 1898), was making preparation for the expected war with Spain, which was imminent, and which was declared by Congress a few days thereafter. The government was evidently desirous of obtaining the construction of these gun carriages as early as it was reasonably possible, and it was prepared to pay an increased price for speed. The acceptance of the proposal at the highest price for the delivery of the carriages in the shortest time is also evidence of the importance with which the government officers regarded the element of speed. There can be no doubt as to its importance in their opinion, or that such opinion was \n\n[205 U.S. 105, 120]\n\u00a0\n communicated to the company. In the light of this fact an examination of the language of the contract itself upon the question of deductions for delay in delivery renders its meaning quite plain. It is true that the word 'penalty' is used in some portions of the contract, although in the clause providing for the $35 per day deduction that word is not used, nor are the words 'liquidated damages' to be found therein. The word 'penalty' is used in the correspondence, even by the officers of the government, but we think it is evident that the word was not used in the contract nor in the correspondence as indicative of the technical and legal difference between penalty and liquidated damages. It was used simply to provide that the amount named might be deducted if there were a delay in delivery. Either expression is not always conclusive as to the meaning of the parties. Little v. Banks, supra; Ward v. Hudson River Bldg. Co. 125 N. Y. 230, 26 N. E. 256. What was meant by the use of the language in question in this case is rendered, as we think, still more certain by the manner in which the $35 per day was arrived at, as stated in the letters of the officers representing the government, which were examined and criticized by the company before the signing of the contract. The correspondence shows that the sum was arrived at by figuring the average difference in time of delivery between the price bid for slow delivery of the carriages and the price under the accepted bid, the Department saying 'that this average difference should be the prescribed penalty.'\n Having this question before them and the amount stated arrived at in the manner known to both parties, we think it appears from the contract and the correspondence that it was the intention of the parties that this amount should be regarded as liquidated damages, and not technically as a penalty. This view is also strengthened when we recognize the great difficulty of proving damage in a case like this, regard being had to all the circumstances heretofore referred to. It would have been very unusual to allow the company to obtain the \n\n[205 U.S. 105, 121]\n\u00a0\n contract for the construction of these carriages, and yet to place it under no liability to fulfil it as to time of delivery, specially agreed upon, other than to pay only those actual damages (not exceeding $35 per day) that might be proved were naturally and proximately caused by the failure to deliver. The provision under such circumstances would be of no real value. The circumstances were such that it would be almost necessarily impossible to show what damages (if any) might or naturally would result from a failure to fulfil the contract. The fact that not very long after the contract had been signed and the war with Spain was near its end, the importance of time as an element largely disappeared, and that practically no damage accrued to the government on account of the failure of the company to deliver, cannot affect the meaning of this clause as used in the contract, nor render its language substantially worthless for any purpose of security for the proper performance of the contract as to time of delivery.\n The amount is not so extraordinarily disproportionate to the damage which might result from the failure to deliver the carriages as to show that the parties must have intended a penalty, and could not have meant liquidated damages. If the contract were construed as contended for by the company, it would receive (as events have turned out) the highest price for the longest time in which to deliver, which could not have been contemplated by either party. This would result from the finding that no damages in fact flowed from the failure to deliver on time.\n The eighth finding of the court of claims is, in effect, that the failure to deliver was caused in part by both parties; that the total number of days failure was 1096 days, of which 496 were caused by the defendant's officers, and it does not mean that the court regarded itself as bound by the decision of the Chief of Ordnance as to the number of days that the claimant or the government delayed the delivery. It found the number of days as stated, and that the transactions were so involved that \n\n[205 U.S. 105, 122]\n\u00a0\n whether the defendant should be charged with a greater proportion of the delays than set forth in the finding, the court could not decide on the evidence produced.\n The judgment of the Court of Claims must be reversed, and the cause remanded, with directions to dismiss the petition.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","168":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. FIDELITY & GUARANTY CO. v. U.S.(1907)\nNo. 173\nArgued: January 18, 1907Decided: February 25, 1907\n\n\n\n By an act of Congress approved August 13th, 1894, entitled 'An Act for the Protection of Persons Furnishing Materials and Labor for the Construction of Public Works,' it was provided: 'That hereafter any person or persons entering into \n\n[204 U.S. 349, 350]\n\u00a0\n a formal contract with the United States for the construction of any public building, or the prosecution and completion of any public work, or for repairs upon any public building or public work, shall be required, before commencing such work, to execute the usual penal bond, with good and sufficient sureities, with the additional obligations that such contractor or contractors shall promptly make payments to all persons supplying him or them labor and materials in the prosecution of the work provided for in such contract; and any person or persons making application therefor, and furnishing affidavit to the department under the direction of which said work is being, or has been, prosecuted, that labor or materials for the prosecution of such work has been supplied by him or them, and payment for which has not been made, shall be furnished with a certified copy of said contract and bond, upon which said person or persons supplying such labor and materials shall have a right of action, and shall be authorized to bring suit in the name of the United States for his or their use and benefit against said contractor and sureties, and to prosecute the same to final judgment and execution: Provided, That such action and its prosecutions shall involve the United States in no expense. Sec. 2. Provided, that in such case the court in which such action is brought is authorized to require proper security for costs in case judgment is for the defendant.' 28 Stat. at L. 278, chap. 280, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2523\n\n\n On the same day-August 13th, 1894-Congress passed an act providing that whenever any recognizance, stipulation, bond, or undertaking conditioned for the faithful performance of any duty, or for doing or refraining from doing anything in such recognizance, stipulation, bond, or undertaking specified, is, by the laws of the United States, required or permitted to be given with one or more sureties, it should be lawful to accept such instrument from a corporation having power to guarantee the fidelity of persons holding positions of public or private trust, and to execute and guarantee bonds and undertakings in judicial proceedings. The act provided that \n\n[204 U.S. 349, 351]\n\u00a0\n any surety company doing business under the provisions of that act 'may be sued in respect thereof in any court of the United States which has now or hereafter may have jurisdiction of actions or suits upon such recognizance, stipulation, bond, or undertaking, in the district in which such recognizance, stipulation, bond, or undertaking was made or guaranteed, or in the district in which the principal office of such company is located.' 28 Stat. at L. 279,  5, chap. 282. U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2316.\n Proceeding under the above acts the United States, in 1899, made a written contract with one Churchyard to furnish labor, materials, tools, and appliances for the construction of a public building, taking from him the required bond with the United States Fidelity & Guaranty Company, a corporation, as surety.\n The present action, brought in the circuit court on that bond, was by the United States, 'suing herein for the benefit and on behalf of James S. Kenyon,' who furnished a contractor, for use in the construction of the proposed government building, materials of the value of $66.05, for which the latter neglected and refused to pay. Damages to the amount of $500 were claimed in the declaration.\n The defendant, the United States Fidelity & Guaranty Company, pleaded that it did not owe the sum demanded. The plaintiff introduced testimony, but the defendant introduced none, and it appearing upon the face of the declaration that the value of the matter in dispute was less than $2,000, it moved that the action be dismissed for want of jurisdiction in the circuit court. That motion was denied, and judgment for $206.47 was entered against the Fidelity & Guaranty Company for the use and benefit of Kenyon. United States v. Churchyard, 132 Fed. 82.\n Messrs.

[24 Stat. at L. 552, chap. 373] 25 Stat. at L. 433, chap. 866, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 508. But if, within the meaning of that act, the United States is the plaintiff in the action, then jurisdiction exists in a circuit court without regard to such value. United States v. Sayward, \n160 U.S. 493\n, 40 L. ed. 508, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 371; United States v. Shaw, 3 L.R.A. 232, 39 Fed. 433; United States v. Kentucky River Mills, 45 Fed. 273; United States v. Reid, 90 Fed. 522.\n The contention of the Fidelity Company is that the government, in this case, is to be beemed a nominal party only, its name being used as plaintiff simply under the authority of the above act of 1894, chap. 280. In support of this position our attention is called to the following, among other cases: Browne v. Strode, 5 Cranch, 303, 3 L. ed. 108; McNutt v. Bland, 2 How. 9, 14, 11 L. ed. 159, 161; Maryland use of Markley v. Baldwin, \n112 U.S. 490\n, 28 L. ed. 822, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 278; Stewart v. Baltimore & O. R. Co. \n168 U.S. 455\n, 42 L. ed. 537, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 105.\n Browne v. Strode was a suit in the circuit court for the district of Virginia in which the persons named in the declara- \n\n[204 U.S. 349, 355]\n\u00a0\n tion as plaintiffs were justices of the peace, all citizens of Virginia. The suit was on a bond given by an executor in conformity with a Virginia statute, and was for the recovery of a debt due from the testator in his lifetime to an alien, a British subject. The defendant was a citizen of Virginia. This court held that the circuit court had jurisdiction, notwithstanding the justices and the defendant were all citizens of the same state. This was, we assume, upon the ground that the justices were nominal parties only, while the beneficial party was an alien, and the defendant a citizen of the state in which the suit was brought.\n McNutt v. Bland was a suit upon a bond given by a sheriff and running to the governor of the state, conditioned for the faithful performance of the duties of his office. The statute authorized suit to be brought and prosecuted from time to time at the cost of any party injured until the whole amount of the penalty was recovered. The suit was brought in the name of the governor for the use of certain parties who were citizens of New York. The court held that the sheriff and his sureties, citizens of Mississippi, could be sued by the parties in interest in their own name, and that no sound reason could be perceived 'for denying the right of prosecuting the same cause of action against the sheriff and his sureties in the bond, by and in the name of the governor, who is a purely naked trustee for any party injured. He is a mere conduit through whom the law affords a remedy to the person injured by the acts or omissions of the sheriff; the governor cannot prevent the institution or prosecution of the suit, nor has he any control over it. The real and only plaintiffs are the plaintiffs in the execution, who have a legal right to make the bond available for their indemnity, which right could not be contested in a suit in a state court of Mississippi, nor in a circuit court of the United States, in any other mode of proceeding than on the sheriff's bond.'\n Maryland use of Markley v. Baldwin, \n112 \nU.S. 490, 492\n, 28 S. L. ed. 822, 823, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 278, 279, was an action in a state court on an administrator's bond in the name of the \n\n[204 U.S. 349, 356]\n\u00a0\n state for the benefit of one Markley, a citizen of New Jersey, the obligors in the bond being citizens of Maryland. The action was removed to the circuit court of the United States. After referring to the cases of Browne v. Strode and McNutt v. Bland, the court said: 'The justices of the peace in the one case and the governor in the other were mere conduits through whom the law afforded a remedy to persons aggrieved, who alone constituted the complaining parties. So, in the present case, the state is a mere nominal party; she could not prevent the institution of the action, nor control the proceedings or the judgment therein. The case must be treated, so far as the jurisdiction of the circuit court of the United States is concerned, as though Markley was alone named as plaintiff; and the action was properly removed to that court.'\n Stewart v. Baltimore & O. R. Co. was an action against a railroad company by an administrator to recover damages for the benefit of a widow whose husband's death was alleged to have been caused by the negligence of the defendant company. In the course of the discussion of the controlling questions in that case, the court observed, in passing, that, 'for purposes of jurisdiction in the Federal courts, regard is had to the real rather than to the nominal party,' and that, even in an action of tort, 'the real party in interest is not the nominal plaintiff, but the party for whose benefit the recovery is sought.'\n This case differs from those just cited, and stands, we think, on exceptional grounds. The United States is not here a merely nominal or formal party. It has the legal right, was a principal party to the contract, and, in view of the words of the statute, may be said to have an interest in the performance of all its provisions. It may be that the interests of the government, as involved in the construction of public works, will be subserved if contractors for such works are able to obtain materials and supplies with certainty and promptly. To that end Congress may have deemed it important to assure those who furnish such materials and supplies that the government would exert its power directly for their protection. It \n\n[204 U.S. 349, 357]\n\u00a0\n may well have thought that the government was under some obligation to guard the interests of those whose labor and materials would go into a public building. Hence, the statute required that, in addition to a penal bond in the usual form, one should be taken that would contain the specific, special obligation directly to the United States that the contractor or contractors 'shall promptly make payments to all persons supplying him or them labor and materials in the prosecution of the work.' The government is a real party here because the declaration opens, 'The United States, suing herein for the benefit of and on behalf of James Kenyon . . . comes and complains,' and alleges that the 'defendants became and are indebted to the United States for the benefit of the said James S. Kenyon.' In a large sense the suit has for its main object to enforce that provision in the bond that requires prompt payments by the contractor to material men and laborers. The bond is not simply one to secure the faithful performance by the contractor of the duties he owes directly to the government in relation to the specific work undertaken by him. It contains, as just stated, a special stipulation with the United States that the contractor shall promptly make payments to all persons supplying labor and materials in the prosecution of the work specified in his contract. This part of the bond, as did its main provisions, ran to the United States, and was therefore enforceable by suit in its name. We repeat, the present action may fairly be regarded as one by the United States itself to enforce the specific obligation of the contractor to make prompt payment for labor and materials furnished to him in his work. There is, therefore, a controversy here between the United States and the contractor in respect of that matter. The action is none the less by the government as a litigant party, because only one of the persons who supplied labor or materials will get the benefit of the judgment. We are of opinion, in view of the peculiar language of the act of 1894 for the protection as well of the United States as of all persons furnishing materials and labor \n\n[204 U.S. 349, 358]\n\u00a0\n for the construction of public works, that it is not an unreasonable construction of the words in the judiciary act of 1887, 1888, 'or in which controversy the United States are plaintiffs or petitioners,' to hold that the United States is a real, and not a mere nominal, plaintiff in the present action, and therefore that the circuit court had jurisdiction.\n This interpretation of the statute finds some support in the above act of 1894, chap. 282, passed the same day as the act chap. 280, for the protection of material men and laborers, and which provides that suits against a fidelity or guaranty corporation, accepted as surety in any recognizance, stipulation, bond, or undertaking given to the United States, may be sued in any court of the United States having jurisdiction of suits upon such instrument. There is in that act no express limitation as to the amount involved in suits of that character in either of the acts passed in 1894. Taking the two acts together, there is reason to say that Congress intended to bring all suits embraced by either act, when brought in the name of the United States, within the original congnizance of the circuit courts of the United States, without regard to the amount in dispute. And this view as to the intention of Congress is strengthened by an examination of the act of February 24th, 1905 (33 Stat. at L. 811, chap. 778, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1905, p. 493), which amends the above statute of 1894, chap. 280. After providing that persons supplying labor and materials for the construction of a public work shall have the right to intervene in any suit brought by the United States against the contractor, that act declares that, if no such suit is brought by the United States within six months after completion of the contract, then the person supplying labor or material to the contractor 'shall have a right of action, and shall be and are hereby authorized to bring suit in the name of the United States in the circuit court of the United States in the district in which said contract was to be performed and executed, irrespective of the amount in controversy in such suit, and not elsewhere, for his or their use and benefit, against said contractor and his sure- \n\n[204 U.S. 349, 359]\n\u00a0\n ties, and to prosecute the same to final judgment and execution.'\n It is true that this statute can have no direct application here, because the present action was instituted long prior to its passage and after the trial court had decided the question of the jurisdiction of the circuit court. As the act of 1905 does not refer to cases pending at this passage, the question of jurisdiction depends upon the law as it was when the jurisdiction of the circuit court was invoked in this action. Nevertheless, that act throws some light on the meaning of the act of 1894, chap. 280, for the protection of material men and laborers, and tends to sustain the view based on the latter act, namely, that, in suits brought in the name of the government for their benefit, the United States is a real litigant, not a mere nominal party, and that, of such suits, the government being plaintiff therein, and having the legal right, the circuit court may take original cognizance without regard to the value of the matter in dispute. There are cases which take the opposite view, but the better view, we think, is the one expressed herein.\n The judgment is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice Brewer dissents. \n\n\n\n","169":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v.

Thompson for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n Action by the United States against the Paine Lumber Company for the recovery of the value of a quantity of timber and logs, to wit: 7,500 feet of basswood, 6,500 feet of elm, 51,020 feet of pine logs, alleged to have been cut and removed from certain lands in the eastern district of Wisconsin.\n The answer contained denials of the complaint, and set up that defendant company purchased the basswood and elm logs of one Thomas Gardner, and the pine logs of one Daniel \n\n[206 U.S. 467, 468]\n\u00a0\n Davids, in the fore part of 1899, the logs being at the time in the county of Shawano in Wisconsin, and being in possession of Gardner and Davids respectively, who claimed and represented themselves to be the sole and absolute owners thereof, and that defendant, in the regular course of its business, sold and disposed of them.\n Defendant also pleaded payment of the sum of $271.37 in full satisfaction and accord.\n The action was tried by the court, who found the following facts:\n'That the defendant is and was, during all the times mentioned in the complaint, a duly incorporated Wisconsin corporation.\n\n'That long prior to the commencement of this action and long prior to the acts alleged in the complaint the head men or council of the Stockbridge and Munsee Indians, claiming authority so to do under the treaties and arrangements with the United States, allotted to one Thomas Gardner the east half of the northwest quarter of section thirty-five (35), township twenty-eight (28), range fourteen (14) east, of the fourth principal meridian, of the state of Wisconsin, and to one Daniel Davids the northeast quarter of the southeast quarter of section twenty-one (21), township twentyeight (28), range fourteen (14) east, of the fourth principal meridian, of the state of Wisconsin, said lands being a part of the tract of land given to the Stockbridge and Munsee Indians by the treaty of 1856, each of said Indians being a member of said tribe of Stockbridge and Munsee Indians and the head of a family, and the said allotments being made to them respectively as their separate and individual allotments, and being the same lands described in the complaint herein.\n\n'That thereupon Thomas Gardner and Daniel Davids entered into immediate possession of their respective allotments and each of them has ever since claimed to hold the same as his allotment, and has constantly asserted his ownership and right to take the timber therefrom without restric- \n\n[206 U.S. 467, 469]\n\u00a0\n tions under the said treaty and arrangements with the plaintiff.\n\n'That no patent has ever been issued for either of said parcels of land and that the ownership of the same by said Indians has received no official sanction on the part of the plaintiff aside from the recognition of their respective rights to the occupancy of the parcels so claimed and held by them respectively as aforesaid.\n\n'And that their respective rights to the occupancy of their respective parcels of land allotted to them as aforesaid has been recognized by the United States.\n\n'That the timber and logs involved in this case, to wit, 7,500 feet of basswood, 6,500 of elm, and 51,020 feet of pine, were cut in the winter of 1898-1899, upon said respective parcels of land by the said Thomas Gardner and the said Daniel Davids, respectively, not for the purpose of clearing the land for cultivation, but for the purpose of providing means for the support of their families, and that such cutting by each of them was done in good faith, and each of them claiming and believing that he had the right to so cut for said purpose.\n\n'That after said cutting, and in the summer of 1899, at Weeds Point, in the county of Shawano, Wisconsin, the said logs were bought by the defendant of said Thomas Gardner and Daniel Davids, the same then and there being at said Weeds Point and of of the said reservation, for a valuable and fair consideration.\n\n'That the defendant bought the same in good faith, believing the said Thomas Gardner and the said Daniel Davids were the bona fide and absolute owners thereof, and that they respectively were lawfully entitled to sell the logs cut from their respective allotments.\n\n'That at the time of the cutting of the timber in question the said Thomas Gardner was living upon his said allotment; that shortly thereafter his wife died, and that he has not since lived thereon except at intervals of two or three months at \n\n[206 U.S. 467, 470]\n\u00a0\n a time, but for the most part has lived elsewhere with his brother.\n\n'That at the time of the said cutting the said Daniel Davids had no house on his allotment and was only there at times temporarily.\n\n'It is stipulated in this case that if defendant is liable for the value of the logs and timber at the time of taking or while in his hands, that the measure of damages therefor be the sum of five hundred and sixty- six dollars and twenty-eight cents ($566.28), and that if it be liable for the value of said logs and timber at the time of the cutting thereof or at the time of the taking thereof by the defendant, less the additions in value made thereto by the Indians in cutting, hauling, and banking the same, then the measure of damages therefor shall be the sum of three hundred and seventy-eight dollars and fifty-nine cents ($378.59). The measure of damages in both cases includes the cost of the scale and estimate thereof made by the government officials.'\n\n From these findings the conclusion of law was deduced:\n'That the said Thomas Gardner and the said Daniel Davids, as such allottees, had the right to cut and sell the timber on their respective allotments for the purpose for which the same was cut and sold, and that the defendant is entitled to judgment herein in its favor and against the plaintiff, dismissing the plaintiff's complaint on the merits, but without costs.'\n\n The court expressed the reasons for its judgment in an opinion of such circumstantial care and consideration that makes unnecessary an elaborate discussion by us. 154 Fed. 263. It stated the primary issue to be 'whether the Indian allottees under the Stockbridge and Munsee treaty of 1856 (11 Stat. at L. 663) and the act of Congress of 1871 (16 Stat. at L. 404, chap. 38) were vested with sufficient title in their allotments to authorize the cutting of timber for sale, and not by way of improvements, without the approval of the Department of the Interior.' And stating the purpose of the treaty and its provisions, the court said: \n\n[206 U.S. 467, 471]\n\u00a0\n 'The Stockbridge and Munsee treaty of 1856 was entered into to provide for relocation of the remnant of the tribe in Wisconsin, as they were unwilling to remove to a reservation in Minnesota theretofore provided. It recites valuable retrocessions and releases to the United States and reserves a tract 'near the south boundary of the Menominee reservation' of sufficient extent to furnish individual allotments. The terms of the grant were substantially these: After survey into the usual subdivisions the council of the tribes, under the direction of the superintendent, shall 'make a fair and just allotment among the individuals and families of their tribes,' in 80-acre tracts to heads of families and other classes named, and 40 acres to others. The allottees 'may take immediate possession thereof, and the United States will henceforth and until the issuing of 'patents' hold the same in trust for such persons;' certificates are to be issued 'securing to the holders their possession and an ultimate title to the land;' but 'such certificates shall not be assignable, and shall contain a clause expressly prohibiting the sale or transfer by the holder' of such land. After ten years, upon application of the holder and consent of the council, 'and when it shall appear prudent and for his or her welfare, the President of the United States may direct that such restriction on the power of sale shall be withdrawn and a patent issued in the usual form.' In the event of the death of an allottee without heirs, before patent, the allotment was not to revert to the United States but to the tribe for disposition by the council. It is further declared (art. 11): 'The object of this instrument being to advance the welfare and improvement of said Indians, it is agreed, if it prove insufficient, from causes that cannot now be foreseen, to effect these ends, then the President of the United States may, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, adopt such policy in the management of their affairs as in his judgment may be most beneficial to them; or Congress may, hereafter, make such provisions of law as experience shall prove necessary.' \n\n[206 U.S. 467, 472]\n\u00a0\n And another act should be mentioned, as it has induced a concession by the plaintiff of the right of Gardner to cut the timber upon his allotment. It is provided by the act of March 3, 1893 (27 Stat. at L. 744, chap. 219), that all members of the tribe 'who entered into possession of lands under the allotments of eighteen hundred and fifty-six and of eighteen hundred and seventy-one, and who by themselves or by their lawful heirs have resided on said lands continuously since, are hereby declared to be owners of such lands in fee simple, in severalty, and the government shall issue patents to them therefor.'\n It is contended that Davids is not within the act of 1893, and 'that his title is only such as can be read out of the treaty of 1856 and the act of 1871.' Granting this to be so, it hardly needs to be said that the allotments were intended to be of some use and benefit to the Indians. And it will be observed that on that use there is no restraint whatever. A restraint, however, is deduced from the provision against alienation, the supervision to which, it is asserted, the Indians are subject, and the character of their title. It is contended that the right of the Indians is that of occupation only, and that the measure of power over the timber on their allotments is expressed in United States v. Cook, 19 Wall. 592, 22 L. ed. 211. We do not regard that case as controlling. The ultimate conclusion of the court was determined by the limited right which the Indians had in the lands from which the timber there in controversy was cut.\n Certain parties of the Oneida Indians ceded to the United States all the lands set apart to them, except a tract containing 100 acres for each individual, or in all about 65,000 acres, which they reserved to themselves, to be held as other Indian lands are held. Some of the lands were held in severalty by individuals of the tribe with the consent of the tribe, but the timber sued for was cut by a small number of the tribe from a part of the reservation not occupied in severalty. It was held, citing Johnson v. M'Intosh, 8 Wheat. 574, 5 L. ed. 688, that the right of the Indians in the land from which the logs were taken was that of occupancy only. Necessarily the \n\n[206 U.S. 467, 473]\n\u00a0\n timber, when cut, 'became the property of the United States absolutely, discharged of any rights of the Indians therein.' It was hence concluded 'the cutting was waste, and, in accordance with well-settled principles, the owner of the fee may seize the timber cut, arrest it by replevin, or proceed in trover for its conversion.' If such were the title in the case at bar, such would be the conclusions. But such is not the title. We need not, however, exactly define it. It is certainly more than a right of mere occupation. The restraint upon alienation must not be exaggerated. It does not of itself debase the right below a fee simple. Libby v. Clark, \n118 U.S. 250\n, 30 L. ed. 133, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1045. The title is held by the United States, it is true, but it is held 'in trust for individuals and their heirs to whom the same were allotted.' The considerations, therefore, which determined the decision in United States v. Cook, do not exist. The land is not the land of the United States, and the timber when cut did not become of the property f the United States. And we cannot extend the restraint upon the alienation of the land to a restraint upon the sale of the timber consistently with a proper and beneficial use of the land by the Indians,-a use which can in no way affect any interest of the United States. It was recognized in United States v. Cook that 'in theory, at least,' that land might be 'better and more valuable with the timber off than with it on.' Indeed, it may be said that arable land is of no use until the timber is off, and it was of arable land that the treaty contemplated the allotments would be made. We encounter difficulties culties and baffling inquiries when we concede a cutting for clearing the land for cultivation, and deny it for other purposes. At what time shall we date the preparation for cultivation and make the right to sell the timber depend? Must the axe immediately precede the plow and do no more than keep out of its way? And if that close relation be not always maintained, may the purpose of an allottee be questioned and referred to some advantage other than the cultivation of the land, and his title or that of his vendee to the timber be denied? Nor does the argument \n\n[206 U.S. 467, 474]\n\u00a0\n which makes the occupation of the land a test of the title to the timber seem to us more adequate to justify the qualification of the Indians' rights.\n It is based upon the necessity of superintending the weakness of the Indians and protecting them from imposition. The argument proves too much. If the provision against alienation of the land be extended to timber cut for purposes other than the cultivation of the land it would extend to timber cut for the purpose of cultivation. What is there in the former purpose to protect from imposition that there is not in the other? Shall we say such evil was contemplated and considered as counterbalanced by benefit? And what was the benefit? The allotments, as we have said, were to be of arable lands useless, may be, certainly improved by being clear of their timber, and yet, it is insisted that this improvement may not be made, though it have the additional inducement of providing means for the support of the Indians and their families. We are unable to assent to this view.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice Moody took no part in the decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","170":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNION BRIDGE CO. v. U S(1907)\nNo. 431\nArgued: Decided: February 25, 1907\n\n\n\n\n[204 U.S. 364, 365]\n\u00a0\n This is a proceeding in the nature of a criminal information in the district court of the United States for the western district of Pennsylvania against the Union Bridge Company, a corporation of Pennsylvania, owning and controlling a bridge across the Allegheny river near where it joins the Monongahela river to form the Ohio river,-the Allegheny river being a navigable waterway of the United States, having its source in New York and being navigable in both New York and Pennsylvania.\n Stating the matter generally, the Secretary of War found the bridge to be an unreasonable obstruction to the free navigation of the Allegheny river, and required the Bridge Company to make certain changes or alterations in order that navigation be rendered reasonably free, easy, and unobstructed. These alterations, it was charged, the company wilfully failed \n\n[204 U.S. 364, 366]\n\u00a0\n and refused to make. Hence the present information against it. There was a verdict of guilty, followed by a motion in arrest of judgment, which motion being overruled, the company was sentenced to pay a fine of $5,000. To review that order this writ of error is prosecuted.\n The information was based on  18 of the river and harbor act of March 3d, 1899, which provides: 'That whenever the Secretary of War shall have good reason to believe that any railroad or other bridge now constructed, or which may hereafter be constructed, over any of the navigable water ways of the United States, is an unreasonable obstruction to the free navigation of such waters on account of insufficient height, width of span, or otherwise, or where there is difficulty in passing the draw opening or the draw span of such bridge by rafts, steamboats, or other water craft, it shall be the duty of the said Secretary, first giving the parties reasonable opportunity to be heard, to give notice to the persons or corporations owning or controlling such bridge, so to alter the same as to render navigation through or under it reasonably free, easy, and unobstructed; and in giving such notice he shall specify the changes, recommended by Chief of Engineers, that are required to be made, and shall prescribe in each case a reasonable time in which to make them. If, at the end of such time, the alteration has not been made, the Secretary of War shall forthwith notify the United States district attorney for the district in which such bridge is situated, to the end that the criminal proceedings hereinafter mentioned may be taken. If the persons, corporation, or association owning or controlling any railroad or other bridge shall, after receiving notice to that effect, as hereinbefore required, from the Secretary of War, and within the time prescribed by him, wilfully fail or refuse to remove the same or to comply with the lawful order of the Secretary of War in the premises, such persons, corporation, or association shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine not exceeding five thousand dollars; and every month such persons, cor- \n\n[204 U.S. 364, 367]\n\u00a0\n poration, or association shall remain in default in respect to the removal or alteration of such bridge shall be deemed a new offense, and subject the persons, corporation, or association so offending to the penalties above prescribed: Provided, That in any case arising under the provisions of this section an appeal or writ of error may be taken from the district courts or from the existing circuit courts direct to the Supreme Court, either by the United States or by the defendants.' 30 Stat. at L. 1121, 1153, chap. 425, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3545\n\n\n Legislation similar in its general character can be found in river and harbor acts passed at previous sessions of Congress. Act of 1884 (23 Stat. at L. 133, 148, chap. 229, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3532); act of April 11th, 1888 (25 Stat. at L. 400, 424, 425, chap. 860,  9, 10); and act of September 19th, 1890 (26 Stat. at L. 426, 453, chap. 907,  4, 5). Finally, we have the act of March 23d, 1906 (34 Stat. at L. 84, chap. 1130 ,  4, 5), which covers the same ground as the act of 1899 under which the present information was filed.\n It appears that the Bridge Company was incorporated by an act of the Pennsylvania legislature, approved March 13th, 1873, with authority to construct a bridge over the Allegheny river, in the city of Allegheny. That act contains this proviso: 'That the erection of said bridge shall not obstruct the navigation of said river, so as to endanger the passage of rafts, steamboats, or other water crafts; and the piers shall not be so placed as to interfere with towboats proceeding out with their tows made up, and shall be constructed in such manner as to meet the requisitions of the law in regard to the obstructions of navigation.'\n The bridge was constructed in 1874 and 1875, and has been in use since 1875.\n In 1902 a petition was sent to the Secretary of War by persons, corporations, and companies in and about Pittsburg, which contained, among other things, these statements: 'There can be no doubt whatever that this bridge is an unreasonable obstruction to the free navigation of the Ohio, Monongahela, and Allegheny rivers on account of insufficient \n\n[204 U.S. 364, 368]\n\u00a0\n height and the filling in of the river or rivers over which it passes in order to provide approaches for it. We respectfully request that you will investigate this matter, having full confidence that, after making such investigation, you will find it to be your duty to take action against its owners, the Union Bridge Company, under the provisions of  18 of the river and harbor act, approved March 3, A. D. 1899. . . . It was built of such a low height above the water as to cause the almost complete obstruction of all the packet and tow-boat trade passing from the Allegheny river into the Ohio and Monongahela rivers, and from these rivers into the Allegheny. In building it the width of the river was very materially narrowed, as already stated, by the fills made for the approaches. The river commerce of Pittsburg, as you are aware, is of very great magnitude and importance, and is rapidly increasing in volume. For the last calendar year it amounted to 10,916,489 tons, being about equal to that of the harbor of New York. The extension of the manufacturing industries of Pittsburg up the Allegheny river is making it of much greater importance than heretofore that the navigation to and from that river should not be obstructed. The present time is peculiarly appropriate for action by you. The Union bridge is an old, wooden structure, and will soon need-in fact, it already needs-extensive repairs to make it safe for public use. Therefore, as the bridge in question deprives the community of a reasonable use of the Allegheny river in connection with the river business of this great harbor, we appeal to you to exercise the powers committed to you to abate, or to at least mitigate, this great public nuisance, as you shall find yourself justified by the law and the facts of the case.'\n The matter was referred by the Secretary of War to the proper officers of the Engineer Corps of the Army for examination and report. Such examination was had upon notice to the Bridge Company, and, under date of December 8th, 1902, Capt. Sibert, cap tain of engineers, who conducted the examination, reported and recommended to the Chief of En- \n\n[204 U.S. 364, 369]\n\u00a0\n gineers that the company be given notice to make certain alterations in its bridge.\n On December 16th, 1902, the Chief of Engineers transmitted that report to the Secretary of War, saying: 'As required by the law and the instructions of the War Department, a public hearing has been held, after due advertisement, and all interested parties have been afforded an opportunity to present their views. Attention is respectfully invited to the accompanying report on the subject, dated the 8th instant, by Captain Sibert, and to its accompanying papers. In this report Captain Sibert fully discusses all phases of the question, and shows that, without reference to the use of the Allegheny river for through navigation, the bridge in question is an unreasonable obstruction, and practically a bar to the use of that portion of Pittsburg harbor situated on the river. He states that none of the boats engaged in interstate commerce from Pittsburg, south and west, can reach, at low water, a single manufacuring plant or wharf in the cities of Pittsburg and Allegheny on the Allegheny river. He submits a photograph to show that the portion of Pittsburg harbor in the Monongahela river is crowded with shipping, while that portion in the Allegheny has none, all due to the existence of the Union bridge. It is also shown by the evidence that the lower portion of the Allegheny river would be of great importance as a harbor of refuge when ice is running out of the Monongahela river, if it were not obstructed by the Union bridge. He reaches the conclusion, based on the facts developed at the hearing, that, in order to give the shipping at Pittsburg increased harbor room, and to enable it to connect with wharves and manufacturing plants in that part of the harbor located on the Allegheny river the Union bridge should be so raised as to provide a channel-span with a clear height of 70 feet, the same as exists under the bridge known as the 'Point bridge' on the Monongahela river, and the same that will exist under the Wabash Railroad bridge just being built, immediately above the Point bridge. It appears that this \n\n[204 U.S. 364, 370]\n\u00a0\n bridge was built in 1873, 1874 by the Union Bridge Company, incorporated under authority of an act of the Pennsylvania legislature of March 13, 1873, and that it has been the subject of complaint on the part of the navigation interests practically ever since its completion. Numerous investigations have been made by different engineer officers, who have held public hearings on the bubject, and who have concurred in expressing the opinion that the bridge was an unreasonable obstruction to navigation, and that it should be raised so as to give a headroom equal, at least, to that of the aforesaid Point bridge at the mouth of the Monongahela river. The Union bridge is situated at the mouth of the Allegheny river, and there seems to be no room for doubt that the alteration of the bridge is essential to the reasonable use for navigation and commercial purposes of that portion of the river forming a part of Pittsburg harbor. Captain Sibert recommends that the bridge in question be so altered as to give two navigable spans extending riverwards from the left abutment, of not less than 394 feet clear width each; the second span from the Pittsburg shore to give a clear headroom over the Davis Island pool of not less than 70 feet; and the first span from the same shore to give a headroom of not less than 70 feet at the pier and 62 feet at the abutment; also that the piers of the altered structure shall have no riprapping or other pier protection above an elevation of 10 feet below the surface of Davis Island pool, and that all parts of the old structure not comprised in the new construction, and in conformity with the above requirements, shall be wholly removed. The period of eighteen months is considered by him ample time within which to make these alterations. I concur in his views and recommend that notice be served on the Bridge Company, requiring the alterations to be made and completed as specified by him.'\n Under date of 20th of January, 1903, Mr. Root, then Secretary of War, issued a formal notice to the Bridge Company, stating that he had good reason to believe that its bridge was an unreasonable obstruction to free navigation. The \n\n[204 U.S. 364, 371]\n\u00a0\n notice informed the company of the alterations of its bridge recommended by the Chief of Engineers as necessary, and concluded: 'And whereas, eighteen months from the date of service of this notice is a reasonable time in which to alter the said bridge as described above; Now, therefore, in obedience to, and by virtue of,  18 of an act of the Congress of the United States entitled 'An Act Making Appropriations for the Construction, Repair, and Preservation of Certain Public Works on Rivers and Harbors, and for Other Purposes,' approved March 3, 1899, I, Elihu Root, Secretary of War, do hereby notify the said Union Bridge Company to alter the said bridge as described above, and prescribe that said alterations shall be made and completed on or before the expiration of eighteen months from the date of service hereof.'\n At the request of the Bridge Company, the time fixed by Secretary Root for altering, changing, and elevating the bridge was extended by his successor, Secretary Taft, to December 1st, 1904. By order of the latter officer the time was extended to January 1st, 1905.\n Subsequently, a rehearing was asked for by the Bridge Company, but the rehearing was refused and Secretary Taft made the following order: 'The Union bridge is an unreasonable obstruction to commerce of the Allegheny river. If the bridge were not there, the winter refuge which the stretch of the Allegheny river up to the next bridge would offer for the fleet of boats which usually are moored in the Monongahela would be a very great advantage for navigation and commerce on the Ohio river and its tributaries. The two rivers, the Allegheny and the Monongahela, because they rise in different sections of the country, have their ice breaks at different times in the early spring. The mouth of the one offers very desirable refuge to the vessels that are exposed to danger from the breaking up of ice in the headwaters of the other. The Union bridge, at the mouth of the Allegheny, was erected at a time when the Secretary of War was not given specific control over navigable streams, and was not authorized \n\n[204 U.S. 364, 372]\n\u00a0\n to inhibit the construction of bridges which were likely to obstruct navigation; but it appears that an army engineer, Colonel Merrill, in charge of the district, publicly announced that this bridge was an obstruction to navigation when it was erected. It was erected, therefore, in the face of the information given by the best authority that could be consulted in that matter in the government. These are the facts that I find independently of any previous adjudication; but, added to this is the finding of my predecessor, Mr. Root, to exactly the same effect, upon which he based an order that the bridge, as an obstruction to navigation, be abated. This matter is now before me on a petition for rehearing of Mr. Root's order. As an original question I should have ruled as Mr. Root ruled, and a fortiori because the orders of this Department are not to be lightly set aside, and are to be treated as a decree in equity would be, and be set aside only upon a showing of a palpable error or mistake. The petition for rehearing is denied, and the order suspending the operation of Mr. Root's order is now revoked. The order will be put in full force and executed by the proper officers, and the Union Bridge will be notified accordingly.'\n In the opinion of the district court, delivered on a motion in arrest of judgment, it was said: 'The obstruction here involved consists of a bridge over the Allegheny river just above its junction with the Monongahela at Pittsburgh. The Allegheny river rises in Pennsylvania, flows north into New York state, and thence back into Pennsylvania. The latter state, by act of March 21, 1798 (3 Smith's Laws, p. 320), enacted the Allegheny, from the New York state line to its mouth, a navigable stream, and the state of New York, by act of March 31, 1807, did likewise in its counties of Genesee and Allegheny. The Allegheny is the principal branch of the Ohio, its volume being six times greater than that of the Monongahela. It is included in the general plan for the improvement by the national government of local interstate waterways and the harbor of Pittsburg. The government has built, or has now in process of construction, \n\n[204 U.S. 364, 373]\n\u00a0\n a system of locks and dams on the Allegheny which will slackwater the stream for 27 miles from its mouth. The Davis Island dam, situate 5 miles below Pittsburg, on the Ohio river, raises the water in the Allegheny and Monongahela at their junction 6 feet above their normal depths, and backs its water to the first dams of the Allegheny and Monongahela slackwater systems respectively. These waters form the harhor of Pittsburg, the importance of which harbor will be appreciated from the fact that the tonnage in water transportation passing from it the past year exceeded that of the Suez canal for the same period. From its size, interstate relation, and its being a part of this really great harbor, it will be seen that the Allegheny answers the requirement of a navigable stream (The Montello [United States v. The Montello], 11 Wall. 411, 20 L. ed. 191), and is also one over which the national government has assumed jurisdiction. The Union bridge is a pier-supported, wooden structure; it crosses from Pittsburg to Allegheny City; and is the first bridge on the Allegheny.' [143 Fed. 378.]\n Messrs. D. T. Watson, Johns McCleave, John S. Wendt, and W. B. Rodgers for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[204 U.S. 364, 376]\n\u00a0\n Assistant to the Attorney General Purdy for defendant in error. \n\n[204 U.S. 364, 377]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of the court:\n The first principal question raised by the defendant is whether the 18th section of the river and harbor act of March 3d, 1899, is in violation of the Constitution of the United States as delegating legislative and judicial powers \n\n[204 U.S. 364, 378]\n\u00a0\n to the head of an executive department of the government. This question, the government contends, has been determined in its favor by the principles heretofore announced by this court, and need not be discussed as if now presented for the first time. In its judicial as well as legal aspects the question is of such importance as to justify a full reference to prior decisions.\n The earliest case is that of The Aurora v. United States, 7 Cranch, 382, 3 L. ed. 378, which involved the question whether Congress could make the revival of a law (which had ceased to be in force) depend upon the existence of certain facts, to be ascertained by the President and set forth in a proclamation by him. The court said: 'We can see no sufficient reason why the legislature should not exercise its discretion in reviving the act of March 1st, 1809 [2 Stat. at L. 528, chap. 24], either expressly or conditionally, as their judgment should direct. The 19th section of that act, declaring that it should continue in force to a certain time, and no longer, could not restrict their power of extending its operation without limitation upon the occurrence of any subsequent combination of events.' Referring to this language, we said in the subsequent case of Marshall Field & Co. v. Clark, \n143 \nU.S. 649, 683\n, 36 S. L. ed. 294, 307, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 495, 501: 'This certainly is a decision that it was competent for Congress to make the revival of an act depend upon the proclamation of the President, showing the ascertainment by him of the fact that the edicts of certain nations had been so revoked or modimodified that they did not violate the neutral commerce of the United States. The same principle would apply in the case of the suspension of an act upon a contingency to be ascertained by the President and made known by his proclamation.'\n In Wayman v. Southard, 10 Wheat. 1, 43, 45, 46, 6 L. ed. 253, 262, 263, Chief Justice Marshall, delivering the unanimous judgment of the court, said that although Congress could not delegate to the courts or to any other tribunals powers strictly and exclusively legislative, and although the line had not been exactly drawn that separates the important subjects which must be entirely \n\n[204 U.S. 364, 379]\n\u00a0\n regulated by the legislature itself from those of less interest 'in which a general provision may be made, and powers given to those who are to act under such general provisions to fill up the details,' yet 'Congress may certainly delegate to others powers which the legislature may rightly exercise itself,' and 'the maker of the law may commit something to the discretion of the other departments.'\n In Marshall Field & Co. v. Clark, just cited, \n143 \nU.S. 649, 680\n, 683 S., 691, 692, 36 L. ed. 294, 306, 307, 309, 310, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 495, 500, 501, 504, 505, the question arose as to the constitutionality of that section of the McKinley tariff act of 1890 [26 Stat. at L. 612, chap. 1244 ,  3] which provided for the imposition, in a named contingency (to be determined by the President and manifested by his proclamation), of duties upon sugar, molasses, and other specified articles, which the act had placed in the free list. By that section it was declared that 'with a view to secure reciprocal trade with countries producing the following articles and for this purpose, on and after the first day of January, eighteen hundred and ninety-two, whenever, and so often as the President shall be satisfied that the government of any country producing and exporting sugars, molasses, coffee, tea, and hides, raw and uncured, or any of such articles, imposes duties or other exactions upon the agricultural or other products of the United States, which, in view of the free introduction of such sugar, molasses, coffee, tea, and hides into the United States, he may deem to be reciprocally unequal and unreasonable, he shall have the power, and it shall be his duty, to suspend, by proclamation to that effect, the provisions of this act relating to the free introduction of such sugar, molasses, coffee, tea, and hides, the production of such country, for such time as he shall deem just, and in such case and during such suspension duties shall be levied, collected, and paid upon sugar, molasses, coffee, tea, and hides, the product of or exported from such designated country, as follows, namely.' Here follows in the act provisions indicating the particular duties to be collected, after the President's proclamation upon sugars, molasses, coffee, tea, hides, etc. It was contended in the Field Case that the \n\n[204 U.S. 364, 380]\n\u00a0\n above section, so far as it authorized the President to suspend by proclamation the provisions of the act relating to the free introduction of sugar, molasses, coffee, etc., was unconstitutional, as delegating to him both legislative and treaty-making powers. In its consideration of this question the court, after referring to the case of The Aurora, above cited, examined the numerous precedents in legislation showing to what extent the suspension of certain provisions and the going into operation of other provisions of an act of Congress had been made to depend entirely upon the finding or ascertainment by the President of certain facts, to be made known by his Proclamation. The acts of Congress which underwent examination by the court are noted in the margin. The result of that examination of legislative precedents was thus stated: 'The authority given to the President by the act of June 4, 1794 [1 Stat. at L. 372, chap. 41], to lay an embargo on all ships and vessels in the ports of the United States, 'whenever, in his opinion, the public safety shall so require,' and under regulations, to be continued or revoked, 'whenever he shall think proper;' by the act of February 9, 1799, to remit and discontinue, for the time being, the restraints and prohibitions which Congress had prescribed with respect to commercial intercourse with the French Republic, 'if he shall deem it expedient and consistent with the interest of the United States,' and 'to revoke such order whenever, in his opinion, the interest of the United States shall require;' by the act of December 19, 1806, to suspend, for a named time, the operation of the nonimportation act of the same year, 'if, in his judgment, the public interest should require it;' by the act of May 1, 1810 [2 Stat. at L. 606, chap. 39,  4], to revive a former act, as to Great Britain or France, if either country had not, by a \n\n[204 U.S. 364, 381]\n\u00a0\n named day, so revoked or modified its edicts as not 'to violate the neutral commerce of the United States;' by the acts of March 3, 1815, and May 31, 1830, to declare the repeal, as to any foreign nation, of the several acts imposing duties on the tonnage of ships and vessels, and on goods, wares, and merchandise imported into the United States, when he should be 'satisfied' that the discriminating duties of such foreign nations, 'so far as they operate to the disadvantage of the United States,' had been abolished; by the act of March 6, 1866, to declare the provisions of the act forbidding the importation into this country of neat cattle and the hides of neat cattle, to be inoperative, 'whenever, in his judgment,' their importation 'may be made without danger of the introduction of spread of contagious or infectious disease among the cattle of the United States,'-must be regarded as unwarranted by the Constitution, if the contention of the appellants in respect to the 3d section of the act of October 1, 1890, be sustained.'\n Touching the general question the court said: 'That Congress cannot delegate legislative power to the President is a principle universally recognized as vital to the integrity and maintenance of the system of government ordained by the Constitution. The act of October 1, 1890, in the particular under consideration, is not inconsistent with that principle. It does not, in any real sense, invest the President with the power of legislation. For the purpose of securing reciprocal trade with countries producing and exporting sugar, molasses, coffee, tea, and hides, Congress itself determined that the provisions of the act of October 1, 1890, permitting the free introduction of such articles, should be suspended as to any country producing and exporting them that imposed exactions and duties on the agricultural and other products of the United States, which the President deemed, that is, which he found to be, reciprocally unequal and unreasonable. Congress itself prescribed, in advance, the duties to be levied, collected, and paid, on sugar, molasses, coffee, tea, or hides, produced by or exported from such designated country, while the suspension \n\n[204 U.S. 364, 382]\n\u00a0\n lasted. Nothing involving the expediency or the just operation of such legislation was left to the determination of the President. The words, 'he may deem,' in the 3d section, of course, implied that the President would examine the commercial regulations of other countries producing and exporting sugar, molasses, coffee, tea, and hides, and form a judgment as to whether they were reciprocally equal and reasonable, or the contrary, in their effect upon American products. But when he ascertained the fact that duties and exactions, reciprocally unequal and unreasonable, were imposed upon the agricultural or other products of the United States by a country producing and exporting sugar, molasses, coffee, tea, or hides, it became his duty to issue a proclamation declaring the suspension, as to that country, which Congress had determined should occur. He had no discretion in the premises except in respect to the duration of the suspension so ordered. But that related only to the enforcement of the policy established by Congress. As the suspension was absolutely required when the President ascertained the existence of a particular fact, it cannot be said that, it ascertaining that fact, and in issuing his proclamation, in obedience to the legislative will, he exercised the function of making laws. Legislative power was exercised when Congress declared that the suspension should take effect upon a named contingency. What the President was required to do was simply in execution of the act of Congress. It was not the making of law. He was the mere agent of the lawmaking department to ascertain and declare the event upon which its expressed will was to take effect. It was a part of the law itself as it left the hands of Congress that the provisions, full and complete in themselves, permitting the free introduction of sugars, molasses, coffee, tea, and hides, from particular countries, should be suspended, in a given contingency, and that, in case of such suspensions, certain duties should be imposed.' Again: \"The true distinction,' as Judge Ranney, speaking for the supreme court of Ohio, has well said, 'is between the delegation of power to make the law, \n\n[204 U.S. 364, 383]\n\u00a0\n which necessarily involves a discretion as to what it shall be, and conferring authority or discretion as to its execution, to be exercised under and in pursuance of the law. The first cannot be done; to the latter no valid objection can be made.' Cincinnati, W. & Z. R. Co. v. Clinton County, 1 Ohio St. 88. In Moers v. Reading, 21 Pa. 188, 202, the language of the court was: 'Half the statutes on our books are in the alternative, depending on the discretion of some person or persons to whom is confided the duty of determining whether the proper occasion exists for executing them. But it cannot be said that the exercise of such discretion is the making of the law.' So, in Locke's Appeal, 72 Pa. 491, 498, 13 Am. Rep. 716, 721: 'To assert that a law is less than a law because it is made to depend on a furture event or act is to rob the legislature of the power to act wisely for the public welfare whenever a law is passed relating to a state of affairs not yet developed, or to things future and impossible to fully know.' The proper distinction, the court said, was this: 'The legislature cannot delegate its power to make a law; but it can make a law to delegate a power to determine some fact or state of things upon which the law makes, or intends to make, its own action depend. To deny this would be to stop the wheels of government. There are many things upon which wise and useful legislation must depend which cannot be known to the lawmaking power, and must, therefore, be a subject of inquiry and determination outside of the halls of legislation.' What has been said is equally applicable to the objection that the 3d section of the act invests the President with treatymaking power. The court is of the opinion that the 3d section of the act of October 1, 1890, is not liable to the objection that it transfers legislative and treaty-making power to the President.'\n The latest case bearing on the general question is Buttfield v. Stranahan, \n192 \nU.S. 470, 496\n, 48 S. L. ed. 525, 535, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 349, 355. That case involved the constitutionality of the act of Congress of March 2d, 1897 (29 Stat. at L. 604, chap. 358, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3194), relating to the 'importation of impure and unwholesome tea.' The act provided for the appointment by \n\n[204 U.S. 364, 384]\n\u00a0\n the Secretary of the Treasury of a board of seven tea experts, who should prepare and submit to him standard samples of that article. One section of the act provided: 'That the Secretary of the Treasury, upon the recommendation of the said board, shall fix and establish uniform standards of purity, quality, and fitness for consumption of all kinds of teas imported into the United States, and shall procure and deposit in the custom houses of the ports of New York, Chicago, San Francisco, and such other ports as he may determine, duplicate samples of such standards; that said Secretary shall procure a sufficient number of other duplicate samples of such standards to supply the importers and dealers in tea at all ports desiring the same at cost. All teas, or merchandise described as tea, of inferior purity, quality, and fitness for consumption to such standards shall be deemed within the prohibition of the 1st section hereof.' [ 3.] In that case it was contended that the act was unconstitutional, as making the right to import tea depend upon the arbitrary action of the Secretary of the Treasury and a board appointed by him; as excluding from import wholesome, genuine and unadulterated tea; and, as discriminating unequally in the admission of the different kinds of teas for import, as well as in the right to sell and purchase that article. The act conferred, it was objected, upon the Secretary and the board, the uncontrolled power of fixing standards of purity, quality, and fitness for consumption, and thus to prescribe arbitrarily what teas may be imported and dealt in. The question of constitutional law so raised was thus disposed of by the court: 'The claim that the statute commits to the arbitrary discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury the determination of what teas may be imported, and therefore in effect vests that official with legislative power, is without merit. We are of opinion that the statute, when properly construed, as said by the circuit court of appeals, but express the purpose to exclude the lowest grades of tea, whether demonstrably of inferior purity, or unfit for consumption, or presumably so because of their inferior quality. \n\n[204 U.S. 364, 385]\n\u00a0\n This, in effect, was the fixing of a primary standard, and devolved upon the Secretary of the Treasury the mere executive duty to effectuate the legislative policy declared in the statute. The case is within the principle of Marshall Field & Co. v. Clark, \n143 U.S. 649\n, 36 L. ed. 294, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 495, where it was decided that the 3d section of the tariff act of October 1, 1890, was not repugnant to the Constitution as conferring legislative and treaty-making power on the President, because it authorized him to suspend the provisions of the act relating to the free introduction of sugar, molasses, coffee, tea, and hides. We may say of the legislation in this case, as was said of the legislation considered in Marshall Field & Co. v. Clark, that it does not, in any real sense, invest administrative officials with the power of legislation. Congress legislated on the subject as far as was reasonably practicable, and, from the necessities of the case, was compelled to leave to executive officials the duty of bringing about the result pointed out by the statute. To deny the power of Congress to delegate such a duty would, in effect, amount but to declaring that the plenary power vested in Congress to regulate foreign commerce could not be efficaciously exerted.'\n It would seem too clear to admit of serious doubt that the statute under which the Secretary of War proceeded is in entire harmony with the principles announced in former cases. In no substantial, just sense does it confer upon that officer, as the head of an executive department, powers strictly legislative or judicial in their nature, or which must be exclusively exercised by Congress or by the courts. it has long been the policy of the government to remove such unreasonable obstructions to the free navigation of the water ways of the United States as were caused by bridges maintained over them. That such an object was of common interest and within the competency of Congress, under its power to regulate commerce, everyone must admit: for commerce comprehends navigation, and therefore to free navigation from unreasonable obstructions is a legitimate exertion of that power. Gibbons v. Odgen, 9 Wheat. 1, 189, 190, 6 L. ed. 23, 68, 69. As appropriate to the object \n\n[204 U.S. 364, 386]\n\u00a0\n to be accomplished, as a means to an end within the power of the national government, Congress, in execution of a declared policy, committed to the Secretary of War the duty of ascertaining all the facts essential in any inquiry whether particular bridges, over the water ways of the United States, were unreasonable obstructions to free navigation. Beyond question, if it had so elected, Congress, in some effective mode and without previous investigation through executive officers, could have determined for itself, primarily, the fact whether the bridge here in question was an unreasonable obstruction to navigation, and, if it was found to be of that character could, by direct legislation, have required the defendant to make such alterations of its bridge as were requisite for the protection of navigation and commerce over the water way in question. But investigations by Congress as to each particular bridge alleged to constitute an unreasonable obstruction to free navigation, and direct legislation covering each case, separately, would be impracticable, in view of the vast and varied interests which require national legislation from time to time. By the statute in question Congress declared in effect that navigation should be freed from unreasonable obstructions arising from bridges of insufficient height, width of span, or other defects. It stopped, however, with this declaration of a general rule, and imposed upon the Secretary of War the duty of ascertaining what particular cases came within the rule prescribed by Congress, as well as the duty of enforcing the rule in such cases. In performing that duty the Secretary of War will only execute the clearly-expressed will of Congress, and will not, in any true sense, exert legislative or judicial power. He could not be said to exercise strictly legislative or judicial power any more, for instance, than it could be said that executive officers exercise such power when, upon investigation, they ascertain whether a particular applicant for a pension belongs to a class of persons who, under the general rules prescribed by Congress, are entitled to pensions. If the principle for which the defendant \n\n[204 U.S. 364, 387]\n\u00a0\n contends received our approval the conclusion could not be avoided that executive officers, in all the departments, in carrying out the will of Congress, as expressed in statutes enacted by it, have, from the foundation of the national government, exercised, and are now exercising, powers as to mere details, that are strictly legislative or judicial in their nature. This will be apparent upon an examination of the various statutes that confer aothority upon executive departments in respect of the enforcement of the laws of the United States. Indeed, it is not too much to say that a denial to Congress of the right, under the Constitution, to delegate the power to determine some fact or the state of things upon which the enforcement of its enactment depends, would be 'to stop the wheels of government' and bring about confusion, if not paralysis, in the conduct of the public business.\n To this may be added the consideration that Congress, by the act of 1899, did not invest the Secretary of War with any power in these matters that could reasonably be characterized as arbitrary. He cannot act in reference to any bridge alleged to be an unreasonable obstruction to free navigation without first giving the parties an opportunity to be heard. He cannot require any bridge of that character to be altered, even for the purpose of rendering navigation through or under it reasonably free, easy, and unobstructed, without giving previous notice to the persons or corporations owning or controlling the bridge, specifying the changes recommended by the Chief of Engineers, and allowing a reasonable time in which to make them. If, at the end of such time, the required alterations have not been made, then the Secretary is required to bring the matter to the attention of the United States district attorney in order that criminal proceedings may be instituted to enforce the act of Congress. In the present case all the provisions of the statute were complied with. The parties concerned were duly notified and were fully heard. Nor is there any reason to say that the Secretary of War was not entirely justified, if not compelled, by the evidence, in finding \n\n[204 U.S. 364, 388]\n\u00a0\n that the bridge in question was an unreasonable obstruction to commerce and navigation as now conducted.\n We are of opinion that the act in question is not unconstitutional as conferring upon the Secretary of War powers of such nature that they could not be delegated to him by Congress.\n The next principal contention of the Bridge Company is that the act of 1899 is unconstitutional, in that it makes no provision, and the United States has not offered, to compensate if for the sum that will necessarily be expended in order to make the alterations or changes required by the order of the Secretary of War. In other words, the defendant insists that what the United States requires to be done in respect of defendant's bridge a taking of private property for public use, which the government is fordidden by the Constitution to do without making just compensation to, or without making provision to justly compensate, the owner. Stating the question in another way, the contention is, in effect, that even if the United States did not expressly assent to the construction of this bridge as it is, and even if the bridge has become an unreasonable obstruction to the free navigation of the water way in question, the exertion of the power of the United States to regulate commerce among the states is subject to fundamental condition that it cannot require the defendant, whose bridge was lawfully constructed, to make any alterations, however necessary to secure free navigation, without paying or securing to it compensation for the reasonable cost of such alterations.\n The propositions are combated by the government, which contends that the alterations or changes required to secure navigation against an unreasonable obstruction is not a taking of private property for public use within the meaning of the Constitution, and that the cost of such alterations or changes is to be deemed incidental only to the exercise of an undoubted function of the United States, when exerting, through Congress, its power to regulate commerce among the states, \n\n[204 U.S. 364, 389]\n\u00a0\n and therefore navigation upon the water ways on and over which such commerce is conducted.\n It would seem clear that this issue has likewise been determined by the principles announced in the previous cases of this court. Let us see whether such be the fact.\n A leading case upon this subject is Gibson v. United States, \n166 \nU.S. 269, 271\n, 41 S. L. ed. 996, 998, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 578, 579, et seq. Congress, by the river and harbor acts of 1884 and 1886 (23 Stat. at L. 133, 147, chap. 229, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3524, 24 Stat. at L. 316, 327, chap. 929), authorized and directed the improvement of the Ohio river, and made appropriations to effect that object. Under the authority of the Secretary of War, and the Engineer Corps of the Army, a dike was constructed in that river for the purpose of concentrating the water-flow in the main channel of the river, near Neville island. The dike began at a certain point on the island. Its construction substantially destroyed the landing on and in front of a farm, owned by Mrs. Gibson, on that island, preventing, during most of the year, free egress and ingress from and to such farm to the main or navigable channel of the river. At the time of the construction of the dike that farm was in high state of cultivation, well improved, with a dwelling house, barn, and outbuildings. It had a frontage of a thousand feet on the main navigable channel, and the owner had a landing there which was used in the shipping of products from and supplies to her farm, and was the only one from which such products and supplies could be shipped. Before the construction of the dike the farm, by reason of the use to which it was put, was worth $600 per acre. The obstruction caused by the dike reduced its value to $150 or $200 per acre, resulting in damages to the owner in excess of $3,000. Suit was brought against the United States in the court of claims to recover such damages. That court found, as a conclusion of law, that the owner was not entitled to recover.\n The Chief Justice of this court, delivering its unanimous judgment, said: 'All navigable waters are under the con- \n\n[204 U.S. 364, 390]\n\u00a0\n trol of the United States for the purpose of regulating and improving navigation, and although the title to the shore and submerged soil is in the various states and individual owners under them, it is always subject to the servitude in respect of navigation created in favor of the Federal government by the Constitution. South Carolina v. Georgia, \n93 U.S. 4\n, 23 L. ed. 782; Shively v. Bowlby, \n152 U.S. 1\n, 38 L. ed. 331, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 548; Eldridge v. Trezevant, \n160 U.S. 452\n, 40 L. ed. 490, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 345.' After referring to several adjudged cases the court proceeded: 'The 5th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States provides that private property shall not 'be taken for public use without just compensation.' Here, however, the damage of which Mrs. Gibson complained was not the result of the taking of any part of her property, whether upland or submerged, or a direct invasion thereof, but the incidental consequence of the lawful and proper exercise of a governmental power. The applicable principle is expounded in Northern Transp. Co. v. Chicago, \n99 U.S. 635\n, 25 L. ed. 336. In that case, plaintiff, being an owner of land situated at the intersection of La Salle street in Chicago, with the Chicago river, upon which it had valuable dock and warehouse accommodations, with a numerous line of steamers accustomed to land at that dock, was interrupted in his use thereof by the building of a tunnel under the Chicago river by authority of the state legislature, in accomplishing which work it was necessary to tear up La Salle street, which precluded plaintiff from access to his property for a considerable time; also to build a coffer dam in the Chicago river, which excluded his vessels from access to his docks; and such an injury was held to be damnum absque injuria. The court said, again speaking through Mr. Justice Strong: 'But acts done in the proper exercise of governmental powers, and not directly encroaching upon private property, though their consequences may impair its use, are universally held not to be a taking within the meaning of the constitutional provision. They do not entitle the owner of such property to compensation from the state or its agents, or give him any \n\n[204 U.S. 364, 391]\n\u00a0\n right of action. This is supported by an immense weight of authority.' . . . Moreover, riparian ownership is subject to the obligation to suffer the consequences of the improvement of navigation in the exercise of the dominant right of the government in that regard. The legislative authority for these works consisted simply in an appropriation for their construction, but this was an assertion of a right belonging to the government, to which riparian property was subject, and not of a right to appropriate private property, not burdened with such servitude, to public purposes. In short, the damage resulting from the prosecution of this improvement of a navigable highway for the public good was not the result of a taking of appellant's property, and was merely incidental to the exercise of a servitude to which her property had always been subject.'\n The Gibson Case was referred to with approval in Scranton v. Wheeler, \n179 \nU.S. 141, 153\n, 162 S., 45 L. ed. 126, 133, 137, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 48, 53, 57. The latter case involved the question whether the owner of land on the St. Mary's river, in Michigan, was entitled, under the Constitution of the United States, to be compensated for the injury or damage done him, as a riparian owner, by certain work done in that river under the authority of the United States. The controlling question was whether the prohibition in the Constitution of the United States of the taking of private property for public use without just compensation has any application to the case of an owner of land bordering on a public navigable river whose access from his land to navigability is permanently lost by reason of the construction of a pier resting on submerged lands in front of his upland, and which pier was erected by the United States for the purpose only of improving the navigation of such river. After observing that when that which is done amounts, within the meaning of the Constitution, to a taking of private property for public use, and that Congress may not, in the exercise of its power to regulate commerce, override the provision for just compensation when private property is so taken, the court entered \n\n[204 U.S. 364, 392]\n\u00a0\n upon a review of some of the adjudged cases. Among other things it said: 'All the cases concur in holding that the power of Congress to regulate commerce, and therefore navigation, is paramount, and is unrestricted except by the limitations upon its authority by the Constitution. Of course, every part of the Constitution is as binding upon Congress as upon the people. The guaranties prescribed by it for the security of private property must be respected by all. But whether navigation upon waters over which Congress may exert its authority requires improvement at all, or improvement in a particular way, are matters wholly within its discretion; and the judiciary is without power to control or defeat the will of Congress, so long as that branch of the government does not transcend the limits established by the supreme law of the land. Is the broad power with which Congress is invested burdened with the condition that a riparian owner whose land borders upon a navigable water of the United States shall be compensated for his right of access to navigability whenever such right ceases to be of value solely in consequence of the improvement of navigation by means of piers resting upon submerged lands away from the shore line? We think not.' 'The primary use,' the court said, 'of the waters and the lands under them is for purposes of navigation, and the erection of piers in them to improve navigation for the public is entirely consistent with such use, and infringes no right of the riparian owner. Whatever the nature of the interest of a riparian owner in the submerged lands in front of his upland bordering on a public navigable water, his title is not as full and complete as his title to fast land which has no direct connection with the navigation of such water. It is a qualified title, a bare technical title, not at his absolute disposal, as is his upland, but to be held at all times subordinate to such use of the submerged lands and of the waters flowing over them as may be consistent with or demanded by the public right of navigation. In Lorman v. Benson, 8 Mich. 18, 22, 77 Am. Dec. 435, the supreme court of Michigan, speaking \n\n[204 U.S. 364, 393]\n\u00a0\n by Justice Campbell, declared the right of navigation to be one to which all others were subservient. . . . But the contention is that compensation must be made for the loss of the plaintiff's access from his upland to navigability incidentally resulting from the occupancy of the submerged lands, even if the construction and maintenance of a pier resting upon them be necessary or valuable in the proper improvement of navigation. We cannot assent to this view. If the riparian owner cannot enjoy access to navigability because of the improvement of navigation by the construction away from the shore line of works in a public navigable river or water, and if such right of access ceases alone for that reason to be of value, there is not, within the meaning of the Constitution, a taking of private property for public use, but only a consequential injury to a right which must be enjoyed, as was said in Yates v. Milwaukee, 10 Wall. 497, 504, 505, 19 L. ed. 984, 986, 987, 'in due subjection to the rights of the public,'- an injury resulting incidentally from the exercise of a governmental power for the benefit of the general public, and from which no duty arises to make or secure compensation to the riparian owner. The riparian owner acquired the right of access to navigability subject to the contingency that such right might become valueless in consequence of the erection under competent authority of structures on the submerged lands in front of his property for the purpose of improving navigation. When erecting the pier in question, the government had no object in view except, in the interest of the public, to improve navigation. It was not designed arbitrarily or capriciously to destroy rights belonging to any riparian owner. What was done was manifestly necessary to meet the demands of international and interstate commerce.' The court further said: 'In our opinion, it was not intended that the paramount authority of Congress to improve the navigation of the public navigable waters of the United States should be crippled by compelling the government to make compensation for the injury to a riparian owner's right of access to navigability that might incidentally result from \n\n[204 U.S. 364, 394]\n\u00a0\n an improvement ordered by Congress. The subject with which Congress dealt was navigation. That which was sought to be accomplished was simply to improve navigation on the waters in question so as to meet the wants of the vast commerce passing and to pass over them. Consequently the agents designated to perform the work ordered or authorized by Congress had the right to proceed in all proper ways without taking into account the injury that might possibly or indirectly result from such work to the right of access by riparian owners to navigability. . . . . We are of opinion that the court below correctly held that the plaintiff had no such right of property in the submerged lands on which the pier in question rests as entitles him, under the Constitution, to be compensated for any loss of access from his upland to navigability resulting from the erection and maintenance of such pier by the United States in order to improve, and which manifestly did improve, the navigation of a public navigable water.'\n In New Orleans Gaslight Co. v. Drainage Commission, \n197 \nU.S. 453, 461\n, 462 S., 49 L. ed. 831, 835, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 471, 473, 474, it appeared that, under contract with the city of New Orleans, and at its own expense, the gaslight company had lawfully laid its pipes at certain places in the public ways and streets of that city. Subsequently, the drainage commission of New Orleans adopted a plan for the drainage of the city, which made it necessary to change the location in some places of the mains and pipes theretofore laid by the gaslight company. That company contended that to require such changes was a taking of its property for public use, for which it was entitled, under the Constitution, to compensation. That view was rejected by this court. We said: 'The gas company did not acquire any specific location in the streets; it was content with the general right to use them, and when it located its pipes it was at the risk that they might be, at some future time, disturbed, when the state might require, for a necessary public use, that changes in location be made . . . . The need of occupation of the \n\n[204 U.S. 364, 395]\n\u00a0\n soil beneath the streets in cities is constantly increasing, for the supply of water and light and the construction of systems of sewerage and drainage, and every reason of public policy requires that grants of rights in such subsurface shall be held subject to such reasonable regulation as the public health and safety may require. There is nothing in the grant to the gas company, even if it could legally be done, undertaking to limit the right of the state to establish a system of drainage in the streets. We think whatever right the gas company acquired was subject, in so far as the location of its pipes was concerned, to such future regulations as might be required in the interest of the public health and welfare. These views are amply sustained by the authorities. National Waterworks Co. v. Kansas City, 28 Fed. 921, in which the opinion was delivered by Mr. Justice Brewer, then circuit judge; Columbus Gaslight & Coke Co. v. Columbus, 50 Ohio St. 65, 19 L.R.A. 510, 40 Am. St. Rep. 648, 33 N. E. 292; Jamaica Pond Aqueduct Corp. v. Brookline, 121 Mass. 5; Re Deering, 93 N. Y. 361; Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Chicago, \n166 \nU.S. 226, 254\n, 41 S. L. ed. 979, 990, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 581. In the latter case it was held that uncompensated obedience to a regulation enacted for the public safety under the police power of the state was not taking property without due compensation. In our view, that is all there is to this case. The gas company, by its grant from the city, acquired no exclusive right to the location of its pipes in the streets, as chosen by it, under a general grant of authority to use the streets. The city made no contract that the gas company should not be disturbed in the location chosen. In the exercise of the police power of the state, for a purpose highly necessary in the promotion of the public health, it has become necessary to change the location of the pipes of the gas company so as to accommodate them to the new public work. In complying with this requirement at its own expense none of the property of the gas company has been taken, and the injury sustained is damnum absque injuria.'\n In Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Illinois, \n200 U.S. 561\n, \n\n[204 U.S. 364, 396]\n\u00a0\n 582, 593-595, 50 L. ed. 596, 605, 609, 610, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 341, 345, 350, 351, the above cases were cited with approval, and the principles announced in them were applied against a railway company owning a bridge that had been lawfully constructed by it over a non-navigable creek running through certain swamp or slough lands which the drainage commissioners were required by statute to drain in order to make them tillable and fit for cultivation. The commissioners, in executing the work of draining, found it necessary that the creek over which the railway bridge was constructed should be deepened and enlarged, and a greater opening made under the bridge for the passage of the increased amount of water caused by the deepening and enlarging of the bed of the creek. The railway company was required, at its own cost, to construct such a bridge over the creek as would meet the necessities of the situation as it was or would be under the drainage plan of the commissioners. The company refused to obey the order. The contention of the railway company was that, as the bridge was lawfully constructed under its general corporate powers, and as the depth and width of the channel under it was sufficient, at the time, to carry off the water of the creek as it then and subsequently flowed, the foundation of the bridge could not be removed and its use of the bridge disturbed, unless compensation be first made or secured to the company in such amount as would be sufficient to meet the expense of removing the timbers and stones from the creek and of constructing a new bridge of such length and with such opening under it as the plan of the commissioners would make necessary. The company insisted that to require it to meet these expenses out of its own funds would be, within the meaning of the Constitution, a taking of its property for public use without compensation, and, therefore, without due process of law. The court, after a review of authorities, said: 'The constitutional requirement of due process of law, which embraces compensation for private property taken for public use, applies in every case of the exertion of governmental power. If, in the execution of any power, no matter what it is, the government, \n\n[204 U.S. 364, 397]\n\u00a0\n Federal or state, finds it necessary to take private property for public use, it must obey the constitutional injunction to make or secure just compensation to the owner. Cherokee Nation v. Southern Kansas R. Co. \n135 \nU.S. 641, 659\n, 34 S. L. ed. 295, 303, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 965; Sweet v. Rechel, \n159 \nU.S. 380, 399\n, 402 S., 40 L. ed. 188, 196, 197, 16 Sup. Ct.

If the means employed have no real substantial relation to public objects which government may legally accomplish,-if they are arbitrary and unreasonable, beyond the necessities of the case,- the judiciary will disregard mere forms, and interfere for the protection of rights injuriously affected by such illegal action. The authority of the courts to interfere in such cases is beyond all doubt. Minnesota v. Barber, \n136 \nU.S. 313, 320\n, 34 S. L. ed. 455, 458, 3 Inters. Com. Rep. 185, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 862, Upon the general subject there is no real conflict among the adjudged cases. Whatever conflict there is arises upon the question whether there has been or will be, in the particular case, within the true meaning of the Constitution, a 'taking' of private property for public use. If the injury complained of is only incidental to the legitimate exercise of governmental powers for the public good, then there is no taking of property for the public use, and a right to compensation, on account of such injury, does not attach under the Constitution. Such is the present case.' The opinion concluded: 'Without further discussion we hold it to be the duty of the railway company, at its own expense, to remove from the creek the present bridge, culvert, timbers, and stones placed there by it, and also (unless it abandons or surrenders its right to cross the creek at or in the vicinity of the present crossing) to erect, at its own expense, and maintain, a new bridge for crossing that will conform to the regulations established by the drainage commissioners, under the authority of the state; and such a requirement, if enforced, will not amount to a taking of private property for public use within the meaning of the Constitution, nor to a denial of the equal protection of the laws.'\n The latest adjudication by this court was in West Chicage \n\n[204 U.S. 364, 398]\n\u00a0\n Street R. Co. V. Chicago, \n201 \nU.S. 506, 524\n, 50 S. L. ed. 845, 852, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 518, 523. In that case the principal question related to the duty of a street railroad company, which had lawfully constructed a tunnel under the Chicago river, to obey an ordinance of the city, requiring the company, at its own cost and expense, to lower its tunnel, so as to provide for a certain depth under it, which had been ascertained by competent Federal and local authority to be necessary for the increased demands of navigation. This court held, upon the adjudged cases, that the rights of the company, as the owner of the fee of the land on either side of the river or in its bed, were subject to the paramount right of navigation over the waters of the river. It said: 'If, then, the right of the railroad company to have and maintain a tunnel under the Chicago river is subject to the paramount public right of navigation; if its right to maintain a tunnel in the river is a qualified one, because subject to the specific condition in the act of 1874 that no tunnel should interrupt navigation; if the present tunnel is an obstruction to navigation, as, upon this record, we must take it to be; and if the city, as representing the state and public, may rightfully insist that such obstruction shall not longer remain in the way of free navigation,-it necessarily follows that the railway company is under a duty to comply with the demand made upon it to remove, at its own expense, the obstruction which itself has created and maintains. If the obstruction cannot be removed except by lowering the tunnel to the required depth and (if a tunnel is to be maintained) providing one that will not interrupt navigation, then the cost attendant upon such work must be met by the company. The city asks nothing more than that the railroad company shall do what is necessary to free navigation from an obstruction for which it is responsible, and (if it intends not to abandon its right to maintain a tunnel at or near Van Buren street) that it shall itself provide a new tunnel with the necessary depth of water above it.' Again: 'In the case before us the public demands nothing to be done by the railroad company except to remove the obstruction which itself placed and \n\n[204 U.S. 364, 399]\n\u00a0\n maintains in the river under the condition that navigation should not at any time be thereby interrupted. The removal of such obstruction is all that is needed to protect navigation. So that whatever cost attends the removal of the obstruction must be borne by the railroad company. The condition under which the company placed its tunnel in the river being met by the company, the public has no furthere demands upon it. This cannot be deemed a taking of private property for public use, or a denial of the equal protection of laws within the meaning of the Constitution, but is only the result of the lawful exercise of a governmental power for the common good. This appears from the authorities cited in Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Illinois, supra, just decided. The state court has well said that to maintain the navigable character of the stream in a lawful way is not, within the meaning of the law, the taking of private property or any property right of the owner of the soil under the river, such ownership being subject to the right of free and unobstructed navigation. People ex rel. Chicago v. West Chicago Street R. Co. 203 Ill. 551, 557, 68 N. E. 78. What the city asks, and all that it asks, is that the railroad company be required, in the exercise of its rights and in the use of its property, to respect the public needs as declared by competent authority, upon reasonable grounds, to exist. This is not an arbitrary or unreasonable demand. It does not, in any legal sense, take or appropriate the company's property for the public benefit, but only insists that the company shall not use its property so as to interrupt navigation.'\n Do the principles announced in the above cases require us to hold, in the present case, that the making of the alterations of its bridge specified in the order of the Secretary of War will be a taking of the property of the Bridge Company for public use? We think not. Unless there be a taking, within the meaning of the Constitution, no obligation arises upon the United States to make compensation for the cost to be incurred in making such alterations. The damage that will accrue to the Bridge Company, as the result of compliance \n\n[204 U.S. 364, 400]\n\u00a0\n with the Secretary's order, must, in such case, be deemed incidental to the exercise by the government of its power to regulate commerce among the states, which includes, as we have seen, the power to secure free navigation upon the water ways of the United States against unreasonable obstructions. There are no circumstances connected with the original construction of the bridge, or with its maintenance since, which so tie the hands of the government that it cannot exert its full power to protect the freedom of navigation against obstructions. Although the bridge, when erected under the authority of a Pennsylvania charter, may have been a lawful structure, and although it may not have been an unreasonable obstruction to commerce and navigation as then carried on, it must be taken, under the cases cited, and upon principle, not only that the company, when exerting the power conferred upon it by the state, did so with knowledge of the paramount authority of Congress to regulate commerce among the states, but that it erected the bridge subject to the possibility that Congress might, at some future time, when the public interest demanded, exert its power by appropriate legislation to protect navigation against unreasonable obstructions. Even if the bridge, in its original form, was an unreasonable obstruction to navigation, the mere failure of the United States, at the time, to intervene by its officers or by legislation and prevent its erection, could not create an obligation on the part of the government to make compensation to the company if, at a subsequent time, and for public reasons, Congress should forbid the maintenance of bridges that had become unreasonable obstructions to navigation. It is for Congress to determine when it will exert its power to regulate interstate commerce. Its mere silence or inaction when individuals or corporations, under the authority of a state, place unreasonable obstructions in the water ways of the United States, cannot have the effect to cast upon the government an obligation not to exert its constitutional power to regulate interstate commerce except subject to the condition that compensation be \n\n[204 U.S. 364, 401]\n\u00a0\n made or secured to the individuals or corporation who may be incidentally affected by the exercise of such power. The principle for which the Bridge Company contends would seriously impair the exercise of the beneficent power of the government to secure the free and unobstructed navigation of the water ways of the United States. We cannot give our assent to that principle. In conformity with the adjudged cases, and in order that the constitutional power of Congress may have full operation, we must adjudge that Congress has power to protect navigation on all water ways of the United States against unreasonable obstructions, even those created under the sanction of a state, and that an order to so alter a bridge over a water way of the United States that it will cease to be an unreasonable obstruction to navigation will not amount to a taking of private property for public use for which compensation need be made.\n Independent of the grounds upon which we thus place our decision, it is appropriate to observe that the conclusion reached finds support in the charter of the Bridge Company and in the law of Pennsylvania, as declared by its highest court. The charter of the company, as we have seen, expressly warned the company that its bridge must not obstruct navigation,- that is, in legal effect, navigation as it then was, or might be, at any subsequent time. In Dugan v. Bridge Co. 27 Pa. 303, 309, 311, 67 Am. Dec. 464, we have the case of a bridge company on which was conferred the franchise to erect and maintain a toll-bridge across Monongahela river, coupled, however, with the condition that such bridge should not be erected 'in such manner as to injure, stop, or interrupt the navigation of such river by boats, rafts, or other vessels.' The supreme court of Pennsylvania interpreted these words as meaning that 'the bridge was to be so built as not to injure, stop, or interrupt the navigation, either then or now, whether in its infancy or full growth.' The same general question arose in Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Illinois, \n200 U.S. 589\n, 50 L. ed. 607, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 348. This court held that the adjudged cases 'negative the \n\n[204 U.S. 364, 402]\n\u00a0\n suggestion of the railway company that the adequacy of its bridge and the opening under it for passing the water of the creek at the time the bridge was constructed determine its obligations to the public at all subsequent periods. In Cooke v. Boston & L. R. Corp. 133 Mass. 185, 188, it appeared that a railroad company had statutory authority to cross a certain highway with its road. The statute provided that if the railroad crossed any highway it should be so constructed as not to impede or obstruct the safe and convenient use of the highway. And one of the contentions of the company was that the statute limited its duty and obligation to provide for the wants of travelers at the time it exercised the privilege granted to it. The court said: 'The legislature intended to provide against any obstruction of the safe and convenient use of the highway for all time; and if, by the increase of population in the neighborhood, or by an increasing use of the highway, the crossing, which, at the outset, was adequate, is no longer so, it is the duty of the railroad corporation to make such alteration as will meet the present needs of the public who have occasion to use the highway.' In Lake Erie & W. R. Co. v. Cluggish, 143 Ind. 347, 42 N. E. 743, the court said (quoting from Lake Erie & W. R. Co. v. Smith, 61 Fed. 885): 'The duty of a railroad to restore a stream or highway way which is crossed by the line of its road is a continuing duty; and if, by the increase of population or other causes, the crossing becomes inadequate to meet the new and altered conditions of the country, it is the duty of the railroad to make such alterations as will meet the present needs of the public.' So, in Indiana ex rel. Muncie v. Lake Erie & W. R. Co. 83 Fed. 284, 287, which was the case of an overhead crossing lawfully constructed on one of the streets of a city, the court said: 'If, by the growth of population or otherwise, the crossing has become inadequate to meet the present needs of the public, it is the duty of the railroad company to remedy the defect by restoring the crossing so that it will not unnecessarily impair the usefulness of the highway.\" \n\n[204 U.S. 364, 403]\n\u00a0\n Some stress was laid in argument upon the fact that compliance with the order of the Secretary of War will compel the Bridge Company to make a very large expenditure in money. But that consideration cannot affect the decision of the questions of constitutional law involved. It is one to be addressed to the legislative branch of the government. It is for Congress to determine whether, under the circumstances of a particular case, justice requires that compensation be made to a person or corporation incidentally suffering from the exercise by the national government of its constitutional powers.\n These are all the matters which require notice at our hands; and, perceiving no error of law on the record, the judgment must be affirmed.\n It is so ordered.\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer and Mr. Justice Peckham dissent.\n Mr. Justice Moody did not participate in the consideration or decision of the case. \n\nFootnotes\n Act of June 13th, 1798, chap. 53, 1 Stat. at L. 565, 566; of February 9th, 1799, chap. 2, 1 Stat. at L. 613; of April 18th, 1806, chap. 29, 2 Stat. at L. 379; of December 19th, 1806, chap. 1, 2 Stat. at L. 411; of March 3d. 1815, chap. 77, 3 Stat. at L. 224; of March 3d, 1817, chap. 39, 3 Stat. at L. 361; of January 7th, 1824, chap. 4, 4 Stat. at L. 3; of May 24th, 1828, chap. 111, 4 Stat, at L. 308, U.

BROWN(1907)\nNo. 266\nArgued: March 7, 1907Decided: March 18, 1907\n\n\n\n This appellee, Brown, was charged in the superior court of Lewis county, Washington, with the crime of murder, and was acquitted. The verdict of the jury was: 'We, the jury, find the defendant not guilty, by reason of insanity.'\n The verdict having been entered of record, an order was made which recited that the court, by reason of the verdict, the evidence, the proceedings in the trial, and the demeanor of the defendant, 'finds that the discharge or going at large of said Thomas Brown would be and is considered by the court as manifestly dangerous to the peace and safety of the community;' also, that he be committed to the county jail until the further order of the court.\n In making this order the court acted on the authority of a statute of Washington, as follows: 'When any person indicted or informed against for an offense shall, on trial, be acquitted by reason of insanity, the jury, in giving their verdict of not guilty, shall state that it was given for such cause; and thereupon, if the discharge or going at large of such insane person shall be considered by the court manifestly dangerous to the \n\n[205 U.S. 179, 180]\n\u00a0\n peace and safety of the community, the court may order him to be committed to prison, or may give him into the care of his friends, if they shall give bonds, with surety to the satisfaction of the court, conditioned that he shall be well and securely kept; otherwise he shall be discharged' Ballinger's Anno. Codes & Statutes,  6959\n\n\n Subsequently, the accused, being in the custody of the sheriff under the above order, made an original application to the supreme court of Washington on the 13th day of June, 1905, for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging that he was unlawfully detained and imprisoned, in that the statute under which he was held was in violation of both the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States and of the Constitution of the state.\n The supreme court of Washington, by its final judgment, entered July 14th, 1905, held that the statute was constitutional, and that the order of the trial court was in strict conformity with its provisions. Re Brown, 39 Wash. 160, 1 L.R.A.(N.S.) 540, 109 Am. St. Rep. 868, 81 Pac. 552. That court accordingly denied his application to be discharged. That appellee then, on July 18th, 1905, made application to the circuit court of the United States for the western district of Washington for a writ of habeas corpus. In his answer to this application the sheriff, having the appellee in custody, referred to the proceedings in the supreme court of the state, and alleged that the mental condition or capacity of the applicant was in no wise different or improved than it was on the 23d of December, 1904, at the time he killed his father. That court granted the writ, and, the case being heard, the court, by its final order, entered January 10th, 1906, discharged the appellee from custody. The circuit judge held that the statute, although constitutional, was not properly administered by the superior court in rendering its judgment, and that the imprisonment of the petitioner with sanction of the judiciary of the state, without arraignment, and a fair opportunity to defend himself against charges lawfully preferred, and to produce evidence in his defense, was deprivation \n\n[205 U.S. 179, 181]\n\u00a0\n of his liberty by the state, without due process of law, and violated the national Constitution; and for that reason the application for the writ of habeas corpus was granted. 139 Fed. 846.\n The order of commitment under which the appellee was held was adjudged by the circuit court to be illegal and void, but the judgment was without prejudice to any lawful proceeding to have the prisoner restrained, if he should be adjudged to be a dangerous person by reason of insanity. From that judgment the present appeal was prosecuted.\n Messrs. E. C. Macdonald, John D. Atkinson, A. J. Falknor, and J. R. Buxton for appellant.\n No counsel for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of the court:\n It is the settled doctrine of this court that, although the circuit courts of the United States, and the several justices and judges thereof, have authority, under existing statutes, to discharge, upon habeas corpus, one held in custody by state authority in violation of the Constitution or of any treaty or law of the United States, the court, justice, or judge has a discretion as to the time and mode in which the power so conferred shall be exerted; and that, in view of the relations existing, under our system of government, between the judicial tribunals of the Union and of the several states, a Federal court or a Federal judge will not ordinarily interfere by habeas corpus with the regular course of procedure under state authority, but will leave the applicant for the writ of habeas corpus to exhaust the remedies afforded by the state for determining whether he is illegally restrained of his liberty. After the highest court of the state, competent under the state law \n\n[205 U.S. 179, 182]\n\u00a0\n to dispose of the matter, has finally acted, the case can be brought to this court for re-examination. The exceptional cases in which a Federal court or judge may sometimes appropriately interfere by habeas corpus in advance of final action by the authorities of the state are those of great urgency, that require to be promptly disposed of; such, for instance, as cases 'involving the authority and operations of the general government, or the obligations of this country to, or its relations with, foreign nations.' The present case is not within any of the exceptions recognized in our former decisions. If the applicant felt that the decision, upon habeas corpus, in the supreme court of the state, was in violation of his rights under the Constitution or laws of the United States, he could have brought the ease by writ of error directly from that court to this court. \n1\n In Reid v. Jones, \n187 U.S. 153\n, 47 L. ed. 116, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 89, it was said that one convicted for an alleged violation of the criminal statutes of a state, and who contended that he was held in violation of the Constitution of the United States, 'must ordinarily first take his case to the highest court of the state, in which the judgment could be reviewed, and thence bring it, if unscuccessful there, to this court by writ of error; that only in certain exceptional cases, of which the present is not one, will a circuit court of the United States, or this court, upon appeal from a circuit court, intervene by writ of habeas corpus in advance of the final action by the highest court of the state.' So, in the recent case of United States ex rel. Drury v. Lewis, \n200 U.S. 1\n, 50 L. ed. 343, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 229, it was said that, in cases of the custody by state authorities of one charged with crime, the settled and proper procedure was for a circuit court of the United States not to interfere by habeas corpus, 'unless in cases of peculiar urgency, and that, instead of discharging, \n\n[205 U.S. 179, 183]\n\u00a0\n they will leave the prisoner to be dealt with by the courts of the state; that, after a final determination of the case by the state court, the Federal courts will even then generally leave the petitioner to his remedy by writ of error from this court. The reason for this course is apparent. It is an exceedingly delicate jurisdiction given to the Federal courts by which a person under an indictment in a state court, and subject to its laws, may, by the decision of a single judge of the Federal court, upon a writ of habeas corpus, be taken out of the custody of the officers of the state, and finally discharged therefrom.'\n Without now expressing any opinion as to the constitutionality of the statute in question, or as to the mode in which it was administered in the state court, for the reasons stated the judgment of the Circuit Court must be reversed, with directions to set aside the order discharging the appellee, and to enter an order denying the application for a writ of habeas corpus, leaving the appellee in the custody of the state, with liberty to apply for a writ of error to review the above judgment of the Supreme Court of Washington.\n It is so ordered.\n\nFootnotes\n Ex parte Royall, \n117 \nU.S. 241, 251\n, 29 S.

TERRITORY OF ARIZ.(1907)\nNo. 67\nArgued: November 15, 1907Decided: December 2, 1907\n\n\n\n\n[207 U.S. 201, 202]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Samuel L. Kingan and William Herring for appellants.\n\n\n\n[207 U.S. 201, 203]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William c. Prentiss, Horace F. Clark, and E. S. Clark for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n This was an application by the appellee, the territory of Arizona, for a mandamus to compel the appellants, the supervisors of Pima county, to levy a tax to pay the interest due on certain bonds. The facts are these: In 1883 an act was passed by the territorial legislature (Ariz. Laws 1883, p. 61), directing Pima county to exchange its bonds for those of the Arizona Narrow Gauge Railroad Company. The amount of the bonds and the conditions of exchange were specified in the act. One hundred and fifty thousand dollars of bonds were so exchanged. Pima county denied its liability on the bonds, refused to pay the interest coupons, and an action was brought thereon, which finally reached this court. Lewis v. Pima County, \n155 U.S. 54\n, 39 L. ed. 67, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 22. The act was held to be in violation of the restrictions imposed upon territorial legislatures by U. S. Rev. Stat.  1889, as amended by the act of Congress of June 8, 1878, chap. 168 (20 Stat. at L. 101), and the bonds were adjudged void. Subsequently, by acts of Congress and the territorial legislature, provision was made for the issue of territorial in exchange for these bonds and for the payment of the principal and interest thereof by the county. The validity of this legislation came before us in Utter v. Franklin, \n172 U.S. 416\n, 43 L. ed. 498, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 183, where the different acts are fully stated. We sustained it, and adjudged that it was the duty of the loan commissioners to \n\n[207 U.S. 201, 204]\n\u00a0\n refund the bonds. In Murphy v. Utter, \n186 U.S. 95\n, 46 L. ed. 1070, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 776, the ruling was reaffirmed, and it was held that neither a change in the personnel of the loan commission nor an act of the legislature of Arizona, abolishing the commission, put an end to the duty of refunding.\n The refunding having been made, the territory thereafter called upon Pima county to pay the interest which the territory had paid on the funded bonds. Upon its refusal to pay this, application was made to the supreme court of the territory and it granted a mandamus, and from that decision the appellants have brought the case here. They challenge the validity of the refunding legislation, while the appellee contends that the matter is res judicata, or, if not, should, upon the doctrine of stare decisis, be regarded as foreclosed. In the two cases, 172 and 186 U. S., in which the validity of the refunding legislation was considered, Pima county was not nominally a party. The actions were brought by the holders of the bonds against the loan commission. Whether the county was technically bound by the decisions may be a question. It was heard by its attorney in the litigation, and was the party ultimately to be affected by the refunding. Gunter v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. \n200 U.S. 273\n, 50 L. ed. 477, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 252. But, if it be not so bound, still, under the doctrine of stare decisis, the question should no longer be considered an open one. The county had full knowledge of the entire litigation, having been a party in the first action and been represented by its attorney in the last two. Any defense which could be made to the refunding of the bonds and the validity of the refunding legislation could have been raised in the last cases. This court considered every question that was presented, determined that the legislation was valid, and ordered that the bonds should be refunded. They have been refunded. They have gone into the channels of trade, and now, after many years,-for the case of Utter v. Franklin was decided in 1899,-and when it is fair to presume that many have bought, relying upon the conclusiveness of the adjudication by this court, it might work a grievous wrong to overthrow those decisions and \n\n[207 U.S. 201, 205]\n\u00a0\n hold the bonds void. Stare decisis is a wholesome doctrine. It is not of universal application, and there have been cases where a ruling once made was wisely changed; but when the decision is one affirming the validity of bonds, notes, or bills of a limited amount, the issue of which had been in terms authorized by statute, such decision should generally be held conclusive, even as to those not strictly parties to the litigation; for otherwise, as we have said, much wrong might be done to innocent holders who bought in reliance upon the decision. We are of the opinion that the Supreme Court of Arizona was right, and its judgment is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","173":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nVANDALIA R. CO. v. STATE OF INDIANA EX REL CITY OF SOUTH BEND(1907)\nNo. 26\nArgued: October 18, 1907Decided: December 16, 1907\n\n\n\n\n[207 U.S. 359, 360]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Samuel Parker, John G. Williams, liams, and Anderson, Parker , & Crabill for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[207 U.S. 359, 361]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. L. T. Michener, Harry R. Wair, Frank H. Dunnahoo, and W. W. Dudley for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[207 U.S. 359, 362]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n This action was commenced by the defendant in error in the circuit court of St. Joseph county, Indiana, to compel the Terre Haute & Logansport Railway Company to open its tracks and yards within Calvert street in South Bend, to \n\n[207 U.S. 359, 363]\n\u00a0\n make the roadbed conform to the street grade, to plank the crossing of the same, and to make that crossing safe and convenient for the passage of persons and vehicles. While the action was pending in the state courts the Terre Haute company and certain other companies consolidated and formed a new corporation under the name of the Vandalia Railroad Company, which succeeded to all the rights and duties of the original defendant, carried on the further litigation, and is the plaintiff in error.\n Upon the complaint an alternative writ of mandamus was issued. To this writ and the complaint the railroad company demurred, and the demurrer was overruled. The company then filed its return to the alternative writ, and a demurrer of the plaintiff thereto was sustained. The railway company refusing to plead further, a peremptory writ of mandamus was issued as prayed for. On appeal to the supreme court of the state the decision of the circuit court was affirmed. 166 Ind. 219, 76 N. E. 980. Thereupon this writ of error was sued out.\n To fully understand the question presented a statement of the matters set forth in the complaint and return is necessary.\n The complaint alleges that on November 10, 1884, the city granted a franchise to the railway company to cross the streets and alleys of the city on the express condition that when it did so the roadbed should be made to conform strictly to the grade of the street or alley it crossed, and that the defendant should so construct and maintain its road at such crossing as to cause the least possible obstruction to the passage of persons and vehicles over it; that the railway company accepted said franchise and had ever since acted under it.\n It further described that portion of the street whose grade had been established and which was occupied by the defendant, and which it had been notified to plank and improve.\n The demurrer to the writ raised the question whether the action was not founded alone upon the contract created by the franchise, and asserted that the duties of a corporation, springing wholly out of contract, cannot be enforced by writs \n\n[207 U.S. 359, 364]\n\u00a0\n of mandamus; also whether the plaintiff could not of itself have constructed the crossing, and brought an action for the cost thereof and the penalty, as provided in the ordinance, and thereby secured adequate redress without resorting to the extraordinary remedy of mandamus. But obviously these matters are of a local nature, and present no question under the Federal Constitution.\n The return of the defendant alleged that at the time the original franchise was granted the place at which the improvement of the crossing was sought to be compelled by this action was outside the limits of the city of South Bend; that in 1887 it was taken into the corporate limits of the town of Myler, and thereafter, in 1892, said town of Myler was annexed to and became a part of the city of South Bend; that before this annexation, and while the town of Myler existed, certain parties filed with the board of trustees of that town a petition for the establishment of a street, at first called Elmira, but afterwards Calvert, street, over the ground where the plaintiff now claims said street is located; that the Terre Haute & Logansport Railroad Company, then the owner of the real estate, had no notice of the proceedings had for the establishment of said street and took no part therin; neither did it receive any compensation on account thereof; that prior thereto that company had placed a trust deed on the property, which, after the attempted establishment of the street, was foreclosed, by suit in the United States circuit court for the state and district of Indiana, and the property purchased by one Joshua T. Brooks, who directed a conveyance to the Terre Haute & Logansport Railway Company, the defendant herein; that neither the trustee in said trust deed nor any holder of bonds secured by it was a party to the proceedings for the establishment of said street, nor was any notice of said proceedings given to said trustee or any bondholder, nor did either have any knowledge thereof; that no damages for the opening of the street were assessed or tendered to either, and that, at the time of the purchase of the property and the payment of the \n\n[207 U.S. 359, 365]\n\u00a0\n purchase chase price, neither the purchaser nor the railroad company nor the defendant had any knowledge of the proceedings to locate and open the said street. A violation of the 14th Amendment was in terms claimed, in that an appropriation of its property acquired by the proceedings in the Federal court was sought to be made without compensation. The return further set forth that, springing out of these facts, there was a dispute between the railroad company and the city of South Bend as to the validity of the proceedings for the opening of said street, and that 'on January 17, 1902, for the purpose of adjusting and settling the said conflicting claims of the relator, and the defendant, the relator, acting by its then board of public works, made and entered into a contract whereby the defendand agreed to construct a steel viaduct above and across its tracks at said Elmira street where claimed by the relator, and the relator or agreed to construct the approaches thereto, and each agreed to perform the other agreements set forth in said contract, which is in writing and which was reported to the common council of said, city of South Bend, which, by ordinance duly passed and enacted, ratified and approved said contract. Said ordinance and said contract are in the following words and figures, to wit: 'Ordinance. An ordinance ratifying a contract between the department of public works and the Terre Haute & Logansport Railway. Be it ordained by the common council of the city of South Bend, that the within contract, made on the 17th day of January, 1902, between the department of public works and the Terre Haute & Logansport Railway Company, is hereby ratified and approved. This agreement made this 17th day of January, 1902, between the city of South Bend, by and through its board of public works, and the Terre Haute & Logansport Railway Company, witnesseth,\" etc. The return further averred that the defendant was ready at all times to construct the said viaduct according to said contract and ordinance, but the city had not performed any of the agreements contained \n\n[207 U.S. 359, 366]\n\u00a0\n in said contract, to be performed by it, and that it had not given to the defendant any written or other notice to construct the viaduct according to the provisions of said contract.\n In reference to this return the supreme court, in its opinion, made this statement of the contention of the parties:\n'Appellant's counsel assert and argue an insufficiency of the notice and return of service in the special proceedings of the board of trustees of the town of Myler for the establishment of Elmira street; a want of notice to the mortgagee of the property to be appropriated; and, in consequence, a taking of property without due process of law, in violation of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n\n'Appellee's counsel insist that the only question presented to and considered by the circuit court upon the demurrer to the return was the validity of the agreement therein pleaded.'\n\n It declared that the appellee's view was the correct one, and that the only question to be considered was the validity of the agreement therein pleaded. It then proceeded to discuss its validity, holding that it was beyond the power of the city, saying: 'The agreement entered into between the relator and the railway company was, on the part of the city, an unwarranted surrender of legislative power and control over the crossing, and an unauthorized assumption of the burdens of another, and is invalid and void.'\n It is now contended on the part of the defendant in error that no Federal question was passed upon by the supreme court of the state and that, therefore, the writ of error should be dismissed; while the plaintiff in error insists that there are two Federal questions: first, whether the state court gave due effect to the proceedings of the Federal court in the foreclosure and sale of the property under the trust deed; and second, whether the proceedings for the opening of the street were had without notice to the defendant and its predecessor, and so operated to take private property without compensation. This involves a consideration of the meaning and scope \n\n[207 U.S. 359, 367]\n\u00a0\n of the return. It is true that in that return it is alleged that no notice was given to the railroad company or its predecessor or the trustee in the trust deed or any bondholder, and that therefore there was no valid appropriation of the property of the railroad company to street purposes. It is also stated that by the foreclosure proceedings in the Federal court the full title to the property passed to the defendant,-a title which in its origin antedated the attempt to open the street. But the supreme court held that these were merely matters of inducement leading up to the making of the contract for a viaduct; that they were only presented for the purpose of showing the state of the controversy, which was settled between the parties by the making of this alleged contract. In other words, it did not pass upon the Federal questions, but held that they were put entirely out of the case by facts set forth in the return, presenting a question obviously not of a Federal character.\n Now, the construction of a pleading, the meaning to be given to its various allegations, and the determination of the validity of a contract made by parties in reference to real estate in the state, are, as a rule, local questions. Doubtless this court is not concluded by the ruling of the state court, and must determine for itself whether there is really involved any Federal question which will entitle it to review the judgment. Newport Light Co. v. Newport, \n151 \nU.S. 527, 536\n, 38 S. L. ed. 259, 262, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 429, and cases cited in the opinion. A case may arise in which it is apparent that a Federal question is sought to be avoided or is avoided by giving an unreasonable construction to pleadings, but that is not this case. Even if it be conceded that the conclusion of the supreme court of the state is not free from doubt, there is nothing to justify a suspicion that there was any intent to avoid the Federal questions. The construction placed by that court upon the pleading was a reasonable one. It said in reference to the matter:\n'The manifest theory of the pleader was to show that a reasonable and bona fide controversy existed as to the validity \n\n[207 U.S. 359, 368]\n\u00a0\n of the proceedings for the establishment of Elmira street by the board of trustees of the town of Myler, as an inducement to and consideration for entering into the compromise agreement pleaded, and that said contract having been legally executed and not rescinded, the railway company was thereby absolved from the duty declared upon, to construct and maintain a grade crossing at the point in controversy. 'A single paragraph of answer cannot perform the double function of denying the cause of action, and of confessing and avoiding it. It must be one thing or the other, but it cannot be both; and its character, in this respect, must be determined from the general scope of its averments.' Kimble v. Christie, 55 Ind. 140, 144. [In our opinion] the return under consideration was intended to confess and avoid the duty sought to be enforced, and its sufficiency must be determined upon that theory. This conclusion forbids a discussion of the legality of the various steps taken in the proceedings to establish Elmira street, as well as the constitutional question raised.'\n\n We think it must be held that the decision by the Supreme Court of the state was placed upon a sufficient non-Federal ground, and therefore the writ of error is dismissed. \n\n\n\n","174":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWALKER v. MCLOUD(1907)\nNo. 140\nArgued: Decided: February 4, 1907\n\n\n\n The appellant, who was plaintiff below, appeals from the judgment of the circuit court of appeals (70 C. C. A. 534, 138 Fed. 394) affirming a decree of the United States court for the central district of Indian territory, dismissing the appellant's bill on the merits. 5 Ind. Terr. 563, 82 S. W. 908.\n The appellant describes this action 'as in the nature of ejectment on the equity docket, instituted for the purpose of securing possession of certain buildings and the right to the occupancy of the land on which they were erected, and to quiet plaintiff in his title and possession of the same, and to \n\n[204 U.S. 302, 303]\n\u00a0\n remove the cloud from the title.' The appellant is the executor of the will of W. H. Ansley, who was the purchaser of the buildings, hereinafter referred to, at the sheriff's sale.\n The facts necessary to state in considering the question decided are as follows: The defendant McLoud is a trustee under a deed of trust, which need not now be more particularly stated, and defendant Gowen is the receiver of the Choctaw Coal & Railway Company, which was a corporation created under the laws of the state of Minnesota. By the 2d section of the act of Congress of February 18, 1888 (25 Stat. at L. 35, chap. 13), it was granted the right to take and use for all purposes of a railway, but for no other purposes, a right of way 100 feet in width through the Indian territory for its main line and branch. The 10th section of the act provided that the company should accept this right of way upon the express condition that it would neither aid, advise, nor assist in any effort looking towards the changing or extinguishing of the present tenure of the Indians in their land, and would not attempt to secure from the Indian nations any further grant of land or its occupancy than was provided in the act; and that any violation of the condition mentioned should operate as a forfeiture of all the rights and privileges of the company under the act.\n The Choctaw Nation, on October 30, 1888, passed an act, the 1st section of which reads as follows:\n'All noncitizens not in the employ of a citizen of the Choctaw Nation, and not authorized to live in the Choctaw Nation under the provisions of existing treaty stipulations, who have made or bought improvements in said Nation, are hereby notified that they are allowed to sell their so-called improvements to citizens, and if such noncitizens fail to comply with this section, then it shall be the duty of the sheriffs of the counties in which such improvements may be located to advertise the same for sale in thirty days, and sell the same at the appointed time to the highest Choctaw citizen bidder for cash; one half of which shall be paid into their respective \n\n[204 U.S. 302, 304]\n\u00a0\n treasuries, and the other half into the national treasury. Provided, however, that, if any such noncitizen fail or refuse to deliver the possession of such an improvement, he shall be reported by the sheriff of that county to the principal chief, and by said chief to the United States Indian agent, to take proper steps for the removal and prosecution of such offender under  2118 of the Revised Statutes of the United States. Provided, further, that a notice of sale shall be posted by the sheriff in three public places in his county, which shall be legal notice to all persons against whom this law may operate.'\n\n While the above acts were in force and during the years from 1889 to 1893, both inclusive, it is charged that the company, through its officers and agents, built certain buildings at the town of South McAlester, Indian territory, outside and beyond its right of way, illegally and in violation of such acts, and were using the same in behalf and in the interest of the company.\n In 1895 William Ansley, who was a citizen of the Choctaw Nation, and a deputy sheriff of the county where the buildings were erected, wrote to the governor of the Choctaw Nation and subsequently made a report in regard to the buildings as being erected by the company outside of its right of way, and that they were controlled by the company, and he was then directed by the principal chief of the Choctaw Nation to proceed according to law to sell and dispose of the buildings which had been built by the company outside its right of way. The sheriff proceeded to advertise the buildings for sale according to law, and in June, 1895, sold some of them to the appellant's intestate for $270; and the sheriff accepted his note as payment, conditioned that the same should be paid as soon as the purchaser was put into or otherwise obtained possession. This note has never been paid. The property purchased was, as alleged, of the value of about $60,000, and the purchaser was the son of the deputy sheriff who made the sale. The reason the money was not paid at the time of the bid, as stated by the bidder Ansley, was that the property was held by the company, and he was informed that it would take litigation \n\n[204 U.S. 302, 305]\n\u00a0\n to obtain possession. Immediately after the sale the sheriff who made it reported his action to the chief of the Choctaw Nation.\n The appellant, upon the trial, offered in evidence the deposition of the deputy sheriff who made the sale, in relation to this matter, in which he swore that 'the chief ratified my action as to the sale and payments of said property, and instructed me to proceed at once and employ attorneys to assist me in getting possession of the property for the purchasers, and I at once employed attorneys to assist the plaintiff, W. H. Ansley, in obtaining possession of the property sold by me as sheriff. Mosely & Smith, of Denison, Texas, a firm of lawyers, and Cole & Redwine, attorneys at South McAlester, were employed by the chief of the Choctaw Nation to assist the plaintiff in obtaining possession of said property. In 1895 the Choctaw council passed a special act, appropriating $1,500 to employ attorneys to represent the Choctaw Nation and to assist the plaintiff in obtaining possession of the property aforesaid. In the December following contracts employing the aforesaid lawyers were signed by Jeff Gardner, chief of the Choctaw Nation, and all my acts as deputy sheriff aforesaid as to the sale and payments of the purchase price of the aforesaid property were accepted and ratified by the Choctaw Nation.'\n All that portion of the deposition above quoted was objected to on the part of the defendants, and the objection was sustained, and that portion was stricken out under the exception of appellant.\n The appellant also put in evidence the act of the general council of the Choctaw Nation, entitled 'An Act Authorizing the Principal Chief to Employ Counsel,' approved October 30, 1895, the 1st section of which reads as follows:\n'Section 1. Be it enacted by the general council of the Choctaw Nation, assembled: That the sum of two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) is hereby appropriated out of any money in the national treasury not otherwise appropriated, and \n\n[204 U.S. 302, 306]\n\u00a0\n said sum to be placed to the credit of the principal chief, and to be by him used for and in behalf of the Choctaw Nation, in the employing of able and competent counsel to defend the interest of this nation in all suits now pending or that may hereafter come before the United States courts in any manner relative to the full and complete execution of the laws of the Choctaw Nation by the sheriffs of each and every county in the confiscation of property of noncitizens who are now occupying lands or buildings, or who may hereafter occupy, not in conformity to the laws of the Choctaw Nation.'\n\n Messrs. W. N. Redwine, Chester Howe, George R. Walker, Preslie B. Cole, and J. O. Poole for appellant.\n\n\n[204 U.S. 302, 308]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John W. McLoud and Charles B. Stuart for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice Peckham, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The circuit court of appeals decided but one question in this case, and that one related to the validity of the sale of the property by the sheriff on credit instead of for cash. In our opinion that question was rightly decided by the court when it held such sale absolutely void, and it is unnecessary for us to refer to or decide any other.\n The son of the deputy sheriff who conducted the sale bid off property worth $60,000 for $270, and gave his note for that amount, payable when possession was given him, or he, by some means, had otherwise obtained it. He has not yet obtained it, and the note has never been paid.\n The court of appeals held the sale void, as in violation of the statute under which the sheriff assumed to sell. The proceedings of the sheriff were under the act of the Choctaw legislature, approved October 30, 1888, referred to in the foregoing statement. By that act it was provided that the sheriffs of the counties in which the improvements were located should advertise the improvements for sale for thirty days, and should 'sell the same at the appointed time to the highest Choctaw citizen bidder for cash.'\n The sale was a clear violation of the provisions of the statute, under which alone there was authority to sell at all.\n The appellant answers this objection by stating that the parties consented to the sale for credit instead of cash. We find no evidence of such consent, so far as the coal company was concerned, or its receivers. The buildings were, as alleged by appellant, erected by the company or its receivers, although outside the right of way, and, therefore, as is claimed by appellant, they became forfeited to the Choctaw Nation. It is unnecessary to decide this question at present. But if the \n\n[204 U.S. 302, 309]\n\u00a0\n property were to be taken away from the company or its receivers, on the ground of the alleged forfeiture, they certainly had the right to demand that it should be taken from them pursuant to law, and not in open violation thereof. When a party whose only title to property depends upon its sale to him under a statute demands possession of such property from one who is in possession under a bona fide claim of right, the party making such demand must show some right to it, and this obligation he does not meet by showing that he purchased it under a sale which was in plain violation of the very statute under which the sale took place. Hockett v. Alston, 49 C. C. A. 180, 110 Fed. 910. The coal company or the receivers, therefore, had great interest in this property, as owners, until, at least, their title was devested upon a valid sale. They never consented to any sale on credit.\n The appellant asserts that the railroad or the receivers had forfeited the property by building outside the right of way, and hence they had no right to be heard as to the manner of sale, whether in violation of the statute or not. But, assuming the validity and applicability of the Indian statute, the title to the property did not become forfeited by the mere act of building. There must be at least some valid action looking towards the enforcement of the forfeiture. To assert that those who are in possession are intruders upon the land and have forfeited their property, and therefore are not entitled to be heard upon the question whether those who claim the property have complied with the law, is to say that one in possession and claiming to be the owner may be deprived of his property without due process of law. On the contrary, he is entitled to insist upon obedience to law by those who assume to take his property by reason of an alleged forfeiture. To insist upon a forfeiture the person who claims it must show some legal right to insist upon it. In case of a sovereign state or nation, its conclusion to insist upon a forfeiture for breach of a condition subsequent may be by legislation (Atlantic & P. R. Co. v. Mingus, \n165 \nU.S. 413, 431\n, 41 S. L. ed. 770, 777, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 348), and that legislation must be \n\n[204 U.S. 302, 310]\n\u00a0\n followed in asserting and enforcing the forfeiture by those acting for the state. So the owners of this property, even if it be liable to forfeiture, may nevertheless insist upon obedience to the statute by those assuming to act under it. Their consent to its violation is most essential. They did not become outlaws by building outside of the right of way.\n It is also urged on the part of the appellant that the act of the sheriff was ratified both by the principal chief and also by the council of the Nation. The only proof of the ratification by the principal chief ( even if he had power to ratify, which cannot be assumed) is given in the deposition of the appellant's intestate, referred to in the foregoing statement of facts. Therein the sheriff said that the chief ratified his action as to the sale and payments on the property, and instructed him to proceed at once to employ attorneys to assist him in getting possession of the property for the purchaser. The statement that the chief ratified his action was a mere conclusion of law. It gave no facts upon which such alleged ratification was based, and was clearly inadmissible as proof of ratification. The same witness had already testified that before the sale he was directed by the chief of the Choctaw Nation 'to proceed according to law to dispose of the buildings which had been built by the Choctaw Coal & Railway Company off of its right of way.' It would hardly be supposed that he would at once ratify a violation of law in the conduct of the sale. But the proof of ratification by the principal chief is totally insufficient, and is, as already said, a mere conclusion of law by the witness. And, as a separate and distinct reason, we find no proof of any power of the chief to ratify a violation of this act.\n Nor is the alleged ratification by the general council of the Choctaw Nation of any greater effect. This ratification consists in the passage by the general council of the act approved October 30, 1895, and already referred to. It appropriates the sum of $2,000, to be used by the principal chief in the employment of counsel for the purpose of defending the interest of the Nation in all suits pending or that may thereafter come \n\n[204 U.S. 302, 311]\n\u00a0\n before the United States courts, 'in any manner relative to the full and complete execution of the laws of the Choctaw Nation by the sheriffs of each and every county in the confiscation of property of noncitizens who are now occupying lands or buildings, or who may hereafter occupy, not in conformity with the laws of the Choctaw Nation.'\n Certainly there is nothing in that act which in any way ratifies, or purports to ratify, an illegal sale by a sheriff assuming to act under the law providing for sales by sheriffs, of buildings erected on land outside the right of way of the railroad company. It appropriates money to defend the Nation in suits relative to the full and complete execution of the laws, and nothing else; not a suspicion of any ratification of an illegal sale under those laws.\n The record shows a gross violation of the act under which the sale was made, and an entire absence of any evidence showing a ratification of such act either by the principal chief, assuming he could ratify, or by the council of the Nation. The case is not one in which any court would strive to find a way to uphold such a proceeding.\n Without going into the other questions which arise, it is sufficient to say that, upon the ground above discussed, the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is right.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","175":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWALLACE v.

Bleakmore for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n[204 U.S. 415, 417]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George A. Mansfield, J. F. McMurray, and Melven Cornish (by special leave) for Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations. \n\n[204 U.S. 415, 418]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n This was an action commenced in September, 1904, by \n\n[204 U.S. 415, 419]\n\u00a0\n Mrs. Ella Adams, for herself and her minor children, defendants in error, in the United States court for the southern district of the Indian territory, to recover possession of a tract of land in that territory. Defendants answered, and, upon trial, judgment was rendered in favor of plaintiffs. This judgment was sustained by the United States court of appeals of the Indian territory, and, on further appeal, reaffirmed by the United States circuit court of appeals for the eighth circuit. 143 Fed. 716.\n The case arises out of the legislation of Congress designed to secure the disintegration of the tribal organization of the Five Civilized Tribes in the Indian territory, and the distribution of the property of those tribes among the individual Indians. A full r esum e of this legislation and the general litigation following it is to be found in Stephens v. Cherokee Nation, \n174 U.S. 445\n, 43 L. ed. 1041, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 722, and a full statement of the facts in this case is to be found in the opinion of the United States circuit court of appeals. An entire restatement of these matters is, therefore, unnecessary.\n There is but a single matter to be determined. As counsel for plaintiffs in error say:\n'The assignment of errors presents but one question. If the decree of the Choctaw-Chickasaw citizenship court, in the test case known as the Riddle Case, vacated the decree that defendant, Hill, had, theretofore, procured in the United States court for the southern district of the Indian territory, wherein he was adjudged to be a member of the Choctaw tribe of Indians, this case should be affirmed. If it did not, it should be reversed.'\n\n To properly appreciate and rightly answer this single question some things in the history of the legislation and litigation and also some of the facts in this case must be noticed.\n In order to divide the lands of these Indian nations an enumeration of the individuals entitled thereto became necessary. By the act of March 3, 1893 (27 Stat. at L. 645, chap. 209,  16), the commission to the Five Civilized Tribes, generally known \n\n[204 U.S. 415, 420]\n\u00a0\n as the Dawes Commission, was empowered to negotiate and extinguish the tribal title to the lands and to make an allotment thereof to the members of the tribe in severalty. By that of June 10, 1896 (29 Stat. at L. 339, 340, chap. 398), the commission was authorized to hear the application and determine the right of each applicant for citizenship in either of these tribes. The act also granted an appeal to the proper United States district court in the Indian territory to any party aggrieved by the ruling of the commission, and declared that the judgment of that court should be final. It required the commission to make a complete roll of the citizens of each of the tribes, to be 'hereafter held and considered to be the true and correct rolls of persons entitled to the rights of citizenship in said several tribes.' Hill, who is the principal defendant, applied to be enrolled as a citizen of the Choctaw Nation, and his application was finally sustained by the court, and he was, on March 8, 1898, adjudged to be a member of the Choctaw tribe by blood and entitled to be enrolled as such. The land in controversy was selected and taken possession of by him in reliance upon this adjudication of citizenship. On July 1, 1898, Congress passed an act (30 Stat. at L. 591, chap. 545) granting to the tribes an appeal to the Supreme Court from the judgments of the United States courts of the Indian territory in citizenship cases. Under the authority of this act many of these cases were appealed to this court, which affirmed the judgments. Stephens v. Cherokee Nation, supra. On March 21, 1902, an agreement was made between the United States and the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations, which was confirmed by act of Congress July 1, 1902 (32 Stat. at L. 641, chap. 1362). This agreement and act were substantially that a court known as the Choctaw and Chickasaw citizenship court should be created, and that that court should have power, in a suit in equity brought by either or both of these tribes against any ten persons who had been admitted to citizenship or enrolment by the terms of the judgments of the several United States courts in the Indian territory, as representa- \n\n[204 U.S. 415, 421]\n\u00a0\n tives of all persons similarly situated, to determine whether the judgments of those courts should be annulled on account of certain alleged irregularities. The agreement and act also provided that, in case the citizenship courts should decide that those judgments should be annulled the papers in any action in those courts, wherein such a judgment had been rendered, should, upon seasonable application of either party, be transferred to the citizenship court, which should proceed to a hearing and determination of the question of citizenship. Under this agreement and act the court was established and test suit brought, in which a decree was entered to the effect that the judgments of the United States courts in the Indian territory, whereby persons were admitted to citizenship in the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations under the act of June 10, 1896, were annulled and vacated. Hill was not named a party in that test suit, nor did he thereafter apply for a transfer of his case to the citizenship court. The above statement of facts is sufficiently full for an understanding of the single question presented for determination.\n That single question may be divided into two. First, was the decree in the Indian territory court declaring Hill a citizen a finality, beyond the power of Congress to in any manner disturb? This was answered in the Stephens Case, supra. In that case we held that Congress could authorize a review of the judgments of the United States courts of the Indian territory in citizenship cases, and this although, by the terms of prior legislation, those judgments had become final. While sustaining the act authorizing such review and providing for appeals to this court, we construed it as limiting the appeals to the question of the constitutionality or validity of the legislation, and not as bringing before us the facts in the instances of all applications for citizenship. In the opinion (page 477, L. ed. page 1052, Sup. Ct. Rep. page 734) we said:\n'The contention is that the act of July 1, 1898, in extending the remedy by appeal to this court, was invalid because retrospective, an invasion of the judicial domain, and de- \n\n[204 U.S. 415, 422]\n\u00a0\n structive of vested rights. By its terms the act was to operate retrospectively, and as to that it may be observed that while the general rule is that statutes should be so construed as to give them only prospective operation, yet, where the language expresses a contrary intention in unequivocal terms, the mere fact that the legislation is retroactive does not necessarily render it void.\n\n'And while it is undoubtedly true that legislatures cannot set aside the judgments of courts, compel them to grant new trials, order the discharge of offenders, or direct what steps shall be taken in the progress of a judicial inquiry, the grant of a new remedy by way of review has been often sustained under particular circumstances. Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 1 L. ed. 648; Sampeyreac v. United States, 7 Pet. 222, 8 L. ed. 665; Freeborn v. Smith, 2 Wall. 160, 17 L. ed. 922; Garrison v. New York, 21 Wall. 196, 22 L. ed. 612; Freeland v. Williams, \n131 U.S. 405\n, 33 L. ed. 193, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 763; Essex Public Road Board v. Skinkle, \n140 U.S. 334\n, 35 L. ed. 446, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 790.\n\n'The United States court in Indian territory is a legislative court and was authorized to exercise jurisdiction in these citizenship cases as a part of the machinery devised by Congress in the discharge of its duties in respect of these Indian tribes; and, assuming that Congress possesses plenary power of legislation in regard to them, subject only to the Constitution of the United States, it follows that the validity of remedial legislation of this sort cannot be questioned unless in violation of some prohibition of that instrument.\n\n'In its enactment Congress has not attempted to interfere in any way with the judicial department of the government, nor can the act be properly regarded as destroying any vested right, since the right asserted to be vested is only the exemption of these judgments from review; and the mere expectation of a share in the public lands and moneys of these tribes, if hereafter distributed, if the applicants are admitted to citizenship, cannot be held to amount to such an absolute right of property that the original cause of action, which is citizenship or not, is placed by the judgment of a lower court \n\n[204 U.S. 415, 423]\n\u00a0\n beyond the power of re-examination by a higher court, though subsequently authorized by general law to exercise jurisdiction.'\n\n This decision established that no such vested right was created by the proceedings of the Dawes Commission or the judgments of the courts of the Indian territory on appeal from the findings of the commission as prevented subsequent investigation. The power of Congress over the matter of citizenship in these Indian tribes was plenary, and it could adopt any reasonable means to ascertain who were entitled to its privileges. If the result of one measure was not satisfactory it could try another. The fact that the first provision was by an inquiry in a territorial court did not exhaust the power of Congress or preclude further investigation. The functions of the territorial courts in this respect were but little more than those of a commission. While the act of July 1, 1898, provided for an appeal to this court, and appeals were taken in many cases, yet our inquiry stopped with the question of the constitutionality of the legislation. In other words, we entertained and decided the purely judicial question of the validity of the means Congress had adopted for determining the matter of citizenship. We did not attempt to pass upon the question of citizenship in any particular case, nor determine whether the applicant was or was not entitled to be enrolled as a citizen. It is unnecessary to consider what would have been the effect of a judgment of this court, a court provided for in the Constitution, on the question of the right of a litigant to citizenship. The distinction between this court and the courts established by act of Congress in virtue of its power to ordain and establish inferior courts is shown in Gordon v. United States, \n117 U.S. 697\n, Appx. in which we held that while Congress could give to the court of claims jurisdiction to inquire and report upon claims against the government, it could not authorize an appeal from such report to this court unless our decision was made a final judgment, not subject to congressional review. In the opinion Mr. Chief Justice Taney said (pp. 699, 702): \n\n[204 U.S. 415, 424]\n\u00a0\n 'Congress may undoubtedly establish tribunals with special powers to examine testimony and decide, in the first instance, upon the validity and justice of any claim for money against the United States, subject to the supervision and control of Congress, or a head of any of the executive departments. In this respect the authority of the court of claims is like to that of an auditor or comptroller, with this difference only: that in the latter case the appropriation is made in advance, upon estimates furnished by the different executive departments, of their probable expenses during the ensuing year; and the validity of the claim is decided by the officer appointed by law for that purpose, and the money paid out of the appropriation afterwards made. In the case before us the validity of the claim is to be first decided, and the appropriation made afterwards. But in principle there is no difference between these two special jurisdictions created by acts of Congress for special purposes, and neither of them possesses judicial power in the sense in which those words are used in the Constitution. The circumstance that one is called a court and its decisions called judgments cannot alter its character nor enlarge its power. . . . Congress cannot extend the appellate power of this court beyond the limits prescribed by the Constitution, and can neither confer nor impose on it the authority or duty of hearing and determining an appeal from a commissioner or auditor, or any other tribunal exercising only special powers under an act of Congress; nor can Congress authorize or require this court to express an opinion on a case where its judicial power could not be exercised, and where its judgment would not be final and conclusive upon the rights of the parties, and process of execution awarded to carry it into effect.'\n This decree was followed by legislation which, in a general way, provided that the rulings of this court on appeals from the judgments of the court of claims should be in effect judgments. While that case is not entirely parallel to this, yet the line of thought pursued in the opinion is suggestive. \n\n[204 U.S. 415, 425]\n\u00a0\n We do not feel called upon to enlarge upon it. It is enough now to hold that Congress, in giving to the Indian territory courts jurisdiction of appeals from the action of the Dawes Commission, did not place the decisions of these courts beyond the reach of further investigation. Hence the act of Congress of July 1, 1902, creating the Choctaw and Chickasaw citizenship court, and giving to it power to examine the judgments of the Indian territory courts, and determine whether they should not be annulled on account of irregularities, was a valid exercise of power.\n The other question is one of procedure, and not of power. It is objected that the defendant Hill was not made a party to the proceeding instituted in the citizenship court, but there were a multitude, according to the report of the Dawes Commission, probably one thousand, in whose favor judgments of citizenship have been entered in the Indian territory courts, and the act provided that ten should be selected as representatives of the class. It further authorized any individual, in case of an adverse judgment by the citizenship court, to transfer his case from the territorial to that court. Now, it is undoubtedly within the power of a court of equity to name as defendants a few individuals who are in fact the representatives of a large class having a common interest or a common right,-a class too large to be all conveniently brought into court,- and make the decree effective not merely upon those individuals, but also upon the class represented by them. Mandeville v. Riggs, 2 Pet. 482, 7 L. ed. 493; Smith v. Swormstedt, 16 How. 288, 14 L. ed. 942; Bacon v. Robertson, 18 How. 480, 489, 15 L. ed. 499, 504; United States v. Old Settlers, \n148 \nU.S. 427, 480\n, 37 S. L. ed. 509, 529, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 650. It was by way of extra precaution, and in order to more effectually secure the rights of the individuals other than those named as parties defendant in that suit, that Congress provided that anyone might transfer his individual case from the territorial court to the citizenship court, and there have the merits of his claim decided. Hill, as every other citizen, was bound to take notice of the legislation of Congress, and it is not to be doubted that he, as \n\n[204 U.S. 415, 426]\n\u00a0\n well as others similarly situated, was cognizant of the proceedings that were being had in pursuance of such legislation. He made no application to transfer his case, but chose to abide by the outcome of the case against the ten representatives of his class. The answers to these subordinate questions fully dispose of the main question. Without further discussion, we refer to the exhaustive opinion of Circuit Judge Sanborn, in delivering the judgment of the court of appeals, with which, in the main, we fully concur.\n We find no error in the record, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","176":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWATER, LIGHT & GAS CO. OF HUTCHINSON, KAN. v. CITY OF HUTCHINSON(1907)\nNo. 53\nArgued: November 13, 1907Decided: December 23, 1907\n\n\n\n The ultimate question in these cases is the validity of ordinance No. 402 of the city of Hutchinson, which took effect March 17, 1897, and by which the Water, Light, & Gas Company claims to have, for the period of twenty years from such date, the exclusive right and privilege of supplying the city and its inhabitants with water, and with light, heat, and power by means of electricity and gas.\n On the 19th of December, 1905, the city enacted and published ordinance No. 651, granting permits to Emerson Carey and others, their successors and assigns, to construct and operate a street railway in and along the streets of the city, and to construct and operate electric and gas plants for the purposes for which electricity may be used.\n These suits were brought to command the city and those claiming under ordinance No. 651, to 'desist from doing any \n\n[207 U.S. 385, 386]\n\u00a0\n acts or exercising any pretenses of right to act' under the ordinance which will in anywise affect the exclusive right of the Water, Light, & Gas Company 'to furnish the city and its inhabitants with electric or gas light for lighting and heating purposes or power, except for street cars and electric railways, and also from making or proceeding to make any contract for furnishing light or gas to said city and its inhabitants' until the expiration of the 'franchises and contracts' of that company.\n The cases went off on demurrers to the bills. The circuit court, assuming that ordinance No. 402 was exclusive in its terms and was intended to be so by the city, held that the city did not possess the power, either inherent or under the law of its creation, to make a contract binding and exclusive of all others, and entered decrees dismissing the bills. 144 Fed. 256.\n The facts are: In 1885 the city granted to the Holly Manufacturing Company, its successors and assigns, an exclusive right to build and operate waterworks for twenty years. The company erected and operated the works until the subsequent assignment of its rights.\n In the same year the city granted to the Interstate Gas Company the right to erect and maintain gas works for the period of twenty-one years; and in 1886 granted to Drake and Orton the right for the period of twenty years to construct and operate an electric light plant. The latter right, and those granted to the two companies, passed by successive assignments, with the knowledge and consent of the city, to the Water, Light, & Power Company, and existed in that company at the time of the passage of ordinance No. 402.\n The various companies expended in the aggregate on the construction of their plants and equipment $400,000, to secoure which the Hutchinson Water, Light, & Power Company executed a mortgage upon all the water, light, and gas rights and franchises and properties.\n Subsequently, the city became financially embarrassed, so \n\n[207 U.S. 385, 387]\n\u00a0\n that before the year 1897 it had become indebted for hydrant rentals in the sum of $12,800 in excess of its ability to pay.\n On account of this default of the city the company became embarrassed and hindered in the payment of interest on its mortgage, and its mortgage bondholders took possession of its property, and operated the plant during the year 1896 and until the readjustment of its affairs in the spring of 1897, resulting in the passage of ordinance No. 402.\n By reason of its embarrassment the company found it expedient to scale down its bonded indebtedness and secure a new franchise from the city, and in ocnsideration of securing the same, and the readjustment of the contract obligations between the company and the city, the bondholders agreed to reduce and scale down their mortgage indebtedness from $400,000 to $212,500.\n On March 5, 1897, at the earnest and repeated solicitation of the city, and in consideration of its inability to discharge its past indebtedness to the company and to pay the current indebtedness thereafter, the company agreed with the city to remit one half of the indebtedness then due; that is, to scale it down to $6,400, and to reduce the sum thereafter annually payable for hydrant rental from $12,800 to $6,000 for the years of the contract, and to reduce the rental for hydrants thereafter located from $60 to $36, and reduce the number of hydrants from twelve to ten per mile. These concessions and abatements were made on the condition of a renewal and extension of the franchise and contract rights of the company. And the city was to have, what it did not have before, the right to purchase or otherwise acquire the light and gas properties at any time after ten years from the date of the renewal and adjustment. In view of these considerations and in pursuance of them the city passed ordinance No. 402, to take effect March 17, 1897, and by that ordinance 'granted to the company, its successors and assigns, for the period of twenty years from said date, the exclusive privilege of supplying the city and its inhabitants with the public utilities of \n\n[207 U.S. 385, 388]\n\u00a0\n water, light, heat, and power by means of electric current and gas.' But it was agreed that the right for furnishing electric current or power should not be exclusive as to or for the operation of street railways, nor exclusive as to any person residing in the city, or any company doing business therein manufacturing gas or electricity for his or its own use for light or fuel. A copy of the ordinance was attached to and made part of the bill. The concessions and abatements would not have been made by the company except for the consideration of the exclusive rights and privileges granted; and the total of the reductions of monetary demands made for what was due and to become due for the period the water franchise had to run amounted to $65,240, which the company remitted from its contract rights and demands against the city. The mortgage bondholders of the Water, Light, & Power Company, for the purpose of effectuating the promises and agreements between the company and the city contained in ordinance No. 402, scaled down their indebtedness from $400,000 to $212, 500, and canceled their mortgage, and accepted a substitute mortgage on the property, franchise, and contracts and on its income of $212,500.\n The Water, Light, & Power Company, on the 4th of October, 1902, sold and transferred to the Water, Light, & Gas Company, the complainant, all of its property rights and franchise, and complainant has since that date been in possession of the same, and in the fulfilment of the duties and obligations imposed on it by its purchase and said ordinance liabilities with the consent of the city, and the city has ratified and approved the same, and contracted and dealt with the complainant as the successor of the Water, Light, & Power Company. The Water, Light, & Gas Company has, since its purchase, expended large sums of money in the improvement and enlargement of its properties and the service rendered by it, and has, under the direction and order of the city, extended its water mains and placed hydrants upon such extensions, and, as agreed by it, has reduced the number of hydrants on \n\n[207 U.S. 385, 389]\n\u00a0\n its extended mains from twelve to ten per mile, and generally has complied with the orders and requests of the city, whether or not under the ordinance No. 402 it was required to comply with such orders, all of which was done in reliance on the obligations of the city and its good faith in carrying out all the terms and conditions and provisions of ordinance No. 402; but the city, notwithstanding, through its mayor and councilmen, on or about the 19th of December, 1905, enacted and published ordinance No. 651, by which it assumed to grant to Emerson Cary and others the right and privilege, for the term of twenty years thereafter, of establishing and operating in the city a plant and appliances for the manufacture and sale to the city and its inhabitants of electric light and power and manufactured factured and natural gas, with the right and privilege to lay and construct gas mains and pipes and erect poles and wires and all other things necessary to the maintenance of said public service in the streets, alleys, and public places of the city, in opposition to the business of complainant.\n It is alleged that ordinance No. 402 constitutes a contract between the city and the complainant in respect to all the rights secured, and in particular in respect to the exclusive rights and privileges thereby conferred, and that the city, by and through ordinance No. 651, illegally and inequitably impairs the same, in violation of the provisions of the Constitution of the United States, which forbids the impairment of the obligation of contracts by the several states of the Union.\n Neither the city nor any of the grantees in ordinance No. 651 have paid or tendered complainant the monetary abatement, or the reductions and concessions paid or secured to the city in consideration of the enactment of ordinance No. 402, or to secure complainant from loss from the competition of the rival public service association or company. At the time the public service enterprises were undertaken by the grantors of complainant the city of Hutchinson had about 5,000 inhabitants, and, at the time complainant succeeded to their rights, about 10,000; and at both of said times it would have been \n\n[207 U.S. 385, 390]\n\u00a0\n impossible, and is now impossible, to maintain rival or competing companies in the city so as to enable either to earn a fair and reasonable income on the cost of their respective properties, and at none of the times when the complainant or its grantors undertook the work of furnishing said public necessities would it or they have done so without being secured in the enforcement thereof for a reasonable time against the competition of rival companies, nor could the large sums of money have been obtained therefor except under like security. The company has not, up to this time, and will not for many years to come, have secured the repayment of the purchase price of said public service and the cost of the betterments, extensions, and improvements.\n The company alleges that it does not seek to prevent the granting by the city of a franchise or contract for the erection and maintenance of an electric railway in the city or elsewhere.\n An injunction was prayed against the doing or exercising any pretenses of right under ordinance No. 651 which would in any way affect the exclusive rights of the company to furnish electricity and gas for lighting and heating purposes.\n Messrs. John F. Dillon, Frank Doster, Harry Hubbard, Houston Whiteside, and Howard S. Lewis for appellant.\n\n\n[207 U.S. 385, 392]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Max Pam, C. M. Williams, A. C. Malloy, and F. F. Prigg for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n The circuit court assumed that ordinance No. 402 was in terms exclusive and was intended to be made so by the city. We shall assume the same thing. Indeed, it would be impossible to decide otherwise. It recites that the Hutchinson Water, Light, & Power Company 'is the owner of certain exclusive franchises and contracts with the city of Hutchinson,' under which it has expended large sums of money, and that the city 'is desirous of modifying and changing said franchise and contracts to the advantage of said city of Hutchinson, without canceling or abridging any of the rights or privileges vested in said company,' and that, therefore, in consideration of the surrender of all existing contracts and franchises, except as therein specified, 'there is hereby given and granted' to the company, 'its successors or assigns, the exclusive right and privileges for the term of twenty years from the date of the passage and approval of this ordinance, of \n\n[207 U.S. 385, 393]\n\u00a0\n supplying the city of Hutchinson, Reno county, Kansas, and the inhabitants thereof, by a system of waterworks, with water . . . with electric current for electric light and power, and for all other purposes for which electric current may be used, except power for the operation of street railways.' The city, it is clear, in express terms and for consideration received, granted exclusive rights. The power of the city to do this is denied, and this makes the question in the case. The circuit court ruled against the existence of the power, applying to the statutes conferring power upon the municipalities of the state the rule of strict construction. The ruling is challenged by appellants, and it is contended that the general welfare clause and 'the municipal power to furnish light carries with it the obligation to enter into all contracts and to exercise all subsidiary powers which the circumstances of the case require.' And it is further contended that, in Kansas, statutes delegating to cities the power to furnish light and water have been liberally construed by the supreme court of the state.\n That grants to municipal corporations, like grants to private corporations, are subject to the rule of strict construction, was announced by this court in Detroit Citizens' Street R. Co. v. Detroit R. Co. \n171 U.S. 48\n, 43 L. ed. 67, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 732, following and applying the doctrine of previous cases. It was said that the power to grant an exclusive privilege must be expressly given, or, if inferred from other powers, must be indispensable to them, and that this principle was firmly fixed by authority. See also Dill. Mun Corp. 4th ed.  80. The case was concerned with a grant to a street railway, and, in the argument of the cases at bar, a distinction is asserted between an exclusive privilege to occupy the surface of streets and interfere with 'a matter of common and a privilege to use the streets below the surface 'as incidental only and subsidiary to the performance of a contract pertaining to another matter;' and on this distinction, it is argued, the 'first must show an express grant of authority' to make the right exclusive, \n\n[207 U.S. 385, 394]\n\u00a0\n but that the second is not limited by such requirement. The distinction is only one of degree, and has not been considered as varying the application of the rule of construction announced. In Freeport Water Co. v. Freeport, \n180 U.S. 598\n, 45 L. ed. 688, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 497, a statute of Illinois was considered which gave power to cities and villages to provide for the supply of water at such rates as might be fixed by ordinance and for a period not exceeding thirty years. And passing upon these provisions as constituting a contract precluding a change of rates from time to time, we said: 'The rule which governs interpretation in such cases has often been declared. We expressed it, following many prior decisions, in Detroit Citizens' Street R. Co. v. Detroit R. Co. supra, to be that the power of a municipal corporation to grant exclusive privileges must be conferred by explicit terms. If inferred from other powers, it is not enough that the power is convenient to other powers; it must be indispensable to them.' See also Rogers Park Water Co. v. Fergus, \n180 U.S. 624\n, 45 L. ed. 702, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 490; Joplin v. Southwest Missouri Light Co. \n191 U.S. 150\n, 48 L. ed. 127, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 43, and cases cited; Owensboro v. Owensboro Waterworks Co. \n191 U.S. 358\n, 48 L. ed. 217, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 82. The doctrine was recognized as existing in Walla Walla v. Walla Walla Water Co. \n172 U.S. 1\n, 43 L. ed. 341, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 77, and in Vicksburg v. Vicksburg Waterworks Co. \n202 U.S. 453\n, 50 L. ed. 1102, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 660. In the two latter cases the power of the respective cities to make a contract precluding them from building waterworks and operating their own water systems was declared. In the Vicksburg case it was pointed out that the power of the city to exclude itself from building waterworks of its own was recognized to exist by the supreme court of Mississippi.\n In Vicksburg v. Vicksburg Waterworks Co. \n206 U.S. 496\n, 51 L. ed. 1155, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 762, a contract of the city, fixing a maximum rate, was sustained upon the authority of the decisions of the supreme court of the state, holding that, under a broad grant of power conferring, without restriction or limitation upon the city, the right to make a contract for a supply of the water, it was within the right of the city council, in the exercise of that power, to make a binding contract fixing the maximum rate at which the water \n\n[207 U.S. 385, 395]\n\u00a0\n should be supplied to the inhabitants of the city for a limited term of years.\n This case is especially relied on by appellant as establishing a right in the city of Hutchinson to grant an exclusive franchise under the statutes of the state, both from their letter and as construed by the supreme court of the state. A consideration of the statutes and decisions, therefore, becomes necessary. Those quoted by the circuit court in its opinion are inserted in the margin. They confer power to provide for the general welfare, and enable a city to construct water and lighting plants of its own or 'to make contracts with any person or company for such purposes,' and give such person or company 'the privilege of furnishing light for the streets, lanes, or alleys of said city for any length of time not exceeding twentyone years.'\n In addition to these sections, appellant cites others, which give to the city the power to make all contracts in relation to its property and affairs necessary to the exercise of its corporate \n\n[207 U.S. 385, 396]\n\u00a0\n or administrative powers, the power to open and improve streets, purchase or condemn land for hospital and waterworks, to make regulations to secure the general health of the city, to enact ordinances for any of the above- mentioned purposes, and 'for maintaining the peace, good government, and welfare of the city, and its trade and commerce.' Also a section which gives to gas and water companies the power to manufacture and furnish gas and water and to lay down pipes and mains in the streets 'with the consent of the municipal authorities thereof and under such regulations as may be prescribed,' and a section giving power to such authorities 'to contract with any such corporation for the lighting or supplying with water the streets, lots, lanes, squares, and public places in any such city, town, or village.'\n It is from these provisions that the water company deduces the power of the city to make the privileges granted exclusive, and special stress is put upon the provision of  65, which we have quoted. Counsel say: Language more explicitly expressing an absolute measure of power could hardly be framed. The power is given to light the streets, to make contracts for the lighting of the streets, and to confer the privilege of lighting the streets for a specific term of years.' And, further counsel say: 'It will be observed that the grant of power is to confer 'the privilege of furnishing light.' The definite article 'the' is used. Power to confer the privilege implies ex vi termini, the exclusive privilege, not a fractional or communal privilege. The privilege conferred exists as a concrete and integral whole, and therefore when conferred must pass in its entirety. The city possessed the privilege of lighting its own streets as a function of its municipal authority. It was that privilege in its integral and exclusive form which the legislature authorized the city to confer.' We cannot concur. The kind of privilege is defined, not the extent of it. It is exclusive of some persons, but not of all. It is exclusive of those who have not a grant from proper authority. There are privileges which may exist in their full entirety in more than one person, and the privilege \n\n[207 U.S. 385, 397]\n\u00a0\n or franchise or right to supply the inhabitants of a city with light or water is of this kind. A grant of power to confer such privilege is not necessarily a grant of power to make it exclusive. To hold otherwise would impugn the cited cases and their reasoning. It would destroy the rule of strict construction. The foundation of that rule requires the grant of such power to be explicit-explicit in the letter of the grant-or, if inferred ferred from other powers or purposes, to be not only convenient to them, but indispensable to them. And these conditions are imperative,- too firm of authority to be disregarded upon the petition of equities, however strong.\n It is, however, contended that the statutes of Kansas fulfil the rule by the construction put upon them by the supreme court of the state, and the case is therefore brought, it is further contended, within the rule of Vicksburg v. Vicksburg Waterworks Co. \n206 U.S. 496\n, 51 L. ed. 1155, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 762. The Kansas cases relied on are Eureka Light & Ice Co. v. Eureka, 5 Kan. App. 669, 48 Pac. 935; State v. Topeka, 68 Kan. 177, 74 Pac. 647; Cherryvale Water Co. v. Cherryvale, 65 Kan. 219, 69 Pac. 176. In those cases the court did say, in determining what duties were imposed or powers conferred upon the city, that the statute should be liberally construed to effectuate the general purpose of the legislature, but the powers under consideration were different from the powers herein involved, otherwise those cases would not be reconcilable with Paine v. Spratley, 5 Kan. 545, and Coffeyville Min. & Gas Co. v. Citizens' Natural Gas & Min. Co. 55 Kan. 178, 40 Pac. 326. In Paine v. Spratley the general principles respecting the power of municipal corporations were said to be those which we have expressed. In Coffeyville Min. & Gas Co. v. Citizens' Natural Gas & Min. Co. one of the companies, claiming an exclusive right, sought to test the validity of two city ordinances, granting the other the use of the streets, and to restrict it from using the privileges granted. For this purpose the court said the plaintiff company clearly had no standing in court, because the city authorities alone were charged with the duty of preventing encroachment on the \n\n[207 U.S. 385, 398]\n\u00a0\n streets, and they, alone, could test the validity of the ordinance. The court said further: 'The city did not, in terms, attempt to give the plaintiff company a right to the exclusive use of the streets and alleys for the purpose of laying its pipes. If it had attempted to do so it could not, for want of power.'\n The conclusion from these cases is reinforced by a change in the statutes conferring power upon the cities of the state. Section 65, supra, was  30 of the statutes of 1868, and as such gave to a city the power to make the contracts therein expressed, and give 'the exclusive privilege of furnishing gas to light the streets, lanes, and alleys of said city for any length of time, not exceeding twenty-one years.' This provision was repeated in  59 of the statutes of 1872. But in 1885 that section was amended, so as to omit the words 'the exclusive privilege.' Statutes 1885, p. 147,  7. And as thus amended it was re-enacted in 1901. Statutes 1901 ,  1000\n\n\n Decrees affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n Sec. 35.

CASSATT(1907)\nNo. 283\nArgued: Decided: December 2, 1907\n\n\n\n The Webster coal & Coke Company commenced an action at law in the circuit court of the United States for the eastern district of Pennsylvania against the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, defendant, to recover damages for its alleged violation of the interstate commerce act of February 4, 1887 [24 Stat. at L. 379, chap. 104, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3154], by discriminating against plaintiff in the allowance of freight rates on coal and coke. The defendant pleaded not guilty. \n\n[207 U.S. 181, 182]\n\u00a0\n In the opinion below it is stated:\n'After issue was thus joined, and before the time for the trial of the action, the plaintiff filed in the circuit court a petition in which, after setting forth the nature of the action at law, and declaring that the defendant and Alexander J. Cassatt, president, John B. Thayer, fourth vice president, and ten other specifically-named officers and employees of the defendant, had in their possession or power certain books and papers containing evidence pertinent to the issue, there was a prayer for an order requiring the defendant and its said officers and employees to produce said books and papers at the trial, and also for inspection by the plaintiff's representatives before trial. The application for the order was based on  724 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 583 ), which is as follows:\n\n\"In the trial of actions at law, the courts of the United States may, on motion and due notice thereof, require the parties to produce books or writings in their possession or power which contain evidence pertinent to the issue, in cases and under circumstances where they might be compelled to produce the same by the ordinary rules of proceeding in chancery. If a plaintiff fails to comply with such order, the court may, on motion, give the like judgment for the defendant as in cases of nonsuit; and, if a defendant fails to comply with such order, the court may, on motion, give judgment against him by default.'\n\n'On presentation of the petition to the circuit court, a rule was allowed requiring the defendant and its officers and employees named in the petition to show cause before the court on a certain day why they 'should not produce on the trial of this cause' the books and writings above referred to; and also why they should not produce them at a certain time and place before trial 'and permit the plaintiff, its counsel and accountants, to inspect the same and take such copies as they may deem proper.' The defendant answered the petition, setting forth (1) that the action was for the recovery of damages in the nature of penalties, and therefore that the defendant \n\n[207 U.S. 181, 183]\n\u00a0\n was not obliged to produce its books and papers, either before or at the trial; (2) that even if the action were one in which the defendant could be required to produce its books and papers at the trial, it could not be required to do so before the trial; (3) that the petition did not describe with sufficient particularity the books and papers the production of which was desired, or state the facts which the books and papers would tend to prove; and (4) that the defendant could not produce any books which would show the rebates and drawbacks alleged to have been allowed to other companies, because they had not been so kept as to show any such allowances. With the petition and answer before it, the circuit court, on the return of the rule to show cause, 'adjudged, ordered, and decreed' that Alexander J. Cassatt, president, John B. Thayer, fourth vice president, and the ten other officers and employees of the defendant, 'produce on the trial of this cause' the books and papers described in the petition, and also that they produce them before trial at a specified time and place for the inspection of the plaintiff, with leave to the plaintiff to make copies thereof.'\n\n To review this order, Cassatt and the other officers and agents of the Pennsylvania company sued out, as individuals, a writ of error from the circuit court of appeals for the third circuit, assigning as error (1) that the circuit court erred in entering the order requiring plaintiffs in error to submit to the inspection of the plaintiff below and its counsel, prior to the trial of the cause, the books, records, and papers referred to therein; and (2) requiring the production at the trial of said books, records, and papers. The case was heard, together with two similar cases, one of which was entitled Pennsylvania Coal & Coke Co. v. Cassatt, and is numbered 284 on the present docket. [\n207 U.S. 187\n, 52 L. ed. --, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 110.]\n The circuit court of appeals gave an opinion in one case applicable to the three, and reversed the judgments of the circuit court with costs. 10 L.R.A.(N.S.) 99, 150 Fed. 32, 48. That court held that the order in question was a 'final decision' within in \n\n[207 U.S. 181, 184]\n\u00a0\n  6 of the judiciary act of March 3, 1891 [26 Stat. at L. 828, chap. 517, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 549]; that the proceeding which resulted in the order was independent of and collateral to the main action, and the order therefore reviewable on a writ of error; that the corporation's officers and agents were not 'parties' within Revised Statutes,  724; that that section did not authorize an order requiring a party to produce books and papers before trial, but, if such relief was desired, it must be obtained by a bill of discovery. The present cause was then brought to this court on certiorari, and is numbered 283 on its docket. It was advanced for hearing and heard October 28, 29, together with No. 284, also brought up on certiorari.\n Messrs. John W. Grigges, Benjamin S. Harmon, David L. Krebs, and George S. Graham for petitioner.\n\n\n[207 U.S. 181, 185]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John G. Johnson and Francis I. Gowen for respondents.\n\n\n\n[207 U.S. 181, 186]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice Fuller delivered the opinion of the court:\n The Pennsylvania Railroad Company did not except to the order, nor attempt to prosecute a writ of error therefrom, if that were possible; the plaintiffs in error, who were officers of the company, excepted and carried the case up on this writ of error. They were not parties to the case between the coal company and the railroad company, had no property in the books and papers referred to, were mere custodians as officers, and any rights of theirs were not made to appear to be involved in the disclosures sought. The order as to them was purely interlocutory, not imposing penalty or liability, and not finally disposing of an independent proceeding.\n What Mr. Justice Bradley said in Williams v. Morgan, \n111 \nU.S. 684, 698\n, 28 S. L. ed. 559, 564, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 638, in holding a decree on intervention appealable, and citing many cases, was that the order appealed from there 'was final in its nature, and was made in a matter distinct from the general subject of litigation,-a matter by itself, which affected only the parties to the particular controversy, and those whom they represented.'\n This order affected the plaintiff and defendant in the case itself, and not respondents as individuals at all, and, if the court had power to punish disobedience or enforce compliance, \n\n[207 U.S. 181, 187]\n\u00a0\n then the order prior to such action on the part of the court was clearly interlocutory in the suit. Alexander v. United States, \n210 U.S. 117\n, 50 L. ed. 686, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 356. If the provision of  724 in respect of disobedience of such an order was exclusive, then, of course, respondents were in no way aggrieved. Doyle v. London Guarantee & Acci. Co. \n204 U.S. 599\n, 51 L. ed. 641, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 313.\n Whether the order to produce was valid. and whether it warranted judgment by default against the defendant company, were matters in which plaintiffs in error had no concern. There was here no attachment for contempt, no judgment on default, and no independent and collateral proceeding, the order disposing of which could be considered as a final decree.\n Judgment reversed and cause remanded with a direction to dismiss the writ of error. \n\n\n\n","178":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWERCKMEISTER v.

Werckmeister, decided December 2, 1907, \n207 U.S. 284\n, 52 L. ed. --, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 72.\n The present action was brought to recover, under  4965 of the copyright act (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3414), the penalties of $10 each, for 1,196 sheets of the alleged infringing publications claimed to have been found in the defendant's possession and seized by the United States marshals, under the two writs of replevin described in that suit.\n Plaintiff in error, Werckmeister, offered in evidence the judgment roll in the former suit, with the pleadings and judgment, and also offered in evidence the writs and returns of the marshals for the southern and western districts of New York, respectively, showing seizures of 203 copies and 993 copies; the court excluded these writs as immaterial. No other evidence being offered, the court instructed the jury to render a verdict for the defendant, and judgment was afterwards rendered accordingly upon the verdict. 138 Fed. 162. On writ of error to the circuit court of appeals the judgment below was affirmed (74 C. C. A. 682, 144 Fed. 1023), and this writ of error is prosecuted to reverse the judgment of the circuit court of appeals.\n This action requires the construction of  4965, Rev. Stat. as amended (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3414), which is as follows:\n'Sec. 4965. If any person, after the recording of the title of any map, chart, dramatic, or musical composition, print, cut, engraving, or photograph, or chromo, or of the description of any painting, drawing, statue, statuary, or model or design intended to be perfected and executed as a work of the fine arts, as provided by this act, shall, within the term limited, contrary to the provisions of this act, and without the consent of the proprietor of the copyright first obtained in writing, signed in presence of two or more witnesses, engrave, etch, \n\n[207 U.S. 375, 380]\n\u00a0\n work, copy, print, publish, dramatize, translate, or import, either in whole or in part, or by varying the main design, with intent to evade the law, or, knowing the same to be so printed, published, dramatized, translated, or imported, shall sell or expose to sale any copy of such map or other article, as aforesaid, he shall forfeit to the proprietor all the plates on which the same shall be copied, and every sheet thereof, either copied or printed, and shall further forfeit one dollar for every sheet of the same found in his possession, either printing, printed, copied, published, imported, or exposed for sale; and in case of a painting, statue, or statuary, he shall forfeit ten dollars for every copy of the same in his possession, or by him sold or exposed for sale: Provided, however, That in case of any such infringement of the copyright of a photograph made from any object not a work of fine arts, the sum to be recovered in any action brought under the provisions of this section shall be not less than one hundred dollars, nor more than five thousand dollars: And, provided further, that in case of any such infringement of the copyright of a painting, drawing, statue, engraving, etching, print, or model or design for a work of the fine arts or of a photograph of a work of the fine arts, the sum to be recovered in any action brought through the provisions of this section shall be not less than two hundred and fifty dollars, and not more than ten thousand dollars. One half of all the foregoing penalties shall go to the proprietors of the copyright and the other half to the use of the United States.'\n\n As with the sections of the copyright act under consideration in American Tobacco Co. v. Werckmeister, supra, this section has been the subject of consideration in the Federal courts, with different conclusions as to its purport and meaning. While the statute provides for the forfeiture of the plates and sheets and for the sum of $10 in case of a painting, for every copy found in the offending person's possession or sold by him, it is silent as to the kind of action to be brought, and we are left to discover the meaning of the act in this respect from a consideration of the \n\n[207 U.S. 375, 381]\n\u00a0\n language used, read in the light of the objects and purposes to be effected.\n Obviously the statute does not provide a proceeding in rem, as is sometimes done in the revenue laws, for the act is leveled against any person who shall, contrary to its provisions, without consent, etc., engrave, work, copy, print, etc., forfeit to the proprietor the plates and sheets and a sum of money for each sheet, etc., found in his possession. This section of the statute is penal, and there should be especial care to work no extension of its provisions by construction. Statutory provisions similar to those above cited have been the subject of consideration in a number of cases in this court. In Backus v. Gould, 7 How. 798, 12 L. ed. 919, it was held that there could be no recovery for publishing sheets, copyright matter, etc., unless the same were found in the possession of the defendant. In Stevens v. Cady, 2 Curt. 200, Fed. Cas. No. 13,395, Mr. Justice Curtis, sitting at the circuit, held there could be no accounting for the penalties in an action in equity, and that the proprietor of the copyright was left by the act to his remedy at law by trover or replevin. In Thornton v. Schreiber, \n124 U.S. 612\n, 31 L. ed. 577, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 618, it was held that action would not lie against Thornton, who was the business manager of Sharpless & Son, of Philadelphia, in whose store the prints in question in that case were found, and, in speaking for the court, Mr. Justice Miller, who delivered the opinion in that case, said (p. 620):\n'Counsel for defendants in error, Schreiber & Sons, insist that the words 'found in his possession' are to be construed as referring to the finding of the jury; that the expression means simply that where the sheets are ascertained by the finding of the jury to have been at any time in the possession of the person who committed the wrongful act, such person shall forfeit $1 for each sheet so ascertained to have been in his possession. We, however, think that the word 'found' means that there must be a time before the cause of action accrues at which they are found in the possession of the defendant.'\n\n This language was held in Falk v. Curtis Pub. Co. 102 Fed. \n\n[207 U.S. 375, 382]\n\u00a0\n 967-971, affirmed by the circuit court of appeals for the third circuit in 46 C. C. A. 201, 107 Fed. 128, to mean that before the action for the penalty would lie there must be a finding of the articles in the possession of the defendant by means of a proceeding instituted for the express purpose of condemnation and forfeiture, and that an action of assumpsit brought at the same time with the action of replevin was premature.\n In the case of Bolles v. Outing Co. 46 L.R.A. 712, 23 C. C. A. 594, 45 U. S. App. 449, 77 Fed. 966, Judge Wallace, who spoke for the court of appeals in that case, said (p. 968):\n'The statute is apparently framed to give the party whose copyright has been invaded complete relief by an action in which he can procure a condemnation of the infringing sheets, and at the same time recover, by way of compensation, a penalty for every sheet which he is entitled to condemn. The words 'found in his possession' aptly refer to a finding for the purposes of forfeiture and condemnation. The remedy by condemnation and forfeiture is only appropriate in a case where the property can be seized upon process; and where, as here, the forfeiture declared is against property of the 'offender,' it is only appropriate when it can be seized in his hands. The section contemplates two remedies, enforceable in a single suit, each of which depends upon the same state of facts. The aggrieved party may, at his election, pursue either one or both remedies. But it does not contemplate a recovery of penalties, except in respect to the sheets which can be condemned.'\n\n And in Bolles v. Outing Co. \n175 U.S. 262\n-266, 44 L. ed. 156-158, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 94, 95, this court, speaking by Mr. Justice Brown, observed:\n'No remedy is provided by the act, although by  4970 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3416), a bill in equity will lie for an injunction, but the provision for a forfeiture of the plates and of the copies seems to contemplate an action in the nature of replevin for their seizure, and in addition to the confiscation of the copies, for a recovery of $1 for every copy so seized or found in the possession of the defendant.' \n\n[207 U.S. 375, 383]\n\u00a0\n And in that case the view expressed in the circuit court of appeals for the second circuit was approved (\n175 U.S. 268\n); and while the point was not necessarily involved, we think the indication in Bolles v. Outing Co., that a single action in the nature of replevin for the recovery of plates and copies and a penalty for copies found, is correct.\n\n We agree with the circuit court of appeals for the second circuit that the language in Thornton v. Schreiber, above quoted, was not intended to indicate that an action declaring the forfeiture was required by the statute before the adjudication of the articles to the plaintiff as is generally necessary in actions of forfeiture (Cooley, Const. Lim. 518), but that the true construction of the statute, and the one intended to be indicated by Mr. Justice Miller, is that before the penalty can be recovered it is necessary that the sheets be actually found in the possession of the defendant. As we have said, this section of the statute is highly penal (Bolles v. Outing Co. supra), and there is nothing in its terms to indicate that the offender is to be subjected to more than one action; on the contrary, the provisions of the section seem to point clearly to the conclusion that when the offender is brought into court, under this section, he shall forfeit to the proprietor the plates on which the articles shall be copied and every sheet thereof, whether copied or printed, 'and shall further forfeit one dollar for every sheet of the same found in his possession, . . . and in case of a painting,' etc., 'he shall forfeit ten dollars for every copy of the same in his possession, or by him sold or exposed for sale.'\n There is nothing in this section which seems to contemplate the method of procedure pursued in this case, namely, a separate action for the money penalty, upon the theory that it arose only in case of actual finding and judgment of condemnation, but the statute contemplates the bringing of the offender into court in one suit, in which the plates and sheets shall be seized and forfeited and the penalty recovered.\n If it had been the intention of Congress to provide two \n\n[207 U.S. 375, 384]\n\u00a0\n actions, one for the forfeiture of the plates, sheets, etc., and another for the recovery of the money penalty, it would have been easy to have said so. Likewise, had it been the intention of Congress to permit a recovery for the money penalty only after judgment of forfeiture had gone in favor of the plaintiff, it would have been equally as easy to have made such provision.\n Until Congress shall provide otherwise, and this section might well be made more specific as to the nature and character of the remedy given, we think this section intended to provide, in a single action, all the remedy which is within its scope, and that to construe it as requiring two actions would be extending a penal act beyond the provisions incorporated in its terms.\n In reaching this conclusion we have not overlooked the fact that one half of the penalties go to the proprietors of the copyright and one half to the United States. There is no requirement that the United States shall be a party to the action, and we think the purpose of the statute was to make the proprietor of the copyright accountable to the United States for one half of the money penalty recovered.\n Upon this construction of the statute the plaintiff in error had exhausted his remedy in the judgment rendered in the first suit; and as the action is wholly statutory and no second action is given as we construe the act, the court was without power to award the second judgment in the separate action for the money penalty, and the circuit court properly directed the verdict for the defendant below.\n The judgment of the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","179":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWESTERN TURF ASS'N v. GREENBERG(1907)\nNo. 189\nArgued: Decided: February 25, 1907\n\n\n\n\n[204 U.S. 359, 360]\n\u00a0\n Mr. William S. Goodfellow for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[204 U.S. 359, 361]\n\u00a0\n Mr. William G. Burke for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of the court:\n The plaintiff in error is a corporation of California, and the lessee, in possession, of a race course kept as a place of public entertainment and amusement, and to which it was accustomed to issue tickets of admission. The defendant in error, Greenberg, purchased one of such tickets, and was admitted to the race course. After being admitted he was ejected from the premises against his will by police officers, acting, it was alleged in the complaint, by the direction of the defendant. The defendant denied responsibility for the acts of those officers. It was sued by Greenberg in one of the courts of California, and there was a verdict and judgment against the association for the sum of $1,000. The case was taken to the supreme court of the state and the judgment was affirmed. 148 Cal. 126, 82 Pac. 684.\n At the trial a question was raised as to the applicability to this case of a statute of California relating to the admission of persons holding tickets of admission to places of public \n\n[204 U.S. 359, 362]\n\u00a0\n entertainment and amusement. That statute is as follows: 'It shall be unlawful for any corporation, person, or association, or the proprietor, lessee, or the agents of either, of any opera house, theater, melodeon, museum, circus, caravan, race course, fair, or other place of public amusement or entertainment, to refuse admittance to any person over the age of twenty-one years who presents a ticket of admission acquired by purchase, and who demands admission to such place, provided that any person under the influence of liquor, or who is guilty of boisterous conduct, or any person of lewd or immoral character, may be excluded from any such place of amusement.  2. Any person who is refused admission to any place of amusement, contrary to the provisions of this act, is entitled to recover from the proprietors, lessees, or their agents, or from any person, association, corporation, or the directors thereof, his actual damage and $100 in addition thereto.'\n\n 1. \nThe record sufficiently shows that in the supreme court of the state the defendant questioned the validity of the statute in question under the 14th Amendment, in that it 'seeks to abridge the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States, and to deprive them of liberty and property without due process of law, and to deny to them, being within its jurisdiction, the equal protection of the laws.' By the judgment below the validity of the statute was sustained, the court holding that it was a legitimate exertion of the police power of the state. The contention that this court is without jurisdiction to review that judgment is, therefore, overruled.\n\n 2. \nThe supreme court of the state, in a previous decision between the same parties,-Greenberg v. Western Turf Asso. 140 Cal. 357, 360, 73 Pac. 1050,-held the statute to be constitutional as a valid regulation imposed by the state in its exercise of police power. That decision, we assume, from the opinion of the court, had reference only to the Constitution of California. But this court can only pass upon the validity of \n\n[204 U.S. 359, 363]\n\u00a0\n the statute with reference to the Constitution of the United States. We perceive no reason for holding it to be invalid under that instrument. The contention that it is unconstitutional as denying to the defendant the equal protection of the laws is without merit, for the statute is applicable alike to all persons, corporations, or associations conducting places of public amusement or entertainment. Of still less merit is the suggestion that the statute abridges the rights and privileges of citizens; for a corporation cannot be deemed a citizen within the meaning of the clause of the Constitution of the United States which protects the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States against being abridged or impaired by the law of a state.\n The same observation may be made as to the contention that the statute deprives the defendant of its liberty without due process of law; for the liberty guaranteed by the 14th Amendment against deprivation without due process of law is the liberty of natural, not artificial, persons. Northwestern Nat. L. Ins. Co. v. Riggs, \n203 U.S. 243\n, 51 L. ed. 168, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 126. Does the statute deprive the defendant of any property right without due process of law? We answer this question in the negative. Decisions of this court, familiar to all, and which need not be cited, recognize the possession, by each state, of powers never surrendered to the general government; which powers the state, except as restrained by its own Constitution or the Constitution of the United States, may exert not only for the public health, the public morals, and the public safety, but for the general or common good, for the well-being, comfort, and good order of the people. The enactments of a state, when exerting its power for such purposes, must be respected by this court, if they do not violate rights granted or secured by the supreme law of the land. In view of these settled principles, the defendant is not justified in invoking the Constitution of the United States. The statute is only a regulation of places of public entertainment and amusement upon terms of equal and exact justice to everyone holding a ticket of ad- \n\n[204 U.S. 359, 364]\n\u00a0\n mission, and who is not, at the time, under the influence of liquor, or boisterous in conduct, or of lewd and immoral character. In short, as applied to the plaintiff in error, it is only a regulation compelling it to perform its own contract as evidenced by tickets of admission issued and sold to parties wishing to attend its race course. Such a regulation, in itself just, is likewise promotive of peace and good order among those who attend places of public entertainment or amusement. It is neither an arbitrary exertion of the states's inherent or governmental power, nor a violation of any right secured by the Constitution of the United States. The race course in question, being held out as a place of public entertainment and amusement, is, by the act of the defendant, so far affected with a public interest that the state may, in the interest of good order and fair dealing, require defendant to perform its engagement to the public, and recognize its own tickets of admission in the hands of persons entitled to claim the benefits of the statute. That such a regulation violates any right of property secured by the Constitution of the United States cannot, for a moment, be admitted. The case requires nothing further to be said.\n The judgment is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","180":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWETMORE v. KARRICK(1907)\nNo. 144\nArgued: January 9, 1907Decided: March 11, 1907\n\n\n\n\n[205 U.S. 141, 142]\n\u00a0\n Mr. William L. Ford for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[205 U.S. 141, 144]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. W. W. Millan, J. J. Darlington, and Millan & Smith for defendant in error.\n\n\n[205 U.S. 141, 146]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a writ of error to the court of appeals of the District of Columbia to reverse a judgment of that court affirming a judgment of the supreme court of the District of Columbia in favor of the defendant in error, overruling a demurrer to the defendant's second plea.\n The action was brought on the law side in the supreme court of the District of Columbia on December 1, 1903, to recover judgment against Karrick, defendant in error, upon a judgment rendered in the superior court for the county of Suffolk, commonwealth of Massachusetts, on November 20, 1900. Copy of the record in the Massachusetts court is made part of the record in the supreme court of the District of Columbia.\n This record shows that suit was brought upon certain contracts between the defendant in error and one Charles H. Wetmore, since deceased, plaintiff's intestate. The defendant was personally served with process, appeared, and pleaded to the declaration. Trial was had to a jury, and resulted in a verdict against the defendant. Upon his motion the verdict was set aside. Thereupon the plaintiff filed an amendment to his declaration and another trial to a jury was had. Upon February 21, 1894, by another verdict, special and general, a sum of $9,169.30 was found in favor of the plaintiff. Motion for a new trial was made by the defendant and overruled March 3, 1894, and exceptions filed. On June 8, 1897, more than three years after the proceedings just recited, the action was dismissed under the general order of the court \n\n[205 U.S. 141, 147]\n\u00a0\n upon the calling of the docket. Two days thereafter, June 10, 1897, the order of dismissal was stricken out and the case restored to the docket.\n On June 23, 1897, attorney for the defendant entered an order withdrawing his appearance. On June 13, 1898, an attorney, whose name does not appear elsewhere in the record, withdrew his appearance. The record then shows:\n'Thence the case was continued to the July sitting, 1898, when said exceptions, having been presented to the court, were disallowed as not conformable to the truth, the bill not properly and correctly stating the evidence so as to fairly present the questions of law raised by the defendant's exceptions.'\n\n Then follows:\n'Thence the case was continued from sitting to sitting into the April sitting, 1899, when, on the 12th day of June, 1899, at a calling of the docket under the general order of court, said action was dismissed.'\n\n And then the entry:\n'And now, at this present October sitting, 1900, to wit, on the 18th day of said October, 1900, said dismissal is stricken off and the case brought forward, the same having been dismissed improvidently, action having been taken within one year, but not discovered.'\n\n On November 17, 1900, there was a motion by plaintiff for judgment on the verdict of the jury, and on November 20, 1900, judgment was entered accordingly against the defendant for the sum of $12,881.46 and costs.\n Two pleas were filed to the declaration in the supreme court of the District of Columbia; first, the general issue nul tiel record; second, a special plea, wherein the defendant set out that on June 12, 1899, the cause against him in the Massachusetts court was dismissed; that under the rules of court that dismissal became final on the first Monday of July, 1899; that the cause remained so dismissed for more than five terms or sittings of the court, and until October 18, 1900; that, in \n\n[205 U.S. 141, 148]\n\u00a0\n the meantime, on April 29, 1899, defendant filed his petition in bankruptcy in the district court of the United States for the district of Colorado, enumerating in his schedule the debt due to said Wetmore, and was, by the said district court, on June 23, 1899, discharged from all debts provable against him in bankruptcy, including the debt sued on; that subsequently to the discharge, as aforesaid, he made inquiry of the clerk of the court in Massachusetts as to the suit, and was informed that said suit was no longer pending; that relying upon this statement he took no steps to suggest in that court his discharge in bankruptcy; that the action of the court in Massachusetts, restoring the case to the docket, was without summons, citation, or notice of any kind to him, or to anyone for him, and without his knowledge; that the court had no jurisdiction to render the judgment sued upon.\n Issue was joined upon the first plea, and to the second plea a demurrer was filed, which was sustained by the supreme court of the District of Columbia. From the order sustaining the demurrer special appeal was taken on January 6, 1905, to the court of appeals for the District of Columbia, and on April 17, 1905, the judgment below was reversed and the cause remanded. 25 App. D. C. 415.\n On May 16, 1905, the supreme court of the District of Columbia entered an order overruling plaintiff's demurrer to defendant's second plea and, the plaintiff electing to stand on his demurrer, judgment was entered for the defendant, and the plaintiff appealed to the court of appeals of the District of Columbia.\n On October 10, 1905, the case was submitted; and, on the 12th day of the same month, judgment below was affirmed without further opinion.\n Before taking up the case in detail it must be regarded as settled by previous decisions of this court that, where an action is brought to recover upon a judgment, the jurisdiction of the court rendering the judgment is open to inquiry. And the constitutional requirement as to full faith and credit in \n\n[205 U.S. 141, 149]\n\u00a0\n each state to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other state does not require them to be enforced if they are rendered without jurisdiction, or otherwise wanting in due process of law. This principle was so lately asserted by a decision in this court as to render unnecessary more than a reference to the consideration of the subject in Old Wayne Mut. Life Asso. v. McDonough, decided on January 7, 1907, of the present term. \n204 U.S. 8\n, 51 L. ed. 345, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 236.\n It is also an elementary doctrine of this court that a judgment rendered in personam against a defendant without jurisdiction of his person is not only erroneous but void. Pennoyer v. Neff, \n95 U.S. 714\n, 24 L. ed. 565. And the same case holds that such judgment is not required to be enforced in another state, either by the due faith and credit clause of the Constitution, or the act of Congress (Rev. Stat.  905, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 677) passed in aid thereof.\n It is apparent from the statement of facts preceding this discussion that the precise question to be determined is whether a court which has once rendered a judgment in favor of a defendant, dismissing the cause and discharging him from further attendance, may, at any time after the term, and at a subsequent term, no matter how remote from the time of rendering judgment, without motion or proceeding to vacate the judgment, and without notice, set aside the judgment so rendered and render a new judgment against the defendant for the recovery of a sum of money against him.\n The general principle is that judgments cannot be disturbed after the term at which they are rendered, and can only be corrected, if at all, by writ of error, or appeal, or relieved against in equity in certain cases. There are, it is true, certain exceptions to the rule, within which, it is the contention of the plaintiff in error, the present action is brought.\n No contention is made in the brief or argument of counsel for plaintiff in error that the question for decision in this case is changed or modified because of the fact that terms \n\n[205 U.S. 141, 150]\n\u00a0\n of court are abolished by statute in Massachusetts. The statutes of that commonwealth (Rev. Laws, vol. 2, 1382,  24) provide for 'sittings' of the superior court at Boston, in the county of Suffolk, for civil business, on the first Tuesdays of January, April, July, and October. The exemplified copy of the record in this case shows that the case was dismissed under the general order of the court at the April sitting, 1899, on the 12th day of June, 1899. At the October sitting, 1900, to wit, on October 18, 1900, the dismissal was stricken off for the reason stated, and on November 20, 1900, the new judgment was rendered.\n In Dalton-Ingersoll Co. v. Fiske, 175 Mass. 15, 55 N. E. 468, the supreme judicial court recited the previous cases, holding that terms no longer exist in the superior court, and said (p. 22, N. E. p. 471): 'When we had terms the practice was to enter judgment, either on some day in the term, upon motion, or, of course, on the last day. Howe, Pr. 267. Since terms have been abolished the practice is regulated by statutes and the rules of the courts.' In the second plea it is averred, and admitted by the demurrer, that under the rules of court the dismissal became final on the first Monday of July, 1899; that is, the first Monday of the following month.\n We think this rule day equivalent to the end of a term. It is the time at which, by the rules of court adopted under statutory power, the judgment became final, unless set aside for mistake within the principles to be hereinafter discussed.\n Pierce v. Lamper, 141 Mass. 20, 6 N. E. 223, was a case where a suit had been dismissed upon the call of the docket under the same rule under which the case against Karrick, defendant in error, was dismissed. for want of action within the year, which order should have been followed by an entry of judgment of dismissal, in place of which the clerk simply made a docket entry 'dismissed on call.' The court held, since it was the duty of the clerk to have entered the dismissal, it was to be deemed in law as actually entered and a final disposition of the case; that at a subsequent term the court had \n\n[205 U.S. 141, 151]\n\u00a0\n no power to vacate it, except by writ of review filed within one year under the statute.\n The doctrine that a judgment is final at the term unless set aside within the exceptions for mistake seems fully recognized by other decisions in Massachusetts. Radclyffe v. Barton, 154 Mass. 159, 28 N. E. 148, where previous cases are cited in the opinion.\n At common law a writ of error coram vobis brought before the court certain mistakes of fact not put in issue or passed upon,-such as the death of a party, coverture, infancy, error in process, or mistake of the clerk. This writ is no longer in use, but its objects are attained by motion. Pickett v. Legerwood, 7 Pet. 145, 147, 8 L. ed. 638, 639.\n As in the common-law writ of coram vobis, so in the proceeding by motion, after a party has been dismissed from the action by judgment he is brought again into the court by notice of the new proceeding. Ferris v. Douglass, 20 Wend. 626.\n A few of the cases from this court may be noticed which support the general proposition that, at the end of the term at which judgment was rendered, the court loses jurisdiction of the cause. The principle was briefly stated by Mr. Chief Justice Waite, speaking for the court, in Brooks v. Burlington & S. W. R. Co. \n102 U.S. 107\n, 26 L. ed. 91:\n'At the end of the term the parties are discharged from further attendance on all causes decided, and we have no power to bring them back. After that, we can do no more than correct any clerical errors that may be found in the record of what we have done.'\n\n The question underwent a full discussion, Mr. Justice Miller delivering the opinion of the court, in Bronson v. Schulten, \n104 U.S. 410\n, 26 L. ed. 797. On page 415, L. ed. p. 799, he said:\n'But it is a rule equally well established, that after the term has ended all final judgments and decrees of the court pass beyond its control, unless steps be taken during that term, by motion or otherwise, to set aside, modify, or correct \n\n[205 U.S. 141, 152]\n\u00a0\n them; and, if errors exist, they can only be corrected by such proceeding by a writ of error or appeal as may be allowed in a court which, by law, can review the decision. So strongly has this principle been upheld by this court, that, while realizing that there is no court which can review its decisions, it has invariably refused all applications for rehearing made after the adjournment of the court for the term at which the judgment was rendered. And this is placed upon the ground that the case has passed beyond the control of the court. Brooks v. Burlington & S. W. R. Co. supra; St. Louis Public Schools v. Walker, 9 Wall. 603, 19 L. ed. 650; Brown v. Aspden, 14 How. 25, 14 L. ed. 311; Cameron v. M'Roberts, 3 Wheat. 591, 4 L. ed. 467; Sibbald v. United States, 12 Pet. 488, 9 L. ed. 1167; United States v. The Glamorgan, 2 Curt. C. C. 236, Fed. Cas. No. 15,214; Bradford v. Patterson, 1 A. K. Marsh, 464; Ballard v. Davis, 3 J. J. Marsh, 656.'\n\n In discussing the exceptions to this rule for the correction of judgment by writ of error coram vobis, or motion, now substituted for the old practice, the only one which has application here is error in the process through the default of the clerk.\n We are unable to find in the present record any clerical mistake. The entry of action during the year upon the bill of exceptions appears to have been duly entered upon the minutes of the court; the clerk made no mistake about it. The court erroneously rendered a judgment, believing that no action had been taken, but this was not through mistake or oversight of the elerk within the meaning of the rule. The judgment intended to be entered by the court was, in fact, entered,-through misapprehension, it is true; but nothing was left out which the court intended to make a matter of record.\n In Hickman v. Ft. Scott, \n141 U.S. 415\n-418, 35 L. ed. 775, 776, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 9, 10, there was a petition to correct by new findings the special findings of fact upon which the court had rendered a judgment at a former term, which findings, it was averred, had been omitted, some unavoidably and others accidentally; but the application was overruled and error was prosecuted to this court, which, \n\n[205 U.S. 141, 153]\n\u00a0\n speaking through Mr. Justice Harlan, said: 'The judgment was the one the court intended to enter, and the facts found were those only which the court intended to find. There is here no clerical mistake. Nothing was omitted from the record of the original action which the court intended to make a matter of record. The case, therefore, does not come within the rule that a court, after the expiration of the term, may, by an order nunc pro tunc, amend the record by inserting what had been omitted by the act of the clerk or of the court. Re Wight (Wight v. Nicholson) \n134 \nU.S. 136, 144\n, 33 S. L. ed. 865, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 487; Fowler v. Equitable Trust Co. \n141 U.S. 384\n, 35 L. ed. 786, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1; Galloway v. McKeithen, 27 N. C. (5 Ired. L.) 12, 52 Am. Dec. 153; Hyde v. Curling, 10 Mo. 359.'\n This case from 10 Missouri was quoted with approbation also in the case of Re Wight (Wight v. Nicholson) \n134 \nU.S. 136, 145\n, 33 S. L. ed. 865, 869, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 487, 490, as follows: 'A court has power to order entries of proceedings had by the court at a previous term to be made nunc pro tunc; but, where the court has omitted to make an order which it might or ought to have made, it cannot, at a subsequent term, be made nunc pro tunc.'\n In the case Re Wight this court approved an order of the circuit court of the United States putting in the record at a subsequent term an order which was made at a previous term of the court, remanding the case to the district court. 'A clerical error, as its designation imports, is an error of a clerk or a subordinate officer in transcribing or entering an official proceeding ordered by another.' Marsh v. Nichols, S. & Co. \n128 \nU.S. 605, 615\n, 32 S. L. ed. 538, 542, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 168, 171.\n Of another alleged exception to the general rule of finality of judgments, counsel for plaintiff in error says, after conceding the general rule that jurisdiction is lost after the lapse of the term at which judgment is rendered:\n'But a well-known exception to this general rule is that a judgment of dismissal based upon a mistake or inadvertence, such as appear in this record, can be set aside after the term, and that is the proposition with which this court is concerned in this case. The reason is that jurisdiction is not lost by a \n\n[205 U.S. 141, 154]\n\u00a0\n dismissal by a mistake. This is one of the exceptions to the general rule that has been recognized in the decisions of this court for nearly a century.'\n\n To support this contention the case of The Palmyra, 12 Wheat. 1, 6 L. ed. 531, is relied upon. In that case, which was one in admiralty, the court found there was no final decree in the court below, and, therefore, it was not appealable. The next term of the court a corrected transcript was adduced, showing there had been a final decree which the clerk, through mistake, had failed to include in the record, and the court permitted the filing of a new transcript. Mr. Justice Story, delivering the opinion of the court, said:\n'The difference between a new appeal and a reinstatement of the old appeal after a dismissal, from a misprision of the clerk, is not admitted by this court justly to involve any difference of right as to the stipulators. Every court must be presumed to exercise those powers belonging to it which are necessary for the promotion of public justice; and we do not doubt that this court possesses the power to reinstate any cause dismissed by mistake. The reinstatement of the cause was founded, in the opinion of this court, upon the plain principles of justice, and is according to the known practice of other judicial tribunals in like cases.'\n\n It is to be observed, while the learned justice, speaking for the court in that case, affirmed the 'power of this court to reinstate any cause dismissed by mistake,' the case had been dismissed at the first hearing, as Mr. Justice Story distinctly says, from a 'misprision of the clerk,'-a recognized exception to the general doctrine of conclusiveness of the judgment after the term, and there is no indication that the correction made in that case was made without notice to the party interested. The adverse party was present and resisted the order, so there was opportunity to be heard.\n The Palmyra Case has been cited a number of times since in the course of opinions not involving the precise proposition, to the effect that the court 'may reinstate a cause at subsequent \n\n[205 U.S. 141, 155]\n\u00a0\n term, dismissed by mistake.' Sibbald v. United States, 12 Pet. 492, 9 L. ed. 1169\n\n\n It was cited to the proposition that a court might correct misprision of clerks. Bank of United States v. Moss, 6 How. 38, 12 L. ed. 334.\n In 21 How. 85, 16 L. ed. 32, Rice v. Minnesota & N. W. R. Co., an opinion delivered by Mr. Chief Justice Taney, it was held that at common law, where a case upon error proceedings had been dismissed for want of jurisdiction, it could not be reinstated at a subsequent term upon a showing that the final judgment below, for want of which the case was dismissed, had been accidentally omitted from the record as a production of the correct record showed.\n In the case The Palmyra Case was relied upon in support of the motion, but the court declined to follow it in a common-law case, and limited its application to the jurisdiction of an appellate court in admiralty cases, which, the Chief Justice said, was much wider than in a case at common law.\n In the case of Alviso v. United States, 6 Wall. 458, 18 L. ed. 721, a case dismissed for want of citation at a former term, omitted to be returned from neglect of the clerk, was reinstated upon the authority of The Palmyra; but in that case Mr. Justice Nelson, speaking for the court, distinctly stated that the omission in The Palmyra Case was the error of the clerk in making out the transcript, and there is no reference to the general authority of the court to reinstate a case dismissed by mistake, regardless of the character of the omission or error.\n The Palmyra, like every other case, must be read in the light of the point decided in the case, and in considering the language of Mr. Justice Story, who spoke of the general power of the court to reinstate a case dismissed by mistake, it is evident that he had in mind, for he says so, that the first dismissal was for a clerical mistake, which is a well- recognized ground for correcting judgments at subsequent terms, upon notice and proper showing.\n The plaintiff in error also cites Phillips v. Negley, 117 U. S. \n\n[205 U.S. 141, 156]\n\u00a0\n 665, 29 L. ed. 1013, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 901. That case contains an emphatic statement of the doctrine that a judgment at law cannot be reversed or annulled after the close of the term at which it was entered by the court rendering the judgment, for errors of fact or law, with the exceptions which we have heretofore noted. In that case Negley had been sued in the supreme court of the District of Columbia upon a certain order. Negley answered, denying his liability, and asserting that he signed the order only as agent; denied also that plaintiff was the holder of the order, or notice of nonpayment. After issue joined on the pleas, on April 3, 1879, Negley not appearing, a jury was called, and verdict found for the plaintiff, upon which judgment was rendered.\n On September 4, 1882, Negley filed his motion to vacate the judgment and set aside the verdict rendered against him ex parte, because of irregularity, fraud, and deceit, and the negligence of his attorney. Affidavits were filed in support of this motion, setting forth a denial of Negley's personal liability on the order; that he was served with process when temporarily in Washington, being then and since a resident of Pittsburg; that he employed counsel and filed his defense, but received no further notice from the fall of 1874 until July 26, 1882, when he was sued on the judgment in Allegheny county, Pennsylvania; that plaintiff took no notice of the plea filed in the original case until May 3, 1877; that in the meantime, without defendant's knowledge, his counsel had removed from Washington, leaving him without counsel, as plaintiff and his counsel well knew, and on April 3, 1879, without notice, and while Negley was ignorant of the proceeding, called for a jury and procured the verdict and judgment against him.\n Other testimony was taken, and after hearing on December 2, 1882, the supreme court of the District set aside the verdict because of 'irregularity, surprise, fraud, and deceit,' and granted a new trial. In this court the judgment of the supreme court was reversed for error in entertaining and granting \n\n[205 U.S. 141, 157]\n\u00a0\n the motion to set aside the judgment, and the cause was remanded, without prejudice to Negley's right to file a bill in equity. After citing and quoting from the Bronson Case (\n104 U.S. 410\n, 26 L. ed. 797), Mr. Justice Matthews, who delivered the opinion of the court, said:\n'Although the opinion [Bronson Case] also shows that upon the facts of that case the action of the circuit court in vacating its judgment after the term could not be justified upon any rule authorizing such relief, whether by motion or by bill in equity, nevertheless the decision of the case rests upon the emphatic denial of the power of the court to set aside a judgment upon motion made after the term and grant a new trial, except in the limited class of cases enumerated as reached by the previous practice under writs of error coram vobis, or for the purpose of correcting the record according to the fact where mistakes have occurred from the misprision of the clerk. We content ourselves with repeating the doctrine of this recent decision, without recapitulating previous cases in this court, in which the point has been noticed, for the purpose of showing their harmony. It has been the uniform doctrine of this court. No principle is better settled,' it was said in Sibbald v. United States, 12 Pet. 488, 492, 9 L. ed. 1167, 1169, 'or of more universal application, than that no court can reverse its own final decrees or judgments for errors of fact or law, after the term in which they have been rendered, unless for clerical mistakes (Cameron v. M'Roberts, 3 Wheat. 591, 4 L. ed. 467; Bank of Commonwealth v. Wistar, 3 Pet. 431, 7 L. ed. 731), or to reinstate a cause dismissed by mistake (The Palmyra, supra); from which it follows that no change or modification can be made, which may substantially vary or affect it in any material thing. Bills of review, in cases in equity, and writs of error coram vobis at law, are exceptions which cannot affect the present motion.\"\n\n The case just cited is relied upon because of its reference to The Palmyra. But the point to which that case is cited was not involved. As we have seen, it had already been limited in Rice v. Minnesota & N. W. R. Co. 21 How. 85, 16 L. ed. 32, to appeals in admiralty. \n\n[205 U.S. 141, 158]\n\u00a0\n Further, that case, as we have seen, was one of clerical mistake in making up the record.\n We therefore find nothing in the previous decisions of this court justifying the contention of the plaintiff in error as to the right to correct the judgment of the previous term, in view of the character of the error sought to be corrected, and more especially in the attempt, under the circumstances shown in this record, to set aside a judgment of a former term, and render a new and different judgment without notice to the party who had been dismissed by a former judgment.\n As we have seen, the question here involved pertains to a case where no notice is given and a new and different judgment is entered at a subsequent term. It is urged when the necessary facts appear in the record such correction can be made without notice, because, it is said, there is nothing to litigate. But aside from the fact that this proposition ignores the rule that jurisdiction once lost can only be regained by some proper notice, the case at bar is an illustration that such action may impair the substantial right of a party to be heard against the rendition of a new judgment against him. Had notice been given, the defendant could have availed himself of his right to plead his discharge in bankruptcy by proper proceedings for that purpose. Loveland, Bankr. 783. It may be that he did not lose all right to avail himself of the discharge in some other manner, but he had the right to show that, in view of his discharge, the judgment in question ought not to be rendered against him.\n In Capen v. Stoughton, 16 Gray, 364, cited by plaintiff in error, a sheriff's jury in condemnation proceedings by mistake signed a verdict in favor of the municipal corporation instead of the property owners. The court held this a mistake of a merely formal and clerical kind; and 'when no action has been taken on an order or judgment, and the rights of parties to the proceeding or those of third persons cannot be affected unjustly by the correction of an error, the court has power to order an action to be brought forward and a judgment \n\n[205 U.S. 141, 159]\n\u00a0\n to be vacated in order that an entry may be made in conformity with the truth.'\n There is no suggestion that such action can be 'brought forward' without notice to the adverse party, or a correction made where, as in the present case, the party has lost a valuable right in reliance upon a judgment of dismissal.\n And if it be held that the mistake in this case, though not of the clerk, was of a clerical character, and within the rule permitting the correction of such mistakes by the court, a point unnecessary to decide in this case, such a correction cannot be made after term without notice, certainly where the changed condition of the parties in view of a new right acquired would render it prejudicial to render a new judgment.\n The plaintiff in error also relies upon the proposition that the Massachusetts statute (Revised Laws of Massachusetts, chap. 193,  22) provides that if a judgment is rendered in the absence of the petitioner, and without his knowledge, a writ of review may be granted upon petition filed within one year after the petitioner first had notice of the judgment; otherwise, within one year after the judgment was rendered. But we cannot agree that this remedy supplied the want of jurisdiction in the Massachusetts court to render, after the term and without notice, a new and different judgment against the defendant in error. Whatever his remedy may be in the state courts, want of jurisdiction may be pleaded wherever the judgment is set up against him in another forum.\n We find nothing in any decision of this court which sanctions any different procedure, and the cases in the state courts which hold that notice is necessary after the term before a judgment can be set aside are numerous. Some of them will be found in the note in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[205 U.S. 141, 160]\n\u00a0\n To sanction a proceeding rendering a new judgment without notice at a subsequent term, and hold that it is a judgment rendered with jurisdiction, and binding when set up elsewhere, would be to violate the fundamental rpinciples of due process of law as we understand them, and do violence to that requirement of every system of enlightened jurisprudence which judges after it hears, and condemns only after a party has had an opportunity to present his defense. By the amendment and new judgment the proceedings are given an effect against the defendant in error which they did not have when he was discharged from them by the judgment of dismissal. By the judgment of dismissal the court lost jurisdiction of the cause and of the person of the defendant. A new judgment in personam could not be rendered against the defendant until, by voluntary appearance or due service of process, the court had again acquired jurisdiction over him. As a matter of common right, before such action could be taken he should have an opportunity to be heard and present objections to the rendition of a new judgment, if such existed.\n We find no error in the judgment of the Court of Appeals overruling the demurrer to the second plea, and the same is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice Brewer took no part in this case.\n\nFootnotes\n Murphy v.

OF HARTFORD(1907)\nNo. 258\nArgued: April 12, 1907Decided: April 22, 1907\n\n\n\n This is a suit upon an accident policy of insurance issued November 3d, 1900, by the AEtna Life Insurance Company of Hartford, Connecticut, upon the life of James Whitfield, a resident of Missouri. The policy specifies various kinds of injuries; also, the amount that will be paid by the company on account of such injuries respectively It provides: 'If death results solely from such injuries within ninety days, the said company will pay the principal sum of $5,000 to Amanda M. S. Whitfield, his wife, if living; and, in event of the death of said beneficiary before the death of the insured, to the executors, administrators, or assigns of the insured.' The policy recites that it was issued and accepted by the assured, James Whitfield, subject to certain conditions, among which are these: '. . . 5. In event of death, loss of limb or sight, or disability due to injuries inten- \n\n[205 U.S. 489, 490]\n\u00a0\n tionally inflicted upon the insured by any other person (except assaults committed for the sole purpose of burglary or robbery), whether such other person be sane or insane, or under the influence of intoxicants or not; or due to injuries received while fighting or in a riot; or due to injuries intentionally inflicted upon the insured by himself; or due to suicide, sane or insane; or due to the taking of poison, voluntarily or involuntarily, or the inhaling of any gas or vapor; or due to injuries received while under the influence of intoxicants or narcotics,-then, in all such cases referred to in this paragraph, the limit of this company's liability shall be one tenth the amount otherwise payable under this policy, anything to the contrary in this policy notwithstanding. . . . 8. The maximum liability of the company hereunder in any policy year shall not exceed the principal sum hereby insured, and in no event will claim for weekly indemnity be valid if claim is also made for any of the stated amounts herein provided for specified injuries, based upon the same accident and resulting injuries.'\n The insured died April 7th, 1902, the plaintiff, his widow and the beneficiary of the policy, alleging in her petition that he died 'from bodily injuries, effected through external, violent, and accidental means, and by a pistol shot.' The petition also states that the company, after receiving proofs as to the death of the insured, offered to pay $500 as the full amount due by  5 of the policy, but refused to pay more. The plaintiff asked a judgment for $5,000 with interest from the date of the death of the insured.\n The company, in its answer, denied liability for the whole principal sum, and averred, among other things, that, by the terms of the policy, 'in the event death is caused by intentional injuries inflicted by the insured or any other person, whether such person be sane or insane, or while fighting or in a riot, or by suicide, sane or insane, or by poison, or by inhaling gas or vapor, or while under the influence of intoxicants or narcotics, then the amount to be paid shall be one tenth of the principal sum, or $500; . . . that said James Whitfield died from bodily injuries caused by a pistol shot intentionally fired by himself for the purpose thereby of taking his own life; that the cause of the death of said Whitfield was suicide.' It was not averred in the answer that the insured contemplated suicide when applying for a policy.\n The plaintiff demurred to the answer. The demurrer was overruled, and the plaintiff filed a reply, admitting that the insured 'died from \n\n[205 U.S. 489, 491]\n\u00a0\n bodily injuries caused by a pistol shot fired by himself, and the cause of his death was suicide,' but averring that the shot was fired and the suicide committed at a time when the insured was 'incapable of realizing or knowing, and when he did not realize or know, what he was doing or the consequences of his act.'\n The case-a jury having been waived in writing-was tried by the court upon an agreed statement of facts, one of which was that the insured died 'from bodily injuries caused by a pistol shot intentionally fired by himself, for the purpose of thereby taking his own life; that the cause of the death of said Whitfield was suicide.'\n The circuit court held that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover $ 5,000, but only $500, and judgment for the latter amount was entered. 125 Fed. 269. That judgment was affirmed by the circuit court of appeals, 75 C. C. A. 358, 144 Fed. 356, and the case is here upon writ of certiorari.\n Messrs. Frank Hagerman and Herbert S. Hadley for petitioners.\n\n\n[205 U.S. 489, 493]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. James C. Jones, J. J. Darlington, Jones, Jones, & Hocker, and Boyle, Guthrie, & Smith for respondent. \n\n[205 U.S. 489, 494]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of the court:\n When the policy in suit was issued, and also when the insured committed suicide, it was provided by the statutes of Missouri that 'in all suits upon policies of insurance on life hereafter issued by any company doing business in this state, to a citizen of this state, it shall be no defense that the insured committed suicide, unless it shall be shown to the satisfaction of the court or jury trying the cause, that the insured contemplated suicide at the time he made his application for the policy, and any stipulation in the policy to the contrary shall be void.' Mo. Rev. Stat. 1879,  5982; Id. 1889,  5855; Id. 1899,  7896\n\n\n Assuming-as upon the record we must do-that, within the true meaning of both the statute and the policy, the insured \n\n[205 U.S. 489, 495]\n\u00a0\n committed suicide, without having contemplated self-destruction at the time he made application for insurance, the question arises whether the contract of insurance limiting the recovery to one tenth of the principal sum specified was valid and enforceable.\n\n 1. \nThat the statute is a legitimate exertion of power by the state cannot be successfully disputed. Indeed, the contrary is not asserted in this case, although it is suggested that the statute 'seemingly encourages suicide, and offers a bounty therefor, payable, not out of the public funds of the state, but out of the funds of insurance companies.' There is some foundation for this suggestion in a former decision of this court, in which it was held that public policy, even in the absence of a prohibitory statute, forbade a recovery upon a life policy, silent as to suicide, where the insured, when in sound mind, wilfully and deliberately took his own life. Ritter v. Mutual L. Ins. Co. \n169 \nU.S. 139, 154\n, 42 S. L. ed. 693, 698, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 300. But the determination of the present case depends upon other considerations than those involved in the Ritter Case. An insurance company is not bound to make a contract which is attended by the results indicated by the statute in question. If it does business at all in the state, it must do so subject to such valid regulations as the state may choose to adopt. Even if the statute in question could be fairly regarded by the court as inconsistent with public policy or sound morality, it cannot, for that reason alone, be disregarded; for it is the province of the state, by its legislature, to adopt such a policy as it deems best, provided it does not, in so doing, come into conflict with the Constitution of the state or the Constitution of the United States. There is no such conflict here. The legislative will, within the limits stated, must be respected, if all that can be said is that, in the opinion of the court, the statute expressing that will is unwise from the standpoint of the public interests. See Northwestern Nat. L. Ins. Co. v. Riggs, \n203 U.S. 243\n, 51 L, ed. 168, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 126.\n\n 2. \nDid the courts below err in adjudging that the policy in suit was not forbidden by the statute? Can an insurance \n\n[205 U.S. 489, 496]\n\u00a0\n company and the insured lawfully stipulate that, in the event of suicide, not contemplated by the insured when applying for a policy, the company shall not be bound to pay the principal sum insured, but only a given part thereof? Will the statute, in a case of suicide, allow the company, when sued on its policy, to make a defense that will exempt it, simply because of such suicide, from liability for the principal sum?\n We cannot agree with the learned courts below in their interpretation of the statute. The contract between the parties, evidenced by the policy, is, we think, an evasion of the statute, and tends to defeat the objects for which it was enacted. In clear, emphatic words the statute declares that in all suits on policies of insurance on life it shall be no defense that the insured committed suicide, unless it be shown that he contemplated suicide when applying for the policy. Whatever tends to diminish the plaintiff's cause of action or to defeat recovery in whole or in part amounts in law to a defense. When the company denied its liability for the whole of the principal sum, it certainly made a defense as to all of that sum except one tenth. If, notwithstanding the statute, an insurance company may, by contract, bind itself, in case of the suicide of the insured, to pay only one tenth of the principal sum, may it not lawfully contract for exemption as to the whole sum or only a nominal part thereof, and, if sued, defeat any action in which a recovery is sought for the entire amount insured? In this way the statute could be annulled or made useless for any practical purpose. Looking at the object of the statute, and giving effect to its words according to their ordinary, natural meaning, the legislative intent was to cut up by the roots any defense, as to the whole and every part of the sum insured, which was grounded upon the fact of suicide. The manifest purpose of the statute was to make all inquiry as to suicide wholly immaterial, except where the insured contemplated suicide at the time he applied for his policy. Any contract inconsistent with the statute must be held void. \n\n[205 U.S. 489, 497]\n\u00a0\n In Berry v. Knights Templars' & M. Life Indemnity Co. 46 Fed. 441, which was an action upon a policy of life insurance, it appears that the policy, among other things, provided that, in the case of the self- destruction of the insured, whether voluntary or involuntary, sane or insane. the policy should be void. Judgment was given for the plaintiff. The circuit court said: 'It is contended that the provision in the policy, declaring that it shall be void if the assured commits suicide, is a waiver or nullification of the statute which declares such a stipulation in a policy 'shall be void.' The statute is mandatory and obligatory alike on the insurance company and the assured. Its very object was to prohibit and annul such stipulations in policies, and it cannot be waived or abrogated by any form of contract or by any device whatever. The legislative will, when expressed in the peremptory terms of this statute, is paramount and absolute, and cannot be varied or waived by the private conventions of the parties.' Upon writ of error to the circuit court of appeals the judgment was affirmed, that court saying: 'The company refused to pay the full amount named in the policy, claiming that, by the express provisions of the policy, self-destruction by the insured, whether sane or insane, rendered the contract for the payment of $5,000 void, and the company was only bound to pay the amount which had been paid in assessments by the insured. The action was brought in the circuit court for the western district of Missouri, to recover the full sum of $5,000. The case was tried to the court, a jury being waived. The parties stipulated that the company was liable for the full amount claimed by the plaintiffs, unless excused by the clause in the policy providing that the same should be void in case of suicide; . . . Judgment in favor of plaintiffs having been entered for the full amount of the policy, the case was brought to this court upon writ of error. . . . In our judgment, the court below ruled correctly in holding that the policy sued on was a contract made in Missouri, and, as such, that the provisions of  5982 [ the same as the statute now in question] are applicable \n\n[205 U.S. 489, 498]\n\u00a0\n thereto; and therefore the judgment is affirmed, at costs of plaintiff in error.' 1 C. C. A. 561, 562, 569, 4 U. S. App. 353-355, 359, 50 Fed. 511, 512, 515.\n In Knights Templars' & M. Life Indemnity Co. v. Jarman, \n187 U.S. 197\n, 47 L. ed. 139, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 108, this court had occasion to consider the scope and effect of the statute here in question. That was an action upon a policy of life insurance for $5,000. A recovery for the whole sum was sought, but the company defended the action upon the ground that the provision in the statute that it should be no defense that the insured committed suicide related only to cases where he took his own life voluntarily, while sane, and in full possession of his mental faculties; that the provision in the policy that \"in case of the self-destruction of the holder of this policy, whether voluntary or involuntary, sane or insane, . . . this policy shall become null and void,' applies, and exonerates the company from all liability beyond that provided in the policy, 'that, in the case of the suicide of the holder of this policy, then this company will pay to his widow and heirs or devisees such an amount of his policy as the member shall have paid to this company on the policy in assessments on the same, without interest.\" This view of the statute was not accepted in the circuit court, and there was judgment against the company for the whole sum insured. That judgment was affirmed here upon certiorari to the circuit court of appeals.\n A leading case on the general subject is Logan v. Fidelity & C. Co. 146 Mo. 114, 119, 122, 123, 47 S. W. 948, which was a suit upon a policy which, according to the answer in the case, contained stipulations and covenants to the effect that, in the event of fatal injuries to the assured, wantonly inflicted upon himself, or inflicted upon himself while insane, the company's liability under its policy should be a sum equal to the premiums paid, and that sum the policy provided should be in full liquidation of all claims under it. The question before the court was whether or not the statute here in question applied to such a policy as the one there in suit. The trial court instructed the jury to return a verdict for the full amount of \n\n[205 U.S. 489, 499]\n\u00a0\n the policy, with interest. The court said: 'The error into which respondent has fallen is in assuming that  5855 [the statute now in question] was intended to affect a particular line, class, or department of insurance, as the same has been classified for legislation. The real object of the section, as the clear terms of its language express, is to affect all policies of insurance on lift from whatever class, department, or line of insurance the policy may be issued, or by whatever name or designation the company may be known. It is policies of a given kind, and not companies of a class, that are to be affected by the provisions of  5855. The section was enacted clearly to protect all policy holders of insurance on life against the defense that the insured committed suicide, all provisions in the policies to the contrary notwithstanding, standing, unless, as provided in the section, it can be shown that the insured contemplated suicide at the time he made application for the policy. . . . When a policy covers loss of life from external, violent, and accidental means alone, why is it not insurance on life? Such a provision incorporated in a general life insurance policy admittedly would be insurance on life: then why less insurance on life because not coupled with provisions covering loss of life from usual or natural causes as well? If one holds a general life policy and an accident policy, and is killed by lightning or commits suicide, so that he may be said to have died by accidental means, both the companies should pay, and the stipulation against liability in the event of suicide in the policies should be no more a defense against the suit upon the accident policy, providing against death from accidental cause, than against the policy which goes further and covers death from other causes as well. No such exception or exemption is found in the plain and comprehensive language of  5855. . . . No rule of construction, short of one applied for distortion and destruction, can relieve accident insurance companies, issuing policies of insurance on life in this state, from the operation and influences of  5855, which, in plain and unambiguous terms, declares that in all suits upon policies of \n\n[205 U.S. 489, 500]\n\u00a0\n insurance on life thereafter issued, it shall be no defense that the assured committed suicide, unless it shall have been shown, to the satisfaction of the court or judge trying the cause, that the insured contemplated suicide at the time of making his application for the policies; all stipulations in the policy to the contrary being void.'\n In Keller v. Travelers' Ins. Co. decided by the St. Louis court of appeals, 58 Mo. App. 557, 560, 561, we have a decision very much in point. That was an action on an insurance policy for $2,500. The company defended upon the ground that, by the terms of the policy, if the insured died of suicide, whether the act be voluntary or involuntary, it should be liable for the then full net value of said policy per the American Experience Table of Mortality and 4 1\/2 per cent interest, and no more, and that the same should be paid in manner and form as provided in the policy for the payment thereof in the event of death. The defense was that the insured committed suicide, and that the full net value of the policy, according to the contract, was only $814.50, and no more. The defense was overruled and judgment given for the principal sum. That judgment was affirmed in the court of appeals, the court saying: 'The plain purpose of the statute, supra, was to prevent the insertion in policies of life insurance of exceptions to liability on the ground of the suicide of the insured, unless it could be proven 'that the insured contemplated suicide at the time he made the application for the policy.' This was, in effect, a legislative declaration of the public policy of this state. That it was intended to limit the power to contract for a lesser liability in cases of death by suicide, not within the limitation expressed in the statute, is also apparent from its terms, to wit: 'And any stipulation to the contrary shall be void.' . . . The fact that the premium warranted, and the policy guaranteed, full insurance in case of the death of the insured for any cause not specified in the clause set up in the defendant's answer, demonstrates that said clause was designed to modity the liability of the \n\n[205 U.S. 489, 501]\n\u00a0\n insurance company if the insured committed suicide. It necessarily follows, if this stipulation as to a decreased liability in the event of death by suicide is enforced, that it is some defense to the otherwise full liability agreed upon in the policy. As the statute in question declares that suicide, not committed as therein set forth, is 'no defense,' we cannot hold that the present stipulation can be enforced without violating the plain terms of a mandatory statute which the parties have no power to alter or abrogate.'\n Without further discussion, we adjudge that, under the statute in question, anything to the contrary in the policy issued by the insurance company notwithstanding, where liability upon a life policy is denied simply because of the suicide of the insured, the beneficiary of the policy can recover the whole of the principal sum, unless it be shown that the insured, at the time of his application for the policy, contemplated suicide. The judgment must, therefore, be reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion and consistent with law.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","182":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWILMINGTON STAR MINING CO. v. FULTON(1907)\nNo. 139\nArgued: Decided: March 4, 1907\n\n\n\n Messrs. William P. Sidley, Charles S. Holt, and Arthur D. Wheeler for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[205 U.S. 60, 62]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Arthur J. Eddy, P. C. Haley, and E. C. Wetten for defendant in error.\n\n\n[205 U.S. 60, 64]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n On January 27, 1901, Samuel Fulton, while working as a trackman and mine laborer in a mine operated by the Wilmington Star Mining Company, in Grundy county, Illinois, was killed by an explosion of mine gas. Minnie Fulton, the widow, on behalf of herself and children, brought this action against the mining company in a court of the state of Illinois to recover damages for the death of her husband. Because of diversity of citizenship the case was removed to the circuit court of the United States for the northern district of Illinois.\n The counts of the petition upon which the cause was ultimately tried were eight in number, and in each was set out a specified act of negligence averred to have been the proximate cause of the accident and to have constituted wilful failure to perform specified statutory duties. In count 1 it was alleged that the mining company failed to maintain in the mine currents of fresh air sufficient for the health and safety \n\n[205 U.S. 60, 65]\n\u00a0\n of Fulton. Count 2 charged the failure to maintain crosscuts in the mine at proper distances apart, to secure the best ventilation at the face of the working places. In count 3 the company was charged with having failed to build all necessary stoppings in a substantial manner to close crosscuts connecting the inlet and outlet air courses in the mine. In count 4 the negligence set up was the failure to have the place in the mine where Fulton was expected to pass and to work inspected before Fulton was permitted to enter the mine, to asecrtain whether there were accumulations of gas therein. In count 5 it was charged that the mining company, with knowledge of the existence of an accumulation of dangerous gases in the mine and its unsafe condition when Fulton, in the course of his employment, entered the mine on the morning of his death, wilfully failed and neglected to prevent Fulton from entering the mine to work therein before the dangerous gases had been removed and the conditions in the mine rendered safe, said Fulton not being then and there under the direction of the mine manager. In count 6 it was charged that the mining company, on the morning of the accident, had knowledge that a valve attachment of a certain steam pipe used to conduct steam generated for the purpose of running a ventilating fan in the mine had become accidentally broken or lost, whereby the air currents in the mine became obstructed and stopped, and a large quantity of dangerous gas was permitted to accumulate in the mine at the place where Fulton was required to pass and to work. And it was further charged that, although having such knowledge, the mining company wilfully failed and neglected to order the withdrawal of Fulton from the mine and prohibit his return thereto until thorough ventilation had been established. In count 7 the negligence charged was that the mining company permitted Fulton to enter the mine before the mine examiner had visited it and seen that the air current was traveling in proper course and in proper quantity, and before the accumulation of dangerous gas, then in the mine, had been broken up or removed therefrom. In count 8 \n\n[205 U.S. 60, 66]\n\u00a0\n it was charged that the mining company had knowledge that accumulations of gas existed in the mine, yet it wilfully failed and neglected to place a conspicuous mark at the place in the mine where accumulations of gas existed, as a notice to Fulton and other employees to keep out, whereby Fulton failed to receive the statutory notice and warning of the existence of accumulated gas, and did not know of the dangerous condition of the mine when he proceeded to work at and near the place in the mine where such dangerous accumulation of gas existed.\n To the various counts the defendant pleaded the general issue. The case was twice tried by a jury. On the first trial, at the close of the evidence for the plaintiff, the jury was instructed to find for the defendant. This judgment was reversed by the circuit court of appeals for the seventh circuit. 68 L.R.A. 168, 66 C. C. A. 247, 133 Fed. 193. The second trial resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff and an entry of the judgment which is here assailed.\n On the trial it was testified that the sinking of the shaft in the mine where Fulton met his death was commenced in the month of April or May, 1900. Fulton worked for several months at the mine before the accident, at first assisting in sinking the shaft. The mine is what is known as a long- wall mine, in which, it was testified, crosscuts were not employed. Crosscuts are used in what is known as a room and pillar mine. In that class of mines parallel entries are run, and after proceeding a certain distance-usually 60 feet-a road is cut across, connecting the parallel entries, to permit of a circulation of air. After going another 60 feet a new crosscut is made and the openings of the prior crosscut are stopped up, thus carrying the circulation of air to the new crosscut. The mine in question was not thus intended to be constructed. From the bottom of the main or hoisting shaft towards the north, south, east, and west radiated four main headings or roadways, and it was contemplated to construct a circular road connecting the outer ends of these four main roads so as to cause a complete circulation of air around the mine and through the \n\n[205 U.S. 60, 67]\n\u00a0\n roadways. About 300 feet to the eastward of the main shaft was situated an air or escapement shaft. At the time of the accident the roads radiating north, east, and west had been completed, but the circular roadway had only been completed between the outer edges of the east and north roads. Gas usually made its presence known in the west roadway after going 50 or 60 feet from the bottom of the main shaft. For some time before the accident men were employed at or near the end of this road, continuing the circular road towards the northeast, and Fulton performed the work of track laying. In consequence of the noncompletion of the circular roadway and the absence of natural ventilation in the west roadway, a ventilating fan was used to force air through air boxes to the places where the men were working in that roadway, 'so as to give them air and keep the gases out.' Whilst there is some confusion in the description of the situation and operation of the ventilating fan, we take it that it was as follows: The fan was situated at the bottom of the shaft and was operated by a small engine in close proximity to the fan. The steam to work this engine was carried down from the boilers above, the steam pipe passing down the main shaft to the fan engine at the bottom. To turn on the steam to this engine and set it in motion there was a valve controlled by a wheel. There was another valve by which the accumulation of condensed water could be let off so as to enable the apparatus to be reached by live steam. This valve was intended also to be moved by a wheel, but that appliance had not been put on, and, therefore, in order to turn the valve the use of a wrench was necessary. A wrench used for this purpose was kept near the fan.\n The mine manager stopped the fan about 4 o'clock on Saturday afternoon. On the next day (Sunday) Fulton and the mine manager descended the shaft together. The fan had not started when they reached the bottom of the shaft. The mine manager attempted to start the fan, but could not find the wrench, and there was a delay of a minute or two \n\n[205 U.S. 60, 68]\n\u00a0\n while he went up the shaft and secured a wrench. When the fan was started the mine examiner and several other employees who had descended the mine just ahead of Fulton and the mine manager were with the latter in the immediate vicinity of the fan. At that time, as testified to by the mine manager, he believed there was gas in the west roadway. Soon after the starting of the fan Fulton and a helper proceeded along the west roadway with pit lamps-naked lights-on their caps, pushing a car loaded with track material. In a few minutes the explosion occurred which caused the death of Fulton and seriously injured the helper. There was contradictory evidence as to the instructions given by the mine manager to Fulton at the time he started into the west roadway. One version was that Fulton was told to wait awhile, until an examination had been made by the mine manager with a safety lamp. Another version implied from the evidence was that Fulton, entirely of his own volition, proceeded to the place where he was injured; and still another hypothesis was that Fulton was directed to proceed with the work without any caution. At the time of the explosion the mine manager, mine examiner, and others were in the south roadway.\n After the entry of judgment the cause was brought direct to this court on the ground that a constitutional right was claimed in the court below and denied.\n The errors assigned which have been argued at bar present for consideration the following question:\n First, the constitutionality of the Illinois mining act of 1899, upon which this action was founded.\n Second, the correctness of instructions to the jury on the subject of the proximate cause of the accident in the event Fulton went into the west roadway by direction of the mine manager.\n Third, the correctness of a refusal to instruct the jury to return a verdict for the defendant if they found that 'Fulton, at the time he was killed, was engaged in a wilful act which endangered the lives or health of persons working in the mine \n\n[205 U.S. 60, 69]\n\u00a0\n with him or the security of the mine or its machinery, and that such wilful act on his part contributed to his death.'\n Fourth, the correctness of a refusal to instruct the jury that, if the death of Fulton resulted in part from his reckless disregard of consequences, in view of his own surroundings, the plaintiff could not recover.\n Fifth, the correctness of the overruling of motions to strike out the 2d and 3d counts of the declaration, and of the refusal to instruct the jury that no recovery could be had on these counts, because no evidence had been introduced to support the same.\n Sixth, the correctness of the refusal to give the following instructions:\n'If you believe from the evidence that the decedent, Fulton, just before the time of his death, entered the mine to work therein under the direction of the mine manager, Wilson, then you are directed to find the defendant 'not guilty,' even though you may further believe from the evidence that all the conditions of the mine had not been made safe at such time, as charged in the declaration.'\n\n Seventh, the correctness of the overruling of a motion to strike out the 5th count of the declaration, and in refusing to instruct the jury that no recovery could be had under said count, because no basis existed in the evidence for the asserted liability.\n Eighth, the correctness of the overruling of a motion to strike out the 6th count of the declaration and a request for an instruction that no evidence had been introduced of any neglect as to the fan or machinery whereby the air currents of the mine became obstructed and stopped.\n Before considering these alleged errors, however, we must dispose of a motion to dismiss. It is urged that as the direct appeal to this court rests alone upon the assertion of the repugnancy of the Illinois mining act to the Constitution of the United States, and as the claim of repugnancy is alone based upon certain provisions of that act providing for licensing \n\n[205 U.S. 60, 70]\n\u00a0\n mine managers and examiners, defining their duties, and compelling mine owners to employ only licensed managers and examiners, the writ of error should be dismissed, because there is ground broad enough to sustain the judgment wholly irrespective of the provisions of the Illinois act just referred to, which are asserted to be repugnant to the Constitution of the United States. This proposition is based upon the contention that the 1st count of the declaration charges a violation of duty imposed by the statute directly upon the mine owner, irrespective of the requirements of the statute as to licensed employees. But issue is taken on behalf of the plaintiff in error in respect to the correctness of this contention, and it is insisted that the 1st count is open to the same objections which are urged against the others. We think the motion to dismiss is without merit, because there is color for the contention as to the unconstitutionality of the statute, as well in respect to the first as to the other counts of the declaration.\n We come, then, to consider the first assigned error, viz., the constitutionality of the Illinois mining act approved April 18, 1899, in force July 1, 1899, entitled, 'An Act to Revise the Laws in Relation to Coal Mines and Subjects Relating Thereto, and Providing for the Health and Safety of Persons Employed Therein.' Ill. Rev. Stat. chap. 93.\n It is conceded that the statute in question has been authoritatively interpreted by the supreme court of Illinois as imposing upon mine owners responsibility for the defaults of mine managers and mine examiners,- employees who are required by the statute to be selected by the mine owners from those holding licenses issued by the state mining board created by the statute. And it is an alleged incompatibility between such responsibility of the mine owner and the obligation imposed upon the mine owner to employ only persons licensed by the state, and the nature and character of the duties which the statute imposes upon them, upon which is based the asserted repugnancy of the statute to the 14th Amendment. \n\n[205 U.S. 60, 71]\n\u00a0\n Section 29 of article 4 of the Illinois Constitution of 1870 is as follows:\n'It shall be the duty of the general assembly to pass such laws as may be necessary for the protection of operative miners by providing for ventilation when the same may be required and the construction of escapement shafts, with such other appliances as may secure safety in all coal mines, and to provide for the enforcement of said laws by such penalties and punishments as may be deemed proper.'\n\n In carrying out this constitutional requirement the general assembly of Illinois has, from time to time, legislated for the protection of miners. The act of 1899, here assailed as repugnant to the Constitution of the United States, as said by the court of appeals for the seventh circuit ( 68 L.R.A. 168, 66 C. C. A. 247, 133 Fed. 197), grew out of the desire 'that every precaution should be taken against the unusual hazards and dangers incident to the inhabitancy of mines. It was intended, and intended rightly, to protect with all known expedients every person whose occupation required him to labor in these subterranean rooms and roadways.'\n The act is lengthy, covering 47 pages of print in the appendix to one of the briefs. In substance it created a state mining board, authorized that body to examine candidates for the position of state inspector of mines, and to certify the names of the successful candidates to the governor, in whom was vested the power of appointment. Moreover, the statute fixed the qualifications of mine managers, hoisting engineers, and mine examiners, required candidates for such positions to be examined by the state board, and certificates to be furnished to those found competent, and made it unlawful in the operation of a coal mine to employ or suffer any person, other than one possessing the proper certificate, to serve as a mine manager, hoisting engineer, or mine examiner. Section 16 prescribed in detail the duties of mine managers and miners;  17 set forth the duties of hoisting engineers; and by  18 the duties of mine examiners are prescribed. Interspersed, \n\n[205 U.S. 60, 72]\n\u00a0\n however, throughout the remainder of the act, are found, in sections relating to the subject of ventilation, powder and blast, place of refuge, etc., requirements to be observed in effect supplementing the sections prescribing in detail the duties to be performed by the employees above mentioned. We think the omissions of duty charged in the various counts in the declaration are embraced in those in terms laid upon the mine manager or mine examiner. Considering this act, the supreme court of Illinois, in Henrietta Coal Co. v. Martin, 221 Ill. 460, 77 N. E. 905, first commented upon the decisions in Durkin v. Kingston Coal Co. 171 Pa. 193, 29 L.R.A. 808, 50 Am. St. Rep. 801, 33 Atl. 237, and Williams v. Thacker Coal & Coke Co. 44 W. Va. 599, 40 L.R.A. 812, 30 S. E. 107, which cases dealt with statutes which, in their general purpose, were similar to the Illinois act. The Illinois court declined, however, to hold, as was done in the cases referred to, that, where a statute directly imposed duties upon a mine manager, the negligence of such mine manager could not be imputed to the owner, and, indeed, that the owner could not be made responsible for the act of such employee without causing the statute to be unconstitutional. The Illinois court expressly held that, under the Illinois mining act, a mine manager and mine examiner were vice principals of the owner, and were engaged in the performance of duties which the owner could not delegate to others in such manner as to relieve himself from responsibility. Observing that, in a number of its former decisions, the Illinois court had assumed the law to mean what it expressly decided in the Henrietta Case it did mean, viz., that, in respect to the duties devolved upon the mine manager and mine examiner, those persons stood for the mine owner and were vice principals, performing those duties. The court said:\n'The fact that the proprietor, if he employs men to act in these capacities, is required to employ those who have obtained the certificate from the state mining board, is without significance. The purpose of that provision was, so far as possible, to guard against the possibility of the proprietor employing \n\n[205 U.S. 60, 73]\n\u00a0\n incompetent, intemperate, negligent, or disreputable persons, and not to enable the operator to shift to his employees his responsibility for the management of the mine.\n\n'The object of the mining act, as we gather from its various provisions, is to protect, so far as legislative enactment may, the health and persons of men employed in the mines of the state while they are in the mines. The principal measures prescribed for this purpose require the exercise of greater precaution and care on the part of the mine owner for the safety of the miners than was required by the common law. To hold that he may shift his liability to any person employed by him as examiner or manager who holds the certificate of the state mining board is to lessen his responsibilities, and defeat, in great part, the beneficent purposes of the act. To hold him liable for a wilful violation of the act, or a wilful failure to comply with its provisions on the part of his examiner or manager, is to give force and effect to the statute according to the intent of its makers, and to prolong the lives and promote the safety and well-being of the miners.'\n\n Accepting this interpretation of the Illinois statute, and in view of the ruling in Consolidated Coal Co. v. Seniger, 179 Ill. 370, 374, 375, 53 N. E. 733, that it is not obligatory upon a mine owner to select a particular individual, or to retain one when selected, if found incompetent, we think the act is not repugnant to the 14th Amendment in any particular. In legal effect, duties are imposed upon the mine owner, customarily performed for him by certain employess,-duties which substantially relate to the furnishing of a reasonably safe place for the workmen. The subject was one peculiarly within the police power of the state, and the enactment of the regulations counted upon we think was an appropriate exercise of such power. The use and enjoyment of mining property being subject to the reasonable exercise of the police power of the state, certainly the rights, privileges, and immunities of a mine owner as a citizen of the United States were not invaded by the regulations in question, and the \n\n[205 U.S. 60, 74]\n\u00a0\n imposition of liability upon the owner for the violation of such regulations, being an appropriate exercise of the police power, was not wanting in due process. And even although the liability imposed upon the mine owner to respond in damages for the wilful failure of the mine manager and mine examiner to comply with the requirements of the statute was not in harmony with the principles of the common law applicable to the relation of master and servant, it being competent for the state to change and modify those principles in accord with its conceptions of public policy, we cannot infer that the selection of mine owners as a class upon which to impose the liability in question was purely arbitrary and without reason. And the views just expressed also adequately dispose of the contention that, by the statute, the mine owner was denied the equal protection of the laws.\n The asserted error next to be considered relates to instructions to the jury on the subject of the proximate cause of the accident in the event Fulton went into the west roadway by direction of the mine manager. In the course of the charge to the jury the court said:\n'If you believe from the evidence that Wilson, the mine manager, directed Fulton to go into the west roadway, and that said Fulton did so in obedience to such order, and such order was the proximate cause of Fulton's death, without the giving of which Fulton would not have been killed, then the jury is instructed that the plaintiff cannot recover in this case, and the verdict should be for the defendant. You will note there that it follows, if you believe that this instruction, if there was one, to Fulton, was the proximate cause of his death, note that in passing upon that question you must determinate whether, first, if there was gas there at that time; and whether, if there was, that was or was not the proximate cause of his death. Now, by proximate cause is meant efficient cause. In other words, if the gas had not been there, would his death have followed? And was gas being there necessary to his death? Or was the instruction, if there was \n\n[205 U.S. 60, 75]\n\u00a0\n one there, wilfully sending him there, the thing which caused his death; which was the greater cause? That is a question of fact for you to determine.\n\n ... * *\n'I said it was for them to determine what was the proximate cause if there was an order for this deceased to go into the mine, or whether it was the gas being there. Let the instruction be what I stated now, the last time; that covers it.'\n\n It is contended that the effect of the definitions of proximate cause, made as above, was to hopelessly confuse the jury. While it must be conceded that the instruction was greatly wanting in clearness, yet we think no prejudicial error was committed. Looking at the criticized instructions in connection with the context of the charge, it is clear that it was understood by all as importing that the mining company was at fault for the existence of the accumulated gas, resulting in the explosion which caused the death of Fulton, since to have allowed the gas to accumulate was a disregard of the positive duty towards Fulton imposed by the statute. Now, conceding that the mine manager ordered Fulton into the west roadway, and conceding, further, that such order of the manager was one of the causes of the accident, for which no recovery could be had because not counted on in the declaration, what follows? Simply this, that two concurring causes contributed to the death of Fulton,-one, the order of the mine manager, for which recovery could not be had under the declaration, and the other, the neglect by the mine owner to perform his statutory duty to prevent the accumulation of the dangerous gases which led to the accident. But, because one of the efficient causes, the order of the mine manager, under the pleadings, did not give rise to a right of recovery, it did not follow that therefore the owner was absolved from responsibility for the cause of the accident for which he was liable. Washington & G. R. Co. v. Hickey, \n166 U.S. 521\n, 41 L. ed. 1101, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 661.\n We next consider two contentions: a. That the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury to return a verdict for \n\n[205 U.S. 60, 76]\n\u00a0\n the defendant if they found that Fulton, at the time he was killed, was engaged in a violation of the statute which contributed to his death; that is, the doing of a wilful act which endangered his life and the lives or health of persons working in the mine with him, and which jeopardized the security of the mine or its machinery; and, b. That the court also erred in refusing to instruct that if the death of Fulton resulted in part from his reckless disregard of consequences in view of his known surroundings, the plaintiff could not recover.\n Leaving out of view the contention that the first requested instruction was rightly refused because too general, and bearing in mind that in an action to recover damages under the Illinois mining act a mine owner is deprived of the defense of contributory negligence (Carterville Coal Co. v. Abbott, 181 Ill. 495, 502, 503, 55 N. E. 131), and assuming that the refused instruction might properly have been given if the tendency of the proof justified it, we think the instruction was rightly refused, because we are of opinion that there was no evidence tending to show the doing by Fulton of a wilful act of the character contemplated by the statute, or a reckless disregard by him of his personal safety. While the evidence might have justified the inference that Fulton, before entering the west roadway, knew that it had not been cleared of gas, yet it cannot be inferred that Fulton and his helper suspected that gas had so permeated the roadway as to render it perilous to life to go to the point where the explosion occurred. The jury had been instructed that there could be no recovery if the proof established the contention of the mining company that Fulton entered the part of the mine in which he was killed against or contrary to caution given him by the mine manager, and, if Fulton was permitted to enter the west roadway without caution, it is impossible, on this record, to infer that the jury would have been justified in finding that it was obvious that to enter the west roadway was so hazardous as to give support to the conclusion that Fulton wilfully and recklessly went to his destruction. \n\n[205 U.S. 60, 77]\n\u00a0\n It is asserted that the court erred in refusing to give the following instructions:\n'If you believe from the evidence that the decedent Fulton, just before the time of his death, entered the mine to work therein under the direction of the mine manager, Wilson, then you are directed to find the defendant, 'not guilty,' even though you may further believe from the evidence that all the conditions of the mine had not been made safe at such time, as charged in the declaration.'\n\n The requested charge was based upon the last paragraph of that portion of  18(b) of the Illinois mining act, dealing with the duties of mine examiners, reading as follows:\n'To post danger notices. (b) When working places are discovered in which accumulations of gas, or recent falls, or any dangerous conditions exist, he shall place a conspicuous mark thereat as notice to all men to keep out, and at once report his finding to the mine manager.\n\n'No one shall be allowed to remain in any part of the mine through which gas is being carried into the ventilating current, nor to enter the mine to work therein, except under the direction of the mine manager, until all conditions shall have been made safe.'\n\n We construe this provision of the statute as relating to steps to be taken when a mine or a portion thereof is discovered to be unsafe, and as relating to the necessary work to be done in the mine under the immediate supervision and direction of the mine manager to remedy the unsafe condition. As, however, there is no proof tending to show that Fulton, in entering and working in the mine, came under any of these conditions, we think the instruction was rightly refused.\n The remaining assignments assert the commission of error by the trial court in overruling motions to strike out the 2d, 3d, and 6th counts of the declaration, and in refusing to instruct the jury that no recovery could be had under any of those counts, because no evidence had been introduced tending to establish the commission of the particular \n\n[205 U.S. 60, 78]\n\u00a0\n acts of negligence charged in those counts. Such counts, as we have seen, related to the failure to construct crosscuts and stoppings in the mine, and to an alleged defect resulting from the absence of a wheel, and the consequent necessity of using a wrench for the purpose of opening a valve to allow condensed steam to escape as a prerequisite to the movement of the ventilating fan. We are constrained to the conclusion that prejudicial error was committed in these particulars. We think it is extremely doubtful whether there was any evidence in the record even tending to establish that, in a long-wall mine of the character of the one here in question, crosscuts and stoppings thereof were essential. But be this as it may, certain is it that there is no evidence whatever in the record tending to support the claim that the absence of crosscuts and stoppings in the mine in question was in any wise the cause of the accumulations of gas or the retention of the accumulated gas from the explosion of which Fulton was killed. We are also of opinion that there was nothing in the evidence which would have justified the inference that the absence of the wheel from the valve, forming part of the mechanism to operate the ventilating fan, was the proximate cause of the presence of the gas in the west roadway where Fulton was killed. The uncontradicted testimony showed that but a very brief interval, a minute or two, elapsed before a wrench was obtained, and the distance to the point where the gas had accumulated precludes the possibility of saying that the evidence tended to show that the absence of the wheel could have been the proximate cause of the accident. Under this condition of things we find it impossible to say that prejudicial error did not result. Maryland use of Markley v. Baldwin, \n112 \nU.S. 490, 493\n, 28 S. L. ed. 822, 823, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 278. And, of course, in a case like the one we are considering, we cannot maintain the verdict, as might be done in a criminal case, upon a general verdict of guilty upon all the counts of an indictment. Goode v. United States, \n159 U.S. 663\n, 40 L. ed. 297, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 136. Nor does  57 of the Illinois practice act, chap. 110, Rev. Stat. Illinois, support \n\n[205 U.S. 60, 79]\n\u00a0\n the contention that errors of the character of those we have just been considering must be treated as not prejudicial. The section relied upon is as follows:\n'Whenever an entire verdict shall be given on several counts, the same shall not be set aside or reversed on the ground of any defective count, if one or more of the counts . . . be sufficient to sutain the verdict.'\n\n This section has been held not to relate to counts which are vitally defective, but as only providing that where a declaration consists of several counts, and some of the counts contain defects not vital, and yet subject to be assailed by demurrer, a party cannot wait until after the close of the evidence at the trial, and, a fortiori, after verdict, and then for the first time question the sufficiency of the counts. Chicago v. Lonergan, 196 Ill. 518, 63 N. E. 1018; Consolidated Coal Co. v. Scheiber, 167 Ill. 539, 47 N. E. 1052. This statute, of course, lends no support to the contention here made that where a jury is wrongfully permitted, over the objection of the opposing party, to take into consideration, in reaching a verdict, counts of a declaration which have not been supported by any evidence, and where it is impossible from the record to say upon which of the counts of the declaration the verdict was based, that the judgment entered under such circumstances can be sustained upon the theory that substantial rights of the objecting party had not been invaded.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court is therefore reversed, and the case remanded to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","183":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWILSON v. SHAW(1907)\nNo. 43\nArgued: Decided: January 7, 1907\n\n\n\n In a general way it way be said that this is a suit brought in the supreme court of the District of Columbia by the appellant, alleging himself to be a citizen of Illinois and the owner or property subject to taxation by the United States, \n\n[204 U.S. 24, 25]\n\u00a0\n to restrain the Secretary of the Treasury from paying out money in the purchase of property for the construction of a canal at Panama, from borrowing money on the credit of the United States, from issuing bonds or making any payments under the act of Congress, June 28, 1902 (32 Stat. at L. 481, chap. 1302, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1905, p. 707), providing for the acquisition of property and rights from Colombia and the canal company, and the construction and operation of the canal and the Panama railroad. The Republic of Panama and the New Panama Canal Company of France were named parties defendant, but they were not served with process and made no appearance. A demurrer to the bill was sustained, and the bill dismissed. This decree was affirmed by the court of appeals, from whose decision this appeal was taken.\n Mr. Warren B. Wilson, in propria persona, for appellant.\n\n\n[204 U.S. 24, 28]\n\u00a0\n Solicitor General Hoyt, Assistant Attorney General Russell, and Mr. Glenn E. Husted for appellee.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Brewer:\n\n\n[204 U.S. 24, 30]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brewer delivered the opinion of the court:\n If the bill was only to restrain the Secretary of the Treasury from paying the specific sums named therein, to wit, $40,000,000 to the Panama Canal Company, and $10,000,000 to the Republic of Panama, it would be sufficient to note the fact, of which we may take judicial notice, that those payments have been made, and that whether they were rightfully made or not is, so far as this suit is concerned, a moot question. Cheong Ah Moy v. United States, \n113 U.S. 216\n, 28 L. ed. 983, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 431; Mills v. Green, \n159 U.S. 651\n, 40 L. ed. 293, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 132; American Book Co. v. Kansas, \n193 U.S. 49\n, 48 L. ed. 613, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 394; Jones v. Montague, \n194 U.S. 147\n, 48 L. ed. 913, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 611.\n But the bill goes further and seeks to restrain the Secretary from paying out money for the construction of the canal, from borrowing money for that purpose and issuing bonds of the United States therefor. In other words, the plaintiff invokes the aid of the courts to stop the government of the United States from carrying into execution its declared purpose of constructing the Panama canal. The magnitude of the plaintiff's demand is somewhat startling. The construction of a canal between the Atlantic and Pacific somewhere across the narrow strip of land which unites the two continents of America has engaged the attention, not only of the United States, but of other countries, for many years. Two routes, the Nicaraugua and the Panama, have been the special objects of consideration. A company chartered under the laws of France undertook the construction of a canal at Panama. This was done under the superintendence and guidance of the famous Ferdinand de Lesseps, to whom the world owes the Suez canal. To tell the story of all that was done in respect \n\n[204 U.S. 24, 31]\n\u00a0\n to the construction of this canal, prior to the active intervention of the United States, would take volumes. It is enough to say that the efforts of De Lesseps failed. Since then Panama has seceded from the Republic of Colombia and established a new republic, which has been recognized by other nations. This new republic has by treaty granted to the United States rights, territorial and otherwise. Acts of Congress have been passed providing for the construction of a canal, and in many ways the executive and legislative departments of the government have committed the United States to this work, and it is now progressing. For the courts to interfere, and, at the instance of a citizen, who does not disclose the amount of his interest, stay the work of construction by stopping the payment of money from the Treasury of the United States therefor, would be an exercise of judicial power which, to say the least, is novel and extraordinary.\n Many objections may be raised to the bill. Among them are these: Does plaintiff show sufficient pecuniary interest in the subject-matter? Is not the suit really one against the government, which has not consented to be sued? Is it any more than an appeal to the courts for the exercise of governmental powers which belong exclusively to Congress? We do not stop to consider these or kindred objections; yet, passing them in silence must not be taken as even an implied ruling against their sufficiency. We prefer to rest our decision on the general scope of the bill.\n Clearly there is no merit in plaintiff's contentions. That, generally speaking, a citizen may be protected against wrongful acts of the government affecting him or his property may be conceded. That his remedy is by injunction does not follow. A suit for an injunction is an equitable proceeding, and the interests of the defendant are to be considered as well as those of the plaintiff. Ordinarily it will not be granted when there is adequate protection at law. In the case at bar it is clear not only that plaintiff is not entitled to an injunction, but also that he presents no ground for any relief. \n\n[204 U.S. 24, 32]\n\u00a0\n He contends that whatever title the government has was not acquired as provided in the act of June 28, 1902, by treaty with the Republic of Colombia. A short but sufficient answer is that subsequent ratification is equivalent to original authority. The title to what may be called the Isthmian or canal zone, which, at the date of the act, was in the Republic of Colombia, passed by an act of secession to the newly formed Republic of Panama. The latter was recognized as a nation by the President. A treaty with it, ceding the canal zone, was duly ratified. 33 Stat. at L. 2234. Congress has passed several acts based upon the title of the United States, among them one to provide a temporary government (33 Stat. at L. 429, chap. 1758, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1905, p. 711); another, fixing the status of merchandise coming into the United States from the canal zone (33 Stat. at L. 843, chap. 1311, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1905, p. 394); another, prescribing the type of canal (34 Stat. at L. 611, chap. 3597). These show a full ratification by Congress of what has been done by the Executive. Their concurrent action is conclusive upon the courts. We have no supervising control over the political branch of the government in its action within the limits of the Constitution. Jones v. United States, \n137 U.S. 202\n, 34 L. ed. 691, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 80, and cases cited in the opinion; Re Cooper, \n143 \nU.S. 472, 499\n, 503 S., 36 L. ed. 232, 240, 242, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 453.\n It is too late in the history of the United States to question the right of acquiring territory by treaty. Other objections are made to the validity of the right and title obtained from Panama by the treaty, but we find nothing in them deserving special notice.\n Another contention, in support of which plaintiff has presented a voluminous argument, is that the United States has no power to engage in the work of digging this canal. His first proposition is that the canal zone is no part of the territory of the United States, and that, therefore, the government is powerless to do anything of the kind therein. Article 2 of the treaty, heretofore referred to, 'grants to the United States in perpetuity the use, occupation, and control of a zone of land and land under water for the construction, maintenance, operation, sanitation, and protection of said \n\n[204 U.S. 24, 33]\n\u00a0\n canal.' By article 3, Panama 'grants to the United States all the rights, power, and authority within the zone mentioned and described in article 2 of this agreement, . . . which the United States would possess and exercise if it were the sovereign of the territory within which said lands and waters are located, to the entire exclusion of the exercise by the Republic of Panama of any such sovereign rights, power, or authority.'\n Other provisions of the treaty add to the grants named in these two articles further guaranties of exclusive rights of the United States in the construction and maintenance of this canal. It is hypercritical to contend that the title of the United States is imperfect, and that the territory described does not belong to this nation, because of the omission of some of the technical terms used in ordinary conveyances of real estate.\n Further, it is said that the boundaries of the zone are not described in the treaty; but the description is sufficient for identification, and it has been practically identified by the concurrent action of the two nations alone interested in the matter. The fact that there may possibly be in the future some dispute as to the exact boundary on either side is immaterial. Such disputes not infrequently attend conveyances of real estate or cessions of territory. Alaska was ceded to us forty years ago, but the boundary between it and the English possessions east was not settled until within the last two or three years. Yet no one ever doubted the title of this Republic to Alaska.\n Again, plaintiff contends that the government has no power to engage anywhere in the work of constructing a railroad or canal. The decisions of this court are adverse to this contention. In California v. Central P. R. Co. \n127 \nU.S. 1, 39\n, 32 S. L. ed. 150, 157, 2 Inters. Com. Rep. 153, 160, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1073, 1080, it was said:\n'It cannot at the present day be doubted that Congress, under the power to regulate commerce among the several states, as well as to provide for postal accommodations and \n\n[204 U.S. 24, 34]\n\u00a0\n military exigencies, had authority to pass these laws. The power to construct, or to authorize individuals or corporations to construct, national highways and bridges from state to state, is essential to the complete control and regulation of interstate commerce. Without authority in Congress to establish and maintain such highways and bridges, it would be without authority to regulate one of the most important adjuncts of commerce. This power in former times was exerted to a very limited extent, the Cumberland or National road being the most notable instance. Its exertion was but little called for, as commerce was then mostly conducted by water, and many of our statesmen entertained doubts as to the existence of the power to establish ways of communication by land. But since, in consequence of the expansion of the country, the multiplication of its products, and the invention of railroads and locomotion by steam, land transportation has so vastly increased, a sounder consideration of the subject has prevailed and led to the conclusion that Congress has plenary power over the whole subject. Of course the authority of Congress over the territories of the United States, and its power to grant franchises exercisable therein, are, and ever have been, undoubted. But the wider power was very freely exercised, and much to the general satisfaction, in the creation of the vast system of railroads connecting the East with the Pacific, traversing states as well as territories, and employing the agency of state as well as Federal corporations. See Pacific Railroad Removal Cases, \n115 \nU.S. 1, 14\n, 18 S., 29 L. ed. 319, 323, 325, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1113.'\n\n In Luxton v. North River Bridge Co. \n153 \nU.S. 525, 529\n, 38 S. L. ed. 808, 810, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 891, 892, Mr. Justice Gray, speaking for the court, says:\n'Congress, therefore, may create corporations as appropriate means of executing the powers of government; as, for instance, a bank for the purpose of carrying on the fiscal operations of the United States, or a railroad corporation for the purpose of promoting commerce among the states. M'Culloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 411, 422, 4 L. ed. 579, 602, 605; Osborn v. Bank of United States, 9 Wheat. 738, 861, 873, 6 L. ed. 204, 233, 236; Pacific Railroad Removal Cases, \n\n[204 U.S. 24, 35]\n\u00a0\n \n115 \nU.S. 1, 18\n, 29 S. L. ed. 319, 325, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1113; California v. Central P. R. Co. \n127 \nU.S. 1, 39\n, 32 S. L. ed. 150, 157, 2 Inters. Com. Rep. 153, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1073. Congress has likewise the power, exercised early in this century by successive acts in case of the Cumberland or National road, from the Potomac across the Alleghenies to the Ohio, to authorize the construction of a public highway connecting several states. See Indiana v. United States, \n148 U.S. 148\n, 37 L. ed. 401, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 564.'\n\n See also Monongahela Nav. Co. v. United States, \n148 U.S. 312\n, 37 L. ed. 463, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 622.\n These authorities recognize the power of Congress to construct interstate highways. A fortiori, Congress would have like power within the territories and outside of state lines, for there the legislative power of Congress is limited only by the provisions of the Constitution, and cannot conflict with the reserved power of the states. Plaintiff, recognizing the force of these decisions, seeks to obviate it by saying that the expressions were obiter dicta; but plainly they were not. They announce distinctly the opinion of this court on the questions presented, and would have to be overruled if a different doctrine were now announced. Congress has acted in reliance upon these decisions in many ways, and any change would disturb a vast volume of rights supposed to be fixed; but we see no reason to doubt the conclusions expressed in those opinions, and adhere to them. The court of Appeals was right, and its decision is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","184":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nYATES v. JONES NAT. BANK(1907)\nNo. 230\nArgued: Decided: May 13, 1907\n\n\n\n Messrs. Halleck F. Rose, J. W. Deweese, and Frank E. Bishop for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n[206 U.S. 158, 161]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Lionel C. Burr, John J. Thomas, Charles L. Burr, Richard S. Norval, and William B. C. Brown for defendant in error. \n\n[206 U.S. 158, 162]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n This writ of error is prosecuted to secure the reversal of a judgment of the supreme court of the state of Nebraska, \n\n[206 U.S. 158, 163]\n\u00a0\n affirming one entered by a court of Seward county, in that state, upon a verdict of a jury awarding damages against the defendants below, plaintiffs in error here, because of certain acts charged to have been done by them as officers and directors of the Capital National Bank of Lincoln, Nebraska.\n We briefly summarize a statement contained in the opinion of the court below concerning a prior action between the same parties. That action, and three others of like character, brought by different plaintiffs, were begun in a county different from that in which the present one was commenced, and recovery was sought, with one exception, from those who were defendants below in this case, of the sum of a loss occasioned by the insolvency and suspension of the Capital National Bank, a corporation organized under the national bank act. The actions referred to were removed into a circuit court of the United States, and in each a motion to remand was overruled, and in one of the cases (brought by Thomas Bailey) the circuit court sustained a demurrer to the petition and dismissed the cause, and the judgment so doing was affirmed by the circuit court of appeals. 11 C. C. A. 304, 27 U. S. App. 339, 63 Fed. 488. The plaintiffs in the other cases thereupon dismissed their actions and commenced new ones, as also did Bailey, in Seward county, of which the case before us is one. The same persons who were impleaded in the prior actions were made defendants, and in two of the actions one Thompson, a director of the bank, who had not been previously sued, was joined as a defendant. The defendants were sought to be made liable for acts done as officers and directors of the Capital National Bank, although it was not expressly alleged that the bank was organized under the national bank act. Reliance in each action was placed upon alleged untrue written and oral statements and representations of the financial condition of the bank, alleged to have been made and published by the defendants, which were fully set out in various forms of expression, but in none of the averments was it specifically asserted that the acts in question were done in consequence of and in com- \n\n[206 U.S. 158, 164]\n\u00a0\n pliance with the provisions of the national bank act, although the exhibits attached to the petition disclosed the character of the written reports, which were in part relied upon. The state court overruled an application to remove, and, a transcript of the record having been filed in the circuit court, on motion the action was, by that court, remanded to the state court, upon the ground that the petition was 'clearly based, not upon the provisions of the national banking act, but upon the liability claimed to arise under the principles of the common law.' See Bailey v. Mosher, 74 Fed. 15.\n An amended petition was filed, changing somewhat the averments originally made, and supplementing the same by new allegations. After a considerable lapse of time a second amended petition was filed. This latter enumerated many acts of negligence and mismanagement in the conduct of the affairs of the failed bank charged to have caused its insolvency, in addition to the averments which had been made in the original petition. The defendants demurred on the ground of want of jurisdiction, because the result of the pleading as amended was to demonstrate that the whole cause of action relied upon was based upon the violation by the defendants of provisions of the national bank act, and because, under that act, no cause of action in favor of the plaintiff was stated. The day the demurrer was filed the action was removed by the defendants to the circuit court of the United States. That court overruled a motion to remand (see Bailey v. Mosher, 95 Fed. 223), and subsequently the court sustained the demurrer and dismissed the action. Reviewing the action of the circuit court, however, the circuit court of appeals held that in any event the removal had been made too late, 'and that the judgment of the lower court dismissing the plaintiff's case was rendered without lawful jurisdiction over the case.' 46 C. C. A. 471, 107 Fed. 561. As a result the case went back to the state court, and in that court the demurrer to the second amended petition was argued and overruled.\n There was judgment against Stuart, one of the defendants \n\n[206 U.S. 158, 165]\n\u00a0\n for failure to answer the original petition, and this judgment was affirmed by the supreme court of Nebraska. Stuart v. Bank of Staplehurst, 57 Neb. 570, 78 N. W. 298. A separate answer to the second amended petition was filed on behalf of the defendant Thompson and a joint answer on behalf of the defendants Yates and Hamer. In the answer of Thompson it was averred that, while a stockholder, he was not a director of the Capital National Bank at the time the plaintiff made its various deposits; it was denied that any of the reports set out and referred to in the petition were signed or attested by Thompson, and specifically for himself he denied 'all alleged misconduct and mismanagement of said bank on his part, and all of the alleged neglect of duty and the causing of the insolvency of said bank, as charged in the said amended petition.'\n The following paragraph was also set up in the answer:\n'This defendant further says that the cause of action set out in the plaintiff's amended petition, if it have any, is founded upon alleged facts which, if true, constitute a violation by this defendant, as a director or stockholder, of his duties as such director or stockholder, as laid down and defined in the national banking laws of the United States above referred to, concerning the government and management of national banks. And this defendant alleges that if any liability attaches to him as a director or stockholder of said bank for any act done or duty neglected as set forth in said amended petition or otherwise, that such liability is determined and controlled by the national banking act concerning the management of national banks; and that, in determining the liability of this defendant, there is necessarily involved the construction of said national banking act relating to the duties of directors and stockholders of national banks. That a Federal question is involved in determining the liability of this defendant by reason of the alleged mismanagement of said bank and the alleged neglect of duty on the part of this defendant.'\n\n Matter alleged to constitute an estoppel against the further prosecution of the action, and to operate as a bar to recovery, \n\n[206 U.S. 158, 166]\n\u00a0\n was set up in special defenses, which need not, however, be further noticed.\n The answers of Yates and Hamer were similar in effect to that of Thompson, except as to the allegation that Thompson was not a director when the plaintiff made his deposits.\n The cause was put at issue. Before the trial three of the defendants- Walsh, Hamer, and Phillips-died, and the action was revived against the administrator of Walsh and Hamer, but was not prosecuted further against the estate of Phillips. The companion actions brought by different plaintiffs were tried with the case at bar by a jury, and there was verdict against all the defendants then before the court, upon which judgment was entered except as to the administrator of Walsh, in whose favor judgment was entered by the court upon special findings as to him made by the jury. After the correction of an error in the amount of the judgment the case was taken to the supreme court of Nebraska, where the judgment was affirmed. 105 N. W. 287. This writ of error was then sued out, apparently on behalf of all the defendants. We assume, however, that Charles W. Mosher and R. C. Outcalt, two of the defendants below, have abandoned the prosecution of the writ. We so assume because no cost bond appears to have been furnished by either; because neither has appeared at the bar by counsel and no brief in their behalf has been filed, and, on the contrary, in the brief of the defendants in error it is stated that the persons named did not prosecute error, which we take to mean that the parties referred to have abandoned in this court the prosecution of the writ of error which was sued out in their names, and because the bill of exceptions does not contain the answers of those defendants nor the evidence relating to their case, which would be pertinent to consider if we were called upon to determine whether prejudicial error was committed as to them. None of the remaining plaintiffs in error were officers of the bank, and they were sued simply for acts done as directors thereof. \n\n[206 U.S. 158, 167]\n\u00a0\n A motion to dismiss first requires attention. The asserted want of jurisdiction in this court in based upon the contention that no Federal question was raised in or decided by the state court. But, as will hereafter appear, the record plainly shows that both in the trial and appellate courts an immunity was claimed under  5239 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3515), at least in respect to the rule of liability applied below, and such immunity was expressly denied by the state court, and there is, therefore, jurisdiction, even if, in other respects, jurisdiction might not be exercised, as to which we are not called upon to decide.

Rep. 496.\n To dispose of the controversy presented by the record before us we need only consider the following assignments of error:\n'7. The court has erred in deciding that the fact that those plaintiffs in error who were directors were without knowledge of any falsity of the reports attested by them or some of them, mentioned in the petition, was immaterial, and that such directors or any of them were liable under the proofs showing that they were without knowledge of the falsity of such reports; the said decision is in violation of the provisions of  5239 of the Revised Statutes of the United States, which makes liability of the directors dependent upon the fact that they knowingly violated or knowingly permitted the violation of the provisions of the national banking act, and participated in or assented to such violation.\n\n'8. The court has erred in deciding that a common-law action of deceit based upon reports of the Capital National Bank made to the Comptroller of the Currency and attested by the directors of such bank can be maintained against such directors, without knowledge of any false statements in such reports, and without any participation in or assent to any violation of the national banking act as essential elements \n\n[206 U.S. 158, 168]\n\u00a0\n of the cause of action as required by  5239 of the Revised Statutes of the United States.'\n\n The basis for these assignments is found not only in instruction given by the trial court, but in refusals to give instructions asked by the defendants. The instructions given, which are pertinent to the assignments, and which were duly excepted to below, read as follows:\n'Bank officers and directors who make or participate in a published report of the financial condition of the banks of which they are such officers and directors may become liable for damages sustained by one depositing money in such bank in reliance upon the false representation of the condition of the bank contained in the report, even though such director of officer did not know that his report so published was in fact false or untrue.\n\n'The director of a bank who publishes or participates in the publication of a report of its condition, by such act asserts that the statements contained in such report are substantially true, and he cannot rely upon his ignorance of the true condition of the bank as a defense to an action, when he, in such published reports, represents the bank to be solvent, if in truth it is not solvent and its assets are fictitious or worthless or its liabilities so much greater than its assets as to render the bank insolvent.\n\n'A director or executive of a national bank is responsible for the making and publication of a false report of its financial condition, though he did not personally make and publish such statement, if he, in any manner, participated in the making or publication thereof. A director of a national bank is presumed to know its true condition and that the law requires a true statement of its affairs to be made and published by the bank from time to time, and if one has been a director or executive officer of such a bank for a long period of time he is presumed to have knowledge of the making and publishing of the statements of its condition, and the burden is cast upon him to overcome this presumption by competent evidence. \n\n[206 U.S. 158, 169]\n\u00a0\n 'The jury are instructed that inasmuch as the law required that all reports made by a national bank to the Comptroller of the Currency shall be published at the expense of the bank, in a newspaper at the place where the bank is established, you have a right to consider such published reports as have been introduced in evidence in this action, purporting to have been signed and whose names appear in such published reports as having been authorized by such defendants so appearing to have signed the same.'\n\n Of the instructions refused, to which exceptions was taken, we need only quote the following:\n'The jury are instructed that if you find from the evidence introduced in reference to any one of the directors named in any one of the said cases that such director did not knowingly violate any of the requirements of the national banking act under which he was acting as such director, but acted in good faith, trusting and confiding in the officers, agents of the bank, having no reason to suspect the integrity and honesty of any one of such officers and agents, then you are instructed that your verdict should be in favor of such defendant.'\n\n Concering the cause of action and the proof required to justify a recovery, the supreme court of Nebraska said:\n'The petitions show misfeasance and mismanagement on the part of the defendants, as officers of the bank, and that the bank thereby sustained damages, but they show more than that. They show that the defendants made and published false and misleading statements concerning the financial condition of the bank, whereby the plaintiffs were induced to become and remain its creditors, to their damage. In short, whatever other allegation may be contained in the petition, they also contain sufficient to constitute a common-law action for deceit. That the party upon whom the deceit or imposition was practised by the officers of a national bank may maintain an action against them in his own name and behalf for damages resulting to him thereform, and that his right of \n\n[206 U.S. 158, 170]\n\u00a0\n action does not rest on the Federal statutes, but the common law, is no longer an open question.\n\n ... * *\n'It was incumbent on the plaintiffs to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence: (1) That the defendants published the statements purporting to show the financial condition of the Capital National Bank or participated in the publication thereof; (2) That such statements were false; (3) That the plaintiffs severally relied upon such statements and believed them to be true, and were thereby misled, to their injury. As to the first proposition, the evidence shows that none of the statements were actually made by all of the defendants, but that each defendant participated in making some of them. It is urged on behalf of the defendant Thompson that he participated in making but one of them. That is a mistake; the evidence is conclusive that he signed and participated in making at least four of them, the first being that made and published December 28, 1886, the last, that made and published July 9, 1891. The mistake arises, perhaps, from the construction which the defendants seem to place on the petitions. The petitions set out two of the statements at length, but it is also alleged that at divers other times and dates, between the 28th day of December, 1886, and the 21st day of January, 1893, the defendants made and published other false and misleading reports purporting to show the condition of the bank which were relied upon by the plaintiff. The defendants appear to take the position that plaintiffs should be restricted to the two reports set out at length. We do not think so. The allegations of the petitions are sufficiently broad to admit proof of any and all statements made on and between the dates just mentioned. If definiteness and certainty required all such statements to be set out at length, the remedy was by motion.'\n\n It is not to be doubted that, although the plaintiff alleged the making of false verbal and written statements, there was no attempt to establish any verbal misrepresentations. It is \n\n[206 U.S. 158, 171]\n\u00a0\n also certain, even if it be conceded, arguendo, that there was some evidence tending to show the making of alleged written representations other than those contained in the official reports made by the association to the Comptroller of the Currency, and published in conformity to the national bank act, that such latter statements were counted upon in the amended petition, and were, if not exclusively, certainly principally, the grounds of the alleged false representations covered by the proof. Under this state of the record, irrespective of the nature and extent of the proof required to maintain an action of deceit at common law, the question is: Did the supreme court of Nebraska rightfully decide that the plaintiff was entitled to recover against the defendant directors upon proof merely of the following facts: '(1) That the defendants published the statements purporting to show the financial condition of the Capital National Bank or participated in the publication thereof; (2) That such statements were false; (3) That the plaintiffs severally relied upon such statements and believed them to be true, and were thereby misled, to their injury?' And the exact import of the propositions which were thus stated by the court below and were made the test of the right of the plaintiff to recover is plainly shown by an opinion of the Nebraska court cited in its opinion in this case; viz., Gerner v. Mosher, 58 Neb. 135, 46 L.R.A. 244, 78 N. W. 384, which involved the liability of the directors of the very same national bank with whose failure this record is concerned. The court said:\n'The defendants in the present suit, who, as directors, attested the reports made by the Capital National Bank to the Comptroller of the Currency, by such act vouched for, or certified to, the absolute truthfulness of the statements therein contained, and not that the report was correct so far as the directors knew or had been advised by the proper performance of their duties as directors. The means of information, this record shows, were accessible to them. It was their duty to know whether the reports were correct or not.\n\n ... * * \n\n[206 U.S. 158, 172]\n\u00a0\n 'In our view, whether the attesting directors possessed knowledge of the falsity of their reports is wholly immaterial. They were in fact false and untrue, and those who deposited money with the bank, or who purchased stock of the corporation, in reliance upon the truthfulness of the contents of those reports, were as much deceived and damaged thereby as though the directors, when they signed the reports, knew them to be false. That they were innocent of the true situation or condition of the affairs of the bank is wholly an unimportant consideration, since proof of a scienter is not necessary to a recovery. This court has frequently asserted that, to maintain an action for false representations, it is not essential that it be shown that they were intentionally or knowingly made by the defendant. This is the rule in ordinary causes, and no valid reason can be suggested or pointed out why the same principle should not apply in actions for deceit against the directors of a banking corporation. Certainly no case has come under out observation which has made an exception in their favor.'\n The proper solution of the question above propounded necessitates a consideration of the legislation of Congress respecting national banks.\n By  24 of the national bank act of February 25, 1863 (chap. 58, 12 Stat. at L. 665, 671), each association was required to make and forward to the Comptroller of the Currency quarterly reports, containing 'a true statement of the condition of the association making such report,' in respect to enumerated items, and it was provided that such report 'shall be verified by the oath or affirmation of the president and cashier, and all wilful false swearing in respect to such report shall be perjury, and subject to the punishment prescribed by law for such offense.' It was made the duty of the Comptroller to publish full abstracts of such reports, as to specified items, in newspapers printed in the cities of Washington and New York, 'and a separated report of each association' was required to be published, at the expense of the association, in a newspaper \n\n[206 U.S. 158, 173]\n\u00a0\n published in the place where such association was established. Associations located in a number of the leading cities were also required to publish, in a newspaper published where the association was located, a statement, under the oath of the president or cashier, of the condition of the association, showing the average amount of loans and discounts, specie, deposits, and circulation. By  45 the cashier of each association was required after each dividend to make, under oath, 'a full, clear, and accurate statement of the condition of the association,' sociation,' enumerating specified particulars, which statement was to be forthwith transmitted to the Comptroller of the Currency. The national bank act of June 3, 1864 (chap. 106, 13 Stat. at L. 109), substantially reenacted, in a much condensed form, the requirements as to quarterly reports of the financial condition of each association. The abstract of such reports was required, however, to be published by the Comptroller only in the city of Washington, and every association was required to make a monthly statement of its condition under the oath of the president or cashier. For each day after five days' delay in making a report each bank was made liable to a penalty of $100. The act of 1864 did not contain a requirement for the making and transmittal to the Comptroller of a statement following the declaration of a dividend.\n By an act approved March 3, 1869 (chap. 130, 15 Stat. at L. 326, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3498), in lieu of the reports required by the national bank act of 1864, it was made the duty of each association, on the requisition of the Comptroller, to make not less than five reports in each year. These reports were not only required to be verified 'by the oath or affirmation of the president or cashier of such association,' but to be 'attested by the signature of at least three of the directors.' Publication of such reports was required to be made in a newspaper published in the place where the association was established, and a penalty of $100 for each day's delay after a specified time in making and transmitting the report was authorized to be retained by the Treasurer of the United States out of interest due the associa- \n\n[206 U.S. 158, 174]\n\u00a0\n tion. Each association was also required to make a report, attested by the oath of its president or cashier, whthin ten days after the declaration of a dividend, stating the amount of each dividend and the amount of net earnings in excess of such dividends.\n As embodied in the Revised Statutes the provision became  5211 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3498), and is copied in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n By  39 of the act of 1863, as well as by  9 of the act of 1864, a director of a national bank was required, inter alia, as he is now required by  5147, Rev. Stat. (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3464), to 'take an oath that he will, so far as the duty devolves on him, diligently and honestly administer the affairs of such association, and will not knowingly violate, or willingly permit to be violated, any of the provisions of this title.' In the acts of 1863 and 1864 the concluding word used was not 'title,' but 'act.'\n Sections 50 and 52 of the act of 1863 (12 Stat. at L. 679, 680, chap. 58) were practically identical, and  53 and 55 of the act of 1864 (13 Stat. at L. 116, chap. 106, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 3515, 3497) were also substantially alike, and by those sections civil and criminal liabilities were authorized to be assessed against and imposed upon directors of banking associations in certain contingencies. Section 52 of the act of 1863\n\n\n\n\n[206 U.S. 158, 175]\n\u00a0\n and  55 of the act of 1864-as supplemented by the act of April 6, 1869 ( chap. 11, 16 Stat. at L. 7), construed in the act of July 8, 1870 (chap. 226, 16 Stat. at L. 195, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3497), making it an offense to aid or abet an officer or agent of any association in doing the acts prohibited in  55 of the act 1864, with intent to defraud or deceive- became  5209 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3497). It is copied in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Section 50 of the act of 1863 and  53 of the act of 1864 became  5239 of the Revised Statutes, reading as follows:\n'Sec. 5239. If the directors of any national banking association shall knowingly violate, or knowingly permit any of the officers, agents, or servants of the association to violate, any of the provisions of this title, all the rights, privileges, and franchises of the association shall be thereby forfeited. Such violation shall, however, be determined and adjudged by a proper circuit, district, or territorial court of the United States, in a suit brought for that purpose by the Comptroller of the Currency, in his own name, before the association shall be declared dissolved. And in cases of such violation, every director who participated in or assented to the same shall be held liable in his personal and individual capacity for all damages which the association, its shareholders, or any other person, shall have sustained in consequence of such violation.' \n\n[206 U.S. 158, 176]\n\u00a0\n As in the early acts relating to the national banks, so in the sections of the Revised Statutes on the same subject, there are many provisions specifically enjoining the doing or not doing of certain acts by the association or its officers. Thus, by  5137, Rev. Stat., U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3460 (formerly  28 of the act of 1864), a national bank is prohibited from acquiring real estate for purposes other than those specified in the act, and is forbidden to hold real estate, under certain contingencies, more than a specified length of time; by  5200, Rev. Stat., U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3494 (formerly  29 of the act of 1864), it is prohibited to loan to any person or corporation in excess of one tenth of the capital stock of a bank; by  5201, Rev. Stat., U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3494 (formerly  35 of the act of 1864), banking associations are forbidden to loan or purchase their own stock; by  5202, Rev. Stat., U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3494 (formerly  36 of the act of 1864), associations are forbidden to become indebted or become in any way liable exceeding the amount of their capital stock except on account of specified demands; by  5203, Rev. Stat., U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3495 ( formerly section 37 of the act of 1864), a restriction is imposed upon the use of circulating notes; by  5204, Rev. Stat., U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3495 (formerly  38 of the act of 1864), the withdrawal of the capital of an association while continuing its operations is forbidden, either in the form of dividends or otherwise; and  5206, Rev. Stat., U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3496 (formerly  39 of the act of 1864), embodies a restriction upon the use of notes of other banks. In addition to these sections of course may be considered the various sections enjoining the making and publishing of periodical reports of the association, to which we have heretofore referred.\n\n It thus becomes obvious that the national bank act imposes upon directors duties which would not rest upon them at common law, and that among such duties is the furnishing to the Comptroller of the Currency reports concerning the condition of the bank and the publication thereof. Although the statutory provisions subsequent to the act of 1863, relating to the making and publishing of such reports, do not, as did \n\n[206 U.S. 158, 177]\n\u00a0\n the act of 1863, expressly require that the report, when made, should contain a 'true' statement of the condition of the association, yet, by necessary implication, such is the character of the statement required to be made, and by the like implication the making and publishing of a false report is prohibited.\n Considering the text of the national bank act, as now embodied in the Revised Statutes, including  5239, we think the latter section affords the exclusive rule by which to measure the right to recover damages from directors, based upon a loss alleged to have resulted solely from the violation by such directors of a duty expressly imposed upon them by a provision of the act. By the first sentence of the section mentioned a forfeiture of the charter is entailed 'if the directors of any national banking association shall knowingly violate, or knowingly permit any of the officers, agents, or servants of the association to violate, any of the provisions of this title.' And the last sentence ordains the rule by which civil liability is to be determined, by providing that 'every director who participated in or assented to the same shall be held liable in his personal and individual capacity for all damages which the association, its shareholders, or any other person shall have sustained in consequence of such violation.' As the section thus comprehends all the express commands to do or not to do, as to directors, contained in the national bank act, and besides specifies the nature of the conduct of directors from which their civil liability for violation of such commands may arise, it results that liability cannot be entailed upon them by exacting a different and higher standard of conduct as regards such commands than that established by the statute without depriving directors of an immunity conferred upon them. That the words 'shall knowingly violate, or knowingly permit,' etc., found in the first sentence of  5239, Rev. Stat., were intended to express the rule of conduct which the statute established as a prerequisite to the liability of directors for a violation of the express provisions \n\n[206 U.S. 158, 178]\n\u00a0\n of the title relating to national banks, is additionally shown by the oath which a director is required to take, wherein, as already stated, he swears 'that he will, so far as the duty devolves on him, diligently and honestly administer the affairs of such association, and will not knowingly violate, or willingly permit to be violated, any of the provisions of this title.' Mark the contrast between the general common- law duty to 'diligently and honestly administer the affairs of the association' and the distinct emphasis embodied in the promise not to 'knowingly violate, or willingly permit to be violated, any of the provisions of this title.' In other words, as the statute does not relieve the directors from the common-law duty to be honest and diligent, the oath exacted responds to such requirements. But as, on the other hand, the statute imposes certain express duties and makes a knowing violation of such commands the test of civil liability, and oath in this regard also conforms to the requirements of the statute by the promise not to 'knowingly violate, or willingly permit to be violated, any of the provisions of this title.'\n And general considerations as to the spirit and intent of the national bank act (Easton v. Iowa, \n188 U.S. 220\n, 47 L. ed. 452, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 288; Davis v. Elmira Sav. Bank, \n161 U.S. 275\n, 40 L. ed. 700, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 502) also render necessary the conclusion that the measure of responsibility concerning the violation by directors of express commands of the national bank act is, in the nature of things, exclusively governed by the specific provisions on the subject contained in that act. Thus, a contrary conclusion would lead to a varying measure of responsibility in the several states in which the question of liability might arise, depending upon the conceptions of the state courts of last resort as to the meaning of the act of Congress imposing the duty. Hence, it would follow that the same provision of the statute might mean one thing in one state and a different thing in another. The confusion which would result is aptly illustrated by a review made by the supreme court of Ohio in the recent case of Mason v. Moore, 73 Ohio St. 275, 4 L.R.A. (N.S.) 597, 76 N. E. 932, of the conflicting state adjudications as to the \n\n[206 U.S. 158, 179]\n\u00a0\n proper rule to be applied to fix the liability of bank directors to third persons in an action of deceit at common law. The frustration of the public policy embodied in the national bank system by the crippling of the usefulness of such institutions, which would result from holding that directors, in performing the duties imposed upon them by the national bank act, might be held liable civilly, not by the standard of conduct which the act provides for a violation of its express commands, but by another and different one, is apparent. Under such a conception it might well be that prudent and responsible persons would decline to assume the discharge of the duties imposed by the statute because of the hazard of an uncertain pecuniary liability which the statute imposing the duty did not contemplate.\n The civil liability of national bank directors, then, in respect to the making and publishing of the official reports of the condition of the bank, a duty solely enjoined by the statute, being governed by the national bank act, it is self-evident that the rule expressed by the statute is exclusive, because of the elementary principles that where a statute creates a duty and prescribes a penalty for nonperformance, the rule prescribed in the statute is the exclusive test of liability. Farmers' & M. Nat. Bank v. Dearing, \n91 \nU.S. 29, 35\n, 23 S. L. ed. 196, 199, and cases cited. The error in the decision below becomes at once apparent when its correctness is tested by the rule that the statute is applicable and prescribes the exclusive test of liability. The doctrine, as we have seen, upon which the court below rested its judgment, was that directors of a national bank who merely negligently participated in or assented to the making and publishing of an untrue offical report of the condition of the bank were civilly liable to anyone deceived to his injury by such report. Indeed, in one aspect, the ruling below went further than this, since it was, in substance, decided that, despite the exercise of diligence by the director, if he attested an untrue report he was civilly liable, because he did so at his risk, since it was his duty to know or to refrain from acting. That this imposed a \n\n[206 U.S. 158, 180]\n\u00a0\n higher standard of conduct than was required by the statute is obvious, but is clearly also established by previous decisions of this court, pointing out that where by law a responsibility is made to arise from the violation of a statute knowingly, proof of something more than negligence is required; that is, that the violation must in effect be intentional. McDonald v. Williams, \n174 U.S. 397\n, 43 L. ed. 1022, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 743; Potter v. United States, \n155 \nU.S. 438, 446\n, 39 S. L. ed. 214, 217, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 144, and cases cited. See, also, Utley v. Hill, 155 Mo. 232, 264, et seq. 49 L.R.A. 323, 78 Am. St. Rep. 569, 55 S. W. 1091, and cases cited.\n Of course, in what has been said we have confined ourselves to the precise question arising for decision, and therefore must not be understood as expressing an opinion as to whether and to what extent directors of national banks may be civilly liable by the principles of the common law for purely voluntary statements made to individuals or the public, embodying false representations as to the financial condition of the bank, by which one who has rightfully relied upon such representation has been damaged. And because we have applied in this case to the duty expressly imposed by the statute the standard of conduct established therein we must not be considered as expressing an opinion upon the correctness of the views enunciated by the court below concerning the standard which should be applied solely under the principles of the common law, to fix the civil liabilities of directors in an action of deceit. See Briggs v. Spaulding, \n141 U.S. 132\n, 35 L. ed. 662, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 924.\n There is a suggestion that the subjectmatter of this controversy is so inherently Federal that, although the judgments of the circuit court and of the circuit court of appeals, remanding the cause to the state court, may not be re-examined (25 Stat. at L. 435, chap. 866, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 509), nevertheless it should now be decided that the state court was wholly devoid of jurisdiction. This claim is predicated upon the provision of  5239, Rev. Stat., conferring exclusive jurisdiction on courts of the United States to declare a forfeiture of the charter of a national bank as the result of wrongs committed by the directors, and the contention that a declaration of such forfeiture is a prerequisite to \n\n[206 U.S. 158, 181]\n\u00a0\n an action to enforce the civil liability of directors, and that such action could only be brought in the court of the United States after a forfeiture has been adjudged. We content ourselves with saying that we think these contentions are without merit.\n It follows from what has been said that, as to Mosher and Outcalt, two of the persons named as plaintiffs in error in the writ and citation, the writ of error is dismissed for want of prosecution; as to the other plaintiffs in error, the judgment below is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n Sec. 5211. Every association shall make to the Comptroller of the Currency not less than five reports during each year, according to the form which may be prescribed by him, verified by the oath or affirmation of the president or cashier of such association and attested by the signature of at least three of the directors.

UTICA BANK(1907)\nNo. 231\nArgued: Decided: May 13, 1907\n\n\n\n\n[206 U.S. 181, 182]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Halleck F. Rose, J. W. Deweese, and Frank E. Bishop for plaintiffs in error.\n Messrs. Lionel C. Burr, John J. Thomas, Charles L. Burr, Richard S. Norval, and William B. C. Brown for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n These are the actions referred to in the opinion just announced in No. 230, Yates v. Jones Nat. Bank [\n206 U.S. 158\n, 51 L. ed. 1002, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 638], as companion actions with that case and as having been tried with it. The issues raised below and the questions of law which here arise for decision are, therefore, the same as in No. 230, and the reasons given in the opinion in that case require a reversal of the judgments in these.\n In the Bailey Case (No. 232), however, there is a question not presented in the others, which, if determined in favor of the plaintiffs in error in that case, will finally settle that particular controversy. Referring, therefore, to the opinion in the Jones Nat. Bank Case for the general grounds of reversal in the three cases, we come to consider the particular ground which is additionally relied upon in the Bailey Case as establishing that the decree of reversal in that case should be made conclusive of the entire controversy.\n By a 'second defense,' the defendants pleaded as res judicata a judgment asserted to have been rendered in their favor in an action brought by the same plaintiff in Lancaster county, Nebraska, which was removed into the circuit court \n\n[206 U.S. 181, 183]\n\u00a0\n of the United States, where, upon the sustaining of a demurrer to the petition, a judgment of dismissal was entered which was, by the circuit court of appeals, affirmed. 11 C. C. A. 304, 27 U. S. App. 339, 63 Fed. 488.\n Despite the introduction in evidence of the judgment roll in the case just referred to, which, for convenience, we term the Lancaster county action, the jury in this case, over the objection and exception of the defendants, were in effect instructed that the judgment in the former action did not operate as a bar to a recovery in the present case. Each defendant, in a motion for a new trial, alleged the commission of error by the court in 'failing to give full faith and credit' to the judgment of the circuit court of appeals in the Lancaster county action. The supreme court of Nebraska considered the subject, and as its conclusion was that the judgment of the circuit court of appeals was not res judicata of the issues in this cause, it therefore decided that, in refusing to give effect of res judicata to such judgment, the trial court had not wrongfully denied the validity of an authority exercised under the United States. The correctness of this conclusion is the particular question to be considered which, as we have said, distinguishes this case from the others.\n Whilst the court below found that the Lancaster county action was between the same parties, and, in its opinion, was based substantially upon the same facts, as in the present action, it based its ruling denying the effect of res judicata to the prior judgment upon the conclusion that, taking into view both the pleadings and the opinion in the previous action, it must be considered as certain that the case involved a different cause of action from the one presented here. In so concluding we think the court was right.\n The judgment relied upon was rendered upon a demurrer. This fact, however, does not affect the cogency of the judgment if otherwise efficacious to bring into play the presumption of the thing adjudged. Northern P. R. Co. v. Slaght, \n205 \nU.S. 122, 133\n, 51 S. L. ed. 738, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 442, and authorities there cited. To determine whether the judgment in the former case was conclusive in \n\n[206 U.S. 181, 184]\n\u00a0\n this, in view of its uncertainty, we must address ourselves to the pleadings in that case and consider the opinion of the court for the purpose of ascertaining precisely what was concluded by the judgment upon the demurrer. National Foundry & Pipe Works v. Oconto Water Supply Co. \n183 \nU.S. 216, 234\n, 46 S. L. ed. 157, 169, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 111, and cases cited. Coming to do so, we find that the demurrer was sustained on the ground that no cause of action in favor of the plaintiff was stated in the petition, because the circuit court of appeals was of the opinion that the petition only stated a right to recover for violations of the national bank act, causing damage to the bank as such, the right to recover for which was an asset of the bank, enforceable only by its receiver. In so deciding the court expressly held that the averments in the petition relative to the fraud and deceit claimed to have been practised upon the plaintiff through reports to the Comptroller of the Currency were mere matter of inducement or surplusage, and did not constitute averments of a substantive cause of action. In other words, the previous case was decided exclusively upon the ground that, as the plaintiff had not set up any individual wrong suffered by him, but solely an injury sustained in common with all other creditors of the bank, the resulting damage was only recoverable by the receiver. As, adopting the construction given in the Jones Nat. Bank Case to a petition like unto the one in this case, we hold that the petition in this case sets up a right to recover for the individual loss suffered as distinct from the right of the bank, it follows, if we accept the construction given by the circuit court of appeals to the pleadings in the case wherein the judgment relied upon was rendered, that case and this involve different causes of action. But it is insisted that if a correct analysis be made of the facts set out in the previous case the result will be to demonstrate that that case and this are identical, and, therefore, the judgment in the previous case is controlling here. This, however, is but to assert that the previous judgment was wrong, and, therefore, in determining its effect as res judicata we must treat it as embracing matters which it did not include. To \n\n[206 U.S. 181, 185]\n\u00a0\n give full force and effect to the judgment we must necessarily exclude those things which the judgment excluded. To hold to the contrary would be to decide that the former judgment must be accepted as correct, and yet it must be extended to controversies which are beyond its reach, because the judgment was wrongfully rendered.\n The same judgment must therefore be ordered in each of these cases as was directed to be entered in the Jones Nat. Bank Case, viz., as to Mosher and Outcalt, two of the persons named as plaintiffs in the writ of error and citation, the writ of error in each action is dismissed for want of prosecution; as to the other plaintiffs in error, the judgment below in each action is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","186":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nZARTARIAN v. BILLINGS(1907)\nNo. 120\nArgued: Decided: January 7, 1907\n\n\n\n\n[204 U.S. 170, 171]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Daniel B. Ruggles for appellant.\n\n Assistant Attorney General Cooley for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an appeal from an order of the circuit court of the United States for the district of Massachusetts, denying a pe- \n\n[204 U.S. 170, 172]\n\u00a0\n tition for a writ of habeas corpus filed by Charles Zartarian in behalf of Mariam Zartarian, his daughter, who, it was alleged, was unlawfully imprisoned, detained, and restrained of her liberty at Boston by the United States Commissioner of Immigration, which imprisonment was alleged to have been in violation of the constitutional rights of the said Mariam Zartarian, without due process of law, and contrary to the provisions of  2172 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1334), which section, it is alleged, made said Mariam a citizen of the United States by virtue of the citizenship of her father, the petitioner.\n The United States District Attorney and the attorney for the petitioner stipulated the following facts:\n'The petitioner, Charles Zartarian, formerly a subject of the Sultan of Turkey, became a naturalized citizen of the United States on September 12, 1896, at the circuit court of Cook county, in the state of Illinois. That his daughter Mariam, on whose behalf this petition is brought, is a girl between fifteen and sixteen years of age, and was born just prior to the petitioner leaving Turkey. That in the latter part of the year 1904 the Turkish government, at the request of the United States minister at Constantinople, granted permission to the petitioner's wife, minor son, and his said daughter, Mariam, to emigrate to the United States, it being stipulated in the passport issued to them that they could never return to Turkey. That on March 22, 1905, the Hon. G. V. L. Meyer, then United States Ambassador at Rome, Italy, issued a United States passport to your petitioner's said wife and daughter. That said Mariam arrived at Boston from Naples, Italy, on April 18, 1905, and that on April 18, 1905, she was found to have trachoma, and was debarred from landing by a board of special inquiry appointede by the United States Commissioner of Immigration for the port of Boston.'\n\n The petitioner's child, Mariam Zartarian, was debarred from landing at the port of Boston under the provisions of the act of March 3, 1903, chap. 1012, 32 Stat. at L. 1213, U. S. Comp. Stat. \n\n[204 U.S. 170, 173]\n\u00a0\n Supp. 1903, p. 170, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1905, p. 274, entitled 'An Act to Regulate the Immigration of Aliens into the United States.'\n Section 2 of that act, among other things, provides that certain classes of aliens shall be excluded from admission to the United States, including 'persons afflicted with a loathsome or with a dangerous contagious disease.' Upon the finding of the board of inquiry that said Mariam had trachoma, she was debarred from landing.\n The contention is that she does not come within the terms of this statute, not being an alien, but entitled to be considered a citizen of the United States, under the provisions of  2172 of the Revised Statutes, which provides: 'The children of persons who have been duly naturalized under any law of the United States . . . being under the age of twenty-one years at the time of the naturalization of their parents, shall, if dwelling in the United States, be considered as citizens thereof.'\n As Mariam was born abroad, a native of Turkey, she has not become a citizen of the United States, except upon compliance with the terms of the act of Congress, for, wanting native birth, she cannot otherwise become a citizen of the United States. Her right to citizenship, if any she has, is the creation of Congress, exercising the power over this subject conferred by the Constitution. United States v. Wong Kim Ark, \n169 \nU.S. 649, 702\n, 42 S. L. ed. 890, 909, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 456.\n The relevant section, 2172, which it is maintained confers the right of citizenship, is the culmination of a number of acts on the subject passed by Congress from the earliest period of the government. Their history will be found in vol. 3, Moore's International Law Digest, p. 467.\n The act of 1872 is practically the same as the act of April 14, 1802 ( 2 Stat. at L. 153, chap. 28, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1334), which provided:\n'The children of persons duly naturalized under any of the laws of the United States . . . being under the age of twenty-one years at the time of their parents being so naturalized . . . shall, if dwelling in the United States, be considered as citizens of the United States; and the children of persons who are now \n\n[204 U.S. 170, 174]\n\u00a0\n or have been citizens of the United States shall, though born out of the limits and jurisdiction of the United States, be considered as citizens of the United States.'\n\n In Campbell v. Gordon, 6 Cranch, 176, 3 L. ed. 190, it was held that this act conferred citizenship upon the daughter of an alien naturalized under the act of January 29, 1795 [1 Stat. at L. 414, chap. 20], she being in this country at the time of the passage of the act of April 14, 1802, and then 'dwelling in the United States.'\n The act has also been held to be prospective in its operation and to include children of aliens naturalized after its passage, when 'dwelling in the United States.' Boyd v. Nebraska, \n143 \nU.S. 135, 177\n, 36 S. L. ed. 103, 115, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 375.\n The construction of this law and the meaning of the phrase 'dwelling in the United States' has been the subject of much consideration in the executive department of the government having to do with the admission of foreigners and the rights of alleged naturalized citizens of the United States. The rulings of the State Department are collected in Prof. Moore's Digest of International Law, vol. 3, pp. 467 et seq.\n The Department seems to have followed a rule established at an early period, and formulated with fullness in Foreign Relations for 1890, p. 301, in an instruction from Mr. Blaine to Minister Phelps, at Berlin, in which it was laid down that the naturalization of the father operates to confer the municipal right of citizenship upon the minor child if, at the time of the father's naturalization, dwelling within the jurisdiction of the United States, or if he come within that jurisdiction subsequent to the father's naturalization and during his own minority.\n Whether, in the latter case, a child not within the jurisdiction of the United States at the time of the parent's naturalization, but coming therein during minority, acquires citizenship, is not a question now before us.\n The limitation to children 'dwelling in the United States' was doubtless inserted in recognition of the principle that citizenship cannot be conferred by the United States on the citizens of another country when under such foreign jurisdic- \n\n[204 U.S. 170, 175]\n\u00a0\n tion; and is also in deference to the right of independent sovereignties to fix the allegiance of those born within their dominions, having regard to the principle of the common law which permits a sovereignty to claim, with certain exceptions, the citizenship of those born within its territory.\n It is pointed out by Mr. Justice Gray, delivering the opinion in United States v. Wong Kim Ark, \n169 \nU.S. 649, 686\n, 42 S. L. ed. 890, 904, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 456, that the naturalization acts of the United States have been careful to limit admission to citizenship to those 'within the limits and under the jurisdiction of the United States.'\n The right of aliens to acquire citizenship is purely statutory; and the petitioner's child, having been born and remained abroad, clearly does not come within the terms of the statute. She was debarred from entering the United States by the action of the authorized officials, and, never having legally landed, of course could not have dwelt within the United States. Nishimura Ekiu v. United States, \n142 U.S. 651\n, 35 L. ed. 1146, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 336.\n It is urged that this seems a harsh application of the law; but if the terms of the statute are to be extended to include children of a naturalized citizen who have never dwelt in the United States, such action must come from legislation of Congress, and not judicial decision. Congress has made provision concerning an alien's wife or minor child suffering from contagious disease, when such alien has made a declaration of his intention to become a citizen, and when such disease was contracted on board the ship in which they came, holding them under regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury until it shall be determined whether the disorder will be easily courable, or whether such wife or child can be permitted to land without danger to other persons, requiring that they shall not be deported until such facts are ascertained (32 Stat. at L. 1221, chap. 1012, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1903, p. 185, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1905, p. 290). But Congress has not said that an alien child who has never dwelt in the United States, coming to join a naturalized parent, may land when afflicted with a dangerous contagious disease.\n As this subject is entirely within congressional control, the \n\n[204 U.S. 170, 176]\n\u00a0\n matter must rest there; it is only for the courts to apply the law as they find it.\n It is suggested that the agreed finding of facts contains no stipulation as to the dangerous or contagious quality of trachoma, but the petition shows that the petitioner's daughter was debarred from landing because it was found that she had a dangerous contagious disease; to wit, trachoma. Furthermore, the statute makes the finding of the board of inquiry final, so far as review by the courts is concerned, the only appeal being to certain officers of the Department. 32 Stat. at L. 1213, chap. 1012, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1905, p. 274; Nishimura Ekiu v. United States, supra.\n Finding no error in the order of the Cireuit Court, it is affirmed. \n\n\n\n"}}
